a restaurant supply truck is curbside near a small restaurant
gerald grunick forty one is closing the back door of his truck feeling good about the world a common state for him
he moves towards the cab of the truck and gets inside as we super as he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune
now we reveal his twelve year old son tom seated quietly beside him
he seems a bit down
gerald glances at his son
i dont know a recent saturday ive sold more
you didnt think id sell that health restaurant did you
not even you
why so glum
i dont know
a beat go ahead
ive got a problem i guess
were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss
what are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks
i dont even know what they mean beat them off with a stick
gerald stiffs a grin
you know tom i feel a little proud when people comment on your looks
maybe you should feel that way
im just embarrassed that i like when they say those things
as long as thats your only problem youre
he looks directly at his father and talks quietly and sincerely
i got my report card
three cs two ds and an incomplete
i see you studying so hard tom
what do you think the problem is
ill just have to try harder
i dont know
talking himself into it i will
he shakes his head for emphasis glad hes received this pep talk from himself he hands the card to his father
thanks dad this talk helped
will you sign it please
as he signs would it help if i got you a tutor
suddenly hopeful that would be great
worried it better help
what can you do with yourself if all you do is look good
aaron altman looking almost preposterously young in his graduation gown is delivering his valedictory
he is a rare bread a battle scarred innocent
and finally to the teachers of whitman high school i dont have the words to express my gratitude which may have more to say about the quality of the english
department here than my own limitations
he awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective discomfort
that was of course not meant to be taken seriously
a personal note
i am frequently asked what the special difficulties are in being graduated from high school two months shy of my fifteenth birthday
i sometimes think it was the difficulties themselves which enabled me to do it
if id been appreciated or even tolerated i wouldnt have been in such a hurry to graduate
i hope the next student who comes along and is able to excel isnt made to feel so much an outcast
but im looking forward to college this is the happiest day ive had in a long time
i thank you and i forgive you
this is very little applause
im always so confused by aaron
is he brave and earnest or just a conceited little dick head
as aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking semi literate high school graduates
clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier cuff aaron around
aaron feeling from a blow his lip bleeding his teeth covered with blood
as he gets to his feet
he is livid something primal triggered by this brutality
go ahead stephen take your last licks
points at his face but this will heal what im going to say to you will scar you forever
here it is
he dodges as they come after him
they catch him by the hair and hurl him to the ground
as he gets up he hurls his devastating verbal blow
youll never make more than nineteen thousand dollars a year
ha ha ha
they twist his arm and grip him his face scraped on the concrete
okay take this youll never leave south boston and im going to see the whole damn world
youll never know the pleasure of writing a graceful sentence or having an original thought
think about it
hes punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground
as the young toughs walk off aaron catches a phrase of their conversation
nineteen thousand dollars
jane craig ten years old is in her room typing
above the desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and pictures tacked to each one
her desk has several file racks which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side
jane types very well in the glare of her desk lamp
voice over as she types dear felatzia its truly amazing to me that we live a world apart and yet have the same favorite music
i loved the picture you sent and have it up on my bulletin board
youre growing so much faster than i am that i
showing janes father standing near the door
voice over am starting to get jealous
i read in the newspapers about the italian strike and riots in milan
i hope you werent
jane screams and grabs her heart breathing heavily babbles nervously at her dad
oh god daddy dont
dont ever scare me like that please
we super future network news producer her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction
falling back towards the door jane for gods sake
recovering look its time for you to go to sleep
i just have two more pen pals and then im done
you dont have to finish tonight
he doesnt get in nooo
this way the rotation stays the same
i dont want you getting obsessive about these things
we remain with jane who has obviously become disconcerted and troubled
as jane moves to room at the other end of the hall a family room where her father reads the latest rolling stone of the mid s hunter thompson the
new journalism the slim jann wenner jane bursts into the room
dad you want me to choose my words so carefully and then you just throw a word like obsessive at me
now unless im wrong and
enunciating please correct me if i am obsession is practically a psychiatric term
concerning people who dont have anything else but the object of their obsession who cant stop and do anything else
well here i am stopping to tell you this
so would you please try and be a little more precise instead of calling a person something like obsessive
she advances furiously on her father since even this strung out even with two additional pen pal letters to get off she had enough sense of duty to kiss him
good night before storming from the room
she exits the room into black
stay on black as we begin main titles emerging from the blackness jane craig now a twenty eight year old woman a long speed walker wearing a jacket to which
reflecting stripes have been glued the kind of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off hours
the jacket itself is a wish i had it souvenir from some important news assignment the sort of treasure you love about all else yet never mention
she stops running as she feeds quarters into the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines getting seven different papers before moving on
as she enters from the bathroom having showered and dressed
the sun is jus now rising
she sits next to her phone
the filofax book is almost an additional character a crucial hand fashioned tool of janes trade
she flicks at a page takes down a typewritten sheet scotch taped to it showing the room number of her crew and reporter
as she dials one room number
into phone hi
angle on cameraman his equipment in evidence though essentially asleep holding his bedmates hand as he listens to jane
voice over its thirty minutes before you have to meet me in the lobby nudge your wife
theres probably no time to eat
but theres a cafeteria at the bus depot once we get down there
i love working with you two
it saves me a call
where aaron is switching his tv from station to station monitoring the early morning news
his phone rings
turn on your tv
good morning america the morning news and today are all about to talk to arnold schwarzenegger and i think hes live on at least two of them
at six oclock on the wake up news they used the wrong missile graphic
austrian accent now listen arnold just said that hes been making three million a movie now
but hes not ever gonna change
hes still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie
he feels no different
he also bought a brand new condo with maria they gonna furnish tastefully
a half hour in the lobby
austrian accent okay ill see you in the lobbies sic
she hangs up takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the bed for a moments solitude
she sits stiffly palms on top of her legs
it looks like someone with unusually good posture waiting for something and now we begin to see the first signs redden and she begins to cry
now she sobs then miraculously shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom
this crying episode is clearly part of her morning routine
jane standing behind her husband wife camera sound team as they train their attention on aaron who is getting ready to do a stand up
there is a derelict off to one side
aaron holds his microphone at the ready
your hairs a little funny
its an ethnic curl i cant do anything about it
in front of a little its a bit
you want a mirror
no dont worry about it
lets do this
jane nods her assent
in other times for other purposes there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for j
singers return from war
interrupting im sorry
but look at how wonderful his face is
she points to the derelict
oh you mean use him
ill put him in the low corner of the frame good
in other times with other purposes there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for j
singers return from war
last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war
but it was the civil war in angola and he was in it for the money
he puts the microphone down
he passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair
jane in the distant b
on the phone
aaron and crew shooting as the bus pulls up hisses to a stop and tired rumpled passengers exit the bus
singer strong figure emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him
he reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary
gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus
the crew shooting
just a few questions
he starts walking the four person newsteam staying with him
we came from washington
move away from me
holding out microphone how long has it been since youve been home
you want to use that
it depends on how big a news day it is
they reach jane
she calls to him
im jane craig
i spoke to you in angola
i gave you some sugarless gum and handi wipes
as he reacts to her jane sitting next to aaron making detailed timing notes as she screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit
wheres where i asked him about being scared
then you should work on your speech
it makes me nervous to think about it
lets do this
she consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot
on tape all this business of war do you get scared
on tape he smiles uh uh
then im a little freaked right now about seeing my father though
he laughs self consciously and turns briefly away
i love that turn away
jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled
on the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the conference of local television news broadcasters
in darkness theres a point im trying to make about these pieces coming up
a womans outline blacked out from behind her voice o
angrily i dont think any client of mine makes less than fifty thousand dollars a year which means they can afford the best and youre damn right i feel good
that that includes me
in blackness her voice disguised
youd be surprised at who a working girl meets
ive been a working girl for what
over a year anyway and that must be a thousand men and i dont think theres an age or type that hasnt been in there
voice over policemen
a laugh from the audience
there is a a woman in blackness
im seventeen now and ive been working the streets for two years and i guess to be honest i stopped thinking of it as temporary
the lights come up on the room
the two screens go black
there is general applause
jane blinks nervously
please dont applaud
sitting in groups of three news team from around the country remarkably similar in comparison
a great looking woman good looking man either young or attractively avuncular and a black or hispanic
they still applaud not yet having grasped the sincerity of janes plea which she presses with more urgency
she yells i gathered these pieces as an example of whats with local television news
the applause stops
the excerpts from three separate series on prostitution were simultaneously broadcast by all stations in one city during sweeps week
by what bend of either or suspension of duty is that broadcast news
she pauses half a beat for possible applause hearing none she continues
an anchorman sneezes four people shout gesundheit simultaneously they laugh
the legacy of edward r
murrow eric sevareid william shirer david brinkley and walter cronkite is being squandered in a desperate popularity contest
our profession is in danger as jane continues revealing that the news team now have even more in common
they do not like jane
yesterdays compliment has somehow managed to become todays kiss of death
to be considered a serious journalist is no longer flattering
it presents the risk of being labeled ponderous or worse yet elitest right
women playing with their hair young man bored
one middle aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie
briefly departing from text
all of you know what im talking about
were all trying to act together than we are
but we care
so were all secretly terrified arent we
not a peep she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit her voice begins to rasp
we are being increasingly influenced by the star system
the network anchormen are so powerful they compromise our last best hope
the current group is clearly qualified tied still to our best traditions but who follows these men
seated with other members of his news team a young blonde woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg a good looking hispanic
tom feels a growing excitement jane is not just a speaker she seems a savior
his female colleague looks at him
oh ive known so many women like that
they dont like their looks so theyre angry
fumbling with her cards sunk but game gamer than she would wish
i was going to talk about other trends but
mumbling the magazine shows news at profit influence of entertainment tonight the danger the hope the dream the question
oh i was going to show you a tape a story that was carried by all networks on the same night the same night not one network noted a major
policy change in salt two nuclear disarmament talks
heres what they ran instead
show the tape
showing the japanese domino championships as broadcast by all networks in the spring of
it is quite spectacular the dominoes falling into one another provoking waves crossing tiny bridges setting off little fireworks
janes audience applauds loudly and squeals with delight
jane between the two monitors
she begins to speak loudly over the audience noises of approval
loudly i know its good film
i know its fun
i like fun
its just not news
as they continue to applaud well youre lucky you love it youre going to get a lot more just like it
jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia by the event
dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart
she takes some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return
tom the last person remaining in the room
he approaches her she is totally unaware of his presence even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap
it takes courage for tom to fully intrude himself which he now does hello
she looks up at him
earnest nervous handsome
just when she needed a mirage there it is
i just wanted to tell you how great you were
my names tom grunick
dumbly thank you
then they hated me
i dont hate them
well they say if you can reach even one person it means something
and you did that
jane looks up at his smile a beat then would you like to have dinner with me
jane arrives at the maitre d stand
she has attempted to dress up to the extent that packing for a short day trip allows
she looks for tom
tom rises from a table and is immediately at her side
i was worried i was early
i was a lot earlier
they are lead to a table and sit down
i kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight
more than a great break maybe just what i needed
just when i needed it
angel of mercy godsend
picking one i like godsend
i havent been in news that long
ive just been looking for the right person to talk to
i have about two thousand questions for you
he notices that her head has gone into her hands where it continues to rest
he looks at her a beat
its possible nows not the right time
she lifts her head
if we could just eat first
totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day youve had
if i could just have a roll id be okay
she takes a roll from the roll plate
he smiles at her
she takes a bite
as they walk along dumping occasionally and self consciously
jane is feeling a version of being turned on that is a little adrift and temporarily free of obligations
she is open to making a memorable mistake
another thing i cant stand is this dull
tom shakes his head almost violently
no no no no
jane looks at him curiously then broadly another thing i cant stand is when white house reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has
a theory and the other quotes it in his story as white house sources say
that actually goes on
my room is down here im not tired
do you want to keep talking
a small good room her working paraphernalia very much in evidence
the quality briefcase
the reams of well organized notes
the thick contact book jane is sitting on the bed tom not far away in the rooms only chair
one lamp is on and it serves to place jane in the shadows and cast tom in an enormously flattering light
music comes from her miniature portable stereo system
even im not that hard on myself
no i really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up
jane smiles a calming smile
i was doing sports at the station
the newspaper ran this untrue story that i was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail
so they made me anchor
so great right
except im no good at what im being a success at
how are you at back rubs
jane shifts her position so that her back is to tom
he is immobilized by the sudden turn
jane waits just a bit longer than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before experiencing the ghost like clutch of rejection
she moves briskly past the moment grabbing a good night chocolate from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda
its sort of normal the way you feel
in graduate school everyone thought the only mistake the admission committee made was letting them in
he moves to the bed
listen to me
you keep on thinking im somebody ho lacks
thats not it
i know i can talk well enough and im not bad at making contact with people but i dont like the feeling that im pretending to be a reporter
contd and half the time i dont really get the news im talking about
it isnt that im down on myself
trust me i stink
levelly i trust you
i didnt even have the chance to get really good at sports
i wasnt bad
i thought i was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and
interrupting what about the obvious remedy
maybe getting a job on a newspaper
i dont write
jane laughs or more accurately scoffs as tom continues
but that didnt stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks
well come on it is your life
nobody is tying you to the fast track
did you go to college
almost one year
so youre not well educated and you have almost no experience and you cant write
he nods agreement
and im making a fortune
jane laughs very briefly then rubs her face vigorously with her hands
hes making her feel a little crazy
she gets off the bed
its hard for me to advise you since you personify something that i truly think is dangerous
holding it in i agree with you youre not qualified
letting it out so get qualified
you can insist on being better prepared
you dont have to just leave it as
mimicking him i dont write
im not schooled
i dont understand the news im reading
but at least im upset about it folks
a beat then he mumbles softly to himself
whoa this was a mistake
just what do you want from me anyway
permission to be a fake
stop whining and do something about it
he gets up to leave
she follows him
well you dont have to start right now
he turns to her
i hated the way you talked to me just now
and it wasnt just because you were right
she is on the phone
into phone no
it wasnt just the speech the same thing happened with this guy
i have passed some line some place
i am beginning to repel people im trying to seduce
as he talks with jane
agreeably he must have been great looking right
why do you say that
because nobody invites a bad looking idiot to their bedroom
lets do me
i feel like im slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think
theyre slipping because their standards are so high
this conversation is not worthy of you
id give anything if that were true
laughing good night
wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive
if needy were a turn on
call if you get weird
she hangs up pulls back the bedspread on the double bed on the other half are papers schedules tapes
she doesnt clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work
the phone rings
answering i was just thinking it was the shortest phone conversation we ever had
a deserted well lit area
tom on the phone
i never told you the reason i was telling you everything for
pleasantly surprised its him hey
those audition tapes i sent out
ive been hired by your network for the washington bureau
so ill probably see you at work
jane is rocked and soured
jane and aaron walking to work agitated
they didnt hire peter stiller from the times and he had a great audition tape
you want to start going over who they could have gotten
they cant take on people like this for network news
for gods sake
whats going on
tom arrives for first day of work
ernie merriman is the networks washington bureau chief
he is in his early s has worked for the network about years part of the golden age a family man an honorable man a good guy
right now he is welcoming tom to the network thereby good naturedly helping with the destruction of all he holds dear
as he hands tom his credentials any particular area you feel strongest in
to be honest i was best at anchor
ernie gives him a long look is he kidding
why dont you take a few days observing the system
then well put you on general assignment
two small tv monitors a smallish room
jane goes over her timing notes which correspond to the time code supered on the monitors
bobbie an extraordinarily silent man is doing janes bidding
on the monitor we see the mercenary piece which jane is editing against a tightening deadline
the phone rings periodically jane conducting abrupt conversations which continuing to edit
the pressure is palpable to begin with but builds and builds almost like a family fight getting out of hand and threatening to bend lives
through it all jane remains remarkable calm
her focus is amazing her command sexy
consulting notes go back to bobbie
the sound bite in the cab it starts i dont know how ill feel
interrupting please bobbie were pushing
as bobbie expertly reverses the tape toms face appears in the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room janes eyes click to him briefly
she makes not a move to welcome him
he pauses but is committed and tries to find a piece for himself against the wall
they said i should observe the
jane is distracted by the noise
tom leaning over towards her
they said it would be okay if
incredulous were working here
you can stand over in the uh uh uh
she momentarily cant think of the word corner
then back to bobbie play back the last line
he said something about
sharply let me hear it
bobbie taking the sharp commands with ever increasing yet still repressed resentment
the assistant director blair litton enters the editing room
she is about and every night since she got her job as assistant director she has been the first to crack under pressure
well need it in ten minutes
were putting it directly into
jane holds up a finger of warning to blair as she picks up a ringing phone and talks to bobbie at the same time
into phone craig just a second to bobbie let me hear it
through much of this chaos we focus on wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks he is wide eyed at this circus of tension and fear
his eyes dart around constantly trying to take in as much as he can always returning with wonder to focus on jane
voice over its been a long time since ive seen my folks and all but
i dont expect any big deal homecoming
into phone shes been holding i want to shoot a picture from a book i have in the office
you dont have time
not a chance
into phone ill be right down
its right tight
she crosses out
ive got to tell ernie
because there isnt enough time
yes there is
blair leaves as jane gathers up her notes
she charges out leaving tom awkwardly along with bobbie
im tom grunick
i started on general assignment today
bobbie stops the machine turns in his chair and shakes hands
then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence
i dont think shes going to make it
aaron is having a theoretical discussion with ernie and jennifer mack a correspondent in her early s a pioneer beauties in news
she is well schooled bred trained and known
george wein a black correspondent in his s and martin klein formerly with the johnson administration state department correspondent for the network
okay what about this
heres a tough ethical one
would you tell a source that you loved them just to get some information
jennifer didnt know there was an alternative
jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women will laugh when one says something funny
aaron smiles at her
they allow us to have cameras at an execution in florida
do you broadcast tape of the guy in the chair when they turn on the voltage
nothing like wrestling with a moral dilemma is there
blair enters the scene tom trailing several feet behind continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises
excuse me ernie were several minutes to air and janes shooting an insert still for tonights piece
she knows how much time she has
blair flashes a tortured smile panic is growing
i just wanted you to know
what is she shooting
norman rockwells homecoming
thinks then oh thats nice
walking away well need some new lines
jane up against it now but still seemingly calm
tom watching keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated impressed
okay bobbie just a two second dissolve to the rockwell
interrupting just a two second dissolve
hurting oh jesus we have three minutes
why do you do this to me
is it because i won an award
where aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of paper even as he gets ready to record
he times it with a stop watch
norman rockwells enduring portrait of a homecoming the return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war
tearful women proud men excited children
singer was right his homecoming was no big deal
we have a minute and a half
its my responsibility to tell them we wont be ready
were be ready
blair glances frantically at her watch
sweeping from minutes to seconds from deadline
aaron walks in jane looks up
hopefully nine seconds
eleven and a half
back it bobbie bobbie
youre saying oh god
they are going to go to up and the screen will be black theyre going to go to black because were not there
how about careers huh
how about careers
were not going to make it
bobbie makes a small bobble jane giving the merest evidence of the strain scratching her face repeatedly
no ooh ahhh ohhh
shit shit shit
caught up youre almost there you can do it can do can do
and as the pitch reaches its zenith seconds left
bobbie hands the tape to blair
blair hikes up her skirt and takes off
our chase scene as blair soars through the newsroom leaping a chair smoothly smashing her leg against a table in full flight the adrenaline deadening the pain she arrives at
a waiting elevator uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it
jumps nervously during the ride and now in full extended flight barrels down the long corridor heading to the control room where she arrives slamming the tape into a technicians
hand even as it is introduced on the air
aaron jane the others looking at the end of the piece on the air tom in the b
as blair enters relaxed almost jaunty
i was a little nervous there for a minute
oh come on tell us another
the end of the piece the rockwell painting giving way to the mercenarys actual homecoming which matches the portrait
the irony works nicely
the network anchorman comes up for his close
bill rorish years old and able to flutter much younger pulses
he is able and experienced a reporter who has become a journalistic king
on monitor smiling bill rorish
look at that smile
oh that was good and oh my bill smiled he liked it
he loved it
he gives jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she returns tom in the b
of the shot
i havent seen bill smile like that in weeks
ernie has walked a few steps to the office
ernie you missed his close
mimicking thank you
i saw the smile good piece
im gonna go look at it again
they leave aaron waving to tom who stands in the b
the others leave
tom approaches jane
im sorry if i was in the way
it was totally impressive
somewhat formal you werent
how does it feel being here
i cant believe im really here
if youre through work now no
aaron and i go to central america on wednesday so im cramming
i thought you were incredible in there
i know how much i have to learn
id really a lot appreciate it
really a lot appreciate it
you make me nervous
anyway if i can pick your brain jane grimaces at pick your brain
i cant help you sorry
im not here to teach remedial reporting
and it has nothing to do with the fact i left your room instead of staying there
jane looks at him
then almost gently youre gonna have to understand something
this isnt personal
as aaron jane and their crew march along with a contra squad deep in their own conversation
except for the din of tropical birds they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work
i didnt sleep
theyre giving me less and less air time
they dont think im at all anchor material
if we dont get to their camp soon we wont be able to tape the supplies coming in
last time paul was sick they gave connie the weekend news instead of me
you spend too much time much too much worrying about that crap
suddenly reacting oh good
they have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped the guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots inside
a guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot
a pair of new boots sit alongside him
janes cameraman prepares to shoot saying in spanish then english put on the boot
jane rushes into the scene incensed
we are not here to stage the news
wait and see what he does
then to the totally confused soldier
jane contd sir you do whatever you want
its your choice
by now there is a fair sized cluster of armed men as well as the news team staring at the guerrilla who is at loss as to what is expected
he looks to jane who can offer no help save her own determination not to interfere
finally he puts on the boot
to cameraman okay
he shoots the scene
tom in shirt and tie is on the phone
this is a big day
okay ill meet the crew there then
could you give me that address again
yes its good to finally be getting to work
as tom gets directions from the concierge
its only ten minutes if you prefer to walk
as he walks away ill look for you on the news tonight
tom has a real sense of the moment of having arrived
the strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off to cover his first story
he laughs out loud loving his lot
jane in the f
with her crew while aaron talks in rapid spanish to the guerrilla leaders
aaron in spanish are you guys kidding or do you really think youll run into something
i mean do you feel that every time and it never happens
or is it the first time it felt that way and its going to happen
i mean how bad can it be
are you nervous
whats the chances on a scale of one to ten that were going to be in a war within the next few hours
he starts to walk towards jane one of the men he was talking with calling after him with an added thought
thanks you speak english very well too
to jane great news
he says theyve been engaging the sandinistas pretty regularly and that hed be really surprised if we didnt take fire tonight
jane reacts a flash of exhilaration
aaron is amazed at her attitude
look at her
to jane if anything happens to me tell every woman ive ever dated i was talking about them at the end
that way theyll have to reevaluate me
jane laughs out loud attracting the guerrillas attention
aaron repeats his speech in spanish
the guerrillas laugh
aaron and jane in line behind the guerrillas
they hear a shot
the head of the patrol gestures deploying his men
aaron grabs jane and heads for some cover to the left
as they run more shots
jane in work mode
as soon as they settle
spanish accent much too dark
as they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of the nearly gunfire
the first shots were fired not thirty seconds ago
the contras feel they must be outnumbered this is so small a unit thats a given
still they hold their ground despite the fact that their weapons have been acting up misfiring or jamming
a new shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow all they got today were the shoes
there is the sound of gunfire
to cameraman okay
to aaron great line at the end
did you shoot their boots
we can cut back at the end
to the pan of the supplies boxes can you believe it
i just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups
tom squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters
behind a police line
he hears a reporter next to him say i think hes coming out now
to his crew they say hes coming out now
to reporter is that him
tom checks his notes
the same model weve seen jane use
a list of questions written in big color highlighted letters
as he looks down to study them everyone else moves suddenly off
the mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions
will you dispatch troops
after the ambassador theyve been awaiting clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the movement of the vehicle
standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back
observing tom whats wrong
i had a lot of questions here
i missed the story
dont worry its okay
i got a piece of his face
jane is standing talking to her crew
others asleep in b
a drowsy morning after feeling
are you all packed and ready
the stuff in the dark is not good
nobody wants news lit like that
will you just get packed
she waves him off then she walks several yards away holding a knapsack in her hand
she takes off a brush and runs it through her hair opens a plastic case and takes out a travel toothbrush brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
from her canteen
she puts everything back in place then looks about sobs for several beats
one of the guerrillas hears her sobbing and enters the scene he stands a respectful distance away
jane finishes notices him makes a face by way of explanation and exits the scene feeling measurably better
the washington control room
jennifer jane aaron blair stand watching the intro to the central american piece
tom stands in the distant b
there are over a dozen monitors including one which is constantly on the anchor man bill rorish
bill rorish on camera an insert behind showing aaron in blackness planted into a central american map bordered by rifles
a separate monitor shows the insert alone
bill voice over a fire fight along the nicaraguan border
in one minute
the insert moves out at us to fill the screen we see aarons dim outline and hear him say aaron voice over on camera the first shots were fired not
thirty seconds ago
the musical evening news signature comes in ever so briefly
the screen goes to a commercial as blair screams enthusiastically
great graphic great graphic
ernie enters the scene
he kisses jane in greeting pats aaron on the back
you finally got a piece in a few minutes early and i hear bill loved it
jennifer gives jane a mock pat on the back
ernie continuing i have somebody downstairs who one of the clerks brought in and vouches for
he says he has something to say about gays getting promotions at state
it cant hurt to tape him
as she feels tom staring at her turns and notices him for the first time
hows it going
can i buy you dinner sometime soon
thrown i just got back i dont know which end is up
in the b
we may have noticed bill rorish on one monitor as he picks up the phone at his anchor desk during the commercial break
bill rorish wants to speak to you at the break
as she hands it to her i never heard of him handing over compliments in the middle of the show
there is a stillness in the control room as jane speaks to the anchor man in new york who we can view on a monitor
we see bill rorish
into phone jane
into phone yes
into phone well darling if it gets any better than that im going to have to bring you up here to new york
into phone thanks
i just wish youd kept the first twenty seconds
blair cringes at janes blunt reply
into phone but thanks
over phone well the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect
jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to aaron
god he loved the boots
aaron reaches happily for the phone
into phone aaron should be hearing this so i have an extra witness
over phone well you always want to give the credit away do you
into phone no i dont
he happens to deserve the credit
hes right here
over phone ill speak to you soon we see rorish over the monitor
he hangs up
to aaron he had to read over some new copy
we see on the monitor that this is not so
its a very eggy moment aaron
tom breaks the silence
to the rescue okay if i watch you tape that interview downstairs
as he passes jane he leans next to her and we hear him whisper
please laugh so they think im not dying inside but have so much style i just said something funny
jane does her part enormously well laughing with amusement
but her eyes blaze her friend has been needlessly humiliated
blair wants desperately to be inside aarons joke
what did he say
as if still amused ill never tell
buddy felton waits alone
a camera crew watches him
he is well dressed exceedingly nervous
he summons the courage to ask a question
could i see how i photograph
cause for the interview theyre going to use a screen and disguise me to protect my anonymity so could i see myself before that
the camerawoman punches a button and immediately buddys image comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor
hes not happy with the image but works at concealing his reaction gasping a bit of air trying to touch it
tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters buddy momentarily
but again he almost manages to conceal his private rush
buddys internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his thoughts
aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes
thats your full name
i might as well ask you the questions on tape
is that all right
you worked at one time as foreign service trainee in the state department
i was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times
eventually rising to
curbing his amusement no im sorry
aaron is having a hard enough day he is visibly annoyed
youre saying the fact that youre gay had something directly to do with your promotions
eventually rising to
i dont know
scratches his head i dont know numbers
aaron shoots him a look
youre saying the fact that youre gay had something directly to do with your promotions
i dont like the word gay
which would you prefer
stop the tape okay
forget it ellen
lets call security and get him out
as aaron walks out tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of buddy walking in small circles giving himself a talking to
self flagellating great time to act out buddy
you wont be happy until you turn the whole world off
he notices tom
theyre not really going to call security are they
no i dont think so
how do i get out of here
dazzled you talked me into it
tom distracted his day has been a bit of a bummer
buddy self conscious the proximity creating an almost unbearable tension of romance and adventure
a guard on duty a black woman
she sees buddy
oh youre the gay guy
i was just coming to find you
to guard its okay
buddy in step with him
buddy talks rather quickly he cares very much about leaving tom with the right impression
the last words of his speech he hadnt expected to say
buddy contd thank you for not shunning me and all
more i really did have all that information but i thought i might just be being vindictive to get a little hunk of the ol spotlight
i know horrible but i didnt do it so okay
and thanks again and would you like to have a drink at a regular bar
his heart racing buddy attempts casual matter of factness
is there a regular bar around here
tom and buddy on adjoining stools
for tom the last weeks have been humbling antagonistic
hes enjoying buddy who listens attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word tom speaks
ive been doing some morning show stuff but mostly radio that doesnt bother me
im in no rush for anything
its just the snotty attitude even if i have it coming its still
i mean you didnt do anything special for me tonight
you just had what i think are good manners decency
and it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing
looks right at him honestly
then away because i dont know if youve homosexual or not and youre not are you
tom signals for the check
buddy contd i wasnt doing anything
i really have to go
at least let me show my appreciation
the secretary of labor is going to be indicted on wednesday
for the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed
yes its true
theyre going to make it public wednesday but isnt it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early
how do you know
shrugs my roommates very social somebody from justice was over and
i always hear things before they happen
hey and from now on so do you
george weln the black correspondent and tom are seated in the office with ernie they are in mid meeting
im virtually certain its not true
he may be indicted eventually but i dont think it will be this month
to tom you want to be alone with me tell me your source
if i told you im not sure it would totally convince you but i totally believe the guy
insufferable labor is my department i cant conform it and my contacts go very deep
so if its true im terrific right
its not even a close call
of course we cant go with it
jane is working with bobbie the editor
snatches of the tape make it obvious that the labor secretary has been indicted george weln stands behind jane who is dialing a number
do you want him all the way to the car
no stop where hes all besieged
to bobbie right there bobbie
so he was indicted
we were right not to go with it
but i was right just somebody give it to me
i had a good story
to george give it to him so we can concentrate
ah i dont want any credit
bobbie and i serve anonymously
he pats bobbie on the back
pausing in his work you know i like tom because hi
crowded rush hour
buddy and tom stand next to each other
and the white house is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do
thanks a lot buddy
brushing it off oh please
so they were really impressed with you at work
not impressed exactly but a break in the clouds
i see the change in you i see it
briefing just breaking up jennifer leaves her network seat in the front row only to be grabbed by tom who steers her outside
in the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed marine guard standing at attention
to jennifer so he bought this peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the white house advance team
how come youre not chasing it down yourself
look im junior man and its your beat
boy thats nice
i wish we could all deal with each other like this
ill check it
anything i can do for you
this is my first time at the white house
is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it
i didnt have the guts to ask when i first came up
ill get you a great tour
buddy and tom watching the evening news as jennifer finishes her story
voice over on tv set the president says its not a violation but nonetheless white house sources say the full price will be paid for the peugeot and new rules
will put future bargain hunting off limits for presidential aides
this is jennifer mack at the white house
tom and buddy smile at each other
forgive me but it really is intoxicating being a news source
nobody else had it
i wish it were you giving the story
what if we just dont tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story
dont worry about it
and look in the future i can call you when i have news for you
dont feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information
a breath then to himself well that wasnt as hard to say as you thought was it buddy
what do you mean
youre one of the few people in this town i can talk to
buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a loud sound of hoooo
the bartender and some nearby patrons turn and look
tom shifts with discomfort
hey buddy dont do that anymore
jane waiting for an elevator
it comes and she steps on just as tom clearly excited comes around the bend from ernies office calling for her
he goes to the stairs
he runs out and sees jane in the lobby below then takes off after her
as he enters and runs outside looking in both directions then running off to the right
a beat revealing jane has stopped to talk with blair now she exits
tom on the street ahead of her thinking hes behind her
he runs another half a block and stops dejected
turns to walk back to the office
he keeps looking back to see if he missed her so that his head is turned as jane reaches him says a fairly social hi how are you
she keeps moving tom spinning after her
wait i need you
ive got another story
some public official skipped a week on his christmas club
the house armed service committee has a secret report which says that the general stillwell tank the army has dumped a fortune into plain wont work
i have it cold confirmed
they have five million dollars in this thing already
right of course
they told me i could have any producer i wanted and i want you
as tom savors the moment
various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching toms piece being broadcast
we see a tank misfiring
voice over one source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury
to jane you write this
i write for you sometimes
not because you have to
we see a general walking away from tom
voice over general elton mcguire is in charge of the weapon system
ive been in the army twenty seven years so ill let the army ask the questions not you
general i dont want to bother you anymore or your family
but tomorrow there will be a mob of me back here so if you have anything to say why not say it now sir the way you want
he is a study
looking at himself and though its far from his first time on television its the first time hes seen himself doing serious work and by all appearances doing it well
as the general answers in the b
i think its great of us to have left in what you said just great of us
tom smiles modestly
yeah lets never forget
were the real story
tom and jane look over then tom looks to jane for a verdict
in the b
the news goes to a commercial
yeah i know i went back and forth on it
i liked it
hes not afraid to be human
ernie enters the scene with his fourteen year old daughter in tow
he approaches tom
my youngest wanted to meet you
this is ellie
you should be honored she never cares about meeting anyone here
but she liked you on television just now
entering scene hi ellie remember me
im sorry from where
ive been to your house a lot
helping and aaron went on that fourteen day raft trip with us last year
vaguely oh yes hi
tom is on the phone
into phone hi dad
did you see it
great ill send you a tape
im sorry i havent called
things were a little bumpy for a while
its not important
im fine now
what hes been wanting to say aloud hey dad i just may be able to do this job
well im glad you were sure
ernie is hosting the news staff for sunday brunch they stand around drinking in small groups
aaron is standing with blair and a man in his fifties we have not seen before
i dont know why we have to feel defensive about it
newspapers are in business to make money why not us
aaron looks at her in amazement
they criticize us for supposedly pandering while they run wingo games
amused exactly right
im paid to mix
blair and aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another group
take care paul
back to blair it takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the president of the news division
you think anyone whos proud of the work we do is an ass kisser
i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser
my gosh and for a while there i was attracted to you
she walks off
wait a minute that changes everything
at the bar getting a drink
jennifer enters the scene
and leads jane down the hall until they are standing alone
this is very awkward
go ahead what
ummm its dumb dorm stuff but i see tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and id like to see him outside of work unless
theres some reason for you to mind
in which case i just wont do anything
god almighty whew
do i mind
why do i mind
i do mind
what a shock i dont have a right to
i dont think i like him
i know i dont respect him
so what am i talking about what am i saying to you
youre saying stay away from him
stupefied i cant be
she blinks in wonder
we dont have to settle this definitively right now
jennifer moves toward the drinking table jane unsteadied by the dose of self revelation moves towards aarons circle and scratches his back in friendship
tom approaches an she moves off not wanting to deal with him
she takes a few breaths as she keeps walking
we hear snatches of party conversations i
e tell me one person who ever left television news to work on a newspaper
she moves on tom still following
holding pauls arm i felt so proud when he turned down news vice president so we could stay here
suddenly after all these years we have a life
jane turns sees that tom is still looking at her from a few feet away
badly hi tom
she stands there genuinely frightened
she must deal with him now
he crosses to her
its the firs time ive seen you dressed like this
you look so clean and pretty
what do you mean clean
at work theres always this sort of film over you
well thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you
youre great at taking the edge off a good time
jane starts twitching
she pauses holds a hand lightly on his arm to steady herself
just dont say anything mean for a while
she meets his gaze for an instant and in that instant loses control for the first time in her memory
she looks strange as she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval
ive got to find someone
she walks away
i had the strangest thing happen yesterday
anne and i have been married what
thirty six years
everything fine two days after the promotion came through i was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back
so yesterday i looked in the mirror and she was doing it again
you didnt say anything to her
he shakes his head
my instincts tell me not to
annie comes up
the office is phoning honey
he exits scene as anne watches him go
i hope he moves that fast when its me on the line
as she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back she picks it up and wraps it around herself a bit chilled
she sees jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud anxiety ridden voice as she goes
jennifer turning as jane whips up the stairs
forget what i said you do whatever you want to with him
she pushes at jennifer a little
well theres nothing im going to do right this second
jane pushes her again
but its a party right
jane smiles back feigning female bonding jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to tom
aaron takes in jane who is taking in jennifer and tom then aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as ernie re enters and huddles briefly with
the news president is intent
the two of them walk over to tom and jennifer
we pick up just a few words this would be a good time to tap that source of yours
he could have an angle or something
tom is startled but cool nods his head jennifer is amazed looking at tom with new and even prettier eyes
paul and ernie now move toward jane a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area
jane sheds her afghan as she rises to meet them
to jane we want you to exec produce a special report
aaron has come over to join them now in time to hear
a libyan plane shot up one of our bases in egypt
its all still happening
lets figure out the field
unfortunately since pauls here hes made out the assignments
jennifer at the white house
george at the pentagon
martin at state
and we need an anchor since rorish is in his boat so were gonna do the whole report this afternoon from here
i resign as of now
to aaron stop it
ill tell you what
ill stay if tom knows how to spell gaddafi
ernie as much as i like you i think i have to tell paul what i think because this is really sort of obscenely stupid
jane if you want to go ahead
i dont disagree with you
jane moves quickly off awed at the prospect of taking on the big boss
as she moves past tom who is talking on the phone eventually catching up with paul
in the b
tom has just heard the beep of an answering machine
its and this is tom
you can reach me at the office
i can use a little help
jane because of the proximity to tom is speaking in whispered intensity
tom isnt ready for the job youre about to hand him
not near ready
not by the longest shot
aarons spent six weeks in tripoli hes interviewed gaddafi he reported on the eight one story
i think hes essential to do the job were capable of and i think its my responsibility to tell you that
okay thats your opinion
i dont agree
its not opinion
youre just absolutely right and im absolutely wrong
it must be nice to always believe you know better
to think youre always the smartest person in the room
from her depths no its awful
oh my its awful
turning to leave wed better get moving
as they move out
jane goes to aaron
he moves with her towards the door
ill tell you later where you going to watch from
ill come by your place right after
drink take pills
she runs out the door
aaron turns mean and mocks janes last words screwing up his face in a savage burlesque
yeah love you too
as jane briefly pauses to see which war has room
tom opens the passenger seat of his car she gets in
it moves off
as it moves off
jane looks over at him theres no question hes just told the truth
in the b
we see the bureau newsroom beginning to pulse with activity
tom closes the door
he sits down behind his desk and opens a bottom drawer a clean whit shirt lies there
he opens the center drawer two ties are inside
he picks one
he reaches for a package of new red suspenders
he takes off the shirt and puts on the new one all of this the work of an expert craftsman
by the time he finishes he looks like the authority figure we know hes now
jane is not hyper
she is purposeful organized even calming blair with a little physical contact a touch on the arm to still her colleagues hysterical demons
tell george and jessica to try and cover everything without tom having to ask additional questions
and bobbie says
did you hear what i just said do you have that
take a breath
a breath then yes
in the b
tom has exited his office and looks about waiting for some indication as to what to do next
and the most important thing make sure his earpiece works have back ups ready
thats never been more vital
he must be able to hear me at every second and clearly
jane sees him
she moves across the room takes tom by the arm
we have twenty minutes you can wait in the studio
tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a nearby desk clips it into his inside pocket and walks off
jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic representation of an f shooting down a libyan air force mirage fighter
put in the radar plane that spotted them to begin with
we have no pictures on file
i cant draw but this is a rough idea
she uses the stylus from the electronic paint machine to outline an american air force e c hawkeyes radar plane
her work is stunning
he has a glass in hand some chips on the table with a bottle of wine as he selects a cassette desk to play
he picks a french song looks at some of his books
he might even read
he is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one
he sings along with the record in perfect french
tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up
buddy is being stopped at the other end of the hallway
i have to check first
a bit frantic well then check but hurry there he is
buddy runs the length of the hallway to toms aide despite toms gestures to slow down
is everything all right
you didnt have to come here
its just that im going to anchor this special report on this libyan thing
amused despite situation yes stop
i wondered if you could find out anything about whats happening
on buddys reaction whats wrong
i broke up with my roommate he was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything
look i can start up with him again if you really
im doing fine
tom stands there a man at home in this media castle
hes on the worlds longest ego trip let him take it alone
look buddy ive got to go to work
to tom good bye then
ill speak to you
well who knows
just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever told me dont be afraid to be wonderful
he leans forward gives tom a quick embrace a small kiss on the cheek
tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet his immediate destiny as buddy looks on
jane mounts some steps in the control room she moves past the director and technical crew up to the next level where the two news execs ernie and paul stand
with their backs to the wall and then up one more step slightly above the desk and table occupied by blair
now she slips into the large well paddled throne like seat as we begin music cue
literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide immediate access to the field reporters at the pentagon state and the white house
in front of her the bank of monitors the technical team and past them the studio where tom is seated at anchor a floor producer and writer feeding him copy
as she looks at jane poised to control the complicated apparatus of minds and machines comprising the big time network news
and jane craig is at the helm
blair experiences a flash of emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it
sotto to jane executive producer wow
jane looks at her and in a moment of atypical merriment does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading special report
we hear an announcers voice say this is a special report from
each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to tom and the field reporters
she presses the button marked tom
you hear me tom
he cant hear me
to blair i told you if there was one thing
toms voice on speakers
voice over relaxed i can hear you
i was just teasing
gulping the air in relief she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as tom smiles towards her then poises himself just as the announcers last words clear
voice over in washington tom grunick
he begins his report
he seems authoritative compelling even in a low key way
we trust him
a libyan fighter plane attacked a united states military installation early this morning and was itself shot down by american f interceptors
another monitor shows the graphic running
in the b
two men approaches paul
they look out of place decidedly non business like
moore im marvin usher and this is my brother stuart
the libyan missile destroyed an army warehouse which just thirty minutes earlier had been crowded with servicemen
no one was injured
aaron is seated feet up drinking listening to music reading a book two remote controls are on the cushion next to him
he sings out loud with the record as he reads at one point providing his own lyric line over the music
and i can read while i sing
he picks up the television remote control device an puts the television on the sound off
we see the graphic of the libyan planes flight route its missile firing the u
planes taking off and the shooting down of the mirage jet
at one point aaron lowering the music and raising the tv sound hearing tom
voice over the heat seeking missile virtually disintegrated the plane on
aaron turns down the tv sound and turns up the music
janes hand flicks at the button marked pentagon
george youre ready
we see george and hear him through janes voice box
voice over should i cover everything or should i save something for tom to ask about
hitting toms button were going to george
say the joint chiefs are meeting we have george weln at the pentagon
george weln is at the pentagon where the attack launched by the lone libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might
where he still balances stereo and tv sound
a lot of alliteration from anxious anchors placed in powerful posts
he picks up the phone
as blair hands it to jane
i think the pilot that shot down the libyan in is stationed right here
maybe you could get him and maybe tom should say that our f is one of the hardest planes to fly
theyre nicknamed tomcats
to tom the f is one of the most difficult planes to master
remembering oh you call them tomcats and in the s the first crop had a number of crashes
george isnt the f tomcat one of the most difficult machines for a pilot to master
i think youre right its certainly one of our hottest planes
i say it here it comes out there
voice over there was trouble with them in the early days back in the s
aaron dials again
as we see jennifer standing at the white house
into phone me again
listen gaddafi doesnt foam at the mouth or anything
when you speak to him hes not at all nuts
he seems like a leader very impressive self control
thats whats so strange
right and we have the pilot on the way in nobody else will have him
voice over youre welcome
sow how does it feel to
i know you gotta go me too
were very busy here
he hangs up long shot
aaron with his remote controls
the picture switches back to tom
he turns up the volume
voice over outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed gaddafi find him in a phrase we like to use in this country very presidential
jane is on the phone
the atmosphere buckling with strain
into phone just a minute
her finger hits the tom button
to tom to state for the message from libya then youll have the carrier pilot from the sidra in time to
a sudden shriek what
jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing
as she screams into the phone this is more than volume she is over the top livid her face red neck cords popping
we only have ten minutes left how can you talk to me about parking problems
no not youll try
youll do it do it or ill fry your fat ass estelle
as she bangs the phone down
paul comments sotto to ernie
sotto i had no idea she was this good
hitting toms button fill for a second
fluidly the latest message seems to indicate that the libyan pilot was acting on his own without authority from anyone else
into camera directly in other words i think were okay
moving camera from toms left profile towards his right profile taking in the production assistant who madly shuffles pages even as tom talks on camera the monitor through which he
sees the subject of his interview at the pentagon the clusters of a assistants on the floor and now we continue to circle behind him beginning to see the control room in the b
and as we move in towards his ear the white ear piece firmly in place we begin to hear the barely audible crackle of janes voice as she tells him
roughly what to say and how long he has to say it
so commander it must have been a bit tougher today shooting down the french made mirage jet
the one you got was a su
and now all is obscured except the anchors ears the ear piece and the red light on the camera and beyond
almost an abstract vision
once again the libyan government has disavowed any prior knowledge of the flight
this has been tom grunick reporting from washington
the special report ended jane breathes a breath she and blair momentarily grasp hands
the first talk concerns tom
he was brilliant
ive never been as proud of one of my decisions
calls back to jane great work jane really you know
well there were no major gaffs anyway
ernie scoffs in her direction
she exits the scene
to the usher brothers this was important for tom theres that bonding thing that happens with the public and an anchorman during a crisis
its not the conventions anymore its this kind of moment
he is exuberant
to tom what a baptismal
with all the help you get its sure easier than local
paul and ernie exchange a glance
tom contd wheres jane
im still juiced
ernie points off
as tom exits
the usher brothers hover
to the usher brothers can i help you
were here to play the new news theme
you dont need me for this
why should i be the only one to feel silly
we need a synthesizer but this will give you an idea
to ernie wasnt he great
man two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective news theme a suite meant to have majesty and drive a towering composition the effect of it somewhat lessened
by the fact that the two men vocalize other instruments over the keyboard
as tom makes his way across it crews are drifting in
he enters janes cubby flushed with the electricity of the win the most noteworthy moment of his working life
youre an amazing woman
what a feeling having you inside my head
a bit thrown yeah
it was an unusual place to be
indescribable you knew just when to feed me the next thing just a split second before i needed it
there was a rhythm we got into like great sex
jane looks at him and nods slightly an unconscious spasm of truthfulness
you have to celebrate with me dont you
everybodys going to that bar on the corner caps
im going over to aarons
maybe ill hoop up with all of you later
how long do you think youll be there
tom indicates that its an impossible question to answer
they enters the elevator
as several people cross the street towards the bar
tom has been holding back on one question
its tempting to ask you how you think i did
she starts to reply no
im enjoying myself
take it easy
he starts across the street
trying to be casual maybe ill see you over there
youll never show up
he starts across the street then turns and calls to her
ill wait for you till seven
shouting back okay
tom races to catch up with the others jane in the distant b
pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction
jane moving quickly along
sound of men vocalizing news theme comes up and continues through as jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the stoop outside
happy to see her rising fairly soberly to his feet
he applauds as she comes toward him
it was good
he nods and applauds some more
your calling in that information youre the classiest guy i know
he waves her off
and sits down on the stoop
it was strange to watch him
whats the next step
she sits a step or two above him waiting to gauge his mood
ive been doing some of the most important thinking of my life
i wonder if this is the right time to tell you about it
she steals a glance at her watch
well whatever you think
i figured out exactly why it is im so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor
its because if i do that well theyll pay me more treat me great and my life will be better
sounds like you may be on to something
which means im at their mercy and who wants that
im not going to tell you where this thought led me
anyway well why not tell you
its a happy thing
in the middle of all this i start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and thats you and ill stop
here but jane id give anything if you were two people so i could call up the one whos my friend and tell her about the one im in i
i dont think i should go any further
come on ill walk you to the corner
he tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner
you know youve had a strange day
id sleep on all these things youve been thinking
you go have a good time
you have some place to go
he grabs her and hugs her exuberantly takes her face in his hands and kisses her full on the lips
well i felt something
he leaves her on the corner and walks back
as the sound of news theme vocalizing picks up one more
jane moving quickly hailing a cab
were going to caps bar at seventeenth and vermont connecticut is clear on sunday
take that over to fifteenth then around vermont and well bypass the circle that way
if you dont go over forty we should catch mostly green lights
on the drivers annoyed look
come on dont take it the wrong way
i just know about things
he hits the meter
as the cab pulls up jane gets out and pays him
i never made anywhere near that fast before
thanks good driving thanks
coming from you i appreciate it
as she turns to enter the restaurant tom and jennifer exit
as they confront each other i didnt think youd make it
well i thought id check if all of you were still here
ill just go in and join the gang and you two go on
theres no gang in there we were the last ones
well ill go in and have a bite
to jennifer jennifer you want to have another drink
hey i know how to have a burger by myself
i feel like a little solitude
as they move off i sure know that feeling
terrific work today
too jock like right back to you
thanks for getting me through
he puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of camaraderie
she awkwardly disengages
waves and steps inside the door to the restaurant
standing there between the two sets of doors watching tom and jennifer walk away
as they walk to his car first exchanging a look of reflection over jane
then bumping accidentally then bumping back a look then kissing with passion wrapped around each other
as tom and jennifer rush in locked in an embrace shedding clothes even as they enter
we are aware of moving forms
intense shout damn all you sons of bitches
oh shit you bastards
a beat then sorry
tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman hes just made love to
no its okay
people say different things
the plural threw me
the last time i was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but i guess it beats getting paranoid the next day
okay ill go first
stopping her it would never occur to me to worry at all about you
jennifer is touched
you know something
im deeply complimented
isnt it strange to be deeply complimented because the man youre with doesnt think you have a venereal disease
tom slides out of bed naked she moves quickly across the bed one outstretched hand reaching for his ass a free even lusty sort of motion punctuated by her comment
give me some of that
he dances away out of range liking the action a stupid grin on his face
wheres the bathroom
through the closet
he opens the door and turns on the light in the closet
it is a converted room given over the racks of clothes and shoes extraordinarily well organized
tom stands there agape
various rain coats clothes for all climates lots of luggage
she joins him in the closet holding out a sheet in front of her
i converted a bedroom this stuff builds up
wait till youve been doing this sixteen years
im not knocking it
its a great solution
not only the storage but you can see everything you have
jennifer laughs he follows her gaze and sees himself in silhouette against the door his penis prominent in outline
do you do bunny rabbits
tom is enjoying himself immensely
isnt this a great date
we hear the sound of scratching as we jane feeds another tape in she is taking editing notes alone and scratching her arm
she looks worn out stock footage of statesmen move across the small screen
she sighs and without realizing implores the heavens to help cure a malady shes yet to recognize in herself
to herself god help me
people have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b
how long have you been here
a long time
i was restless
will you crack my neck
he starts massaging her neck as the phone rings
she lets it ring for a beat as aaron works on her
as she picks up the receiver we hear a crack
she reacts to it at the same time she utters a greeting
aaah into phone ello
you sure they said the management meeting
hangs up then to aaron they want me to be at the management meeting
theyre not that dumb after all
he pats her on the back
do you know youre the second woman in network news history to produce
though distracted no im not
im the fourth
pauline fredericks got that credit once on a u
special and theres susan zirinsky
paul is running the meeting from behind ernies desk
two other non editorial men are in attendance
as paul discusses the more pressing problems of the network news division jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by her first moment at the seat of power
she has the blues
anyway they seem to be very serious about making me out eight million from the budget and that means massive firings
im doing everything i can
its too early to make up a death list but i just wanted you to be aware of the situation
were also going to cover the alaskan serial killer trial on a continuing basis
id like it done out of washington which means weve got to get somebody on a plane for anchorage
we cant fool around anymore
she looks up at him a bit sleepy eyed
paul contd this is going to be high profile on the evening news who do you think
george weln or jennifer
much much too quickly jennifer
the men look at her curiously
she repeats herself more rationally
jane contd jennifer
he has been reading from a respectable stack of mail jane appears in his doorway
for the first time we notice that she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor flirting
come on ill buy you a drink
theres a big thing over at the italian embassy
im not sure id be good company tonight
self conscious joke ill be the judge of that
as they walk in one man looks at tom with a glint of recognition
then another a handshake a woman introduces herself
a small knot of people form
its much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you
do i have to stand here in the middle and meet them all
ill get you through
move and smile
she pushes him a little and smile and move
they start crossing the room he is moving now making progress
but an egyptian businessman stops him
is it safe for me to fly home
were fine now
he smiles people smile back
where aaron pimms cut in hand a cucumber sticking out stands with martin klein
martin is eating from a huge platter of appetizers
the italians serve the second best things right after the chinese
i could do an article comparing embassy food
gourmet free loading
sell it anyplace
im sure not getting the assignments
who the heck could that be
from the excited group of people blocking his view its clear there is some personage in attendance
and now he sees that its tom
is god testing me or something
paul loves him
i heard him give him the most poetic compliment in his command
sometimes groups of executives get together just to say that work back and forth
hes hot oh shes hot
oh hes really hot
hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
looking at aaron and here we are
martin youre not allowed to use the word we or im moving
sudden thought maybe jane would like my food idea as a spot
try the one in the middle
he moves off to intercept jane as he stops her
tom is stranded then sees aaron and moves over to his side
same old stuff
im watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors doeuvre idea
a man stops and introduces himself to tom shaking his hand you want to go out there indicating balcony get out of this for a second
why dont you lead
ill just follow the flurry you cause
tom turns the sharpness of the tone unsettles him
what did i do to you
youve made my dreams silly
tom decides not to deal with the remark
hes jolted by the hostility
he leads the way out french doors to a ground floor terrace where aaron joins him closes the door and the two men stare at the party
gesturing at the party heavy hitters
they look inside
several beats then how you doing
network news washington
i love it
what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams
keep it to yourself
you know the other day i really wanted your reaction to how we did with the libyan report i was going to ask but i guess i feel a little
intimidated with you
oh stop it
on toms reaction
you cant talk about feeling intimidated when youre on top of the world
im not buying into any of that
i have a load to learn
im not going to act as if
finishing for him you have the job you have
the sudden debate is important to tom but its moving too fast for him
shut up a second
pretty petty party isnt it pal
picking his words i made one rule for myself when this started and i realized i was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports
and the rule was
never to pretend to know more than i did
can you name all the members of the cabinet
flustered okay lets drop it
i didnt mean id take a test for you i mean if that came up in conversation id
oh my the names of the entire cabinet has slipped my mind
what are they
tom is getting pissed
compromising dont name them
just tell me if you know
i know the names of the cabinet
aaron contd all twelve
there are only ten
aarons suddenly a good deal happier damned if it isnt a little infectious
youre feeling good arent you
sincerely im starting to
we may do the capitols of the states
dry fifty right
aaron almost smiles
tom enters the party leaving the door open
aaron in the f
his back to camera
beyond him tom being approached
then joining jane
as toms car comes to a stop
im so exhausted
i cant think and i cant move
im just a dead lump of poured out flesh
then would you like to come up
tom thinks then maybe we could just sit here talk a little
you didnt like the party huh
too many smart people in one room its not healthy
janes confused by this
she looks at him
im going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own
does it have to be right now
nodding believe me i wouldnt be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary
i have an idea for something
i just read about it in a magazine and it affected me
well what is it
if i tell you can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it wont work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that
broadly yes tom i think i can manage
he turns towards her about to stick his chin out
jane contd i promise
its about women who are attacked by someone they know on a date
date rape thats the piece
jane clamps a hand over her own mouth
okay good move
keep it there
she continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car opens her door and then begins to half carry half pull her out
she keeps her hand clamped over her mouth
laughing from behind her door and runs for it
his spirits lifted
behind the door trying to hide the glow in her eyes
the phone rings
janes hand bounces off her nightstand to turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio instead
three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio
finally the light comes on
janes voice is so thick with sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable
who is it
im not sure i dialed right jane
tom is that you
is this tom
i had to sleep fast so i took two allergy pills to help me
hey you called me
its not important
not important ha ha ha
i was dreaming oh no cant tell how embarrassing for me
what pills did you take
you sound more like someone on a general anesthetic
maybe id better speak to you tomorrow
is it your story
are you going to the correspondents dinner on saturday
why you need me for the story
were you going to you
maybe ill get off work
id like to go
we can go together
so you like me huh
i like you as much as i can like anyone who thinks im an asshole
tom editing a piece with bobby he also has a little typewriter table set up
he is reading from the page in the typewriter as he looks at the piece he has written
reading but cops on the street continue to view it as
shit too long
but street cops say
that last cut work for you bobbie
yes and thanks for asking
as the regulars watch the evening news in particular the date rape piece which is now in progress
tom anxiously eyeing jane out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor
her face impossible to read as she studies the screen
what can you do
if a woman invites a man in and he says they uh had sex and she says he raped her and then you find out theyve been out together two
how can you prove a crime
tom and a woman of about thirty dignified but fragile she looks like someone who might be cast for a church production of glass menagerie
it will be a year next month since it happened
i never thought id talk about it outside of counseling
as aaron enters the scene
he is shushed by every woman in the room accepts this and takes up a position near tom and jane to watch them
wed gone out twice and i hadnt enjoyed myself that much but it gets to a point i dont know if you can appreciate this but where you dont want
to sit home or be with your girlfriends and people had always been telling me that i was too picky
its just you want to meet a nice guy
so anyways it was that give him a chance thing
no it wasnt
i was lonely
so we went to a movie and when he brought me home he said could he just come up and have one beer and then hed go
how do you say no to that
so first it was this wrestling match which was awful enough because it got to be really a fight
because im a modest person
then he ripped my clothes and he forced me to
he stayed in my apartment and forced me more times he didnt leave until
she has started to cry i promised myself i wouldnt cry
its just hard not to ruefully you sure have a sympathetic face
she cries a bit more i was so sure i wouldnt do this but the whole thing messed me up maybe more than it should
as the news piece cut to toms face he turns clearing a tear from his eyes
these watching struck perhaps embarrassed but riveted
aaron is aghast
aaron approaches the set
can i turn on the news for a second
oh wait a minute
sex tears this must be the news
tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the monitor
i dont think you can overestimate it on any given saturday night tens of thousands of women are being attacked and there isnt much they or we can do about
on monitor the victims often remain too terrified to talk the police powerless and all the social welfare groups can finally do is monitor this epidemic of crime without punishment
this is tom grunick in annandale virginia
as his piece concludes
tom continues to glare at aaron
im in a pissy mood
whats wrong with it
i think you really blew the lid off nookie
blair moans with displeasure
aaron exits scene
others start to congratulate tom on the piece in the b
on the we see frozen wilderness men digging in the ground clumps of people watching them work
probing her own ambivalence or to be more accurate working towards a positive stance
to tom nice work
checks watch ive got to get a crew off the clock
she starts off tom stopping her
now off a bit by themselves
so what did you think
it moved me
i did relate to it i really did
it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up and that might not have been my choice
but its real and it got me
and i think a lot of the time im too conservative about that kind of stuff
enormously pleased yeah
he walks back towards the area of the monitor
tomorrow the jury returns to this site as each day brings more revelations of horror four more bodies now taken from the frozen earth
this is jennifer mack in wota hamlet alaska
ernies been looking for you
as aaron walks to his office
as he enters and finds ernie bent over his desk
oh i was just writing you a note
what do you say we take a walk
yeah ernie is silent
hes having difficulty
aaron is feeling knots form
finally ernie breaks his silence
i dont know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you
just tell me whats really going on
i think we know each other well enough for me to expect that
agitated we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out
so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased
wipe me out
ernie sits on a bench
i want you to think of this as
just blunt talk okay
id really appreciate bluntness
upper management thinks youre dull
aaron ive never seen them like this i think pauls nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to
bullshit me a little
im beginning to appreciate it
im no suggesting the worst will happen
but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe the next time that happens down the road you should look into it
emotional ah damn the fucking jerks my god
they want to fire me
all i know is that theyve got to fire a large number of people
and theyre not going by seniority
theres a recklessness in the air
interrupting do one thing to me
get me one shot at anchoring the weekend news theyve never seen me do it
i think it could turn them around
i could do it this saturday everyone wants off for the correspondents dinner
aaron turns his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope
do it then
please prepare carefully
this couldnt come at a better time
you have saturdays news handy
its been a while since you read the news ill have somebody work with you
just on superficial performance things
ernie contd please
i think id better be alone for a while
ill go with you
aaron is seated behind a desk some old news copy in his hand
an unmanned camera is pointing at him
tom is standing a few feet further back studying him
this is uncomfortable for me because well i dont mean it as a knock but we approach this differently
we sure do
i dont mean it as a knock either
he smiles go ahead
ill just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want
it just might not work for me because of our different approaches
tom nods and gestures that he proceed
aaron begins reading the news
barely a sentence in he is interrupted
your coat jacket is rising up in back
aaron ignores the tip
when you sit down sit on your jacket a little that gives you a good line
look at yourself in the monitor
aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news
tom not about to be ignored when he knows its important moves behind aaron and begins to force his jacket down
very uncomfortable i dont like being handled
sit on it
just dont physically
he sees himself in the monitor and is suddenly enthusiastic fantastic tip fantastic
he starts to read again
thats not going to tell us anything
lets get this prompter going
its not loaded
ill find some copy
be right back
tom exits aaron looking after him clearly taken with the genuine camaraderie
the unmistakable joy tom derives from helping out
several beats and tom comes back with a cameraman in tow
i got copy i got ellen to heat up the camera and i got master control taping so you can study it later
he puts the roll of copy in the prompter
im very appreciative
tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from various angles
aaron reading from the prompter
dont let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that
you dont want to look shifty do you
oh god no
and the left side of your face is the good one
and try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence punch one idea a story
punch come on aaron does same with the story he is reading
aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode
punching the first words
thank you for the compliment tom
he draws a laugh from the cameraman as he goes right into the next story
try not to move your head or wrinkle your forehead
this is good very good
aaron tape in head is saying his farewell to tom
he is facing his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth
you were smokin toward the end there
the pointers were great
ill study the tape
tom is into helping aaron he finds himself delivering a locker room pep talk and remember youre not just reading the news or narrating
everybody has to sell a little
youre selling them this idea of you
you know what youre sort of saying is trust me
im uh credible
so whenever you catch yourself just reading
stop and start selling a little
he moves off aaron watching him go feeling decidedly uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted
jane flies into frame carrying her dress two large shoulder pads clipped to her bra straps
she is obviously running a little late
now she slips on the dress her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown the kind good girls wear on
the doorbell rings
she opens the door while trying to put on her necklace
aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful of neckties
i spilled some rum on the outfit you picked out
let me show you the alternates
she eyes the amount of clothing goes to the phone and dials
into phone tom
why dont i meet you there
ive got some last minute stuff ive got to take care of
hey how did you resolve your dilemma did you rent the tux or buy it
i knew it
see you there
i didnt know you were going with him
did you bring your grey suit
i was thinking that way too
she holds them in her hand indicates with the necklace that she wants him to help her
he fastens her necklace while looking over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie collection
the clasp in place thanks
try this one
she hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag puts it on and ties the tie
she reaches into a white paper bag full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a built in atomizer and sprays the air in front of
hr and walks into the mist
on aarons reaction i read about it thats how you can make sure you dont put on too much perfume
could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you me showing up while youre getting ready for a date
flaring its not a date
its co workers going to a professional conclave
jane unnoticed reaches into the paper bag takes a small box of condoms and drops it into her evening bag
jane on a public phone aaron standing nearby within sight of a taxi stand
on phone how long will it tale you to send one
she hangs up
then looks at aaron relaxes
you look terrific
aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core really
because this is important so dont just be polite
id really like to look
whats the word im looking for
as good as humanly possible
well the line of the jacket no really
just very nice
i wish i could be there
if it gets dull a little before drop by the studio
im not sure ill be able to
if if not ill have the tape
ill wait for you at my apartment
okay great good luck
before she can deal with that a cab arrives
have a good time tonight
aaron takes her in she looks lovely
id hug you but why risk mussing either of us
she half laughs
kisses him wipes the slight lipstick mark from his cheek and in a sudden decision takes each of her shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his improving
his look while diminishing her own
she gets in the cab
jane leaning all the way over the front seat giving detailed instructions to the driver as the cab pulls away
as aaron turns and walks off
jane in her formal sitting back anticipating her date
a hefty percentage of the washington journalism industrys men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where they can finally assert their own glamour
jane enters the scene
as jane enters lost momentarily in the lobby greenhouse the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes
a bit of dialogue overhead from two men in dinner jackets
times is a great outfit
best severance pay in the business
jane keeps looking for tom passing another man talking to his sharp looking date
he was lecturing me and finally i just said im sorry i refuse to look at it as a negative that im young and my news appeals to people my
and its not like he just didnt hire a twenty six year old producer himself
no kidding twenty six
jane moves to the steps and starts up greeting several people nervously
more bits of dialogue leaking from conversations of both substance and expedience
remember brinkleys great line its as irrevocable as a haircut
now on the second level she scans the crowd
the floor below
tom in the worlds best fitting tux
clusters of people from around him but he works his way easily through them as he looks for jane and grins his greetings men are buoyed womens pulses throb
as she silently mouths the words smile and move and smile and move
which is exactly what hes doing
then a contract with the gods
to herself if he doesnt see me soon were not supposed to be together
he does a tap step a brief giddy burst the meaning of which is not lost on jane
he is acting like her boyfriend
anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of jane as a joyous pretty young woman
moving quickly up the stairs as she walks toward him
excitedly its incredible whos here
almost completes an affectionate gesture takes his arm instead
aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt sleeves writing
he takes the just completed page out of the typewriter and walks over to the weekend news producer
want to look at this
george weln appears
to aaron what are you doing here
feigning casualness the weekend news
anchoring the weekend news
way to go
aaron nods as the producer finishes the copy
this is terrific news aaron
its a pleasure to read
oh theres water on the set isnt there in case i get an attack of cotton mouth
youll be fine
feeling patronized and repelling ill be fine
bomb sniffing dogs secret service men and d
police monitoring the members of washingtons most trustworthy elite as they pass through the metal detector
the line moves slowly jane and tom several couples back
can i have your autograph for my wife
tom and jane turn to see a grinning paul
how you doing paul
so this is why you wouldnt do the weekend new you cant turn down a free meal
yes born to party
paul enjoys the riposte looks at jane who is shrinking within herself
ill see you two inside i think were all at the same table
sotto to jane youre finally learning to be flexible
glad you changed your mind about tom
he passes through the detector
tom starts to step through it she pulls him back
i dont want to go in there and sit with everybody
imagining it i cant
why dont you go
he considers this option as she waits
suppose i go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby bar
she walks off
he runs a few steps to stop her
youre not going to take off on me are you
she steps on the escalator
riding upwards concern deepens anxiety flows
watching her to up the escalator he finds himself doing simplest thing stepping onto a moving step
jane four steps ahead of him not yet aware of him
he moves past one other man until he is standing directly behind her
i just want you to know that my giving up the correspondents dinner puts tremendous pressure on you
jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture life threatens to be good
and now jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator regaining her balance by grabbing toms offered hand
as they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands
we are on the studio floor focusing on the activity around the anchor desk and three cameras
the floor manager stands ready to cue aaron the script is ready to roll on the prompter machine
making sure he is seated on his jacket taking one last look at the hand mirror being held by the makeup woman
she starts off but aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her footing a check then another check he points to a spot on his forehead which she dabs
with the makeup sponge
both of them fuss enormously with his hair four busy hands
he watches the makeup woman scurry underneath a camera lens resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has been denying him for years
we can hear the end of his cue in a barely audible crackle from the floor managers earphones
with aaron altman
on tv good evening
in mood and language better suited to an espionage novel than the delicate world of the western alliance the british foreign secretary today pounced on what he termed the nest
of profession spies and amateur traitors who were turning nato headquarters into an instrument whose only true function is folly
we begin our coverage with edward towne in london
aaron looks up takes a breath
hes done well hes punched his words and his one thought for the story
his gaze has been steady his voice firm but he has begun to perspire
he dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip
he beckons nervously to the makeup woman who comes in and dabs then dabs again as aaron feels himself under his arms
she scurries away aaron reaching for another kleenex from her box and missing it
a graphic illustrating his next scripted section appears behind him
the sub bases referred to are located in five countries
and now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible the floor manager and makeup woman grimacing at the growing specter as they look at a large monitor
france belgium the netherlands spain as
and now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat
the makeup woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself
aarons eyes dart angrily in her direction
we well as great britain
our own state department was rocked not only by the revelation but from the highly unusual persistence from the state press corps
martin klein reports on the ruckus at foggy bottom
half beat until hes sure that hes off his shirt now showing distinct sweat stains
the makeup woman picks up her kleenex box then thinks better of it
someone finds me some big towels
he blots his face some makeup streaked by the towel
as she scurries away this time entering the control room trotting up one stair to look at the monitor
the director talking to his camera operators
id go looser but we wouldnt see the graphic
to other technician no this is more than nixon ever sweated
the makeup woman now looks at the bank of monitors
cant you just die for him
aarons makeup streaked face
tom and jane walking drinks in hand her arm around his waist
they stop he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up and then sits next to her
revealing that they are sitting on an anti terrorist concrete abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful night in our capitol
he is still holding her hand and now he notes this
loudly to himself why cant i let go of this woman
he interrupts her with the smallest of kisses so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid air
and then he does something hes thought about many times before he briefly caresses her breasts while continuing to look at her
at least kiss me when you do that
a grin you just cant stop editing me
this is hysterical
she laughs a little then kisses him
they break surprised and aroused and look at each other
i was half hoping i wouldnt have a good time tonight
you know why
because youre nuts
right right isnt she fun to tease
he leans forward and speaks softly and truly
more and more lately when ive watched you in action seen all your energy ive been wondering what it would be like to be inside all that energy
she takes a gulp of her drink puts a hand to feel the heat on her own cheek
then turns to him
right back at you
i dont remember saying anything like that exactly
i dont know why i just did
immediately at work oh lets see wait a minute well i can think of two reasons
i just thought of a third
if you talk about it you dont have to do it
thats not it
another is youre trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else
she looks at him hes thinking
or its that great feeling that you dont want to hold anything back
you know intimacy
she elbows him
tom takes in the choices then suddenly oh shit
im a creep
she moves off the concrete wall
i forgot all about aaron
i promised to stop by and see how he did
id like to know
ill go along
ill see you at your apartment as soon as i can
she starts to flurry with activity moves to the curb when out of nowhere tom barks a sharp command the first time any of his actions has been tinged with
thrown she stops and turns
he walks to her
dont run off like everythings settled the minute you make up your mind
he might be weird he can talk more freely if i go alone whys that so hard to understand
its not that its hard
i just want you to give me a minute to catch up
she hugs him sorry
another beat dont yell at me like that again you scared the life out of me
as jane exits a cab and moves up the steps
it is at the top of a flight of steps
she knocks on the door
aaron opens it
he is wearing a sweatshirt and cords
i was in the shower
howd it go
you didnt see it or speak to anybody
then it went well
did it really go well
define your terms
do you feel good about it
do others feel that you did well
then what was good about it
i lost six pounds
aaron will you tell me
it was great
writing my little first rate copy sitting on my jacket punching my one thought
but i had this historic attack of flop sweat so theyll never let me another again
oh i lost one of your shoulder pads how was your evening anyway
what do you mean flop sweat
youre making too much out of it
ill bet you were the only one aware of it
people phoned in
i want to know what happened
im not kidding
there were complaining phone calls because you were sweating
no nice ones worried that i was having a heart attack
if all that happened how come youre so chipper
i dont know
at a certain point it was so off the chart bad it got funny
my central nervous system was telling me something
jane sweat running down my face makeup falling into my eyes people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me all so i could read introductions to other people who
were covering stories which is what i like to do anyway
and im chipper because you finally showed up
i thought id cook for us
tequila and eggs sound good
i have to be somewhere
he looks at a clock reading in the morning
i told whats his name tom that id meet him
call him i mean it can wait right
now the plunge i dont know
i may be in love with him
as if he just burned his hand no
she starts for the door
this is important to me
i think it is important for you too
he walks to a desk and looks at her briefly
looking at her let me think a second
a remarkably long silence her mind wanders she takes stock
it is evident that he is straining to get it right reaching into himself
glancing at note lets take the part that has nothing to do with me
lets let me be your most trusted friend the one that gets to say awful things to you
testy and wary but fair yes i guess
you cant end up with tom because it goes totally against everything youre about
yeah being a basket case
i know you care about him
ive never seen you like this about anyone so please dont take it wrong when i tell you that i believe that tom while a very nice guy is the
quickly this isnt friendship
what do you think the devil is going to look like if hes around
nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long red pointy tail
im semi serious here
he will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great god fearing nation and he will never do
an evil thing
he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important
just coax along flash over substance
just a tiny bit
and he will talk about all of us really being salesmen
seeing hes not reaching her and hell get all the great women
she is getting pissed
i think youre the devil
you know that im not
because we have the kind of relationship where if i were the devil youd be the only one i told
shes briefly impressed
he has a point
you were quick enough to get toms help when
and if it had gone well for me tonight maybe id be keeping quiet about all this
i grant you everything but give me this
he does personify everything youve been fighting against
and im in love with you
realizing how do you like that
i buried the lead
he pauses to catch his breath breathing deeply through his nose
an aside ive got to not say that aloud it takes too much out of me
thawing sit down stop
aaron slumps down its been a long round
ive never fought for anyone before
does anybody win one of these things
a car door slams in the street below he goes towards the window which is blocked by his sofa puts his knees in and looks out
a woman walking from a car
momentarily thinking its jane
it is not jane
the phone rings
as he answers and we have the following conversation between jane who is using the phone with aaron seen just a few feet away
tom in his apartment
where are you
i cant get away just yet
im at aarons
im not sure
it seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news
i taped it
it wasnt as bad as he think was it
it wasnt unprecedented or anything
not if you count singing in the rain
do him a favor and dont treat it like a tragedy
you want me to talk to him
her eyes meet aarons
to aaron he says you could hardly notice it
aaron beckons for the phone
jane hands it to him as she does so dont say anything about anything
will i ever sing again
everybody has one like that
i thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end
yeah well im sorry im tying up jane i didnt realize you two would be going this late
dont worry about it
ill put her on
she takes the phone
that sounds more important
lets forget about tonight
i dont know if thats absolutely necessary
ive got my father coming through tomorrow anyway
i should get some sleep
hampered by aarons presence uh huh
ill see you at the office
several beats of silence
finally finally hello
aghast good night
jane im not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule
okay great grunick easy shots now huh
she puts the phone down
a beat she looks stricken
aaron looks at her
he just cancelled
he had a chance to think and he cancelled
she bows her head
i cant breathe
aghast over a guy
then but i cant i cant breathe
she gulps a breath
her hands on her knees leaning over another deep breath
aaron takes in the specter
well jane it was nice of you to drop by
as she enters goes immediately to the phone
cradled in an answering machine indexes for sixteen one button calls mostly people from work parents etc
jane plays her answering tape
it is silent no messages
she fast forwards to double check
just the sound of blank tape
she pushes the button next to the tom grunick
we hear a busy signal
she hangs up the phone
then compulsively hits the tom button again
she considers for a moment hitting the button next to aarons name
stopping herself be fair
she presses the button next to toms name
as he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the door of his car just as his wife calls from the door
ernie theyre calling from work
tell me im on the way in
ernie just a bit concerned walks back to his house the four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry
a phone in the immaculate living room
into phone hello
he holds the phone down at his side for a beat composing himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events
would there be any point to my going to new york and talking to them
would there be any point in going over it with you
no im still coming in
he hangs up
they fired me
she takes his hand and kisses it then hugs him
weeping how horrible
well be fine
youll be fine
stay here with me well go for a drive have some drinks make happy plans
theyre firing even more people than they said
some will want to talk
it could help
timidly i could use somebody to talk to on a day like this
on his reaction sorry
he kisses her sad face
he walks towards the door picks up his newspapers on the tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start
in the mirror he sees his wife making faces at him behind his back
he exits his home without comment
jane is sitting in her editing cubby it is past noon
she rises and stands in her doorway looking toward toms office the door is open the room is empty
blair enters carrying an armload of tapes
she looks extraordinary
ive got four hours of french demonstrations jane waves it off
some of it they use water cannons
jane takes the tape
what are you dressed up for
oh thats right because the evening news is here this week
i spent a fortune on this
jane pops the tape in automatically making timing notes then standing looking again towards toms door
the door now closed
she stops the tape summons herself
she walks towards toms office and opens the door
tom is seated behind his desk
without passion i kept trying to call you you never called me
were you just diddling me
is that it
im great if im helping your career
mimicking but when im a woman for a second i get immediately fucked around by you
she is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch toms answer
jane this is my dad
and now opening the door a bit more toms father is revealed seated across from him
that quickly please forgive what i said
to tom sorry
as she retreats you just light up a room and leave huh
she laughs nervously as she exits
you want my opinion
the thing thats easy to miss about jane is
you want my opinion
and its okay if you dont
tom thinks a beat
yes i would
the way she just acted is not the way an affectionate person acts
tom finds the comment off the wall enough to be thought provoking
paul arriving with bill rorish
the first time we have seen the multi millionaire anchorman in the flesh
he has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity he and paul are in the midst of an important conversation
muted and ominous
just when do you start telling people
id like to take everyone out after the show
this is hard on all of us and its no time for compliments
but i think its extraordinary of you to come down here for this
if were not here for each other during the tough time were not a news organization
blair enters scene
the smallest flicker of interest from bill but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the outfit
welcome back to washington
a self conscious look of greeting to paul and shes gone
was she on the list
paul nods yes
this is a brutal layoff
and all because they couldnt program wednesdays
cant resist you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary
as bill turns just a bad joke
its a miserable day and that was some kind of totally sick joke defense mechanism which does not indicate any of my feelings not one but just shows the kind
of stress this represents for all of us
tom and his father enter the scene from toms office
bill walks to tom
its about time
good to see you bill
as they shake a great handshake
touched as he watches the networks most prominent journalist greet his son
this is my father
good to meet you sir
equally touched as he watches the worlds most prominent journalist greet his dad who turns goofy with excitement
good bye tom
he puts a big hand on his sons cheek a farewell pat
then whispers in his ear
im going to go back home and tell all your old teachers
tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to janes editing room
as tom enters
i feel terrible about what happened
what did he say
he uh said he liked you because you looked like you had fire and honesty
enormously pleased no
did he really
then he said a really weird thing
so softly what
he means this that it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better
he gets like that sometimes
thats so perfectly
it really makes me feel a little faint
actually woozy whooo
blair enters wildly into the scene
they canned me
well my brother will feel great now hes not the only screw up
bobbie sticks his head out of his office
tom paul wants to see you
as tom focuses and moves off moving with tom
nervousness growing confidence gone he proceeds down the hallway
hell just be a minute
tom sits down pats his tie in place
a beat and the door opens
paul leads out martin klein
they shake hands
you know im just old enough to be flattered by the term early retirement
what a lovely line
if theres anything i can do
evenly i certainly hope you die soon
a little smile to tom and hes off
tom enters the room
a nervous cough in evidence as he crosses to a seat
were having a severe cutback tom people in this bureau including technical personnel and were going to reorganize at the same time
were going to take you out of washington for a while and assign you to london
aaron and ernie are off to the side in the newsroom people are packing their belongings as secretaries cry and embrace from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation no
i wont keep my voice down
those sons of bitches
they are worse than accountants they are bad accountants
tom enters scene
have you guys seen jane
shes in there becoming the first woman bureau chief weve had here
tom takes this in
what did they do with you
they booted me out of washington
theres no system that wouldnt value one of us
what did they do to you
pointing at aaron its what he did
im proud of him
they told me theyd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line
the cost efficient reporter
so i quit
a weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps ernie away
tom and aaron stand there comrades at last victims of the same sword
you packing up tonight
and im sorry that theyre sending you down for a while but youll make it back
where they sending you
thats a promotion
defensively i dont think so
yes thats where they had rorish for gods sake before they made him anchor
i cant stand it theyre grooming you for it all and you dont even know it
hold it down okay
can i ask you something
you only had one crew on the date rape piece right
he extends his hand
youre not going to stick around for the farewell party
i dont know how much fun it will be when martin klein and ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard
aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes a few pockets of conversation
ernie reading some copy
this story they wont cover
and if the network doesnt cover it it must not be important so why worry
eyeing him im going to miss you youre a prick in a great way
aaron taken by surprise laughs
you know what i
no i liked the way it made me sound
as he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings
a scheduled book clean shirt two ties cuff links a travel mirror cassettes of his washington reporting
his desk clear he writes on a clean piece of copy paper
he centers it on his desk
good luck youll love the bureau chief
as tom enters from his office a wake is slowly igniting
tom moves along the edge of the room carrying his wastebasket full of belongings not really a part of the mournful festivities
jane across the room hugging one person after another
as she embraces an older secretary
you know what i always wanted to tell you that
this isnt the last time well see each other
a two armed tight embrace of martin klein
well get them back its going to change
blair is at hand as they embrace
except for socially youre my role model
and now she sees tom he mouths one word at her london
she nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a little
he gestures her towards her editing room so they can rendezvous
as tom enters and waits for jane
when she enters he closes the door
these people its all so awful
it just hurts physically doesnt it
like somethings wrong with your bones like your organs are shifting inside your body
she looks at him expectantly
its not what hes feeling
maybe i havent been here long enough
great but hey congratulations on the promotion
how can you say that to me
a beat i cant stand here feeing bad that i dont feel worse
this has happened at every station i ever worked for
look i think its crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job
i have a week to get to my job
lets get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this
a beat jane takes it in
well i just think that an extraordinary proposal
thats more than yes thats you bet
the phone rings
jane still at the office it is quite late
bastard sneak quitter
i just found out
you didnt say anything to me
you just resign
will you meet me now
im going away tomorrow
across the street from the bureaus building
aaron and jane are having a beer
they are in mid conversation
why not try it for a few weeks
ernie thought i was good too he couldnt help
my agent has a hot prospect the number two station in portland
the general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks
personally i think he should aim higher
tell me the gods honest truth are you leaving because of me
because if you are
ernie told this story
how he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices he cried
he was till that way when they promoted him out of obits
he says youre lucky if you can get out while you could still cry
a beat i should have quit this place three years ago
youre just trying to say all great stuff so ill feel even worse that youre not around
i just want to sit here longer i mean the feeling is powerful whys that
maybe the best part of your life is over and you dont want to get up and start the bad part
jane looks at him levelly
you are now required to sit here with me
a beat then come on
be smart for a second what do you think will happen to us
okay thats very easy
five six years from now ill be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations
smile its like old times yes
ill be walking with my wife and two children well bump into you on the street my youngest son will say something and ill tell him
deliberately its not nice to make fun of single fat ladies
you wont be able to stay mad at me right
i hope so
on her look he relents no
im not really mad
nodding head as if reciting a catechism ill miss you well talk well always be friends
well get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it okay
jane smiles aaron has grown suddenly angry
he rises walks away then turns
jane you know how tom had tears in the piece the other night
ask yourself how we were able to see them when he only had one camera and that was pointing at the girl during the interview
on her reaction im fairly sure i was right to tell you
we look through the window as jane enters in a frenzy searching the stacks
as she locates the cassette labelled date rape as she inserts the tape into the player
as she watches
this is what she sees
but the whole thing messed me up more than it should
we hear tom
okay that will do it
the tape is rocky now the sound woman and cameraman continue to roll as they move towards their next shot at times the camera pointing towards the carpet but the
the crew chatting mentioning that the tape is still rolling
are you okay
yes im sorry
dont be silly
what are you sorry about
the way you were looking at me i just went
tom moves through the shot
i just need you for another minute now so we can shoot from behind towards me and um
that way we have someplace to go when we cut
and i just sit here i nod my head and look nerdy
young woman chuckles
it kills me we didnt have a second camera
it was so powerful seeing your reaction
yes it is
for a second there i thought you were gonna cry yourself
that would have been something
considering then then give me a minute
fully realizing you fucking
as jane watches we see tom work up the tears we saw in the evening news piece as he does so oh thats amazing
on janes shocked reaction janes cab pulls up to the curb
she gets out she is carrying no luggage
she sees tom who hurriedly walks up to her
jane is fighting to maintain a calm
look whos the organized one
ive got everything
he briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit
im not going
he looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face
i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl
i know you acted your reaction after the interview
tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench
jane close behind stalking him
i felt funny about it afterwards
its verboten huh
i thought since i did it for real the first time but i get you
thats not the reason youre not coming
raising her voice of course its the reason
its terrible what you did
we disagree on how god awful it was
why dont you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time
livid jesus if youre glib about this im going to lose it
i was up all night and
calmly jane jane jane jane jane
it made me ill
you could get fired for things like that
i got promoted for things like that
working up tears for a new piece cutaway
you totally crossed the line between
its hard not to cross it they keep moving the little sucker dont they
distaste it just proves that the difference we have are
this is a one way argument
weve got six days if you go and we fight and we hate it well come home
if you dont go
well thats a much bigger deal
i go to london right after that
so itd be very big deal if you stay here
the planes boarding
youre good at deadline
heres your ticket
taking ticket its amazing
you commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if im nitpicking
try and get this
when you edited that
deliberately im leaving now
he simply turns and walks away looking back once as jane stands there mucked up by his sudden departure the lack of resolution to their confrontation is palpable
on tom moving past the metal detector
he too is frustrated pissed off at her
jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors
as jane passes through and sets off the buzzer
she stands there the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to stem the tears
as others look on she takes a huge key ring from her pocket deposits it in the box walks through without a buzzer and moves on
tom waiting while in the b
people eater busses ferry passengers to the plane
as one full people eater pulls away and another empty one arrives
to tom this is the last one
others start to board
he sees jane moving towards him
he walks to her she gestures back towards the street
thats not going to be the way we say good bye
even though i think what you did was rotten its not all impersonal
you mean something to me
interrupting you keep coming after me and looking down on me
its starting to make me batty
she looks at him
tom contd i cant help it that they like me
and i like that they like me
and i think theres a lot of this job that i do well
what do you think it takes to do this job the way they have it now
i dont wan to discuss work
well lets do a special report on that
i mean thats news
i knew what you meant
what i dont know i can learn and what i know nobody can teach
excuse me for saying it about myself but i think its true
old habit what do you think
catching himself never mind what you think
they look at each other
youre lucky i came after you so you got that off your
yes i am
i mean it
the pressure begins to bend janes resolve
so you have an extra bathing suit huh
wary but hopeful you want to come
totally open its just that one of the few things im not confused about is what i was saying downstairs that
giving up sadly finally then you should stay here
softly its better when you let me say it
he hugs her
now that its over they can each openly care for each other
while in the embrace take it easy
why did i have to do this to myself
watch you take off
then call me if you need anything
he kisses her lightly looking at her
then heartfelt oh honey
he walks to the people eater and gets on still holding his paper bags of bathing suits
the bus pulls away
watching him go
tom standing at the front window of the bus framed very much as he is when on television
jane gets quickly into cab
after collecting herself dupont circle please
the cab pulls away
dont take the beltway because at this time of day theres gonna be a lot
stops herself then go any way you want
she sits back in the seat containing herself before finally and quietly adding what she knows to be true but new york avenues faster
much the same place where jane and tom first met
the words seven yeas later appears on the screen
a sign off to one side tells us its the annual meeting of the local television broadcasters
and that at p
tom grunick will be speaking on responsibilities of broadcast journalism for the s
much the same audience though two members of the audience may strike particular interest curly haired man seen from behind holding a similarly curly haired five year old
tom is in mid speech
when they told me bill had decided to retire and offered me the evening news i thought it was the same kind of joke we used to pull back at
the station turning off somebodys prompter in the middle of a show
some good natured laughter
tom contd and then when they heard my reaction they thought i was kidding
i told them id be their anchor but i didnt want to be the managing editor that there were people better qualified than i to control the content and if
there werent we were all in trouble
the audience really enjoys this the anchor teams leaning forward
they love this man a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap
imagine the feeling you see on the top of the mountain a man not unlike yourself
and now to something more important
id like to introduce my bride
gestures to a woman in the front row lila
a svelte classic warm beauty gets to her feet
aaron and his son as aaron cranes for a look at mrs
tom and lila shaking hand
aaron his son in his arms wait
as he sees aaron
he is clearly delighted
holy shit aaron
he claps him on the back
aaron is as pleased as he is uncomfortable with the attention
lila this is aaron altman
high british accent oh yes youre one of toms or so role models
well this kid couldnt possibly belong to anyone else

indicating tom do you know who this is cliff
the big joke
tom looks at him aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge

he starts off
she pulls him back for an urgent communication
tom the speech was magnificent
oh i didnt say anything about your speech

tom aaron and the boy walking along
tom plays with cliff as they move
the boy is delighted
jane is in a park a blanket spread out she is wearing shorts and a top she has some wine and a small picnic a toy for clifford
she hears her name being called
shielding her eyes from the sun now making out tom
as they reach her
to herself well why not
as they arrive hey what is this
my lifes rushing in front of my eyes
i thought for ol cliff here look at you

she gives him a quick kiss
he shakes hands with aaron
to aaron its nice to see you
congratulations on historys longest winning streak
if you ever get restless in portland let me know
tom shuffles uncomfortably
smiling appreciating aarons attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful
to jane as he leaves bye
tom walks away
hes a good twenty yards away when aaron looks up to see his son running after tom
tom now notices the boy leans down and pats him
to clifford go back to your daddy
the boy starts back
come on cliff
as clifford runs back to his father aaron sits next to jane
to jane so whos the guy
well we met about three months ago
he works at the surgeon general office
he loves boating
so hes been getting me into water skiing
aaron laughs at the very notion of jane finding water sports a lure
jane deliberately moves past this moment
i like it
so doll what about you lately
well my wife got this new job
he continues to talk
as the two former colleagues catch up their ease returns if not their intimacy as the frame locks and the scene slowly recedes into a black b
