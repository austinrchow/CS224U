href b b steven zaillian final draft train wheels grinding against track slowing
folding table legs scissoring open
the lever of a train door being pulled
names on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside the tracks
bewildered rural faces coming down off the passenger train
forms being set out on the folding tables
hands straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps
when your name is called go over there
take this over to that table
typewriter keys rapping a name onto a list
keys typing another name
youre in the wrong line wait over there
you come over here
a man is taken from one long line and led to the back of another
a hand hammers a rubber stamp at a form
tight on a face
keys type another name
as a hand comes down stamping a gray stripe across a registration card there is absolute silence
then music the hungarian love song gloomy sunday distant
and the stripe bleeds into color into bright yellow ink
the song plays from a radio on a rust stained sink
the light in the room is dismal the furniture cheap
the curtains are faded the wallpaper peeling
but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful
the hands of a man button the shirt belt the slacks
he slips into the double breasted jacket knots the silk tie folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket all with great deliberation
some currency cigarettes liquor passport
and an elaborate gold on black enamel hakenkreuz or swastika which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket
he steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror
he likes what he sees oskar schindler salesman from zwittau looking almost reputable in his one nice suit
even in this awful room
a spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings
general sigmund lists armored divisions driving north from the sudetenland have taken cracow and now in this club drinking socializing conducting business is a strange clientele ss officers and polish
cops gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs thrown together by the circumstance of war
oskar schindler drinking alone slowly scans the room the faces stripping away all thats unimportant to him settling only on details that are the rank of this man the higher
rank of that one money being slipped into a hand
in front of the ss officer who took the money
a lieutenant hes at a table with his girlfriend and a lower ranking officer
from the gentleman
the waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where schindler seemingly unaware of the ss men drinks with the best looking woman in the place
do i know him
his sergeant doesnt
his girlfriend doesnt
find out who he is
the sergeant makes his way over to schindlers table
theres a handshake and introductions before and the lieutenant watching cant believe it his guy accepts the chair schindlers dragging over
the lieutenant waits but his man doesnt come back hes forgotten already he went there for a reason
finally and it irritates the ss man he has to get up and go over there
his girlfriend watches him cross toward schindlers table
before he even arrives schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room waving at the girl to come join them motioning to
waiter to slide some tables together
and another round of drinks
the lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet
let me get this one
no put it away put it away
schindlers already got his money out
even as hes paying his eyes are working the room settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high ranking ss men
as a waiter lays it down on another table thats been added to the others
schindler seats the ss officers on either side of his own date what are you drinking gin
he motions to a waiter to refill the mens drinks and returning to the head of the table s sweeps the room again with his eyes
erupts from schindlers party in the corner
nobodys having a better time than those people over there
his guests have swelled to ten or twelve ss men polish cops girls and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is making sure everybodys got enough to
eat and drink
here closer at this table across the room an ss officer gestures to one of the ss men who an hour ago couldnt get the girl to sit at his
the guy comes over
who is that
like everyone knows thats oskar schindler
hes an old friend of
i dont know somebodys
screws in a flashbulb
she lifts the unwieldy thing to her face and focuses
as the bulb flashes the noise of the club suddenly drops out and the moment is caught in black and white oskar schindler surrounded by his many new friends smiling
a photograph of a face on a work card black and white
a typed name black and white
a hand affixes a sticker to the card and it saturates with color deep blue
people in long lines waiting
others near idling trucks waiting
others against sides of buildings waiting
clerks with clipboards move through the crowds calling out names
the party pin in his lapel catches the light in the hallway
behind schindler the door to another apartment closes softly
a radio somewhere is suddenly silenced
are you itzhak stern
at the door of this apartment a man with the face and manner of a talmudic scholar finally nods in resignation like his number has just come up
schindler offers a hand
confused stern tentatively reaches for it and finds his own grasped firmly
settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask
theres a company you did the books for on lipowa street made what pots and pans
stern stares at the cognac schindlers offering him
he doesnt know who this man is or what he wants
pause by law i have to tell you sir im a jew
schindler looks puzzled then shrugs dismissing it
all right youve done it good company you think
he keeps holding out the drink
stern declines it with a slow shake of his head
it did all right
schindler nods takes out a cigarette case
i dont know anything about enamelware do you
he offers stern a cigarette
stern declines again
i was just the accountant
simple engineering though wouldnt you think
change the machines around whatever you do you could make other things couldnt you
schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be someone else listening in somewhere
field kits mess kits
he waits for a reaction and misinterprets sterns silence for a lack of understanding
but stern does understand
he understands too well
schindler grins good naturedly
once the war ends forget it but for now its great you could make a fortune
dont you think
with an edge i think most people right now have other priorities
schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could possibly be
stern smiles despite himself
the mans manner is so simple so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a jew in occupied cracow in
he really doesnt know
stern decides to end the conversation
get the contracts and im sure youll do very well
in fact the worse things get the better youll do
it was a pleasure
thats the easy part
finding the money to buy the company thats hard
he laughs loudly uproariously
but then just as abruptly as the laugh erupted hes dead serious all kidding aside you know anybody
stern stares at him curiously sitting there taking another sip of his cognac placid as a large dog
pause jews can no longer own businesses sir thats why this ones for sale
well they wouldnt own it id own it
id pay them back in product
they can trade it on the black market do whatever they want everybodys happy
he shrugs it sounds more than fair to him
but not to stern
pots and pans
nodding something they can hold in their hands
stern studies him
this man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesmans pitch just dressed better than most
i dont know anybody whod be interested in that
a slow knowing nod they should be
a mason trowels mortar onto a brick
as he taps it into a place and scrapes off the excess cement the image drains of under lights a crew of brick layers is erecting a ten foot wall
where a street once ran unimpeded
a young man emerges from an alley pocketing his jewish armband
he crosses a street past german soldiers and trucks and climbs the steps of st
a dark and cavernous place
a priest performing mass to scattered parishioners
lots of empty pews
the young polish jew from the street poldek pfefferberg kneels crosses himself and slides in next to another young man goldberg going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside
pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket
whispered bored whats that
you dont recognize it
maybe thats because its not what i asked for
you asked for shoe polish
my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army
but by the time it got there because of the cold it broke the whole truckload
pause so im responsible for the weather
i asked for metal you gave me glass
this is not my problem
look it up
goldberg doesnt bother he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priests prayer all but ignoring pfefferberg
this is not your problem
everybody wants to know who i got it from and im going to tell them
goldberg glances to pfefferberg for the first time and greatly put upon takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it
he flips the pad closed pockets it crosses himself as he gets up and leaves
pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman the desk clerk
both are wearing their armbands
pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own lets say this is what you give me
these are fees i have to pay some guys
this is my commission
this is what i bring you back in occupation currency
the clerk satisfied with the figures is about to hand over to pfefferberg some outlawed polish notes from an envelope when schindler comes in from the street
the clerk puts the money away gets schindler his room key waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with pfefferberg
but schindler doesnt leave he just keeps looking over at pfefferbergs shirt at the cuffs the collar
thats a nice shirt
pfefferberg nods yeah thanks and waits for schindler to leave but he doesnt
nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street
you dont know where i could find a shirt like that
pfefferberg knows he should say no let that be the end of it
its not wise doing business with a german who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever
but theres something guileless about it
nodding theres nothing in the stores
the clerk tries to discourage pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look
pfefferberg ignores it
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs
nice things cost money
the clerk tries to tell pfefferberg again with a look that this isnt smart
i dont know ten or twelve
thats a good color
dark blues grays
schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills waiting for pfefferberg to nod when its enough
hes being overcharged and he knows it but pfefferberg keeps pushing it more
the look schindler gives him lets him know that hes trying to hustle a hustler but that in this instance at least hell let it go
he hands over the money and pfefferberg hands over his notepad
write down your measurements
as he writes down the information pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug
as he writes im going to need some other things
as things come up
as oberfuhrer scherner and his daughter in a wedding gown dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up
on an expansive lawn
the ss doesnt own the trains somebodys got to pay
whether its a passenger car or a livestock car it doesnt matter which by the way you have to see
you have to set aside an afternoon go down to the station and see this
other ss and army officers share the table with czurda
schindler too nice blue shirt jacket only he doesnt seem to be paying attention rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him ingrid
so you got thousands of fares that have to be paid
since its the ss thats reserved the trains logically they should pay
but this is a lot of money
pause the jews
theyre the ones riding the trains they should pay
so you got jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to god knows where
they pay the ss full fare the ss turns around pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare and pockets the difference
he shrugs there you have it
he glances off sees something odd across the yard
two horses saddled up being led into the garden by a stable boy
to ingrid excuse me
schindler gets up from the table
scherner his wife and daughter and son in law stare at the horses theyre beautiful
schindler appears takes the reins from the stable boy hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom
theres nothing more sacred than marriage
no happier an occasion than ones wedding day
i wish you all the best
scherner hails a photographer
as the guy comes over with his camera so does just about everybody else
scherner insists schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom
a neighborhood place
bread pastries couple of tables
at one sits owner and a well dressed man in his seventies max redlicht
i go to the bank i go in they tell me my accounts been placed in trust
what are they talking about whose trust
i look around
now i see that everybodys arguing they cant get to their money either
this is true
ill take you there
max looks at the man not without sympathy
hes never heard of such a thing
its really a bad deal
but then let me understand
the nazis have taken your money
so because theyve done this to you you expect me to go unpaid
thats what youre saying
the owner of the place just stares at redlicht
that makes sense to you
the man doesnt answer
he watches max get up and cross to the front door where he says something to two of his guys and leaves
the guys come in and start carting out anything of any value cash register a chair a loaf of bread
max strolls along the sidewalk browsing in store windows
people inside and out nod hello but they despise him they fear him
just as hes passing a synagogue some men in long overcoats cross the street
einsatzgruppen they are an elite and wild bunch one of six special chivalrous duty squads assigned to cracow
the sabbath prayers of a congregation of orthodox jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple
several non orthodox jews from the street including max redlicht are being herded inside by the einsatz boys
theyre made to stand before the ark in two lines orthodox and non
one of the einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly i want you to spit on it
i want you to walk past spit on it and stand over there
no one does anything for a moment
the liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes come on were all too sophisticated for this the others with the beards and sidelocks silently check with their
one by one then they file past and spit on the scroll
the last two the rabbi and max redlicht hesitate
they exchange a glance
the rabbi finally does it the gangster doesnt
after a long tense silence
i havent been to temple must be fifty years
to the rabbi nor have i been invited
the einsatz nco glances from max to the rabbi and smiles to himself
this is unexpected this rift
to the rabbi you dont approve of the way i make my living
im a bad man i do bad things
max admits it with a shrug
ive done some things
but i wont do this
the einsatz nco glances away to the others amused
what does this mean
of all of you theres only one who has the guts to say no
and he doesnt even believe
no one of course answer him i come in here i ask you to do something no one should ever ask
and you do it
pause what wont you do
he turns to max
you sir i respect
he pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head
hes dead before he hits the floor
the rest of you
are beneath his contempt
he turns and walks away
the other einsatz boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire
in black and white and absolute silence a suitcase thrown from a second story window arcs slowly through the air
as it hits the pavement spilling open sound on and returning to color thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of kazimierz dragging mattresses over the bridge at podgorze
carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto
crowds of poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route
some take it more soberly as if sensing they may be next
the little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again and at them sit the clerks
goldberg of all people has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority
armed with something more frightening than a gun a clipboard he abets the gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the
pfefferberg with his wife mila at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever flicks at goldbergs od armband with disgust
im a policeman now can you believe it
yeah i can
they consider each other for a long moment before pfefferberg leads his wife past goldberg and into the ghetto
dismayed by each others close proximity orthodox and liberal jews wait to use the floors single bathroom
from the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor
in this apartment looking like they cant bear much more of it sit some non orthodox businessmen stern and schindler
for each thousand you invest you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month to begin in july and to continue for one year after which
time were even
he shrugs thats it
he lets them think about it pours a shot of cognac from his flask offers it to stern who brought this group together and now sits at schindlers side
the accountant declines
not good enough
not good enough
look where youre living
look where youve been put
not good enough
he almost laughs at the squalor a couple of months ago youd be right
moneys still money
no it isnt thats why were here
schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer
it doesnt come
just a silence
which irritates him
did i call this meeting
you told mr
stern you wanted to speak to me
now you want to negotiate
the offers withdrawn
he caps his flask pockets it reaches for his top coat
how do we know youll do what you say
because i said i would
what do you want a contract
to be filed where
he slips into his coat i said what ill do thats our contract
the investors study him
this is not a manageable german
whether hes honest or not is impossible to say
their glances to stern dont help them he doesnt know either
the silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door
one of the men eventually nods hes in
a red power button is pushed starting the motor of a huge metal press
the machine whirs louder louder
schindler at a wall of a windows is peering down at the lone technician making adjustments to the machine
the standard ss rate for jewish skilled labor is seven marks a day five for unskilled and women
this is what you pay the economic office the laborers themselves receive nothing
poles you pay wages
generally they get a little more
are you listening
schindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant
what was that about the ss the rate the
the jewish workers salary you pay it directly to the ss not to the worker
he gets nothing
but its less
its less than what i would pay a pole
thats the point im trying to make
poles cost more
stern hesitates then nods
the look on schindlers face says well whats to debate the answers clear to any fool
why should i hire poles
another machine starting up growling louder louder to a yellow identity card with a sepia photograph a german clerk attaches a blue sticker the holy blauschein proof that the carrier
is an essential worker
at other folding tables other clerks pass summary judgment on hundreds of ghetto dwellers standing in long lines
im a teacher
the man tries to hand over documentation supporting the claim along with his kennkarte to a german clerk
not essential work stand over there
over there other non essential people are climbing onto trucks bound for unknown destinations
the teacher reluctantly relinquishes his place in line
the teacher at the head of the line again but this time with stern at his side
im a metal polisher
he hands over a piece of paper
the clerk takes a look is satisfied with it brushes glue on the back of a blauschein and sticks it to the mans work card
the worlds gone mad
another machine starting up a lathe
a technician points things out to the teacher and some others recruited by stern
the motor grinds louder louder
schindler wanders around a large empty apartment
theres lots of light glass bricks modern lines windows looking out on a park
the same place full of furniture and people
lots of ss in uniform
schindler drinking with oberfuhrer scherner keeps glancing across the room to a particularly good looking polish girl with another guy in uniform
id never ask you for money you know that
i dont even like talking about it money favors i find it very awkward it makes me very uncomfortable no look
its the others
theyre the ones causing these delays
theyre the ones
theyd appreciate some kind of gesture from me
scherner thinks he understands what schindlers saying
just in case he doesnt i should send it to you though dont you think
you can forward it on
id be grateful
yes they understand each other
thatd be fine
lets not talk about it anymore lets have a good time
scherner at his desk initialing several armaments contracts
the letters d
appear on all of them
men and pulleys hoist a big f up the side of the building
down below schindler watches as the letter is set into place the good looking polish girl from the party klonowska is shown to her desk by stern
its right outside schindlers office
this girl has never typed in her life
flames ignite with a whoosh in one of the huge furnaces
the needle on a gauge slowly climbs
a garage door slides open revealing a gleaming black mercedes
schindler steps past pfefferberg and moving around the car carefully touches its smooth lines
another machine starts up
stern with a woman at the head of a line
the clerk affixes the all important blue sticker to her work card
three hundred jewish laborers men and women work at the long tables at the presses the latches the furnaces turning out field kitchenware and mess kits
few glance up from their work at schindler the big gold party pin stuck into his lapel as he moves through the place his place his factory in full operation
he climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries process armaments orders
he gestures to stern at a desk covered with ledgers to join him in his office
the accountant follows schindler into the office
schindler goes to the wall of windows his favorite place in the world and looks down at all the activity below
he pours two drinks from a decanter and turning back holds one out to stern
stern of course declines
oh come on
he comes over and puts the drink in sterns hand moves behind his desk and sits
my father was fond of saying you need three things in life
a good doctor a forgiving priest and a clever accountant
the first two
he dismisses them with a shrug hes never had much use for either
but the third he raises his glass to the accountant
sterns glass stays in his lap
long sufferingly just pretend for christs sake
stern slowly raises his glass
schindler drinks stern doesnt
klonowska wearing a mans silk robe traipses past the remains of a party to the front door
opening it reveals a nice looking nicely dressed woman
a series of realizations is made by each of them quickly silently ending up with klonowska looking ill
who is it
schindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife
behind him through a doorway klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things
shes so embarrassed look at her emilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom catching the girl just as she looks up embarrassed
you know what youd like her
oskar please what i dont have to like her just because you do
it doesnt work that way
you would though
thats what im saying
his face is complete innocence
its the first thing she fell in love with and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now
klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self conscious
it was a pleasure meeting you
she shakes emilies limp hand
schindler sees her to the door lets her out and returns to the table smiling to himself
emilies glancing around at the place
youve done well here
he nods hes proud of it
he studies her
you look great
they emerge from the building in formal clothes both of them looking great
its wet and slick the doorman offers emilie his arm
careful of the pavement mrs
the doorman shoots a glance to schindler that asks clearly really
schindler opens the passenger door of the mercedes for his wife and the doorman helps her in
a nice place
no jews or dogs allowed
the maitre d welcomes the couple warmly shakes schindlers hand
nodding to his date mrs
the maitre d tries to bury his surprise
hes almost successful
no fewer than four waiters attend them refilling a glass sliding pastries onto china lighting schindlers cigarette raking crumbs from the table with little combs
its not a charade all this
how could it be a charade
she doesnt know but she does know him
and all these signs of apparent success just dont fit his profile
schindler lets her in on a discovery
theres no way i could have known this before but there was always something missing
in every business i tried i see now it wasnt me that was failing it was this thing this missing thing
even if id known what it was theres nothing i could have done about it because you cant create this sort of thing
and it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure
he waits for her to guess what the thing is
his looks says its so simple how can you not know
gloomy sunday from a combo on a stage
schindler and emilie dancing
pressed against her both have had a few he can feel her laugh to herself
i feel like an old fashioned couple
it feels good
he smiles even as his eyes roam the room and find and meet the eyes of a german girl dancing with another man
schindler and emilie lounging in bed champagne bottle on the nightstand
long silence before should i stay
pause its a beautiful city
thats not the answer shes looking for and he knows it
should i stay
pause its up to you
thats not it either
no its up to you
schindler stares out at the lights of the city
they look like jewels
promise me no doorman or maitre d will presume i am anyone other than mrs
and ill stay
he promises her nothing
emilie waves goodbye to him from a first class compartment window
down on the platform he waves goodbye to her
as the train pulls away he turns away and the platform of the next track is revealed soldiers and clerks supervising the boarding of hundreds of people onto another train
the image turning black and white
your luggage will follow you
make sure its clearly labeled
leave your luggage on the platform
as workers load crates of enamelware onto trucks back to color stern and schindler and the dock foreman confer over an invoice
more to stern every other time its been all right
this time when i weigh the truck i see hes heavy hes loaded too much
i point this out to him i tell him to wait he tells me hes got a new arrangement with mr
schindler to schindler that you know all about it and its okay with you
its okay with me
on the surface schindler remains calm underneath hes livid
clearly its not okay with him
how heavy was he
not that much just too much for it to be a mistake kilos
stern and schindler exchange a glance
then pause youre sure
the foreman nods
pfefferberg and schindler bang in through the front door startling a woman at a desk
can i help you
they move past her without a word and into the back of the place into a storeroom
they stride past long racks full of enamelware and other goods
a man glances up sees them coming
hes one of schindlers investors the one who questioned the germans word
the mans teenage sons rush to their fathers defense but pfefferberg grabs him and locks an arm tightly around his neck
then calmly if you or anyone acting as an agent for you comes to my factory again ill have you arrested
it was a mistake
it was a mistake
what was a mistake
how do you know what im talking about
all right it wasnt a mistake but it was one time
we had a deal you broke it
one phone call and your whole family is dead
he turns and walks away
pfefferberg lets the guy go and follows
the investors sons help their father up off the floor
gasping he yells
i gave you money
but schindler and pfefferberg are already gone coming through the front office and out the front door to the street
pfefferberg looks a little shaken from the experience
schindler straightens his friends clothes
how you feeling all right
whats the matter everything all right at home
pfefferberg nods milas okay
well then schindler cant imagine what could be wrong
he pats pfefferberg on the shoulder and leads him away
the long tables accommodate most of workers
the rest eat their lunch on the floor
soup and bread
an elegant place setting for one
meat vegetables glass of wine all untouched
schindler leafing through pages of a report stern has prepared for him
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while its till hot
were doing well
better this month than last
any reason to think next month will be worse
the war could end
no chance of that
satisfied schindler returns the report to his accountant and starts to eat
stern knows he is excused but looks like he wants to say something more he just doesnt know how to say it
pause theres a machinist outside whod like to thank you personally for giving him a job
schindler gives his accountant a long suffering look
he asks every day
itll just take a minute
hes very grateful
schindlers silence says is this really necessary
stern pretends its a tacit okay goes to the door and pokes his head out
an old man with one arm appears in the doorway and schindler glances to the ceiling to heaven
as the man slowly makes his way into the room schindler sees the bruises on his face
and when he speaks only half his mouth moves the other half is paralyzed
i want to thank you sir for giving me the opportunity to work
youre welcome im sure youre doing a great job
schindler shakes the mans hand perfunctorily and tells stern with a look okay thats enough get him out of here
the ss beat me up
they would have killed me but im essential to the war effort thanks to you
i work hard for you
ill continue to work hard for you
thats great thanks
god bless you sir
youre a good man
schindler is dying and telling stern with his eyes get this guy out of here
stern takes the mans arm
he saved my life
yes he did
god bless him
they disappear out the door
schindler sits down to his meal
and tries to eat it
stern and schindler emerge from the rear of the factory
the mercedes is waiting the back door held open by a driver
climbing in dont ever do that to me again
stern knows what he means
and schindler knows he knows
close the door
the driver closes the door
snow on the ground and more coming down
a hundred of schindlers workers marching past the ghetto gate as is the custom under armed guard
turning onto zablocie street theyre halted by an ss unit standing around some trucks
shovels scraping at snow
the marchers working to clear it from the street
a dialog between one of the guards and an ss officer is interrupted by a shot and the face of the one armed machinist falls into the frame
herman toffel an ss contact of schindlers who he actually likes sits behind his desk
its got nothing to do with reality oskar i know it and you know it its a matter of national priority to these guys
its got a ritual significance to them jews shoveling snow
i lost a day of production
i lost a worker
i expect to be compensated
file a grievance with the economic office its your right
would it do any good
schindler knows its not toffels fault but the whole situation is maddening to him
he shakes his head in disgust
i think youre going to have to put up with a lot of snow shoveling yet
schindler gets up shakes toffels hand turns to leave
a one armed machinist oskar
right back he was a metal press operator quite skilled
toffel nods smiles
from a distance stern and schindler slowly walk a wasteland that lies between the rear of def and two other factories a radiator works and a box plant
sterns doing all the talking in his usual quiet but persuasive manner
every so often schindler glancing from his own factory to the others nods
the party pins the two other german businessmen wear are nothing compared to the elaborate thing in schindlers lapel
he sits at his desk sipping cognac a large portrait of hitler hanging prominently on the wall behind him
unlike your radiators and your boxes my products arent for sale on the open market
this company has only one client the german army
and lately ive been having trouble fulfilling my obligations to my client
with your help i hope the problem can be solved
the problem simply is space
stern who has been keeping a low profile hands the gentlemen each a set of documents
id like you to consider a proposal which i think youll find equitable
id like you to think about it and get back to me as soon as excuse me do you really think this is appropriate
the man glances to stern and back to schindler his look saying this is wrong having a jew present while we discuss business
if schindler catches his meaning he doesnt admit it
kuhnpast almost sighs
i can appreciate your problem
if i had any space i could lease you i would
me neither sorry
i dont want to lease your facilities i want to buy them
im prepared to offer you fair market value
and to let you stay on if you want as supervisors
pause on salary
theres a long stunned silence
the germans cant believe it
after the initial shock wears off kuhnpast has to laugh
youve got to be kidding
nobody is kidding
pause thanks for the drink
he sets it down gets up
hohne gets up
they return the documents to stern and turn to leave
they arent quite out the door when schindler wonders out loud to stern you try to be fair to people they walk out the door ive never understood that
the businessmen slow but dont look back into the room
pfefferberg wipes a smudge from the hood of an otherwise pristine bmw cabriolet
as scherner and his wife emerge from their house in robes scherner whispers to himself oskar
workers high on the side of the building toss down the letters of the radiator sign as others hoist up a big d
under armed guard others unload a metal press machine from a truck
technicians make adjustments to presses already in place
others test the new firing ovens
kuhnpast is being forcibly removed from the premises
crowded beyond belief the place is like a post office gone mad
stern moving along one of the impossibly crowded lines pauses to speak with an elderly couple
a hand slaps a blue sticker on a work card
klonowska at her desk her eyes closed tight
she opens her eyes and smiles
schindler is holding a poodle in his arms
she comes around to kiss him
he sets the dog on the desk
stern across the room watches blank faced
schindler stern and klonowska turn to the voice
two gestapo men have entered unannounced
we have a warrant to take your companys business records with us
and another to take you
schindler stares at them in disbelief
stern quietly slips one of the ledgers on his desk into a drawer
am i permitted to have my secretary cancel my appointments for the day
he doesnt wait for their approval
he scribbles down some names toffel czurda reeder scherner
underlining scherner he glances to klonowska
a humorless middle level bureaucrat sits behind a desk and d
s ledgers and cashbooks
you live very well
the man slowly shakes his head no to schindlers offer of a cigarette
schindler tamps it against the crystal of his gold watch
this standard of living comes entirely from legitimate sources i take it
schindler lights the cigarette and drags on it all but ignoring the man
as an ss supplier you have a moral obligation to desist from blackmarket dealings
youre in business to support the war effort not to fatten interrupting you know
when my friends ask id love to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect
the quiet matter of fact tone more than the comment itself throws the bureaucrat off his rhythm
his eyes narrow slightly
theres a long silence
the two who arrested him lead schindler down a long hallway
they reach a door have him step inside and close the door after him
schindler knocks on the inside of the door
a waffen ss man opens it
the prisoner peels several bills from a thick wad
chances of getting a bottle of vodka pretty good
he hands the young guard five times the going price
the guard turns to leave
wait a minute
he peels off several more bills and hands them over
perched on the side of the bed in pajamas schindler works on a breakfast of herring and eggs cheeses rolls and coffee
someone has also brought him a newspaper
theres an apologetic knock on the door before it opens
im sorry to disturb you sir
whenever youre ready youre free to leave
schindler the gestapo clerk and one of the arresting officers cross the foyer
id advise you not to get too comfortable
sooner or later law prevails
no matter who your friends are
schindler ignores the man completely
reaching the front doors the clerk turns over the d
records to their owner and offers his hand
schindler lets it hang there
you expect me to walk home or what
tightly bring a car around for mr
a gestapo limousine pulls in through the gates of the factory parks near the loading docks
the driver the same ss officer waits for schindler to climb out but he doesnt he waits for the ss man to come around and open the door for him
if youd return the ledgers to my office id appreciate it
there are no less than forty able bodied jewish laborers working on the docks any one of which would be better suited to the task
the gestapo man calls to one of them
excuse me hey the guy turns theyre working
the guy just stares
finally he heads off with the ledgers
the poodle bounds out past him and over to schindler
he gives the dog a pat on the head
elegantly dressed for a night out schindler and klonowska emerge from the building
as theyre escorted to the waiting car schindler hesitates
a nervous figure in the shadows of an alcove is gesturing to him beckoning him
schindler excuses himself
klonowska watches as he joins the man in the alcove
their whispered conversation is over quickly and the man hurries off
from the locomotive looking back the string of splattered livestock carriages stretches into darkness
theres a lot of activity on the platform
handcards piled with luggage trundle by
people hand up children to others already in the cars and climb aboard after them
the clerks are out in full force with their lists and clipboards reminding the travelers to label their suitcases
climbing from his mercedes schindler stares
hes heard of this but actually seeing the juxtaposition human and cattle cars this is something else
recovering he tells klonowska to stay in the car and moving along the side of the train calls sterns name to the faces peering out from behind the slats and
several pages worth on a clipboard a gestapo clerk methodically leafing through them
without him everything comes to a grinding halt
if that happens itzhak stern
schindler nods hes on the list
the clerk shows him the list points out the name to him
well lets find him
hes on the list
if he were an essential worker he would not be on the list
hes on the list
you cant have him
im talking to a clerk
schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a hard murmur the growl of a reasonable man who isnt ready yet to bring out his heavy guns
whats your name
sir the list is correct
i didnt ask you about the list i asked you your name
as schindler writes it down the clerk has second thoughts and calls to a superior an ss sergeant who comes over
the gentleman thinks a mistakes been made
my plant manager is somewhere on this train
if it leaves with him on it itll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why
the sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes at the pin at the man wearing them
to the clerk is he on the list
to schindler the list is correct sir
theres nothing i can do
may as well get your name while youre here
my name is kunder
the sergeant takes out a pad
now all three of them have lists
he jots down schindlers name
schindler jots down his and flips the pad closed
tauber thank you very much
i think i can guarantee you youll both be in southern russia before the end of the month
he walks away back toward his car
the clerk and sergeant smile
but slowly slowly the smiles sour at the possibility that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow arrange such a fate
schindler the clerk and the sergeant stride along the side of the cars
two of them are calling out loudly stern
soon it seems as if everybody except schindler is yelling out the name
as they reach the last few cars the accountants face appears through the slats
there he is
guards yank at a lever slide the gate open
stern climbs down
the clerk draws a line through his name on the list and hands the clipboard to schindler
initial it please
schindler initials the change and this
as schindler signs three or four forms the guards slide the carriage gate closed
those left inside seem grateful for the extra space
it makes no difference to us you understand this one that one
its the inconvenience to the list
its the paperwork
schindler returns the clipboard
the sergeant motions to another who motions to the engineer
as the train pulls out stern tries to keep up with schindler whos striding away
i somehow left my work card at home
i tried to tell them it was a mistake but they schindler silences him with a look
stern glances down at the ground
it was stupid
contrite thank you
schindler turns away and heads for the car
stern hurries after him
they pass an area where all the luggage carefully tagged has been left the image becoming black and white
mechanics hood lamps throw down pools of light through which me wheel handcarts piled high with suitcases briefcases steamer trunks black and white
moving along with one of the handcarts into a huge garage past racks of clothes each item tagged past musical instruments furniture paintings against one wall childrens toys sorted by
the cart stops
a valise is handed to someone who dumps and sorts the contents on a greasy table
the jewelry is taken to another area to a pit one of two deep lubrication bays filled with watches bracelets necklaces candelabra passover platters gold in one silver the other
and tossed in
at workbenches four jewish jewelers under ss guard sift and sort and weigh and grade diamonds pearls pendants brooches childrens rings faltering only once when a uniformed figure upends a
box spilling out gold teeth smeared with blood the image saturating with color
fractured gravestones like broken teeth jut from the earth of a neglected jewish cemetery outside of town
down the road that runs alongside it comes a german staff car
in the backseat untersturmfuhrer amon goeth pulls on a flask of schnapps
his age and build are about that of schindlers his face open and pleasant
make a nice driveway
the other ss officers in the car knude haase and hujar arent sure what he means
hes peering out the window at the tombstones
the staff car passes through the portals of the ghetto and down the trolley lines of lwowska street
as the car slowly cruises through the ghetto knude like a tour guide briefs the new man goeth this street divides the ghetto just about in half
on the right ghetto a civil employees industry workers so on
on the left ghetto b surplus labor the elderly mostly
which is where youll probably want to start
the look goeth gives knude tells him to refrain if he would from offering tactical opinions
of course thats entirely up to you
outside of town a previously abandoned limestone quarry lies nestled between two hills
the stone and brick buildings look like theyve been here forever the wooden structures those that are up are built of freshly cut lumber
theres a great deal of activity
new construction and renovation foundations being poured rail tracks being laid fences and watchtowers going up heavy segments of huts wall panels eaves sections being dragged uphill by teams of
bescarved women like some ancient egyptian industry
goeth surveys the site from a knoll clearly pleased with it
but then hes distracted by voices a mans a womans arguing down where some barracks are being erected
the woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave of her hand and stalks back to a half finished barracks
the man one from the car hujar sees goeth knude and haase coming down the hill and moves to meet them
she says the foundation was poured wrong shes got to take it down
i told her its a barracks not a fucking hotel fucking jew engineer
goeth watches the woman moving around the shell of the building pointing directing telling the workers to take it all down
he goes to take a closer look
she comes over
the entire foundation has to be dug up and re poured
if it isnt the thing will collapse before its even completed
goeth considers the foundation as if he knew about such things
he nods pensively
then turns to hujar
calmly shoot her
its hard to tell which is more stunned by the order the woman or hujar
both stare at goeth in disbelief
he gives her the reason along with a shrug you argued with my man
to hujar shoot her
hujar unholsters his pistol but holds it limply at his side
the workers become aware of whats happening and still their hammers
goeth groans and takes the gun from him and puts it to the womans head
calmly to her im sure youre right
she crumples to the ground
he returns the gun to his stunned inferior and gesturing down at the body addresses the workers
thats somebody who knew what they were doing
thats somebody i needed
pause take it down re pour it rebuild it like she said
he turns and walks away
stable boys lead two horses into the pre dawn light
the animals hoofs shatter tufts of weeds like fingers of glass fog plumes from their nostrils
in addition to the exhaust from idling trucks and the curling smoke from the sonderkommando units cigarettes there is excitement in the chilly pre dawn air
an empty street
rooftops against a lightening sky
a few of the windows in the buildings are lighted glowing amber the majority are still dark
the stable boys hoist saddles onto the horses cinch the straps
leaning against the hood of the mercedes schindler and ingrid in long hacking jackets riding breeches and boots share cognac from his flask
untersturmfuhrer goeth soon to be commandant goeth stands before the assembled troops with a flask of cognac in his hand
he looks out over them proudly theyre good boys these the best
he addresses them today is history
the young will ask with wonder about this day
today is history and you are a part of it
a fourteen year old kid hurries across to the square pulling on his o
several others of the jewish ghetto police golberg among them are already assembled there
the clerks the list makers scissor open their folding tables set out their ink pads and stamps
when elsewhere they were footing the blame for the black death kazimierz the great so called told the jews they could come to cracow
ingrid climbs onto one of the horses schindler onto the other
as the animals gallop away with their riders toward a wood the stable boys wave
they trundled their belongings into this city they settled they took hold they prospered
the fresh young faces of the sonderkommandos listening to their commander
for six centuries there has been a jewish cracow
the horses panting hard
their hoofs hammering at the ground climbing a hill
riding boots kicking at their flanks
the boots of amon goeth slowly pacing
tight on his face smiling pleasantly
by this weekend those six centuries theyre a rumor
they never happened
today is history
the galloping horses break through to a clearing high on a hill
the riders pull in the reins and the hoofs rip at the earth
schindler smiles at the view the beauty of it with the sun just coming up
from here all of cracow can be seen in striking relief like a model of a town
he can see the vistula the river that separates the ghetto from kazimierz wawel castle from where the national socialist partys hans frank rules the government general of poland beyond
it the center of town
he begins to notice refinements the walls that define the ghetto peace square the assembly of men and boys
he notices a line of trucks rolling east across the kosciuscko bridge and another across the bridge at podgorze a third along zablocie street all angling in on the ghetto
like spokes to a hub
the wheels of the last truck clear the portals at lwowska street and the sonderkommandos jump down
families are routed from their apartments
an appeal to be allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt an unannounced move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot
spilling out of the buildings theyre herded into lines without regard to family consideration some other unfathomable system is at work here
the wailing protests of a woman to join her husbands line are abruptly cut off by a short burst of gunfire
from here the action down below seems staged unreal the rifle bursts no louder than caps
dismounting schindler moves closer to the edge of the hill curious
his attention is drawn to a small distant figure all in red at the rear of one of the many columns
small red shoes against a forest of gleaming black boots
a waffen ss man occasionally corrects the little girls drift fraternally it seems nudging her gently back in line with the barrel of his rifle
a volley of shots echoes from up the street
schindler watches as the girl slowly wanders away unnoticed by the ss
against the grays of the buildings and street shes like a moving red target
a truck thundering down the street obscures her for a moment
then shes moving past a pile of bodies old people executed in the street
schindler watches shes so conspicuous yet she keeps moving past crowds past dogs past trucks as though she were invisible
patients in white gowns and doctors and nurses in white are herded out the doors of a convalescent hospital
the small figure in red moves past them
shots explode behind her
short bursts of light flash throughout the ghetto like stars
schindler fixated on the figure in red loses sight of her as she turns a corner
she climbs the stairs
the building is empty
she steps inside an apartment and moves through it
its been ransacked
as she crawls under the bed the scene drains of color
the gunfire outside sounds like firecrackers
schindler and ingrid are gone
below the ghetto lies like a void within the city its perimeter and interior clearly distinguishable by darkness
outside it the lights of the rest of cracow glimmer
tables and tools and enamelware scrap
the metal presses and lathes still
the firing ovens cold
the gauges at zero
against the wall of windows overlooking the empty factory floor stands a figure schindler in silhouette against the glass black against white not moving just staring down
bloody wheelbarrows stark against the tree line of a forest above the completed forced labor camp plaszow
names on lists
names called out
tight on faces
goldberg at one of several folding tables
the gangsterturned ghetto cop is now the lord of lists inside plaszow
he and other listmakers call out names accounting for those thousands who survived the liquidation of the ghetto and now stand before them in long straight rows
amon goeth stirs wakes glances at the woman asleep beside him
hungover he drags himself slowly out of bed
goeth steps out onto the balcony in his undershirt and shorts and peers out across the labor camp his labor camp his kingdom
satisfied with it even amazed hes reminiscent of schindler looking down on his kingdom his factory as he loves to do from his wall of glass
life is great
goeth reaches for a rifle
workers loading quarry rock onto trolleys under ukrainian guard and a low morning sun
every so often one glances with anticipation to the balcony of goeths villa which is in fact nothing more than a two story stone house perched on a slight rise
in the dry landscape
the butt of the rifle against his shoulder goeth aims down at the quarry at this worker at that one indiscriminately inscrutably
he fires a shot and a distant figure falls
the woman in bed groans at the echoing shot
shes used to it but she still hates it its such an awful way to be woken
she buries her head under a pillow
he pads to his bathroom goes inside and urinates
schindlers mercedes winds through the camp past warehouses and workshops trucks full of furs and furniture work details barracks guard blocks
a man standing alone wears a sign around his neck i am a potato thief
the mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on a driveway made of tombstones from the jewish cemetery
a patio table set with crystal china silver
goeth and hujar are there in pressed ss uniforms and two industrialists bosch and madritsch
one chair is empty
your machinery will be moved and installed by the ss at no cost to you
you will pay no rent no maintenance hujar glances off interrupted by schindlers arrival
although hes never been here the industrialist comes in like he owns the place
all but goeth rise
no no come on sit he works his way around the table patting bosch and madritsch on the back he knows them shaking hujars hand who he doesnt know
he reaches goeth
how you doing
goeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand
we started without you
schindler takes a seat shakes a napkin onto his lap nods to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him
goeth watches him
the others watch goeth
i miss anything important
i was explaining to mr
bosch and mr
madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into plaszow
oh good yeah
schindler clearly doesnt care but nods as though he did
goeth just watches him with what seems to be growing amusement
he nods to hujar to continue
since your labor is housed on site its available to you at all times
you can work them all night if you want
your factory policies whatever theyve been in the past theyll continue to be theyll be respected schindler laughs out loud cutting hujar off
hujar glances over to goeth nonplussed
hes not sorry at all and starts in on the plate of food thats set down in front of him
you know they told me you were going to be trouble czurda and scherner
goeth slowly shakes his head no
he looks great though doesnt he
i have to know where do you get a suit like that
what is that silk
schindler nods its great
id say id get you one but the guy who made it hes probably dead i dont know
he shrugs like those are the breaks too bad
goeth just smiles
the others watch the two of them unsure how theyre supposed to react
the others have gone
its just goeth and schindler now
goeth pours glasses of cognac
something wonderfuls happened do you know what it is
without planning it weve reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet
schindler nods pensively perhaps in agreement perhaps at some other thought
theres a silence broken finally by i go to work the other day theres nobody there
nobody tells me about this i have to find out i have to go in everybodys gone theyre not gone theyre here
his voice echoes into silence
an acquiescent shrug from goeth finally
and a nod schindlers right
every day that goes by im losing money
every worker that is shot costs me money i have to get somebody else i have to train them were going to be making so much money none of this
is going to matter cutting him off its bad business
shrugs some of the boys went crazy whatre you going to do
youre right its bad business but its over with its done
pause occasionally sure okay you got to make an example
but thats good business
schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle nurses it
hes in a foul mood
they study each other trying to determine perhaps whos more powerful
eventually scherner told me something else about you
yeah whats that
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude
that its not some vague thing with you like with some guys
goeth tries to put the situation in perspective you want to stay where you are
you got things going on the side things are good you dont want anybody telling you what to do i can understand all that
pause what you want is your own sub camp
schindler admits it by not disagreeing
goeth thinks about it nods to himself again then frowns
do you have any idea whats involved
the paperwork alone
forget you got to build it all getting the fucking permits thats enough to drive you crazy
then the engineers show up
they stand around and they argue about drainage im telling you youll want to shoot somebody ive been through it i know
well youve been through it
you could make things easier for me
goeth mulls it over his shrug saying maybe maybe not
a silence before id be grateful
theres the word goeth was waiting to hear
an ss surveyor with even paces measures a distance of the bare field adjacent to the factory
he sticks a little flag into the ground
a watchtower half erected the little flag still in the ground
laborers hammer at it while others roll out barbed wire fencing
a surveyor supervises the placement of a post and carefully measures its heights it has to be nine feet exactly
at a folding table in the middle of the field schindler signs checks made out to the construction office plaszow requisitioning more lumber cement and hardware
plaszow prisoners load the requisitioned building supplies the lumber cement and hardware onto trucks
the trucks parked not at schindlers sub camp but at the loading dock of goeths private warehouse in cracow
inside the building can be glimpsed all kinds of plaszow goods clothes food construction equipment furniture
checkbook laid out on the hood of his mercedes schindler pays for the requested materials a second time this time with a check made out to amon goeth personally and
hands it over to his bagman hujar
some ss architects groan over a set of blueprints
schindler and an ss officer walk by
you have the poles beat the czechs you have the czechs beat the poles that way everybody stays in line
all i have is jews
he shrugs too bad whatre you going to do
the ss guy has to think
yeah thats a problem
two huge leashed dogs yank another ss man across their path
as five hundred plaszow prisoners are marched back onto the grounds of d
any hope they may have had of a more lenient environment is quickly dashed
the place completed looks like a fortress barbed wire towers ss guards and dogs
where once they glimpsed the not too threatening figure of oskar schindler strolling through the factory the workers who dare glance up now find armed guards moving past
and further up behind the wall of windows schindler moving around entertaining ss officer
the rosner brothers in evening clothes leo on accordion henry on violin playing a strauss melody trying to keep it muted inoffensive
few of the guests pay attention which is fine with them
an ss officer chats with schindler
shes seventy years old shes been there forever they bomb her house
the furniture everything
well aware the man is lying thank god she wasnt there
schindler with yet another girl on his arm endures the officers lies while sweeping the room with his eyes
i was thinking maybe you could help her out
some plates and mugs some stew pots i dont know
say half a gross of everything
schindler looks at him for the first time knowingly
she run an orphanage your aunt
what she cant use maybe she can sell
schindlers girl excuses herself to get a drink
you want it sent directly to her or through you
through me i think
id like to enclose a card
schindler nods done
both watch his date across the room getting a drink
as usual shes the best looking on there
your wife must be a saint
whatever tolerance schindlers had up to this point with john leaves his face the looks he gives him now is pure contempt
goeths girl tonight a pole eighteen nineteen places a hand on schindlers sleeve
theyre at the important end of the large table with goeth along with czurda and leo john and their girlfriends
youre not a soldier
theres a picture
blanket around his shoulders over in kharkov
happened to whats his name up in warsaw and he was bigger than you oskar
happened to toebbens
himmler goes up to warsaw tells the armament guys get the fucking jews out of toebbens factory and put toebbens in the army and and sent him to the front
i mean the front
never happen in cracow though we all love you too much
i pay you too much
another round of laughs only this time its forced
everybody knows its true but you dont say it out loud and schindler knows better
goeth gives him a look theyll talk later
goeth finds schindler alone outside smoking a cigarette
schindler acknowledges him but thats about it
finally you held back stern
you held back the one man most important to my business
hes important to my business
what do you want for him ill give it to you
i want him
turning back come on lets go inside lets have a good time
goeth heads back inside
schindler stays outside finishing his cigarette
a folding table outside the prisoners barracks
at it playing cards two night sentries
a figure appears out of the darkness
he sets down on the table a fifth of vodka
stern summoned from his barracks watches as schindler digs through his coat pockets
nearby at the table drinking now the sentries
from the hill the villa the rosners music faint can be heard
he discreetly hands over to the accountant some cigars scavenged from the party
from another pocket he retrieves and hands over some tins of food all valuable commodities
from another pocket perhaps not so valuable but then who knows a gold lighter
regarding this last item this i dont know maybe you can trade it for something
schindler shrugs its the least i can do
the two stand around a moment more before schindler shrugs again sorry i cant do more
he reaches out pats stern on the shoulder and turning to leave
i got to go ill see you
oskar schindler comes back but out of embarrassment or maybe he wants to get back to the party waits with some impatience for stern to tell whatever it is he
wants to tell him
lowering his voice theres a guy
this thing happened
goeth came into the metalworks goeth moves through the crowded metalworks like a goodnatured foreman nodding to this worker wishing that one a good morning
he seems satisfied even pleased with the level of production
goldberg is with him
they reach a particular bench a particular worker and goeth smiles pleasantly
what are you making
not daring to look up all the worker sees of goeth is the starched cuff of his shirt
the rabbi turned metalworker gestures with his head to a pile of hinges on the floor
and in a tone more like a friend than anything else i got some workers coming in tomorrow
where the hell they from again
i got to make room
he shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch
make me a hinge
as goeth times him rabbi levartov works at making a hinge as though his life depended on it which it does cutting the pieces wrenching them together smoothing the edges
all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking away
he finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor
again the rabbi works feverishly cutting crimping sanding hearing the seconds ticking in his head and finishing in thirty five
goeth nods impressed
thats very good
what i dont understand though is youve been working since what about six this morning
yet such a small pile of hinges
he understands perfectly
so does levartov he has just crafted his own death in exactly seconds
goeth stands him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders
he pulls out his pistol puts it to the rabbis head and pulls the trigger
mumble christ annoyed goeth extracts the bullet magazine slaps it back in and puts the barrel back to the mans head
he pulls the trigger again
and again theres a click
god damn it he slams the weapon across levartovs face and the rabbi slumps dazed to the floor
looking up into goeths face he knows its not over
as goeth walks away tight on schindler a pensive nod then a shrug
the guy can turn out a hinge in less than a minute
why the long story
rabbi levartov brought over to d
works at a table with several others
as schindler strolls by the rabbi dares to speak thank you sir
schindler has to think a moment before he can figure out who the grateful man is
a dead chicken dangling from hujars hand evidence of some kind
goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or so men standing still silent in a row
nobody knows who stole the chicken
a man walks around with a chicken nobody notices this
no one confesses
goeth nods all right takes a rifle from a guard and shoots one of the workers at random
with this added incentive he waits for someone to tell him who stole the chicken
no one does
still nobody knows
he shrugs okay points the rifle at another worker and a boy of fourteen shuddering and weeping steps out of line
there we go
goeth goes over to the boy and like a distant relative to a small child tries to get him to look at his face
it was you
you committed this crime
you know who though
the boy nods weeps screams him
hes pointing at the dead man
and goeth astonishes the entire assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy
he returns the rifle to the guard and walks away
hujar stares after him then knowingly at the boy
a truck being loaded with supplies
schindler signs for it and appearing as rushed as he always does returns the clipboard to stern
yeah sure bring him over
schindler comes down the stairs with klonowska
as theyre crossing through the factory thank you sir
distracted thats okay
a mechanic peering under the hood of goeths adler
leaning in he accidentally knocks a wrench off the radiator into the fan and theres an awful clatter before the engine dies
the mechanic glances up horrified
as servants hoist a heavy elaborately tooled saddle from schindlers trunk a gift for goeth schindler sees stern coming toward him and glances skyward long sufferingly
the mechanic making adjustments to a metal press glances up as schindler moves past
thank yeah yeah yeah
across the street stands a nervous young woman in a faded dress
she seems to be trying to summon the courage to cross over and onto the factory grounds
just inside the factory she waits as a guard telephones schindlers office
she can see the wall of windows from where shes standing and schindler himself as he appears at it phone to his ear
he glances down at her disapprovingly and the guard hangs up
he wont see you
the woman alone in a dismal room pulling on nylon stockings
at a mirror she applies make up
she slips into a provocative dress
puts on heels
a parisian hat
and looks in the mirror
schindler waits for her on the landing of the stairs
he doesnt recognize her but smiles to counter the unfortunately possibility shes some old girlfriend hes forgotten
reaching him she offers her hand
how do you do
he can tell now she doesnt know him
he seems relieved
he leads her past klonowskas desk and into his office
he arranges a chair for her goes to his liquor cabinet
no thank you
he pours himself a drink warms it in his hands smiles clearly take with her
the grace with which shes carried herself up to this point seems to evaporate as she struggles to find the words she wants
they say that no one dies here
they say your factory is a haven
they say you are good
schindlers face changes like a wall going up a mask of indifference like in the portrait of adolf hitler on the wall behind him
who says that
schindler glances away from her
he seems weary suddenly depressed
my name is regina perlman not elsa krause
ive been living in cracow on false papers since the ghetto massacre
pause my parents are in plaszow
theyre killing old people in plaszow now
they bury them up in the forest
i have no money
i borrowed these clothes
will you bring them here
schindler glances back at her his face hard cold and studies her for a long long moment before i dont do that
youve been misled
i ask one thing whether or not a worker has certain skills
thats what i ask and thats what i care about get out of my office
she stares at him frightened and bewildered
she feels tears welling up
cry and ill have you arrested i swear to god
she hurries out
schindler barges into sterns office
in a foul and aggressive mood he dispenses with pleasantries in order to admonish the accountant people die its a fact of life
stern has hardly had time to look up from the work on his desk
he wants to kill everybody
what am i supposed to do bring everybody over
is that what you think
yeah send them over to schindler send them all
his place is a haven didnt you know
its not a factory its not an enterprise of any kind its a haven for people with no skills whatsoever
sterns look is all innocence but schindler knows better
you think i dont know what youre doing
youre so quiet all the time
with concern are you losing money
no im not losing money thats not the point
what other point is interrupts yells its dangerous
its dangerous to me personally
schindler tries to settle down
then you have to understand goeths under enormous pressure
you have to think of it in his situation
hes got this whole place to run hes responsible for everything that goes on here all these people hes got a lot of things to worry about
and hes got the war
which brings out the worst in people
never the good always the bad
always the bad
but in normal circumstances he wouldnt be like this
hed be all right
thered be just the good aspects of him
which is a wonderful crook
a guy who loves good food good wine the ladies making money
ill admit its a weakness
i dont think he enjoys it
pause all right he does enjoy it so what
what do you expect me to do about it
theres nothing you can do
im not asking you to do anything
you came into my office
but it isnt stern who needs convincing its schindler himself
its doubtful he even realizes this but its clear to stern
schindler sighs either at the predicament itself or at the fact that hes allowed stern to place him right in the middle of it
he turns to leave hesitates
he conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it perlman husband and wife
he unstraps his watch hands it to stern
give it to goldberg have him send them over
distant music brahms lullaby from the rosner brothers way down by the womens barracks calming the inhabitants
up here on the balcony schindler and goeth the latter so drunk he can barely stand up stare out over goeths dark kingdom
they dont fear us because we have the power to kill they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily
a man commits a crime he should know better
we have him killed we feel pretty good about it
or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better
thats not power though thats justice
thats different than power
power is when we have every justification to kill and we dont
thats what the emperors had
a man stole something hes brought in before the emperor he throws himself down on the floor he begs for mercy he knows hes going to die
and the emperor pardons him
this worthless man
he lets him go
it seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint this image schindler has brush stroked of the merciful emperor holds some appeal to goeth
perhaps as he stares out over his camp he imagines himself in the role wondering what the power schindler describes might feel like
eventually he glances over drunkenly and almost smiles
amon the good
a stable boy works to ready goeths horse before he arrives
he sticks a bridle into its mouth throws a riding blanket onto its back drags out the saddle schindler bought goeth
before he can finish though goeth is there
the boy tries to hide his panic he knows others have been shot for less
im sorry sir im almost done
oh thats all right
as goeth waits patiently it seems whistling to himself the stable boy tries to mask his confusion
goeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle
but everywhere he looks it seems hes confronted with stoop shouldered sloth
he forces himself to smile benevolently
goeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride
a worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway
i have to report sir ive been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub
goeth steps past him to take a look
the worker is almost shaking hes so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive
what are you using
the worker hasnt a defense for himself
goeths hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster
he stares at the worker
he so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it right here right in the bathroom put some more stains on the porcelain
he takes a deep breath to calm himself
then gestures grandly
go ahead go on leave
i pardon you
the worker hurries out with his pail and cloth
goeth just stands there for several moments trying to feel the power of emperors hes supposed to be feeling
but he doesnt feel it
all he feels is stupid
the worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa
he dares a glance back and at that moment a hand with a gun appears out the bathroom window and fires
the sentries at their little table again drinking schindlers vodka
nearby schindler and stern outside sterns barracks
the accountants tone is hushed if he didnt steal so much i could hide it
if hes steal with some discretion
goldberg delivers a stack of requisitions and invoices and leaves without a word
behind his desk stern takes a cursory look at them and shakes his head in dismay
stern comes in with the requisitions
now its goldbergs turn to shake his head in dismay he doesnt want to hear it there are fifteen thousand people here goeth says theres twenty five
there are fifteen
he wants to say sixteen seventeen all right maybe he can get away with it but ten thousand over
stern do me a favor get out of here
you want to argue about it go tell goeth
stern watches truck being unloaded of bags of flour rice and other supplies
goeth nods to hujar
hujar calls a halt
the workers climb down close up the trucks
and still half full the trucks rumble off
the ss auditors keep coming around looking over the books goeth knows this the trucks at the loading dock of goeths private warehouse
polish workers under hujars supervision throwing down the surplus bags of flour and rice the supplies for the phantom prisoners
youd think hed have the common sense to see whats coming
no he steals with complete impunity
they can see goeths villa up on the hill figures moving around behind the windows
theres another party going on up there
down here as he nurses a drink from his flask schindler thinks about what stern has told him and eventually shrugs fine fuck him
so youll be rid of him
but stern slowly shakes his head no
if plaszow is closed theyll have to send us somewhere else
where who knows
gross rosen maybe
theres the irony bad as it is evil as goeth is it could get worse
ill talk to him
i think its too late
well ill talk to somebody
ill take care of it
he hands over to stern some negotiable items and leaves
schindler and senior ss officers toffel and scherner share a table in same smoke filled nightclub they met in
whats he done thats so bad take money
thats a crime
come on what are we here for to fight a war
were here to make money all of us
theres taking money and theres taking money you know that
hes taking money
the place produces nothing
i shouldnt say that nothing it produces reaches the army
thats not all right
so ill talk to him about it
hes a friend of yours you want to help him out
tell me this though has he ever once shown you his appreciation
ive yet to see it
never a courtesy
never a thank you note
he forgets my wife at christmas time hes got no style we all know that
so we should hang him for it
hes stealing from you oskar
of course hes stealing from me were in business together
what is this
im sitting here suddenly everybodys talking like this is something bad
we take from each other we take from the army everybody uses everybody it works out everybodys happy
not like him
schindler glances away to the floor show nods to himself
glancing back again he considers the ss men with great sobriety
yeah well in some eyes it doesnt matter the amount we steal its that we do it
each of us sitting at this table
his thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither ss man
the air seems thicker suddenly
he doesnt deserve your loyalty
more important hes not worth you making threats against us
did i threaten anybody here
i stated a simple fact
the threat still stands despite schindlers assurance otherwise and they all know it
so does scherners threat back to him and they all know that too
but schindler just grins and glancing away come on lets watch the girls
in addition to the mid day soup and break there are bowls of fruit on the long work tables
at one of them several workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank schindler
in honor of schindlers birthday goeth has brought over stern and the rosners the musicians at the moment accompanying the best baritone in the ukrainian garrison
surrounded by his friends and lovers schindler cuts a cake
he receives congratulations from the many ss men present and the embraces in turn of ingrid and klonowska and goeth
from stern he gets a handshake
a jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly approaches the drunken group around schindler
the ss men consider her as a curiosity schindler as he would any beautiful girl
the music breaks and out of the silence comes a small nervous voice on behalf of the workers
i wish you a happy birthday
shes surrounded by ss uniforms and swastikas and holstered guns
schindler smiles this is a beautiful girl
he kisses her on the mouth
the smiles on the faces around them strain
stern glances to heaven
amon cocks his head like a confused dog
the kiss is broken finally and schindler smiles again with impunity
thank them for me
the girl backs away nodding anxiously all she wants now is out before someone her schindler both of them gets shot
henry rosner nudges leo and they begin another song
and the party tries to resume
were they not asleep in their barracks the prisoners would no doubt shudder at the sight the clerks are setting up their folding tables
other figures move around the parade ground in the murky dawn light these raising a banner those wheeling filing cabinets across the appellplatz this one wiring a phonograph that one
saturating a pad with ink from a bottle
goldberg lord of lists moves from table to table handing out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with the clerks
some men in white appear like ghosts
a doctors kid is opened a stethoscope removed
another cleans the lenses of his glasses
someone sharpens a pencil
a trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer whos slowly backing an empty cattle car along the tracks
it couples to another empty slatted car with a harsh clank
the needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked
the first scratchy note of a strauss waltz blare from the camp speakers
in his undershirt and shorts goeth calmly smokes his first cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting up from down below
down there on the appellplatz the entire population of the camp has been concentrated some fifteen thousand prisoners
though the music and banners struggle to evoke a country fair the presence of the doctors belie it
a sorting out process is going on here the healthy from the unhealthy
a physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several prisoners run back and forth naked before him
he makes his selections quickly this one into this line that one into that and goldberg moves them recording the names
other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors and clerks
notations are made and lines are formed
the sun beats down and the music lies
some still pulling their clothes back on the first wave of the unfit is marched onto the platform
a guard slides open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group climbs aboard
behind the camouflage of other women prisoners mila pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope of adding a little color to her skin
amon goeth his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up chats with one of the doctors as another group strips
whether the topic is this health aktion or the unseasonable weather is unclear but he nods approvingly
goeth glances up finds poldek among the group taking off their clothes
pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that asks do i really have to go through this and goeth turns to a clerk
pfefferberg is motioned away from the others hes okay he doesnt have to be put through this indignity
he calls out to the commandant again what about my wife
goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods yeah okay sure
a clerk accompanies pfefferberg and making a notation on the way finds mila
the sun is higher the cattle cars hotter
prisoners arms stretch out between the slats offering diamonds in exchange for a sip of water
the needle of the phonograph is set down on another record a childrens song mammi kauf mir ein pferdchen mommy buy me a pony
children are yanked from the arms of their parents
wailing protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards
revolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire
music shots wails
guards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the rafters pulling planks from the floor upending cots looking for some children
a small figure in red sprints across to another barracks past it to a crude wooden structure beyond it
an arm held out to either side the small girl lowers herself into a pit into which men have defecated
she works her way slowly down trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul walls ignoring the flies invading her ears her nostrils
reaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge then her ankles her shins her knees before finally touching harder ground
as she struggles to slow her breathing her racing heart she hears a hallucinatory murmur this is our place
she sees eyes in the darkness five other children are already there
waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars
inside those who failed the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled
schindlers mercedes pulls up
he climbs out and stares transfixed
he notices goeth then standing with the other industrialists bosch and madritsch and strolls over to them
i tried to call you im running a little late this is taking longer than i thought
have a drink
whats going on
i got a shipment of hungarians coming in i got to make room for them
its always something
he glances away at the train
the idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars
theyre complaining now
they dont know what complaining is
schindler watches as another car is loaded
its like theyre climbing into an oven
what do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars
goeth stares at him blankly then with a what will you think of next
kind of look then laughs uproariously and calls over to hujar bring the fire trucks
hujar heard him he just doesnt get it
finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it
stream of water cascade onto the scalding rooftops
the fire trucks are there the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude
this is really cruel oskar youre giving them hope
you shouldnt do that thats cruel
and amusing not just to goeth but to the other ss officers standing around as well
oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen
at full extension apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars
he returns to goeth
ive got some meter hoses back at d
we can reach the cars down at the end
goeth finds this especially sidesplitting and hollers hujar
hoses have arrived and are being coupled to plaszows
as the water drenches the cars further back the people inside loudly voice their thanks and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle
what does he think hes saving them from
the joke takes on new dimension when from the back of the d
trucks boxes of food are unloaded
accompanied by the laughter of the ss schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats
oh my god
goeth is almost hysterical
but slowly then slowly the amusement on his face fades
his friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless ss men laughing or not is not just behaving recklessly here its as though
he were possessed
the water rains down on the last car
a german staff car pulls in across the factory gate blocking it
two gestapo men climb out
the girl who brought schindler best wishes on his birthday glances up from her work to the gestapo crossing through the factory
they climb the stairs to the upstairs offices and moments later appear behind schindlers wall of glass
schindler leaning against his desk drink in his hand calmly tries to assess his humorless arresters
im not saying youll regret it but you might
i want you to be aware of that
well risk it
schindler glances beyond them to a point outside his office to klonowska
she nods she knows what to do shell make the phone calls call in the favors
all right sure its a nice day ill go for a drive with you guys
he snuffs out his cigarette
settled comfortably in the backseat schindler glances idly out the window
as the car makes a turn though he looks back
apparently he expected it to turn the other way
where are we going
the guys up front dont answer
concern for the first time registers on schindlers face
the car approaches a building block long with an ominous sameness to the windows
schindler is made to empty his pockets his money cigarettes everything
around him clerks speak in whispers as if raised voices might set off head splitting echoes along the narrow monotonous corridors
hes led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel
hes taken past darkened cells
past shadowy figures crouched in corners and on the floor
a water bucket
a waste bucket
this is not a cell for dignitaries this arrest is different
schindler incongruous with the dank surroundings in his double breasted suit slowly paces back and forth before his cellmate a soldier who looks like hes been here forever his greatcoat
pulled up around his ears for warmth
i violated the race and resettlement act
though i doubt they can point out the actual provision to me
pause i kissed a jewish girl
schindler forces a smile
his cellmate just stares
now theres a crime much more impressive much more serious than his own
in a stiff backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of racial improprieties amon goeth
to an impassive ss colonel behind a desk goeth tries to highlight extenuating circumstances he likes women
he likes good looking women
he sees a good looking woman he doesnt think
this guy has so many women
they love him
hes married hes got all these women
all right she was jewish he shouldnt have done it
but you didnt see this girl
i saw this girl
this girl was very good looking
goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk but his face is like a wall
they cast a spell on you you know the jews
you work closely with them like i do you see this
they have this power its like a virus
some of my men are infected with this virus
they should be pitied not punished
they should receive treatment because this is as real as typhus
i see this all the time
goeth shifts in his chair he knows hes not getting anywhere with this guy
he switches tacts its a matter of money
we can discuss that
thatd be all right with me
in the silence that follows goeth realizes he has made a serious error in judgment
this man sitting soberly before him is one of that rare breed the unbribable official
youre offering me a bribe
no no please come on
suddenly the man stands up and salutes which thoroughly confuses goeth since goeth is his inferior in rank
but he isnt saluting goeth hes saluting the officer who has just stepped into the room behind him
the colonel sits back down
scherner pulls up a chair next to goeth
scherner smiles and allows goeth to shake his hand but its clear even to goeth himself that he has fallen from grace
a tall thin gray waffen ss officer has a request for the rosner brothers
i want to hear gloomy sunday again
hes drunk morose it seems unlikely hell be on his feet much longer
indeed as henry and leo rosner begin the son an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits suicide for love the field officer staggers over to a chair
in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it
we give you jewish girls at five marks a day oskar you should kiss us not them
goeth laughs too loud drawing a weary glance from scherner
schindler smiles good naturedly
hes out a little worse for wear perhaps a little more subdued than usual
taking him away from the others taking him into his confidence god forbid you ever get a real taste for jewish skirt
theres no future in it
they dont have a future
and thats not just good old fashioned jew hating talk
its policy now
the thin gray ss officer is back in front of the musicians swaying precariously a drink in his hand gloomy sunday again
again they play the song
again he staggers across the crowded room to his chair in the corner paying no attention to the visiting commandant from treblinka or anybody else we can process at treblinka
if everything is working
i dont know maybe two thousand units a day
he shrugs like its nothing or with modesty its unclear
goeth is dully impressed schindler only politely so
now youre talking
what i got is nothing its like a
auschwitz though now theres a death factory
there they know how to do it
there they know what theyre doing
again the gray officer wavering before henry and leo
this time they dont wait for him to ask for it gloomy sunday as the man stumbles back to his chair the rosners not only play the song again they
play with it and him this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost gratefully wrenching from the song all the sentimentality they can as if they could actually drive him to kill himself
no one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on between them this man and this music which the brothers play as if it were an invocation
eventually though someone does become aware if not of the intention at least of the repetition and interrupts the spell enough jesus god the music falls apart
the brothers find goeth in the crowd looking at them like come on for christs sake play something else
which they do defeated some innocuous von suppe
goeth turns back to one of his guests
glancing back as they play to the corner the rosners see the gloomy ss officer getting slowly up from his chair
he stands there for a moment staring at nothing then slowly makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the night air absolutely still in silhouette to
and ruining a perfectly good party he takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head
from a distance schindler can be seen arguing with an ss officer whos trying to hand him papers orders of some kind which the irate industrialist refuses to accept
here closer carrying blankets and bundles schindlers workers are marched under heavy guard out of the factory and its annexes and across the fortified yard
his people are being taken
where is unclear
schindler abruptly breaks off the discussion with the ss man climbs into his car and drives off
a creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella of trees
leo john and his five year old son on their knees catching tadpoles seem unaware of or at least not distracted by a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them bodies
being exhumed out of the earth out of the mass graves in the forest
the dead lay everywhere victims of the ghetto massacre victims of plaszow
arriving schindler sees goeth standing up at the tree line
approaching him furious he hesitates
he sees a wheelbarrow trundled by pfefferberg a corpse in it
he fears the body is milas but then sees her trundling another barrow another corpse in it
goeth calls to schindler can you believe this
goeth shakes his head dismayed
schindler joins him and stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging workers layer upon layer
im trying to live my life they come up with this
i got to find every body buried up here
and burn it
its always something
he glances off
the pyre has reached the height of a mans shoulder
the workers move around it dousing it with gasoline
you took my workers
indignant theyre taking mine
when i said they didnt have a future i didnt mean tomorrow
i dont know
he sighs at the unfairness of it all the dissolution of his kingdom
his glance finds his man leo john over at the stream
this is good
im out of business and hes catching tadpoles with his son
tight on the gleeful boy with a tadpole in his hand
behind him smoke from the pyre rises into the sky
schindler in silhouette against the wall of glass stares down at his deserted factory his silent machines the dark empty spaces
light pouring in through the windows
white sheets over the furniture like shrouds over the dead
schindlers personal things are gone
schindlers mercedes the backseat piled high with suitcases
a border guard returns his passport to him
the barrier is lifted and he crosses into czech countryside
a church in the main square of a sleepy hamlet
a priest and his parishioners including emilie schindler emerging from it morning mass over
some guys outside a bar cafe hanging gout drinking notice the elegantly dressed gentleman outside the towns only hotel
they recognize him
they come over
hey how you doing
look at this
schindler the clothes the car the suitcases the great difference between their respective stations in life
somehow their old neer do well friend has managed to do quite well and it amazes them
across the square emilie has noticed him and he her
but neither makes a move toward the other
finally she walks away which schindler interprets correctly to mean yes check into the hotel
he tips the porter extravagantly and turns back to the guys from the bar
let me buy you a drink
except for the clothes of the working class clientele the scene is reminiscent of the ss nightclub in cracow schindler the great entertainer working his way around the tables making
sure everybodys got enough to drink making sure everybodys happy
a guy at a table with a girl gestures him over
oskar my friend lena
how do you do
to them both what can i get you whatre you drinking
then again something has changed hasnt it
things worked out
i made some money over there had some laughs you know
it was good
now youre back
now im back and you know what im going to do now
im going to have a good time
so are you
he gestures to the bartender to refill his friends and his dates drinks pats the guy on the shoulder and wanders over to the next table
who is he
the guy has to think not because he doesnt know but because his old friend oskar is so many things its hard to know which description to use
finally hes a salesman
a woman asleep in the bed
the girl from the bar
in his robe at the window schindler calmly smokes as he stares out at the night the town off in the distance nestled against the mountains
the sun just coming up
closer here ramshackle structures a long abandoned factory of some kind
schindler in leather riding gear climbs down off a moto guzzi motorcycle
he slowly wanders around peers in through broken windows wanders around some more
tight on his face torn between conflicting choices or realizing theres no choice or only one choice and hating it
schindler and goeth on the balcony of the villa drinking
you want these people
these people my people i want my people
goeth considers his friend greatly puzzled
below them lies the camp still operating at least for now until the shipments can be arranged
what are you moses
what is this
wheres the money in this
whats the scam
its good business
oh this is good business in your opinion
youve got to move them the equipment everything to czechoslovakia it doesnt make any sense
look youre not telling me something
its good for me i know them im familiar with them
its good for you youll be compensated
its good for the army
you know what im going to make
they need that
goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe
hes sure schindlers got something else going on here hes not telling him
youre probably scamming me somehow
if im making a hundred you got to be making three
schindler admits it with a shrug
if you admit to making three then its four actually
i just told you
you did but you didnt
goeth studies him searching for the real answer in his face
he cant find it
yeah all right dont tell me ill go along with it its just irritating to me i cant figure it out
all you have to do is tell me what its worth to you
whats a person worth to you
goeth thinks about it in the silence
then a slow nod to himself
hes going to make some money out of this even if he cant figure it out
whats one worth to you
thats the question
the keys of a typewriter slapping a name onto a list levartov the letters the size of buildings the sound as loud as gunshots tight on the face of a
man rabbi levartov the hinge maker goeth tried to kill with a faulty revolver the keys hammer another name perlman tight on two elderly faces a man a woman the parents of elsa krause
in his small cluttered plaszow office stern transcribes d
workers names from a reich labor office document to the list in his typewriter schindlers list
tight on schindler slowly pacing the six or seven steps sterns cramped office allows nursing a drink
the keys typing pfeffe pfefferbergs face tight
milas face tight
currency hard reichmarks in a small valise
as goeth looks at it he mumbles to himself a virus
moving down the list of names forty fifty
the sound of the keys
stern pulls the sheet out of the machine rolls in another types a name
equipment being loaded onto trucks outside madritschs plaszow factory
you can do the same thing im doing
theres nothing stopping you
madritsch is shaking his head no to schindlers appeal to make his own list to get his workers out
ive done enough for the jews
the keys typing another name a face a man a face a woman a face a child cognac spilling into a glass
the glass coming up to schindlers mouth hesitating there
a name a face one of the original d
another name another face another of the jewish investors
all of them
szerwitz his family
stern glances up with a look that asks schindler if hes sure about this one
the keys type szerwitz tight on the face of the investor who stole from schindler the one he threatened to have killed by the ss and the faces of his
sons three or four pages of names next to the typewriter
stern trying to count them estimates four hundred four fifty more
the trunk of schindlers mercedes yawning open
he takes a small valise from it and heads for goeths villa
the keys typing rosner tight on henry rosner the violinist
tight on his brother leo the accordionist
schindler and bosch the other plaszow industrialist
the same appeal schindler made to madritsch the same answer no
moving down another page of names
about six hundred more
the sound of the keys over the face of a boy the chicken thief
over the face of a girl the one who hid in the pit of excrement
over the faces weve never seen
eight hundred give or take
angrily give or take what stern how many count them
stern runs his finger down the pages of names trying to count them more precisely
blackjack dealt by goeth
theyre betting diamonds he and schindler
a queen falls and goeth groans his misfortune
the face of goeths maid
goeth sweeps his hold card against the table is thrown a four sweeps it again and gets a jack
a name we dont recognize is typed
a face we dont recognize
schindler leafing through the page of names counting them drinking to the sound of the typewriter
eventually quietly to himself thats it
stern heard him and stops typing glances over
you can finish that page
stern resumes where he left off but then hesitates again
theres something he doesnt understand
what did goeth say
you just told him how many you needed
it doesnt sound right
and schindler doesnt answer
hes avoided telling stern the details of the deal struck with goeth and balks telling him now
finally awkwardly im buying them
im paying him
i give him money he gives me the people
pause if you were still working for me id expect you to talk me out of it its costing me a fortune
stern had no idea
and has no idea now what to say
schindler shrugs like its no big deal but stern knows it is
give him the list hell sign it hell get the people ready
i have to go back to brinnlitz to take care of things on that end ill see you there
stern is really overcome by what this man is doing
what he cant figure out is why
and then finish the page
stern turns back does as hes told
nothing but the sound of the typewriter keys
and then nothing at all
the page is done
the rest will die
schindler in front of a large assembly party pin in his lapel as usual imposing ss guards on either side of him
this is my home
he looks out over his audience the citizens of brinnlitz local government officials many of them appearing bewildered by him or the situation that has arisen
i was born here my wife was born here my mother is buried here this is my home
his estranged wife is there
so are the guys he was drinking with
do you really think id bring a thousand jewish criminals into my home
everyone seems to breathe sighs of relief as if theyve been waiting for him to say this to dispel the disturbing rumors theyve heard
these are skilled munitions workers they are essential to the war effort the noise begins his audiences angry reaction
raising pitch of his own voice it is my duty to supervise them and it is your duty to allow me he barely gets it all out before the protests
drown him out
the uproar reaches such a clamoring level theres no point in his continuing
goeth at his writing desk endures the bureaucratic tedium of signing memoranda transport orders requisitions
he comes to schindlers list initials each page and signs the last with no more interest than the others
he hands the whole stack of paperwork to marcel goldberg personnel clerk executor of lists gangster
goldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter
he carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space allowed by the bottom margin
at a folding table in the middle of the field schindler signs his name to reich main office directives evacuation board and department of economy form armaments contracts
around him the new camp is taking shape electric fences are going up watchtowers barracks shipments of heavy equipment huge hilo machines are being off loaded from flatbed train cars
ss engineers stand around frowning at the lay of the land some drainage problem no doubt
a train full of people destined for auschwitz pulls away from the platform
as goldberg gathers his paperwork a prisoner approaches him
am i on the list
what list is that
he knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he knows
he means schindlers list
the good list
well that depends doesnt it
the prisoner knows that too and discreetly turns over to goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat
names on a notepad the first few crossed out
goldberg types the next name onto a page of the list squeezing it into the upper margin and crosses that one out on the pad
he rolls the page down types another name tires of the exacting task tears the handwritten page of names from the notepad crumples it and throws it away
schindler on his way back to his hotel after a night of drinking is jumped by three guys wrestled to the ground and brutally kicked
as the forms of his attackers move away he catches a glimpse of one of them his friend who admired his car when he first arrived back in town
pfefferberg his head under the hood of a german staff car adjusting the carburetor
goldberg comes in
hey poldek hows it going
pfefferberg ignores him you know about the list
youre on it
of course im on it
you want to stay on it
what do you got for me
pfefferberg glances up from his work and studies the blackmailing collaborator for a long moment
what do i got for you
takes diamonds to stay on this list
pfefferberg suddenly attacks him with the wrench in his hand beating him across the shoulders and head with it
ill kill you thats what i got for you
goldberg goes down tries to scramble away on his knees the blows coming down hard on his back
all right all right all right
he makes it outside the garage and runs
a cattle car is coupled to another the pin dropped into place
on the platform clerks at folding tables shuffle paper while others mill around with clipboards calling out names
thousands of prisoners on the platform some climbing onto strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks
some already in them most standing in lines changing lines the end of one virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another
lists of names
pens in hands checking them off
some bound for brinnlitz the rest for auschwitz if they can be properly sorted from one another
a boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father his mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls
this segregation is the only recognizable process going on the others if they exist are apparent only to the clerks and guards and maybe not even to them
it is chaos
a train snakes across the dark landscape
stern wedged into a corner of an impossibly crowded car
this train may be headed for schindlers hometown but it is no more comfortable than the others on their way to auschwitz birkenau
the train idles at a crossing in the middle of nowhere
moving across the faces peering out from between the slats it becomes apparent there are only male prisoners aboard
below on a dirt road a lone polish boy stands watching
just before an empty train roars past from the other direction obscuring him his hand comes up and across his neck making the gesture of a throat being slit
the train pulls into the small quiet brinnlitz station
the doors are opened and the prisoners begin climbing down
at the far end of the platform flanked by several ss guards stands schindler
to his customary elegant attire he has added a careless accouterment a tyrolean hat
leading a procession of nine hundred male jewish criminals through the center of town schindler ignores the angry taunts and denouncements and the occasional rock hurled by the good citizens
of brinnlitz lining the streets
under the towering hilo machines a meal of soup and bread awaits the workers
as theyre sitting down to it schindler addresses them youll be interested to know i received a cable this morning from the personnel office plaszow
the women have left
they should be arriving here sometime tomorrow
he sees stern among the workers smiles almost imperceptibly turns and walks away
a train backs slowly along the tracks toward an arched gatehouse
the women inside the cattle cars dont need a sign to tell them where they are theyve seen this place in nightmares
pillars of dark smoke rise from the stacks into the sky
the stunned women climb down from the railcars onto an immense concourse bisecting the already infamous camp
as theyre marched across the muddy yard by guards carrying truncheons mila pfefferberg stares at the place
it so big like a city only one in which the inhabitants reside strictly temporarily
to mila under her breath where are the clerks
so often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now as though there remains no further reason
to record their names
milas eyes return to the constant smoke rising beyond the birch trees at the settlements western end
schindler comes out of his office and passing sterns desk mumbles theyre in auschwitz
before stern can react schindler is out the door
as he strides across the factory courtyard toward his motorcycle schindler is intercepted by some gestapo men who have just emerged from their car
your friend amon goeth has been arrested
pause im sorry to hear that
there are some things that are unclear
we need to talk
id love to itll have to wait until i get back
i have to leave
the looks on their faces tell him hes not going anywhere
all right okay lets talk
i cant go to breslau
these guys are serious
a young silver haired doctor moves slowly along rows of schindlers women considering each with a pleasant smile even as he makes his selections with tiny gestures for the death
he pauses in front of one
how old are you mother
she could lie and hed have killed her for it
she could tell the truth and hed have her killed for that too
pause sir a mistakes been made
were not supposed to be here we work for oskar schindler
were schindler jews
the doctor nods pensively understandingly it seems
then and who on earth is oskar schindler
he glances around hopelessly
one of the ss guards who accompanied the women from plaszow speaks up he had a factory in cracow
the doctor nods again as if the information were valuable as if it meant something to him
he smiles to himself and gets on with the examination this woman to this line this other one to that
in a dank cell in uniform amon goeth waits
schindler is on his way hopefully
maybe hes already here
schindler will vouch for him
schindler will straighten this out
in a large room schindler sits before a panel of twelve sober bureau v investigators and a judge of the ss court
everything you say will be held in confidence
you are not under investigation
you are not under investigation
he is being held on charges of embezzlement and racketeering
youre here at his request to corroborate his denials
our information onto his financial speculations comes from many sources
on his behalf there is only you
we know you are close friends
we know this is hard for you
but we must ask you he stole our country blind
in schindlers absence the workers attempt to operate the unfamiliar machines to figure out the unfamiliar process of manufacturing artillery shells
theres movement theres noise the machines are running but little is being produced
untersturmfuhrer jose liepold the commandant of schindlers new subcamp moves through the factory conducting an impromptu inspection
he points out to a guard a kid no more nine sorting casings at a work table and another boy ten or eleven carrying a box
mila and another woman cross back toward their barracks carrying a large heavy pot of broth
not more than a hundred meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria the smoke pluming even now at night out of the darkness appear apparitions skeletal figures which surround
the two women or rather the soup pot between them dipping little metal cups into it over and over
too startled to speak mila can only stare
the apparitions clamor around the pot a moment more than furtively slip back into the same darkness from which they came
mila and the other woman exchange a glance
the pot is empty
wheres schindler now
in his en over cognac auschwitz commandant rudolf hoss considers the documents schindler has brought the list the travel papers the evacuation board authorization
hoss nods at them then at schindler
youre right a clerical error has bee made
pause let me offer you this in apology for the inconvenience
i have a shipment coming in tomorrow ill cut you three hundred from it
these are fresh
schindler seems to think about the offer as he nurses his drink
the train comes we turn it around its yours
i appreciate it
i want these
the ones on the list in hoss hand
then you shouldnt get stuck on names
why because you get to know them
because you begin to see them as human beings
schindler suddenly has the awful feeling that the women are already dead
hoss misinterprets the look
thats right it creates a lot of paperwork
a large assembly of women
guards calling out names from a list
as each woman steps out of line a guard unceremoniously brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes
new columns are formed
schindler standing at the end of the platform stone faced watches the women whose names he is stuck on whose clothes are slashed with red paint climbing onto the cattle
as the cars fill a train on another track arrives
the fresh ones schindler turned down
as the gates are closed on the womens cars the gates of the others are opened and the people spill out
a horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the engines
one of schindlers women locked in has seen her son among those coming down off the train on the opposing track
another cry erupts and another another as the women spot their children confiscated from the brinnlitz factory brought here
schindler becomes aware of whats happening and passing over other children tries to corral these particular boys many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing their tortured
cries with their own
schindler manages to gather them together the fifteen or twenty boys and in the middle of the crowded platform appears to a guard these are mine
theyre on the list
these are my workers
they should be on the train
he points across to the womens train then down to the boys
theyre skilled munition workers
the guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious brook around him
these are essential workers
schindler is nodding his head trying to think
the women are shrieking their sons names
the guard who heard it all every excuse imaginable is just turning away when schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him
they polish the insides of shell casings
how else do you expect me to polish the inside of a millimeter shell casing
the guard stares at him dumbly
this he hasnt heard
like a mirage in the distance they appear the women the children guards schindler marching across a field toward the factory
at the perimeter of the camp at the wire the men watch the approaching procession
it appears to them that the women are covered in blood or could it be paint
theyre walking theyre fine some are even smiling
liepold isnt smiling
neither is schindler at least not on the outside
the machines are silent the people are not
women are in their husbands arms sons in their fathers
theres food on the tables but its largely ignored the reunion taking precedence
schindler stands before the assembled camp guards
they are seated at the long tables their food getting cold waiting for him to say whatever it is he has to say
under department w provisions it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause
under the businesses compensation fund i am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths
if you shoot without thinking you go to prison and i get paid thats how it works
so there will be no summary executions here
there will be no interference of any kind with production
in hopes of ensuring that guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization
his eyes meet liepolds hold his icy stare then return to the guards most of whom look like tired middle aged reservists
for your cooperation you have my gratitude
as he steps away he gestures to some kitchen workers
they tear open cases of schnapps and begin setting the bottles out on the tables
schindler strolls through his factory looking over the shoulders of the workers nodding his approval
the place is in full operation finally the people having figured out the complicated hilos turning out shells by the caseload
schindler pauses at one of the machines
hows it going
its taken a while to calibrate the machines but its going good now
he leans down and taps at the crystal of one of the gauges
this isnt right is it
the worker kneels down takes a look
it looks right to him
reaching over schindler changes the calibration of the machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob and all the gauge readings shift
that looks right
he wanders off
the worker stares after him
hes just screwed up settings that took weeks to get right
schindler comes up to another worker levartov the hingemaker
hes at a machine buffing shells
hows it going rabbi
schindler nods watches him work eventually glances away
suns going down
levartov following schindlers gaze nods uncertainly
it is friday isnt it
you should be preparing for the sabbath shouldnt you
what are you doing here
levartov just stares
its been years since hes been allowed indeed inclined to perform sabbath rites
ive got some wine in my office
why dont we go over there ill give it to you
come on lets go
schindler heads off
the rabbi keeps staring
schindler gestures back to him offering casually come on
levartov looks around
finally he hangs up his goggles and follows after schindler
under the shadow of a watchtower among the roof high tiers of bunks strung with laundry levartov recites kiddush over a cup of wine to workers gathered around him
on their bunks the guards relax with schnapps cards and magazines
one of them becomes distracted by a distant sound
some of the others begin to hear it
what is that
the barracks gradually becomes quiet silent all the guards straining to hear
it sounds like
it sounds like yiddish singing
on a watchtower a night sentry unsure where its coming from listens to the distant singing
it seems like its emanating from the surrounding hills from the trees
at his small desk liepold is typing a letter denouncing schindler most likely
the pounding keys bury all other sounds but when he pauses to reread what hes typed he hears it the singing faint far away
he goes to his window peers out listens for a moment more then hears nothing
only the night creatures
the door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing emilie schindler
she coolly considers the visitor on her doorstep her estranged husband looking great as usual bottle of wine in his hand smiling as if nothing is wrong between them as
if nothing is wrong in the entire world
the two of them at the kitchen table in a modest apartment drinking at least he is
hes trying to ask her something but hes not sure how to put it he wants to get it right
finally the words just tumble out i want you to come work for me
there hes said it
but the bewildered look on emilies face wonders thats what was hard for you to say
you dont have to live with me i wouldnt ask that
pause its a nice place
youd like it
it looks awful
you get used to that
shes the only woman hes even known who could make him nervous just sitting across a table from him saying nothing
all right now hell be honest we can spend time together that way
we can see each other see how it goes without the strain of whatever you want to call it when a man a husband and a wife go out to
dinner go have a drink go to a party you know
this way well see each other at work there we are same place we see how it goes
his voice trails off
a shrug adds what do you think
she doesnt answer but she does love him
he loves her too
it really is a shame theyre not right for each other and never will be
stern glances up from his work schindler and emilie have come in and are walking toward the accountants desk
he gets up
itzhak stern emilie schindler
like the doormen and waiters of cracow stern too never imagined schindler was married and has trouble hiding his astonishment now
he extends his hand to her
how do you do
how do you do
stern is my accountant and friend
it sounds strange to stern hearing schindler actually say it
hes never said it before
emilies offered to work in the clinic
hes not sure what shes going to do there shes not a nurse or a doctor
to her thats very generous of you
schindler nods looks around shrugs offers his arm to his wife perhaps to take her on a tour of the place
it was a pleasure meeting you
pleasure meeting you
the schindlers leave
stern sits back down at his desk and smiles
hes never seen schindler so uncomfortable
schindler comes in carrying a radio
he sets it down on a bench where pfefferbergs working on the frame of a machine motor with a blow torch
can you fix it
whats wrong with it
how should i know
see what you can do
pfefferberg plugs it into an outlet and switches it on
it works perfectly
in a male barracks a group of workers including pfefferberg huddle in a corner around the radio straining to hear through heavy static a broadcast by the bbc the voice
of london a sketchy report of an eastern offensive by allied russian forces
as a camp doctor attends to sufferers of dysentery schindler and emilie sort pairs of prescription glasses from a parcel shipped from cracow
stern comes in
we need to talk
schindler sifts through the glasses still in the box comes up with a particular pair and holds them proudly
not quite sure what hes seeing is real they arrived
they arrived can you believe it
stern allows himself a smile a rare thing for him
schindler carefully slips the new glasses onto the accountants face
he looks around the clinic stern eventually settling on emilie crystal clear standing near a picture on the wall which in other circumstances hed find less than reassuring jesus his
heart exposed and in flames
in a quiet corner of the clinic schindler concentrates on the disquieting news stern has brought him weve received a complaint from the armaments board
a very angry complaint
the artillery shells the tank shells rocket casings apparently all of them have failed quality control tests
schindler nods soberly
then dismisses the problem with a shrug
well thats to be expected
they have to understand
these are start up problems
this isnt pots and pans this is a precise business
ill write them a letter
theyre withholding payment
so would i
so would you
i wouldnt worry about it
well get it right one of these days
but stern is worried about it
theres a rumor youve been going around miscalibrating the machines
schindler doesnt deny it i dont think thats a good idea
stern slowly shakes his head no
they could close us down
schindler eventually nods in agreement it seems
call around find out where we can buy shells and buy them
well pass them off as ours
sterns not sure he sees the logic
whether the shells are manufactured here or elsewhere theyll still eventually reach their intended destination into the hearts and heads of germanys enemies
i know what youre saying but i dont see the difference
i see a difference
youll lose money
thats one difference
fewer shells will be made
thats another difference
the main one
the only one schindler cares about
then stern if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired
ill be very unhappy
a nineteen year old boy with his hands in the air stands terrified before commandant liepold and the revolver he wields
workers trying to reduce the likelihood of getting hit by a stray bullet when liepold fires on the boy which seems a certainty scramble out of the way
liepold swings the gun around at the voice pointing it for a moment at schindler who is striding toward him then aims the barrel back at the boys head and
yells department w does not forbid my presence on the factory floor
that is a lie
he waves a document at schindler throws it at him
schindler doesnt bother picking it up
instead pointing at the boy he yells to liepold shoot him
liepold is so startled by the command he doesnt shoot
he doesnt lower the gun though either
shoot him without a hearing
his finger is on the trigger liepold is torn frustrated hating the situation he has created
as the moments without a blast stretch out both and schindler begin to settle down
he sabotaged the machine
schindler glances to the boy
then at the silent hilo beside him
part of it is blackened from an electrical fire
to the boy concerned the machines broken
the boy too terrified to speak nods
the prisoner is under the jurisdiction of section d
ill preside over the hearing
but the machine
liepold glances to him
he seems almost distraught by the destruction of the machine schindler
the machine is under the authorization of the armaments inspectorate
i will preside over the hearing
liepold isnt sure thats correct but he has no documentation at least not on him to refute it
in the machine tool section a judicial table has been set up
at it sit schindler liepold two other ss officers and an attractive german girl a stenographer
the saboteur the boy janek stands before the court
im unfamiliar with the hilo machines
i dont know why i was assigned there
commandant liepold was watching me trying to figure it out
i switched it on and it blew up
i didnt do anything
all i did was turn it on
gone tonight is schindlers usual shop floor familiarity
he studies the boy solemn faced
if youre not skilled at armaments work you shouldnt be here
im a lathe operator
schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his hand and gets up
he comes around and paces slowly before the boy
eventually janek dares to speak again sir
schindler glances up at him distractedly
i did adjust the pressure controls
schindler stops looks to the panel and back to the boy
i know that much about them
somebody had set the pressure controls wrong
i had to adjust schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across janeks face the boy almost falls
so are the others at the table
theyve never seen such violence from the direktor
he roars the stupidity of these people
i wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine
schindlers hand comes up again and janek recoils expecting another blow
schindler manages to hold it
get him out of my sight
a guard escorts the prisoner away
the panel members glance among themselves
is that it
schindler faces them and groans in dismay
liepold at his desk typing again
this time there is no doubt he is composing a letter denouncing schindler
schindler and emilie her arm in his stand around like unwanted guests at the party
they probably are
the other guests include local politicians who fought and failed to keep his camp out of brinnlitz
whenever his glance meets one of theirs they smile tightly
to emilie isnt this nice
its not at all nice
he feels out of place a feeling hes not accustomed to
fortunately a man in uniform someone schindler can relate to approaches cheerfully his hand outstretched
oskar good of you to come
are you kidding i never miss a party
police chief rasch my wife emilie
how do you do
you have a lovely home
it is nice
the man lives well
i need a drink
oh god you dont have a drink
to emilie wine
schindler goes off in search of the bartender
rasch watches after him
your husbands a very generous man
wry hes always been
rasch and schindler sharing cognac in the privacy of the police chiefs study
beyond the closed doors the party continues the sounds filtering in
i need guns
rasch calmly nurses his drink his eyes revealing nothing of whats going on behind them except that the statement requires some elaboration
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate
id like the chance to defend myself
id like my wife to have that chance
my civilian engineers
pause then philosophically were losing the war arent we
it kind of looks that way
pistols rifles carbines
long pause id be grateful
rasch smiles faintly
yes hes familiar as are officials throughout much of europe with the gratitude of oskar schindler
poldek pfefferberg holds up a pistol feels its weight points it
pfefferberg smiles lowers the gun kneels beside an open crate of weapons a couple of revolvers and rifles an old carbine
from high above the factory stern can be seen among the machines talking with a worker
the man points up and returns to his work
stern stares up puzzled
he locates a ladder that connects the shop floor to a series of overhead planks and with trepidation climbs
he reaches a shaky landing high above the machines navigates the primitive catwalks with great care comes to a large water tank near the workshop ceiling
above the rim of the tank amid rising steam schindlers head appears
stern climbs a set of rungs on the tank reaches the top and finds inside lolling in the steaming water schindler and the blonde stenographer from the trial
neither schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit embarrassed
he tries hard to pretend the girl isnt there but he just cant
ill talk to you later
no no what what is it
schindler floats over closer to him waits for him to report whatever it is he has come to report leans closer
finally quietly do you have any money i dont know about
hidden away someplace
schindler thinks long and hard
silence except for the gently lapping water
half joking why am i broke
stern glances away doesnt answer just stares off
and a slight slight smile a gamblers philosophical smile upon being purged of his wealth appears on schindlers face
in the distance a lone boxcar stark against the winter landscape
there are patches of snow on the ground
a cold wind blows through bare trees
tight on poldek pfefferbergs eyes behind a welders mask
he turns from his work to the voice welding torch in his hand
the torch firing at ice as hard as metal blue flame white steam
pfefferbergs eyes behind the mask again concentrating
around the abandoned boxcar in the gruesome cold stand schindler emilie a doctor some workers and some ss guards watching waiting
pfefferberg steps back
sledge hammers pound at locks
hands pull at levers
the doors begin to slide
out of darkness from inside the boxcar as the doors slide open schindlers face is revealed tight
he stares for an interminable moment before walking slowly away
inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs a pyramid of corpses frozen white
from a distance a tableau the boxcar the workers and guards and emilie outside it schindler off to himself several steps away all of them still as statues
beyond a country church among the stone markers of a small cemetery walk schindler and a priest
its been suggested i cremate them in my furnaces
as a catholic i will not
as a human being i will not
the priest nods he seems relatively empathic
he offers an alternative theres an area beyond the church reserved for the burial of suicides
maybe i can convince the parish council to allow them to be buried there
these arent suicides
the priest knows that
but he also knows that the provisions of canon law regarding who can and cannot be buried in consecrated ground are narrow
these are victims of a great murder
in a corner of the factory workers hammer at pine lumber
they are building coffins
as workers harness horses to carts others hoist the coffins into them
schindler is there watching
he glances up at one of the guard towers expecting perhaps to be felled by a bullet
beyond the wire rabbi levartov leads the horse drawn carts
around him walk a minyan a quorum of ten males necessary for the rite
a few guards lag behind
work continues but its apparent in their eyes they are only physically here in spirit they are all walking alongside the carts one great moral force
the roar of a machine suddenly inexplicably dies
schindler standing at the main power panel pulls the last of the switches and the factory plunges into absolute silence
just beyond the perimeter of the catholic cemetery the minyan quickly and quietly recites kaddish over the dead as their coffins are lowered into individual graves
then there is only a low breathing of wind
amon goeth in civilian clothes emerges from a car
his eyes sallow from inadequate sleep sweep across the fortified compound with envy
its a nice place oskars got here
stern at a window stares down at goeth beside his car
softly gravely whats he doing here
schindler appears beside stern glances down
hes lost weight goeth
the old suit he wears seems too big for him
alone down there he seems disoriented
probably looking for a handout
workers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit of their foulest dreams amon goeth crossing through the factory
schindler his arm around the killers shoulder as if he were a long lost brother leads him across the shop floor proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering hilo
schindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet sets it on his desk snaps it open revealing clothes goeths uniforms his medals
the ex oberstrumfuhrer touches the fabric gently then glances up gratefully to his friend
beyond the frosted glass of schindlers office door stern can see the wavering forms of the two nazi party members sharing cognac and stories
warmed by cognac and friendship goeth comes through the factory again carrying the suitcase schindler at his side steering him to some degree
goeths hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a bothersome fly
but it isnt a fly
one of the workers has spit on him
he turns in disbelief
silence as his hand drops to his side to the holster he forgets isnt there
he glances around for ss guards
who arent there
he looks to schindler thoroughly confused and whispers where are the guards
the guards arent allowed on the factory floor
they make my workers nervous
goeth stares at him bewildered
then again at the worker who spit
then at other workers the resolve in their eyes
they know he has no power here and sense he has no power anywhere
his own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her lap knitting needles in her hands
is this a dream
ill discipline him later
schindler good naturedly throws an arm around goeths shoulder and leads him away
the workers watch as the two germans disappear out the factory doors
a guard slowly turns the dial of a radio finding and losing in static several different voices in several languages none of them lasting more than a moment
depression hangs over the barracks
most of the guards are straining to hear the news theyve been fearing for some time now some on their bunks just staring one at a window peering out at
the black face of a forest as if expecting at any moment to see russian or american troops appear
workers like the guards straining to hear
the dial finds faint mired in static the idiosyncratic voice of winston churchill
schindler on liepolds doorstep
the two men considering each other across the threshold
radio static filters out from liepolds room
the word eisenhower cuts through before the speakers voice is buried again
its time the guards came into the factory
he turns and walks away
all twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered for the first time on the factory floor
tension and uncertainty surround them
its ominously quiet
then the unconditional surrender of germany has just been announced
at midnight tonight the war is over
it is not his intention to elicit celebration
indeed his words echoing and fading in the factory echo the doubts they all feel
tomorrow youll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families
in many cases you wont find them
after six long years of murder victims are being mourned throughout the world
not by untersturmfuhrer liepold
he stands with his men dying to lift his rifle and fire
some of you have come up to me and thanked me
thank your fearless stern and others among you who worrying about you have faced death every moment
glancing away thank you
hes looking at the guards thanking them which thoroughly confuses the workers
just when they thought they knew where his sentiments lay hes thanking guards
youve shown extraordinary discipline
youve behaved humanely here
you should be proud
or is he attempting to adjust reality to destroy the ss as combatants to alter the self image of both the guards and the prisoners
moving across the ss mens faces they remain inscrutable
schindler turns his attention back to the workers and not at all like a confession but rather like simple statements of fact im a member of the nazi party
im a munitions manufacturer
im a profiteer of slave labor im a criminal
at midnight you will be free and i will be hunted
pause ill remain with you until five minutes after midnight after which time and i hope youll forgive me i have to flee
that worries the workers
whenever he leaves something terrible always seems to happen
in memory of the countless victims among your people i ask us to observe three minutes of silence
in the quiet in the silence drifting slowly across the faces of the workers the elderly the lame teenagers wives beside husbands children beside their parents families together it becomes
clear if it wasnt before that both as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise the brinnlitz camp has been one long sustained confidence game
schindler has never stood still so long in his life
he does now though framed by his giant hilo machines silent at the close of the noisiest of wars his head bowed mourning the many dead
when he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to do so
the faces few of which he recognizes are all looking at him
he turns to speak to the guards along the wall again
i know youve received orders from our commandant which he has received from his superiors to dispose of the population of this camp
apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave
pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat
his ragtag irregulars do the same the rest of their ersatz arsenal concealed behind a machine
to the guards now would be the time to do it
theyre all here
this is your opportunity
the guards hold their weapons as they have from the moment they arrived here tonight at attention waiting it seems to be given the official order from their commander liepold
who appears ready to give it
he shrugs you could leave
and return to your families as men instead of murderers
long long silence
finally one of the guards slowly lowers his rifle breaks ranks and walks away
when the last is gone the workers consider liepold
he appears more an oddity than a threat
he is more an oddity than a threat
and he knows it
he turns and leaves
the perimeter wire
the guard barracks
the ss is long gone
schindler and emilie emerge from his quarters each carrying a small suitcase
in the dark some distance away from his mercedes stand all twelve hundred workers
as schindler and his wife cross the courtyard to the car stern and levartov approach
the rabbi hands him some papers
weve written a letter trying to explain things
in case youre captured
every worker has signed it
schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the typewritten text and continuing for several pages
he pockets it this new list of names
stern steps forward and places a ring in schindlers hand
its a gold band like a wedding ring
schindler notices an inscription inside it
it says whoever saves one life saves the world
schindler slips the ring onto a finger admires it a moment nods his thanks then seems to withdraw
to himself i couldve got more out
stern isnt sure he heard right
schindler steps away from him from his wife from the car from the workers
to himself i couldve got more
if id just
i dont know if id just
i couldve got more
oskar there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you
look at them
if id made more money
i threw away so much money you have no idea
if id just
there will be generations because of what you did
i didnt do enough
you did so much
schindler starts to lose it the tears coming
the look on schindlers face as his eyes sweep across the faces of the workers is one of apology begging them to forgive him for not doing more
goeth wouldve bought this car
why did i keep the car
ten people right there ten more i couldve got
looking around this pin he rips the elaborate hakenkreus the swastika from his lapel and holds it out to stern pathetically
this is gold
two more people
he wouldve given me two for it
at least one
he wouldve given me one
one more person
a person stern
i couldve gotten one more person i didnt
he completely breaks down weeping convulsively the emotion hes been holding in for years spilling out the guilt consuming him
they killed so many people
stern weeping too embraces him they killed so many people
from above from a watchtower stern can be seen down below trying to comfort schindler
eventually they separate and schindler and emilie climb into the mercedes
it slowly pulls out through the gates of the camp
and drives away
a panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire of the camp and just sits there growling like a beast
suddenly it fires a shell at nothing in particular at the night an exhibition of random spite then turns around and rolls back into the forest
from a watchtower a couple of workers having witnessed the tanks display of impotent might can make little sense of it
below many of the workers mill around the yard waiting to be liberated
no one seems to know what else to do
some czech partisans emerge from the forest
they come down the hill and casually approach the camp
reaching the wire theyre met by pfefferberg and some other workers rifles slung over their shoulders
through the fence its all over
pause so what are you doing
youre free to go home
when the russians arrive
until then were staying here
the partisan shrugs suit yourself and wanders back toward the trees with his friends
five headlights appear out of the night five motorcycles marked with the ss deaths head insignia
they turn onto the road leading to the camp gate and park the riders shutting off the engines
shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp
several armed and dangerous jews
as the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from the camp the workers keep their rifles pointed at them
the nco in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the wire
thank you very much
he climbs onto his motorcycle
the others climb onto theirs
and drive away
a lone russian officer on horseback tattered coat rope for reins emerges from the forest
as he draws nearer it becomes apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard that the horse is a mere pony the russians feet in stirrups nearly touching the
ground beneath the animals skinny abdomen
he reaches the camp climbs easily down from the horse and in a loud voice addresses the hundreds of workers standing at the fence you have been liberated by the
this is it
this one man
the workers wait for him to say more
he waits for them to move to leave to go home
finally whats wrong
a few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk with him
have you been in poland
i just came from poland
are there any jews left
the russian has to think
eventually he shrugs no not that he saw and climbs back onto his pony to leave
where should we go
i dont know
dont go east thats for sure they hate you there
pause i wouldnt go west either if i were you
he shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs
we could use some food
the russian looks confused glances off
the quiet hamlet of brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile away
isnt that a town over there
of course it is
but the idea that they could simply walk over there is completely foreign to them
the russian rides away
all twelve hundred of them a great moving crowd coming forward crosses the land laying between the camp behind them and the town in front of them
tight on the face of one of the men
tight on typewriter keys rapping his name
tight on a pen scratching out the words metal polisher on a form
tight on the keys typing teacher
tight on his face in the crowd
tight on the face of a woman in the moving crowd
the keys typing her name
the pen scratching out lathe operator
the keys typing physician
tight on her face
tight on a mans face
pen scratching out electrician
keys typing musician
a womans face
pen scratching out machinist
keys typing merchant
a street of apartment buildings in a working class neighborhood of the city
the door to a modest apartment opens revealing oskar schindler
the elegant clothes are gone but the familiar smile remains
hey how you doing
its poldek pfefferberg out in the hall

things are great things are great
things dont look so great
schindler isnt penniless but hes not far from it living alone in the one room behind him

pfefferberg waits out in the hall as schindler disappears inside for a minute
the legend below appears schindler reappears wearing a coat steps out into the hall forgets something turns around and goes back in
he comes back out with a nice bottle of wine in his hand and as he and pfefferberg disappear down the stairs together milas good
kids are good

they dont need anything
they just want to see you
yeah i know

itll only take a minute
their voices face
against the empty hallway appears a faint trace of the image of the factory workers through the wire walking away from the brinnlitz camp
