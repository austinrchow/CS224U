based on the play by steven fechter written by steven fechter nicole kassell winner st prize slamdance screenplay competition july over black we hear the rhythmic sound of machinery
this sound will continue throughout the title sequence as other sounds fade in and out
we move forward and back in time
a sparrow flutters in birdseed on a window sill
more birds crowd a bird feeder that hangs above
a lone child swings lazily on a swing
other children tear about in a wild game of chase
close on a piece of wood as it is fed through a wood chipper
a man finishes feeding the log into the chipper
he pauses to wipe the sweat and grime from his face
he is walter early forties features handsome but hardened by time
walter is silhouetted by the early morning light
he holds a duffel bag in his lap and watches out the bus window
the sun is just rising over the horizon streaks of pink and purple graze the frosted ground
wilderness gives way to frozen farmland
walter stands at a counter a female officer fingerprints each finger
walter and some other men drop the side of the flatbed truck and trees crash to the ground
the bus pulls away revealing walter standing alone on the sidewalk of a dilapidated neighborhood
he holds his duffle bag
the oclock whistle blows
workers hustle to get their coats and punch out
walter stands in line keeping to himself
as his turn arrives to punch out he receives a rough knock by two guys play fighting behind him
walter doesnt react punches out and exits the door
vicki a tough looking but striking woman stands in line a little further back watching
a superintendent opens the door to an apartment then hands walter the keys
her gaze is cold
walter closes the door and turns around
he stands in the middle of a prefab pre furnished kitchen living room area
light works its way through the dilapidated blinds
walter shakes the bosss hand bob early thirties strapping and trim is the manager of the business
mary kay the secretary looks up from her typing and takes walter in
bob introduces them
she is in her early forties
walter follows bob from the office mary kay watches as they leave
there is a flash as a camera snaps a photo
walter is captured in a photograph standing against a baby blue background
walter lifts the blinds
the birds flutter away
walter stands under the shower
walter hair wet and clean shaven tosses back some pills
tires screech as cars tear out of the driveway
walter stands at a bus stop across the street
as vicki walks across the lot a car pulls up next to her and men catcall and whistle out the window
vicki flicks them off
the men burst into hysterics and peal out of the lot
she gets in her jeep and leaves tearing by the bus stop
walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the chill
it is late winter
the trees are bare black silhouettes against the darkening sky
walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the wind
filling the kiosk a clothing advertisement displays a young girl striking a seductive pose
close on a police file
a mug shot reveals walter many years younger
pages are flipped through giving glimpses of newspaper clippings as well as typed documents
words stand out convicted st degree counts served
a plain clothes officer closes the folder and looks out his office window where walter stands being fingerprinted
this is sergeant lucas mid fifties face creased and greying hair
walter watches out the window as farmland gives way to city
traffic builds billboards line the highway
details of machines cutting the wood
walter fills the bird feeder with birdseed
there is the sound of children playing and walter looks up
walters pov across the way children play outside of the school
walter watches then closes his window
walter exits the police station and crosses the street
close on fingers typing on a keyboard
a computer screen shows walters image the photo just taken of him against the blue background
words appear across the screen as they are typed creating an internet notification page released qualifying offense s we move in on the photo of walter till it fills the
all sound fades out
the title the woodsman fades in
walter sits in a small windowless office with his coat still on
he looks at someone off screen
how are you adjusting
im adjusting okay
and your new apartment
are you taking your medication
it gives me headaches
but you are taking it
across from walter sits rosen young awkward and clearly new to the profession jotting something down in a notepad
ill talk to your physician about the headaches
maybe he can change the prescription
walter doesnt say anything
rosen contd and hows your job
the jobs okay
do i take okay to mean you feel good about working there
i said the job is okay
smiling thats right you did
pause have you made any friends there
im not running for mr
pause you seem a little hostile today
that was a joke
rosen jots something on his notepad
walter reaches over and taps on the notebook
walter contd its called sarcasm dr
no need to call me doctor
im a therapist not a psychiatrist
its all the same
rosen looks at walter for a long moment
walter avoids his gaze
walter id like you to try something for me
id like you to keep a journal
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i dont understand
ev i dence
it never crossed my mind
it was just an idea
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
you think reflection is good
its very good indeed
by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life
we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships our careers and our goals
walter looks at him flatly
you read that in a book
no fucking way
then think about it
walter is silent
the sidewalk is crowded with pedestrians
walter heads towards the pharmacy entrance but he is abruptly cut off by a group of kids zooming by on their scooters and skateboards
he pauses for them to pass watches after them momentarily then proceeds inside
walter hands a prescription to a male pharmacist
the pharmacist looks at the prescription
he glances at walter then goes over to a female pharmacist working in the back area
she reads the prescription glances at walter over her bifocals then back at the prescription
walter has not missed any of this
there a problem
a middle aged shopper talking on her cell phone nearby looks over and pauses in her conversation
can you read the prescription
can you fill the prescription
then i suggest one of you move your ass because if i dont get my medication i get extremely violent
the male pharmacist scrambles to fill the prescription
the shopper gasps
walter looks at her and smiles
the shopper stuffs her items in her cart and quickly leaves
walter stifles his grin
walter opens the door to his apartment carrying a grocery bag
as he flips on the lights a metal object is thrown across the room
he catches it with one hand
its a can of beer
a man laughs
you still think fast
carlos sits at the table with a six pack
walter sets the bag on the table and pops open the can
dont need to think fast to handle beer
ook some talking to convince your super i was a relative
i told her all my relatives are good looking
jesus christ man its good to see you
carlos stands and they awkwardly embrace
carlos contd you look good damn good considering youre an old man now
seems like the whole worlds gotten younger
there is silence
carlos sits back down at the table and opens another beer
walter starts unpacking the groceries
you doing okay

his son runs it now
oh man that kid takes himself real serious
yeah you still with northland
grins foreman now
lots of building going on
we cant keep up with all the work
in fact i just hired a few new guys
glancing at walter he realizes his blunder
carlos contd just until we catch up
there is a brief silence as both men drink
carlos looks at walter
carlos contd ill never forget you got me started there
i just recommended you
you still had to prove yourself
carlos gets up and walks over to the window
he gazes outside
hey is that a school
k through sixth
carlos glances at walter then back outside
living across the street from a grade school
something wrong with that
i was just thinking of
i like the noise
walter walks over to the window
walter contd one hundred and twenty feet
law says i cant come within one hundred feet of where children congregate
i figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty
make a bet
no way man youd rob me blind
the two men laugh but the laughter quickly fades
carlos contd but maybe its not so healthy being so close you know to a school
heated you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town and ill happily move out of this crap neighborhood
arlos shrugs and tosses down the rest of his beer
i should go
your sister worries and when she worries she yells
how is she
when can i see her
im working on it
is it because of anna
i dont know
she wont talk about it
pause youre the only one in the family who still talks to me
i remember when they all referred to me as the little spic poor annette married
except her brother
you treated me with respect
pause look you paid your dues
your slate is clean now
how old is anna
shell be twelve next week
were throwing a big party on saturday
wish i could ask you to come
only if its no closer than a hundred feet
carlos looks away
walter contd sorry bad joke
they stiffly embrace
then carlos exits leaving walter alone
lose on a mans feet slowly walking heel to toe
the ground is covered in frost
tilt up to reveal walter counting his footsteps as he walks towards the school across from his apartment building
the schoolyard is empty
one hundred and ten one hundred and eleven one hundred and twelve
a birds cry pierces the sky
walter looks up to see a hawk circling above
he watches for a moment then continues walking
walter contd one hundred and thirteen one hundred and fourteen one hundred and fifteen
he reaches the school entrance and touches it
walter contd one hundred and twenty
walter looks at the hawk still circling above and hollers walter contd how about that
slowly the sound of children fades in and a red ball bounces to walters feet
he looks in the direction the ball came from
nothing is there
walter looks back down at his feet
the ball is gone
the sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a rhythmic squeak
walter looks towards the playground where an empty swing sways back and forth in the wind the chain squeaking in its hinges
he hawks cry pierces the silence
walter looks up to see the hawk being chased by two smaller birds
there is a tremendous crash as logs are dropped near the wood chipper
forklifts move and stack wood
walter stands at the end of a wood chipper pushing a long piece of wood through
suddenly above the din of machinery there is the sound of raised voices
walter looks across the way to see vicki yelling furiously and smacking a guy around the head with her work gloves
the man cowers protecting his head from the blows
some other men nearby are doubled over in laughter
he backs off out of breath
pedro straightens up having a very hard time keeping a straight face
he other guys start to applaud
vicki looks around and storms off kicking a piece of wood into one of the men hard
she brushes past walter on her way to the exit
he watches after her
vicki sits alone at a table eating a sandwich
she takes large bites and eats fast
walter approaches carrying a tray of food
he pauses across from where vicki sits
icki ignores him
vicki looks up
are you okay
pause yeah im fucking fantastic
walter nods and keeps on walking
vicki returns to her food
after a moment she steals a glance up at walter
across the way mary kay watches walter as he sits down to the table neighboring vickis
bob sits down across from mary kay with a tray of food and a newspaper
he opens the paper and starts to read
so whatd he do
what did who do
you know the new guy
bob looks across the room at walter
mind your own business mary kay
come on just tell me what he did
bob ignores her and reads the paper
mary kay contd drugs armed robbery manslaughter tax evasion ob picks up his tray and moves away
mary kay smiles to herself
walter sits on the bus
he is squeezed into the window seat the bus crowded with commuters and teenagers on their way home from school
he focuses out the window
walter sits alone on his couch watching a baseball game drinking a beer
the winning run on base and a full count on williams whos been in a terrible slump
heres the pitch
williams swings and misses
the rangers win ball game over
walter switches off the tv
walter crosses the street outside of his apartment and heads towards the bus stop
white volvo is parked along the road
a man sits inside the car looking out towards the school
the engine is off
hes in his twenties good build nice clothes
walter looks at the man as he passes by
he man doesnt notice him his attention fixed down the street
walter looks in the direction of his gaze
he schoolyard is quiet except for a couple of students running in
walter looks back at the man
the man doesnt notice him
walter hurries to his bus stop
walter works feeding wood through the chipper
icki drives a forklift past walter and watches him as she passes
he remains intent upon his work
walter walks across the parking lot heading towards the bus stop
before he reaches the road vickis rusty old jeep pulls up alongside him and stops honking to grab his attention
icki rolls down the passenger side window

im all right
its fucking freezing out here
walter hesitates and looks down the road
there is no bus in sight
vicki contd come on i wont bite
he gets in
as they pull away a beat up grey chevy pulls into the parking lot
sergeant lucas gets out of the car and pauses watching after vicki and walter
he then turns and heads into the office
walter and vicki drive silently
vicki glances at walter
theres something wrong with this picture
im talking about you
walter looks out the window
vicki contd heres this nice hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work
i mean who rides the bus anymore

she gives him a look
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
whats weird about that
most women wouldnt choose it
guess im not like most women
icki takes out a cigarette and presses the cigarette lighter in revealing a tattoo on her wrist of a pair of breasts with angel wings
walter notices the tattoo
vicki notices walter notice
she smiles at him
vicki contd youre quiet at work

vicki laughs and stops at a red light
walter contd smiling are you

she shoots him a look
vicki paces around the apartment
walter takes two beers from the fridge then turns and stands holding them watching her
your windows face south
northern light is the purest
but southern light is very good

ive got shitty light in my place but my plants dont seem to mind

icki wanders through the stark living room space looking at what little there is to look at
what about bears
what about them
they could eat you
laughing yeah they could
she looks closely at the bus map taped to the wall the only decoration in the place
she looks at walter
vicki contd i thought you were just shy but now i think its something else
walter drinks his beer and sits down on the couch
vicki contd something happened to you
icki sits next to him
im not easily shocked
i get that vimpression

walter looks at her in surprise
vicki contd i dont like to waste time
vicki leans in and kisses him
vicki contd so

she kisses him again
vicki looks at him
she kisses him
hesitantly he kisses her back
a bathroom walters hands shake as he splashes water on his face
his shirt is off and he wears just his jeans
he looks up at himself in the mirror
bedroom walter lies back on his bed
vicki runs her hand up his chest pulling his shirt over his head
walter looks at vicki already topless
he tentatively touches her breast

they roll so she is underneath him
livingroom vicki walks backwards towards the bedroom door pulling walters hand to follow

f bedroom walter gropes vickis body and urgently pulls her underwear off
g bedroom walter and vicki are completely engrossed in each other making love
bathroom walter breaks his gaze from the mirror and turns the faucet off
vicki lies in bed relaxed smoking a cigarette
the sheets are pulled to her waist
walter enters and sits on the side of the bed
he smiles shyly at her

walter looks at her
vicki laughs and nudges him in the butt with her foot
vicki contd hey that was

walter gets up and walks over to the window

walter looks out the window silent
vicki contd tell me about it

walter is silent
vicki contd did i say something wrong
i suffer from insomnia
is that all
when i do sleep i sweat a lot
usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming
smiling i sleep like a dead horse
walter has run out of excuses
vicki drops her cigarette in an empty beer bottle and slides deeper under the covers
walter stands by the window watching vicki walk towards her jeep
something brushes his leg
he looks down to see the red ball resting by his foot
he turns to see
a glimpse of a young girl as she flashes by the door
she is twelve years old and wears a white nightgown
there is the sound of a car honk and walter looks out the window to see vicki pull away
he looks back toward the girl
there is nothing there
walter rummages through a drawer
from underneath a pile of clothes he pulls out a well worn notebook
walter leafs through the pages
they are filled with writing but towards the back the pages are blank
walter sits next to the window watching birds play at the bird feeder
the notebook sits next to him on the windowsill
there is the sound of children playing outside
walter opens the notebook closes it then opens it again
he looks up and sees his reflection in the window
he starts to write
i watch the kids arrive at school
walter sits in the chair across from rosen looking at his hands
ows the journal
im still thinking about it
i wish youd give it a try
walter is silent
rosen contd you dont like coming here do you
but you dont like coming here
be honest walter
thats an honest answer
and why dont you like coming here
your cheery personality makes my skin itch
stung is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch
maybe its the way i look
or the sound of my name
i dont have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan
i also know a therapist named chung
i dont need someone else
osen settles back
walter looks at rosen
continued from previous journal scene
walter sits at his windowsill writing in his journal
there is the sound of children arriving to school outside
he looks up
but for the last few weeks ive noticed someone else watching them
walters pov the man with the white volvo stands leaning against his car watching a bus load of children arrive
he pops m ms in his mouth
i call him candy
the boys run and tackle each other
a group walks by candy
contd he talks to the boys fifth and sixth graders
he goes for the pretty ones faces like angels
walter finishes writing then looks outside
walter stands on a crowded bus staring out the window at the landscape rushing by
the bus pulls to a stop
passengers get off then a group of girls come crashing onto the bus
they overflow with energy and giggles
walter squeezes back so they can get by but the bus lurches into motion throwing one of the girls into walter
he helps her regain her balance and the girl smiles at him
she and her friends burst into laughter and move on past
walter watches her move down the aisle then quickly turns away scanning the faces surrounding him
no one looks at him
walter sweats heavily as he works
vicki walks by and glances at walter as she passes
he doesnt notice her
walter sits at a table eating
vicki sits down across from him
they eat silently
walter doesnt look up
vicki blows a straw wrapper hitting walter in the face
fter a moment without glancing up walter retaliates
vicki smothers a laugh
walter cracks a smile
ary kay sits across the room watching the flirtation between vicki and walter
vicki exits a stall and goes to the sink to wash her hands
shes smiling a little smile to herself
mary kay enters and starts primping in the mirror fixing her hair putting on lipstick
she watches vicki in the reflection of the mirror
id keep away from him
the new man
id keep away from him if i were you
you dont want to know but hes damaged goods real damaged goods if you know what i mean
cold yeah mary kay i think i do
thanks a bunch for the advice
mary kay smiles missing vickis ironic tone
just trying to be helpful
well mary youre about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe
you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe dont you
mary kays smile withers into a sneer
she drops the lipstick into her bag and exits
vicki turns and finishes washing her hands glancing at herself in the mirror
walter exits the building amidst a group of men
he walks towards the bus stop
vicki hollers to him from her jeep
vicki waves him over
vicki sits across from walter in a booth
she takes a large bite from a burger and washes it down with a milk shake
walter folds his napkin over his hand to make a little rabbit hand puppet
the rabbit nods at vicki
she busts out laughing
walter and vicki play pool
she knocks two balls into a corner pocket
she is kicking his ass and visibly enjoying it
walter hands her a quarter
vicki kisses him on the cheek and goes to line up the next shot
walter and vicki shower together
walter rinses the suds from vickis hair
vicki and walter have just finished making love vicki on top
she lies down on his chest
he strokes her hair then leans his head close and takes a deep breath
vicki is woken up by walter who makes the moaning sounds of someone having a nightmare
she turns on her side and watches him
walter wakes up with a start then sees vicki and cuddles close
she runs her fingers through his hair and kisses his forehead
he closes his eyes again
vicki looks at him closely
what happened to you
walter opens his eyes
vicki continues to stroke his hair
vicki contd walter what did you do
walter pulls away
why do you want to know
because i like you
walter is silent
vicki contd i wont run away
heres a long pause
he rests back down against the pillows
whats the worst thing you ever did
vicki looks at him
fucked my best friends husband
walter listens with no reaction
vicki contd i mean my best friend since the second grade
her husband was hot for me and god he was cute
she was an international flight attendant so we would get it on for days while she was off in some country we couldnt pronounce
then he told her the shit
it broke up our friendship broke up their marriage
later she had a nervous breakdown quit her job then moved in with her sister who she despised
vicki lights a cigarette and takes a long drag
vicki contd i still feel like the lowest piece of shit when i think about it
she looks at walter
he says nothing his expression blank
vicki contd so what did you do
i molested little girls
molested little girls
walter contd you dont believe me
she shakes her head no but the laughter begins to die
walter contd i wish the judge had your sense of humor
vicki is quiet
youre not joking
twelve years in prison is no joke
walter gets out of bed and pulls on his pants
vicki doesnt move the cigarette burns in her hand
walter contd signaling to the door look you can go now
how many girls did you molest
walter walks over to the window
obviously one too many
bitter laugh vicki looks away
walter contd sorry
what did you do to them
looking back out the window its not what you think
between ten and twelve
once a nine year old told me she was eleven
once a fourteen year old told me she was twelve
i always asked how old they were
icki is visibly shaken
she puts the cigarette out
so it was mostly fondling
shit like that
walter looks at her
i never hurt them
twelve years in prison
the judge had a thing about sex offenders
later i heard his daughter had been raped
if i hadnt had a good lawyer it would have been twenty five to thirty
vicki is silent
walter contd why dont you just go now okay
i told you im not easily shocked
you should be shocked
or do you get off on this shit
get your kicks somewhere else
hey im not depraved
advancing towards her
get the fuck out of here
vicki doesnt move
after a long moment walter sits down next to her
you dont molest little girls anymore do you
icki looks away struggling to digest the news
walter contd quiet you should go now
vicki gets up and pulls on her clothes
she looks at walter who sits motionless on the bed
vicki drives fast
cigarette gripped between her fingers
tears stream down her face
she comes to a stop light and sits completely still staring ahead without blinking
suddenly cars honk
she snaps out of her stupor and keeps on driving
walter sits on the couch writing in his journal
the tv is on a baseball game in progress sound on low
abruptly walter throws the journal across the room
then he lies back and stares at the ceiling
suddenly there is a loud thump outside of the apartment
walter picks up his journal and puts it in a drawer then walks quietly to the door and opens it a crack
a man struggles to bring a large object up the stairs
walter opens the door
carlos turns in surprise
what are you doing
his little table is one heavy bitch
carlos enters the apartment and sets a table down in the middle of the room
walter looks at it
its made from cherry
thats a hard wood
its a nice table
walter runs his hand along the surface
notice the grain
see how deep and rich the red runs
its really nice
carlos sits in a chair
its my own design
you wont find another table like it in the world
it was a beautiful present
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me
gesturing to the empty space you need a table
he was going to throw it out wasnt she
just toss it like a scrap of wood
it wasnt like that
hes got all this new furniture now
she said it didnt fit anymore so i kept it in the attic
i thought you might like it
i made that table for you and annette for your wedding
i put a lot of love into it
i know man
i love this table too
looks at walter but i also love my wife
carlos notices the tv
carlos contd whats happening
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers
walter stares at carlos for a moment then turns and goes to the fridge and pulls out two beers
he hands carlos a beer and sits down on the couch
carlos sits down next to him
they got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of double a or southern cal
pause how was the party
the birthday party
it was great man
anna was so pretty
getting excited she looked like a princess like one of those girls in a fairy tale you know like snow white
walter looks at carlos
carlos contd ive got some pictures
reaching for his back pocket ant to see
ah come on
snapping i dont want to see any goddamn pictures
carlos backs off
theyre just photos i took of the party
walter is silent and avoids carloss gaze
carlos gives walter a look then heads to the door
carlos turns i want to see my sister and anna in person
yeah man i understand
walter walks over to the table and slowly runs his hand along the surface
walter sits across from rosen
how do you feel about that
i dont feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece
she was born after they put me away
how can i have feelings
then why are you talking about this
have to talk about something
what are you afraid will happen
im not afraid
im just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter and if he isnt careful hes going to suffer
have you talked to carlos about your concerns
im not that crazy
do you think youre crazy
if im not then what the hell am i doing here
why do you think youre here
you know why
its part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about
talking to you is like riding on a merry go round
that is a marvelous image walter
because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around
walter looks at rosen
how long is this going to take
checking the clock we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
pause we have a lot of work to do
speaking slowly will i ever be normal
i couldnt say
you couldnt say
im afraid not
do you know what normal is
i suppose its however society defines it
how do you define it
then how do you know if your patients are getting better
they usually tell me
how do they know
what is your idea of being normal
mimicking rosen what is your idea of being a jew
controlled whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you
looks at the clock why dont we continue this on thursday
exploding i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you youre normal
fuck you rosen
i know you dont know
i know youre frustrated walter but walter gets up and slams out the door
osen looks at the empty chair
rosen contd you really are making progress
walter sits at his window with his journal watching outside
walters pov candy leans against his car patiently waiting
something grabs candys attention and walter follows his gaze
kids pour off a school bus
candy waves to one angel faced boy of ten or eleven
so what should i do
call the cops
he laughs yeah thats pretty funny
he boy and a buddy run over to candy
contd but what if candy seduces one to go for a ride
candy smiles and offers angel face a candy bar which the boy accepts
contd yeah thats right
if the boy goes for a ride its because he wants to go for a ride
the bell rings
the other boy grabs angel face and they run off to school
walter rests his chin on his hands watching
icki closes her locker to see walter standing at the end of the room in front of his locker
she looks away
walter looks at her closes his locker loudly and walks brusquely past
vicki stands near a pile of wood chips taking a cigarette break
walter approaches pushing a cart full of wood chips
vicki looks at him as if to say something but walter continues past dumps the chips and returns back inside
walter sits at a table across the room from vicki
ary kay enters and sits down with walter hi walter
how are you doing
you know its really a beautiful day out there and i was thinking walter wipes his mouth and gets up
got another load coming in
the smile fades from mary kays face
icki watches walter leave
walter stands alone at the bus stop
icki gets in her jeep and pauses before turning on the engine watching walter
he turns his back to the cold wind and her
vicki turns on the car and pulls out of the lot roaring by walter without looking at him
vicki moves around her apartment cigarette in one hand spray bottle in the other squirting her plants
she prunes dead leaves from one of them then pauses looking at the leaves in her hands
dont die on me you little shit
she aggressively squirts the little plant with water then pauses noticing her reflection in the window
she looks at herself long and hard
there is a knock on the door
walter walks through the room to the door tucking in his shirt as he walks
he cracks the door
vicki stands outside
walter opens the door
you want to go for a ride
walter looks at her
walter and vicki drive without saying anything
slowly the city scape gives way to countryside
walter looks over at vicki
she stares ahead
walter and vicki get out of the car which is parked on the edge of a reservoir surrounded by a thick pine forest
vicki works her way down to the waters edge
a great blue heron skims across the waters surface
walter watches her for a moment then follows
he sits down near her
icki lights a cigarette and stares out over the water
after a long pause
what was prison like
pause ou dont really yes
i want to know
walter is quiet for a moment
vicki looks at him
you mean the time youre locked away
prison is time
you think time you feel time you hear time
your heart doesnt beat to live it just beats
im sorry walter
shrugs dont be sorry for me
i did those things
no one else did
im dealing with that
vicki looks out at the water
my father took me fishing here when i was a kid
he could name every fish in the lake
and for every fish he named he had a fishing story
i hated fishing but i loved his stories
sounds like a special guy
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave
walter looks at her
vicki contd he said he couldnt help it
said he hated himself for doing it
but boy did that man love to drink
here is a long pause
why young girls walter
walter is silent
vicki contd is it their innocence
pause their power
they seduce me
they seduce you
i was always the one seduced
you really believe that
long pause no
thats what i used to tell myself
v and what do you tell yourself now
walter looks at vicki for a moment then stands up
then take me home
vicki doesnt move
walter contd what do you want from me
i want you to change my mind
walter is silent
vicki shoves walter hard
vicki contd try goddamnit
walter stumbles back a few steps but regains himself
he stares at vicki
his anger wells and he snaps
i had this plan once
or maybe it was a dream
i was going to quit the building business
open my own shop
make and design fine country furniture
i had saved enough money
i found the perfect place
cheap five year lease
the loan was in the bag
my wife was a hundred percent behind it
everything was set
then i got in trouble
pause do you know what the worst kind of trouble is
icki watches walter silent
walter contd its trouble you bring on yourself
and the people you love the most
i lost a wife and a daughter
it hurt to lose my wife
it killed me to lose my daughter
walter stops looks at vicki
vicki stares back at him
after a long pause she approaches and tentatively pulls him into an embrace
close up on computer screen displaying a web page for registered felons
the heading reads sex offenders the more we know the better
mock police sirens and lights frame the heading
he listing of sex offenders scrolls down revealing photos name address and crime details of man after man in alphabetical order page after page
the scrolling slows down past mason past all of the mcs
and stops on miles walter
convicted for sexual abuse of minors five counts released
it is the notification page that we saw created in the opening montage
walters photo stares back at us
e slowly pull back to reveal mary kay at the computer
she clucks her tongue and shakes her head
vicki and walter lie in bed spooning fully clothed
vickis back to walter he holds her close
gently you know this is crazy
being here with me
pause most people say the odds are against me
the percentages vicki looks at him blankly
walter contd for men like me
they say most of us end up back
im saying there are risks
well most people are stupid
pause you want to talk about odds
one day ill tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons
you wanna talk about odds
why not tell me now
vicki lights a cigarette
i got poked around
here and there
which brother did this
all three in chronological order
you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
no you dont
i love all of them
theyre strong gentle men with families of their own
and if you asked them about what they did to me theyd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you
you never asked them about it
laughs are you serious
icki drinks from her beer
walter watches her
walter sits at his table a scrap of wood in his hand
he whittles away at the wood
it is the rough outline of a heart with wings
here is a loud knock on the door
walter gets up
the knock comes again even harder
walter goes to the door and opens it
the smiles fades from his face
ergeant lucas pushes the door open further and walks right in
he wears a well tailored suit
flashes his badge may i come in
you are in
so i am
but i always like to ask
walter closes the door behind him
lucas walks around the apartment
walter watches him uneasy
have a seat
walter hesitates then obeys
lucas contd you dont know
i have no idea
i think you do
why dont you just tell me
lucas walks over to the window
walter contd pause i havent broken any laws
then you wont mind if i look around
got something to hide
i could get a search warrant
if you could you would have brought one today
lucas looks at walter
he looks at the table
unusual design for a contemporary piece
lucas runs his hand along the surface
its not for sale
who said i wanted to buy it
lucas walks back to the window
lucas contd two nights ago a ten year old girl was attacked not too far from here
lucas contd seems theres been a number of attacks on young girls in the vicinity
kind of a coincidence wouldnt you say
walter stands up
if you tell me when this happened walter places his hands in his pockets
lucas whirls around
move your fucking hands away from your pockets
lucas contd sit down
lucas contd we know every step you make every goddamn step
we know when you sleep when you eat when you shit and when you jack off
lucas leans over the table nose to nose with walter
lucas contd and when you sit by the window watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by do you wave your wanger at the girls
is that when you jerk off
you cant talk to me like interrupting like a piece of shit
in my eyes you are a piece of shit
think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now
lucas contd i could say you jumped when i came in
who are they going to believe
not you because youd be a dead piece of shit
lucas taps walter onl the forehead and smiles
lucas contd feigning kindness we just want to make sure youre being a good boy walter
walter is silent
lucas taps him again
lucas contd okay
lucas rises spits his gum in the sink and leaves
walter leans over squeezing his head tight between his hands
the sound of children fades in and walter looks up
the girl with the red ball stands across from him in the doorway to his bedroom
she smiles and bounces the ball
walter folds over cradling his head in his arms
walter stands alone at his bus stop
as he waits he sees the white volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the school
he bus pulls up to the stop obscuring walters view
he quickly gets on and moves to the back looking for candys car
it is nowhere in sight the place where it had parked empty
walter sits down and stares ahead numb
its a bright saturday afternoon
a city bus turns into the parking lot of a large mall
passengers exit the bus and pour into the malls entrance
walter is among them
i followed a girl
music blares from speakers
packs of teenagers cruise the mall
it is alive with chatter
i dont know why i did it
walter is frequently jostled as if he has forgotten how to navigate crowds
contd there were all of these people
e passes many stores and snack shops then sees a barnes noble and enters
the bookstore is two floors and vast
walter looks lost as he moves through the crowds
walter rides an escalator
three girls stand ahead of him
the girl closest to him wears a short skirt which flutters above walters face
he looks up
she was pretty
hey reach the next level and walter watches the girl walk away with her friends
suddenly the girl looks back
their eyes lock briefly
she w turns the corner
contd she gave me a look
if she hadnt given me that look
walter pauses then follows
the girl separates from her friends and goes down an aisle
walter follows her
she goes down another aisle
in the middle of the aisle the girl bends down looking at titles
from the end of the aisle walter pretends to be looking for a book as he edges closer to her
hes now a few feet away
the girl pulls out a book and opens it
walter gazes at the nape of her neck
can i help you find something
walter turns startled
behind the salesman walter sees a security guard exit the rest room area
no im he turns the girl is gone
he bolts the other way through the aisles down the elevator through the mall as fast as possible
the faces are a blur sound becomes distorted
then we hear did she know that you were following her
walter sits in rosens office
i dont know
what did you think would happen
i dont know
what did you want to happen
i dont know
walter is agitated
rosen calmly writes
walter contd i cant believe i took such a risk
looks at rosen will you stop writing in that fucking pad
rosen stops and looks at walter
walter contd you know that if anything happens i spend the rest of my life in prison
no parole no nothing
is this the first one
of course it is
thats why im telling you
i want you to calm down
with effort walter settles down
rosen contd you followed a girl
perhaps you wanted to see what it felt like after so many years
maybe unconsciously you were testing yourself
you followed her and nothing happened
and here you are talking about it with me
this is positive
there is a pause
walter looks down unconvinced
rosen checks the time
rosen contd walter well pick up here next time
i want to talk about it now
well talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was
gently go home walter
now i know
its when i can see a girl be near a girl even talk to a girl
and walk away
pause thats my idea of being normal
walter rides the bus staring out the window
sensing something he looks up
a girl sits across from walter
she is about twelve years old
she wears glasses and a pair of binoculars hangs around her neck
she casually nibbles on food she produces from her backpack
she glances at walter briefly then looks back out the window
walter turns away
walter and vicki sit at his table eating chinese take out
walter glances at vicki who is devouring her food
maybe this isnt a good idea
pause us seeing each other
she looks up at him
im not scared
neither am i
maybe you should be
walter gets up from the table and clears his plate to the sink
vicki looks at him
well walter i got an idea of my own
he avoids her look
vicki contd you listening to me
he doesnt answer
vicki contd we should live together
looks at her live together
move in with me
he stares at her
its a bad idea
i think its a fucking good idea
walter goes to the fridge for a beer
i dont even know how to live with myself
just think about it
ive got problems
most people dont have my kind of problems
guess that makes you pretty special
thats not what i meant
vicki looks at him blankly
walter contd i say we call it quits
icki puts her fork down pulls on her jacket and exits
walter looks at the closed door baffled
pause that was easy
e takes a swig from his beer
walter contd good
im fucking glad
vicki jogs down the stairs and over to her jeep
she opens the door
walter pulls the carving he was working on from a drawer and looks at it
vicki reenters holding a plant and sets it loudly on the table
walter looks at her then at the plant
whats it look like
she gets herself a beer from the fridge
i dont need a plant
everyone needs a plant
this ivy is one tough baby
its a cutting from one of mine
walter seems at a loss
vicki takes a swig from her beer
vicki contd heres the deal
give it a little water
go easy on the direct sunlight
and notice it every once in a while
they love it when you look at them or touch their leaves
can you handle that
walter looks unconvinced
youre such an asshole
she kisses him then gives him a teasing look
vicki contd dont be scared walter
cracking a smile im not scared
vicki walks towards the bedroom
he tosses her the carving
vicki catches it and looks at it for a long moment then at walter
walter contd i made it for you
walter contd its cedar
there is the usual morning chaos in the locker room
walter opens his locker but stops abruptly
aped to the inside of his locker is a magazine ad of a young girl joyfully swinging on a swing
scrawled over the image in red marker is a circle with line across it and the words were watching you written below
walter quickly tears down the picture and looks around
the men are all oblivious
walter works at the saw watching closely every person that walks by him
no one pays him any mind
bob the boss walks into the space and stops to have a few words with a worker who points in walters direction
bob heads towards walter
walter sees him coming and pauses in his work
bob walks right by to talk to another man working behind walter
walter watches for a moment then continues working
walter exits the mens room and stops to drink from the water fountain
mary kay is walking down the hall and pauses
how ya doing
how are you mary kay
she leans up against the wall
well ive got this problem
i promised my sister that id baby sit her little girl tonight while shes on a date
single mother right
her daughters a cute little thing about nine or ten
but once shes asleep i get soo bored
id love to have some company
she gives walter a suggestive look
mary kay contd what are you doing tonight walter
cold i got plans
a couple of men walk down the hall interrupting them
walter contd have a nice day mary kay
mary kay watches walter walk away
walter rides the bus staring out the window
the bus is crowded
iime passes fewer passengers dusk has turned to night
walter and rosen sit in their usual places
youre very late
please dont do it again
i said i was sorry
i cant move my patients around to accommodate one person
walter silently stares at his hands
rosen looks at him closely
rosen contd walter i want to ask you a question
will you try to answer it
walter looks at him
rosen contd when did it all start
you mean my problem
if by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i dont know
thats not a helpful answer
thats my answer
rosen looks at walter
lose your eyes
id like you to close your eyes
snaps im relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
hey rosen you going to hypnotize me
no i am not going to closing his eyes okay
eyes closed mind a blank
im all yours
do it rosen
rosen gets up so hes positioned directly in front of walter
when i say the word girl what is the earliest image that you can remember
can i open my eyes
when i say the word pretty when i say the word pleasure what is the earliest memory you see
i dont see in your mind walter
take your time
after a moment walters expression shifts
rosen contd watching closely who do you see
long pause see my sister
rosen is excited by this breakthrough
where is she
what is she doing
interrupting not so fast
pause where is she
in my bedroom sleeping
in my bed rosen
where do you think
where are you
in my bed too
how old are you and your sister
were little kids
but roughly how old
im maybe about six
which would make her four
rosen walks around walter and paces behind him
and what are you doing
just lying there
pause were taking a nap
yes a nap
kids do that
you ever take a nap rosen
walter opens his eyes
walter contd i dont want to talk about it any more
he sees rosen behind him
walter contd what the hell are you doing there
did you and your sister often take naps together
exploding i want you back in your chair
rosen stumbles back to his chair
walter contd dont ever do that again
i dont like nobody behind my back
i shouldnt have been there
walter looks away quelling his anger
osen contd walter what did you do while taking a nap with your sister
did you touch her
did you take off her clothes
did you take off your clothes
this is garbage
im only asking questions
okay ill tell you what i did just to shut you up
pause i smelled her hair
i just liked smelling her hair
you felt pleasure
long pause yes
rosen writes a few notes
did you get an erection
glaring at rosen i was six years old
i meant later
when you two took naps
walter is silent
rosen contd when the two of you held each other
when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine
when your parents were out and the two of you were alone
completely alone in that big house
it was a small house
a small house
with small rooms
his eyes well up
i smelled her hair
i just liked smelling her hair
walter presses his face into his hands
rosen watches him silently
when walter lifts his face
carlos sits before him
they are in a booth the table covered with drinks and remnants of bar food
the bar bustles in the background
ive got some good news
annette will see you
walter is quiet
carlos contd arent you glad
the week after
walter looks at carlos
carlos contd its just a better time
carlos avoids walters gaze
carlos contd anna will be away at camp
the house will be quiet
its better when its quiet
tell annette im busy in july
you should see my appointment book
it got crazy
its not what you think
the important thing is that you and annette need to talk
she needs to see you and you need to see her
a long pause im not a monster
youre a good man walter
okay you did some wrong things but inside youre a good decent man
maybe im not a good man
maybe inside im bad and ill always be bad
ont talk like that
the waitress interrupts to clear the table leaning over to grab the empty plates
carlos checks her out
carlos contd pause next week annette is going away for a few days
and the thing is that when annettes away
arlos watches the waitress depart
carlos contd i get horny as hell for other women
whispering i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman
you dont have to tell me this
im just talking man
carlos i never raped a woman
im just saying i understand
walter doesnt look at carlos
carlos contd its crazy out there
signaling to the crowd young girls wearing mini this and mini that
sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman she makes me feel like im bothering her
she stares down like shes afraid to look at me
why she do that
why cant she look me in the face
maybe because youre looking her in the face
carlos looks at walter
i see a pretty woman i look
thats the price of beauty my friend
my god you should see what annas friends wear
walter looks at him
carlos can i ask you something
ask me anything
pause did you ever
do you have feelings for anna
arlos looks at walter
what do you mean
a look of horror disgust passes over carloss face and he lurches forward grabbing walter by the shirt collar
i dont got your sick problem and if you or anybody else ever comes near my daughter ill kill you
carlos lets go of walter roughly and gets up and leaves
walter looks around embarrassed onlookers slowly turn away
walter picks up a napkin and starts to blot the table dry
vicki stands before walter who sits on the edge of the bed
both are naked
she kisses him
he turns her around and pulls her to his lap
walters hands are on her hips
he moves her body slowly very slowly around his lap
vicki goes with it enjoying herself then tries to turn around
walter holds her still
he leans his face into her hair
he takes deep audible breaths
vicki tries to turn again but he wont let her
she is aroused but confused
vicki contd walter
she tries to reach back
walter catches her hand and holds it to her side
dont touch me
he holds her tight
walter lies in bed eyes open
there is the sound of children playing outside
he carefully sits up in bed revealing vicki asleep beside him
n slightly fast motion grainy style of transferred mm kids parade down the sidewalk heading for school
the camera pans to reveal candy watching them
in the ratatat tone of a sportscaster good morning fellow sports fans
the match is about to begin
candy enters the arena looking sweet and trim
he checks out the scene but plays it cool
hes definitely holding back
pause uh oh candys eyes have locked onto something
railing behind the others is the angel faced boy
contd a cherub of a lad has separated from his friends
candy quickly makes his move
he pats the cherub on his head ruffles his hair
with his other hand he offers the boy a bag of m ms
che boy tears open the bag
contd round one to candy
candy points across the street to his white volvo
contd a very risky move by candy
the boy looks at the car but walks away
candy follows the boy
contd round two goes to the cherub
candy struts around the boy rapping clapping snapping his fingers
contd i have never seen candy act so cocky
candy points to his car again then dances seen in slow motion toward it
contd the cherub looks at candy the cherub looks at the car the cherub looks for his friends
but his friends are long gone
the cherub is alone
the cherub crosses the street
candy opens the car door
normal tone the cherub gets in the car
the boy gets in the car
the boy gets in the car
the car door closes
walter sits staring out the window
the sound of children playing
icki walks into the room and sees walter sitting by the window
she walks up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders
what are you doing
walter turns around startled brushing her off
dont do that
sneak up behind me like that
whats your fucking problem
whys it always my fucking problem
vicki looks at walter
whats going on
vicki looks at him
walter contd i didnt sleep well
do you want to talk about it
i need a shower
he walks back into the bedroom
a school bell rings and vicki looks out the window
she sees the children running into school
she looks back in the direction walter left
vicki and walter ride in the car
vicki glances at walter
he stares ahead then leans his head back and closes his eyes
walter rides head back eyes closed
the bus comes to a stop and a couple of passengers get on
walter opens his eyes
the girl with binoculars comes to sit in the seat ahead of walter
walter stares at the girl
the bus pulls up to another stop it is walters
the doors to the bus open
walter looks at the doors he does not move
the doors close
he looks back at the girl
the bus drives on
the bus comes to a stop
the girl gets off amongst a couple of passengers
walter walks down a path that opens onto a secluded little field surrounded by trees
the girl stands in the middle of the field looking at the sky through her binoculars
she turns slowly scanning the trees
she spots walter and lowers the binoculars
walter is silent
he looks up at the trees
girl contd what are you looking at
indifferently theres a million birds here
in that birch tree is a nest
pointing up there
she looks through her binoculars
walter stares at her
walter contd a little higher
she points her binoculars up
walter walks towards her
theres little chicks
turns to walter you want to see
she hands him her binoculars
he looks through them
continues looking is that right
i dont like starlings
theyre extremely aggressive birds
plus their habits are rather filthy
the mother sure has her hands full
he hands her back the binoculars
walter contd you always carry these
when i go bird watching
its why i like coming here
its just a city park
youd be surprised how many kinds of birds youll see here
last week i saw a purple martin
and the week before that i saw a solitary vireo
a solitary vireo
i like that one
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound
its hard to describe
i bet you can
she shakes her head
walter contd id love to hear it
pause its a bright sound
she closes her eyes and pipes a little tune
irl contd cheery
she opens her eyes shyly
girl contd something like that
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
you live around here
pause not too far
girl contd she looks at him are you a bird watcher too
im more of a people watcher
were you watching me
pause not at first
you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently
any second i thought you would take off and fly
i have to go
do you come here often
my daddy likes me home before dark
its good to listen to your daddy
the girl runs off down the path
walter watches after her
he stands alone in the field
walter rides the bus
through many different neighborhoods day passes into night
he stares beyond his reflection
over the following voice over we cut between walters apartment and walter riding the bus
i followed a girl
walter sits at his window writing in his journal fast
i talked to a girl
i was near a girl
what did i want to happen
the bus drives by a number of billboards childrens gap ads
maybe its like rosen said
maybe i wanted nothing to happen
walter pauses in the writing
out loud fucking rosen
this isnt helping
theres a loud knock at the door
walter looks over in surprise
the knock comes again
walter quickly closes his journal and puts it in a drawer
the knock comes again
walter goes to the door and opens it partially
ergeant lucas stands outside
walter opens the door
walter slowly closes the door behind him
what can i do for you sergeant lucas
lucas signals a chair
have a seat
walter slowly sits
lucas walks around the room
lucas contd too much sun
lucas points to the plant on the windowsill
too much direct sunlight
these plants dont like a lot of sun
w they grow outside dont they
sure they do
but outside theyve got trees around them
the trees shade them from the sun
of course the plants enrich the soil around the trees
one of natures symbiotic relationships
you going to take me on a nature walk
dont be witty
pause yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work but instead of getting off at your normal stop for some reason you stayed on
why did you stay on the bus walter
i fell asleep
lucas throws him a look
walter contd when i woke up i was confused
i got off at the wrong stop and walked home
lucas looks at the bus map on the wall
you walked home
lucas spits his gum into the garbage can and sits down across from walter
some of these guys
they walk right into a familys home as if they live there
very fucking ballsy
walter is silent
lucas contd this one guy on death row who ill call henry told me about his last victim
henry says how hes in the bedroom of a seven year old cutie named adele
her mothers in the living room watching tv
shes got the volume on so damn high he can hear david lettermans jokes
henry puts his hand over adeles mouth and says if you scream little girl ill kill your mother
and of course little adele doesnt scream doesnt cry doesnt make a sound
then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door
pause ten days later they find adeles body
or whats left of it
looks at walter you believe in fairy tales
do you believe in them
neither do i
pause whats the one with the woodsman
the one with the ax
i dont know
sure you do
he cuts open the wolfs stomach and the girl steps out alive
little red riding hood
little red riding hood jumps out of the wolfs guts with hardly a scratch
pause ever see a seven year old girl sodomized almost in half
walter shakes his head
lucas contd she looked so small and broken
i saw hardened twenty year veterans cry
they cried like babies
i was there
aint no fucking woodsman in this world
lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his mouth
then he rises
you knew her
lucas stares coldly at walter his face red
he looks dangerous
seething i dont know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets
it just means weve got to catch you all over again
he slaps walter on the back of the head
lucas contd see ya walter
walter rushes to the blinds drawing them down then scrambles to get his journal from the drawer
he drops to his knees tearing the pages from his journal tearing them to bits
you have no right to talk to
to speak like
i am not
i am not
the sound of children fades in and walter looks up
in the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown sitting on the red ball rocking back and forth her chin in her hands
wallie what are you doing
walter squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his ears
the sound abruptly stops
walter rides the bus
he is unshaven and looks exhausted
he is jostled by the crowds but seems oblivious
as walter walks into the warehouse men step out of the way and give him leering looks
walter walks into the locker room
a hush suddenly falls over the room
walter looks around
no one will meet his eyes
he opens his locker and a piece of paper slides out
it is a xerox of the police notification information of walter printed from the internet
walter stares at the paper
suddenly something slams next to his head
a piece of metal clangs to the floor
walter turns around
edro stares at him surrounded by a number of men
vicki stands in front of her locker holding the flyer
she looks scared
she glances at the men then walks over to walter
quiet come on lets get out of here
walter doesnt move
dont tell me you feel sorry for this sick fuck
mind your own business pedro
vicki looks defiantly at the men
bob hurries in followed by a worker
what the hell is going on here
hes handed a flyer
he looks it over and turns red
he looks at walter then the men
ob contd who did this
mary kay stands quietly in the back of the room a look of satisfaction on her face
vicki looks at her
mary kay turns and sees vickis glare
she quickly looks away
no one answers
bob looks at the men for a long moment then at walter
bob contd any man who cant deal with it can see me in my office
ill pay you for a week and you can clear out
bob crumples the paper in his hand
bob contd weve got a hell of a lot of orders today
get to work
bob turns and walks away
he men are stunned
three angrily follow after bob
as does mary kay
walter walks off without saying anything his expression blank
walter works at his station
he pauses staring at the cutting blade whirling before him
he looks up around him
after a long moment he turns the machine off and walks away
vicki looks up from where she is working and notices walters place is empty
she looks around
mary kay sits at her desk typing
have you seen walter
big fake smile lovers quarrel
vicki picks up mary kays mug and pours coffee on her lap
mary kay shrieks and stands up
vicki tears through mary kays drawers throwing contents to the floor
ary kay contd what the hell are you doing
bob walks in
what the hell is going on
icki pulls out a handful of the notification fliers
people have the right to know
if shes here tomorrow ill fucking kill her
vicki throws the papers at bob and storms out
bob looks at mary kay
vicki quickly crosses the parking lot to her jeep putting her coat on as she goes
walter rides the bus watching the landscape go by his expression stony
vicki pulls her jeep into the parking lot and screeches to a stop
she races up the stairs and knocks on walters door
she knocks again
she disappears back down the stairs
the door opens
vicki enters and turns to the superintendent standing in the doorway
i promised id take care of his plants
the super shrugs and heads back down the stairs
vicki closes the door and turns around
the place is a mess the blinds drawn
she turns on the lights
there is no sign of walter
she sees the journal scattered on the floor and leafs through the pieces
the image of the girl with red marker is stuck inside
v vicki contd shit
she picks up a couple pieces of paper and scans them then she puts the pieces together
walters words are scrawled across the paper
her hands start to shake
the bus pulls to a stop
walter gets off
walter walks down park path
a jogger runs by but otherwise it is quiet
vicki frantically gathers pieces of the journal and stuffs them in a plastic bag
her face is flushed
he stands up and stuffs the bag in the garbage then pauses staring at the garbage can
she opens the can grabs the bag quickly looks around the apartment
there is the sound of the school bell outside
she rushes to the window and raises the blinds
children pour out of the school
she quickly leaves
walter sits on a park bench in the same little field where he had encountered the girl before
he is alone
he sits still
he looks up at the trees
vicki drives the bag on the passenger seat
she comes to a stop light and looks in the rear view mirror
cop car pulls up behind her
icki reaches over for the bag and stuffs it under the seat
the light turns green
vicki drives slowly
the cop changes lanes and passes her
she lets out her breath
vicki slowly drives by a series of parks schools malls searching
children abound playing running free getting off of school buses running to meet their parents
there is no sign of walter
the girl walks into the clearing wearing her binoculars around her neck
she stops when she sees walter sitting on the bench
walter continues staring at the trees
she walks over to him
see anything interesting
the girl sits on the bench and pulls a small book from her backpack
she starts writing in it
walter watches her
w walter contd what are you writing in that book
its my bird book
she shows it to him
girl contd ive identified sixty seven species of birds this year alone
the girl writes in her book
where are your friends
she continues writing ignoring his question
walter contd dont you have friends
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
im not pretty
not in the common way
she looks at walter
what does that mean
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked
most people only notice birds with the brightest colors
the girl sits silently
walter contd whats your name
she picks up her binoculars and peers through them
walter contd linda
she continues looking but she smiles
walter contd you tell me your name ill tell you mine
yeah like the bird
pause can i ask how old you are
no youre not
i will be in three months
pause i cant wait
i hate being eleven
it has to be the stupidest age in the world
she looks at walter
robin contd whats your name
walter hesitates then shrugs
do you have many friends
a long time ago i was sent far away
when they let me come back all my friends were gone
it sounds like you were banished
birds are my friends
that sounds egotistical but they are
birds know i watch them but they dont mind because they like being watched
if they know you wont hurt them
would you like to sit on my lap
robin looks at him
would you like to sit on my lap
pause no thank you
are you sure
thank you all the same
pause do you want me to sit on your lap
walter looks at her
i would enjoy that
walter contd are you cold
she shakes her head
walter slides closer and rubs her arms with his hands
walter contd you look cold
robin is silent
walter contd i know a place in the park where only very small birds go
there are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons
its quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds
would you like me to take you there
pause they sound like finches
they could be finches
i dont know
we should go before it gets dark
he stands up
walter contd ready
robin doesnt move
my daddy lets me sit on his lap
do you like it when he asks you
she looks at him
her answer has a strange effect on walter as if for a moment he has lost his balance
carefully he sits down and stares at his hands
w why not
she is quiet
walter contd are you two alone when he asks you
walter contd does he touch you
robin looks through her binoculars
walter contd does he say strange things
she scans the trees
walter contd does he move his legs in a funny way
robin drops her head and quietly sobs
walter looks at her but makes no effort to comfort her
walter contd have you told your mother
she shakes her head
walter contd is there anyone at home you can talk to
she is quiet
walter contd is there a teacher you like at school
walter contd whats her name
kramer what your daddy does
yes you can robin
robin in silent
walter contd you said you couldnt make the sound of a solitary vireo
but you did
i heard you
what will happen if i do
someone will talk to your daddy
and then hell stop doing those things
the things you dont like
tears come to robins eyes again
but will he
your daddy will always love you
how do you know
i know because
its just something i know
i dont want to hurt my daddy
robin listen to me
she looks at him
walter struggles to find the words
walter contd at first hell be upset
its because hell realize hes been a bad daddy
then hell try
hell try very hard to be a good daddy
people will say stupid ignorant things about your daddy
that will be hard for you
but one thing i know for sure hell always love you
there is a long moment of silence
do you still want me to sit on your lap
walter stares at her
robin contd i will
walter slides away from her
i dont mind
you should go home
cant i stay a little longer
its getting dark
will i see you again
walter is silent
go home robin
robin gets up goes over to walter and hugs him
walter starts to put his arms around her but refrains
she runs off
walter looks out numb
walter approaches his building
the white volvo sits parked across the street in front of the school
walter walks a couple of more steps when the door to the volvo opens
candy gets out of the car
as he turns walter no longer sees candy but himself many years younger
walter watches fear and emotion coursing through his face
young walter leans back in and pulls the front seat forward and a young girl emerges
flash to the angel faced boy getting out of the car
candy pats him on the head
walter sees young walter pat the girl on the head
she runs off down the street
walter races towards candy
candy tucks his shirt in puts the seat back and is about to get in the car when walter calls out hey
candy whirls around
walter smashes him in the face
candy reels backwards hitting the car
walter attacks candy full force
as he punches flashes of young walter appear then candy then young walter again
he pounds and pounds on candy then finally pulls away
candy sputters on the ground
walter breathing hard stares at candy
he looks at the blood on his hands which shake uncontrollably
he slowly stands up and starts to back away
candy rolls over and groans as he tries to raise himself
walter turns tucks his head down and quickly walks away
walter stands in the living room
he looks down at the floor where the journal was and sees that nothing is there
he goes to his windows and lowers the blinds
through the window we see vicki sitting on her couch biting her nail staring off into space
the phone sits next to her
walter stands in the shower
he turns the water on and lets it run over him
slowly he begins to sob
walter stands at the bureau cleaned up and dressed in fresh clothes
he looks up and stares at himself in the mirror
the sound of traffic fades in
walter walks down a city street with boarded up store fronts
the sidewalks are wet from a steady drizzle
cars pass by on the wet pavement
as walter walks we intercut with a series of flashbacks a ext
school walter looks at the blood on his hands then at candy moaning on the ground
park robin stands in the middle of the field binoculars held to her eyes scanning the trees
extreme close up robin lowers the binoculars and stares us straight in the eye
walter stands at an intersection
the lights play across his face
cop car night walters face slams against a cop car
his hands are cuffed behind him and he is roughly frisked
he tries to look back over his shoulder but his face is held down
park robin dances in circles in the fields arms stretched out as if she is ready to fly
a car races by and walter walks along a busy street fast
the rain falls harder now
house night walter gets place in the back of the cop car
the cops get in the front seat
walter looks out the window at his house as the car pulls away
standing on the front steps his wife turns away carrying his daughter inside
a cop closes the door behind them
school walter pounds and pounds on candy
walter crosses an old brick bridge that spans a river
park robin twirls and twirls then slowly dissolves into the girl with the red ball and white nightgown
the girl spins and spins her dress fluttering in the wind
slowly the girl fades away so the field is empty except for a number of small birds fluttering around the ground
walter stands outside vickis door
after a moment he knocks
the door opens to show vicki
she stares at walter
through the window we see vicki sit down on the couch and walter sit on the coffee table facing her
he starts to talk and takes her hand
she pulls it away
he continues to talk and takes her hand again not letting her pull away
trucks pass by over the wet pavement rattling the windows
the school is quiet the playground empty
swings sway listlessly in the breeze
the old chevy pulls into the parking lot
walter brings his duffel bag into his living room and sets it down next to a clothes hamper
boxes are scattered about the space
theres a knock on the door
the door opens and lucas enters
l hi ya walter
walter automatically sits down in the chair
what can i do for you sergeant lucas
lucas walks over to the window
you dont know
ill be asking the questions
pause last night you hear anything unusual
man was badly beaten across the street
you know anything about that
i was asleep
pause i didnt say what time the assault occurred
you said last night
i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i went to bed around seven
lucas gives him a look
walter contd i wasnt feeling well
i could take you downtown
itd be a waste of your time though
walter starts folding his clothes and placing them in the duffle bag
there was a boy there
walter is silent
lucas watches him closely
lucas contd he i
d the assailant
the description matches you pretty well
i suppose if youre looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty medium height medium weight medium build
probably not too many men fit that bill
just give me a straight answer walter cause the irony goes right over my head
lucas walks around
walter folds a shirt
lucas contd thats a nasty scratch on your neck
i have a passionate girlfriend
whats with the boxes
youre a cop
figure it out
id say youre moving
its a free country isnt it
lucas throws him a look
walter contd just kidding
im moving in with my girlfriend
lucas raises his brows then takes out a piece of gum
the passionate one
then id say youre a lucky fellow
i count my blessings
well i guess ill be seeing you
lucas pops the gum in his mouth and heads towards the door
walter pauses in his folding
think youll catch this guy
well catch him
unfortunately the victim cant talk
in addition to his other injuries his jaw is broken
walter is silent
lucas contd however we ran an i
on the victim
turns out hes wanted in pennsylvania
he raped a boy there
lucas watches walter who impassively unrolls and rolls the same pair of socks
lucas contd you sure you dont know nothing about this
lucas looks at walter for a moment
stay out of trouble walter
cause ill be watching you
walter realizes he unrolled the socks
he tosses them in the duffel bag
walter stares out the passenger window
the sun is low on the horizon
walter wears a pressed button down shirt
he is clean shaven and his hair neatly combed
his hand fidgets in his lap
vicki reaches for his hand then something catches her eye
vicki contd hey look
walter follows her gaze
vicki contd starlings
n the horizon a flock of starlings whirl and turn as if one huge body a dancing cloud against the sky
i heard they were filthy birds
not when they fly
vicki looks at him and smiles
there is a long beat as they drive
vicki sits in her car smoking
she stubs out her cigarette
the ashtray is full
she looks out the window
ickis pov walter and a woman stand in the distance near the water
the woman looks a few years younger than walter
there is space between them
walter faces her but she looks out at the water
after a long moment he reaches to touch her arm
the woman pulls away and yells something at him
walters head drops
icki lights another cigarette
she flips on the radio to country music blocking out all sound
she looks back out the window
the woman yells angrily then falls quiet staring at walter
after a long moment she turns and walks back up the hill to her car where carlos waits leaning against the car
annette gets in the car slamming the door
carlos pauses looking at walter then gets in the car and turns on the engine to leave
walter stays standing near the water
i saw my sister
walter sits in his usual seat across from rosen
it was hard
rosen is silent
walter contd shes still really hurt
i dont know
if she will ever
walter contd i understand that
i just hope
i just want her to
rosen contd its going to take time walter
to himself time
how do you feel about that
walter looks at rosen who nods
there is a moment of silence between them
