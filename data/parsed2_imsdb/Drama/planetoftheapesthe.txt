planet of the aples back screenplay by michael wilson based on novel by pierre boulle may stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space
the belt of orion is center screen but much nearer and larger than ever seen by an earth bound astronomer
a speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen
no spaceship can be seen but only a glowworm a solitary sperma tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe
over this we hear the voice of an astronaut
he is concluding a report
so ends my last signal until we reach our destination
we are now on automatic a mere hundred and five light years from our base
and at the mercy of com puters
ive tucked in my crew for the long sleep
ill join them presently
the cabin is neither cramped nor spacious but about the size of the presidents cabin in air force one
in the immediate f
is a console of dials and switches flanked by four chairs
only one of the chairs is occupied
the astronauts back is to camera
there is a ladder amidships which leads to an escape hatch
the after dart of the cabin is obscured in darkness
we hear the music of a mozart sonata emanating from a phonograph of stereotape
the astronaut is speaking into a microphone
within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from cape kennedy
by our time that is
he pauses looking up at one clock is marked self time but instead of twelve numerals it has twenty four
one of the needles is moving very slowly
the other clock is labeled earth time and its units like those of a tachometer are given by hundreds and thousands
the largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second
over this we hear o
but according to dr
hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light old mother earth has aged a few thousand years since our de parture while we
have scarcely aged at all
this is taylor
he wears simple dungarees or churchill suit and comfortable boots
he seems calm and pensive
extracting the butt of a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees he lights it then continues it may be so
this much is probable the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves and those if any who read this message are a
hopefully a better one
he begins to roll up his left sleeve
i leave the twentieth century without regret
who was it
said modern man is the missin a link between the ape and the human being
he removes the cigar from his mouth turns to look out through one of the portholes into the astral night
one final thought nothing scientific purely personal
seen from up here everything looks different
time bends and space is boundless
it squashes a mans ego
he begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity
and he is nagged by a question ahat if any thing will greet us on the end of mans first journey to a star
are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies these millions of stars only one that speck of solar dust we call earth has been graced or cursed by
pause i have to doubt it
he extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects it into the vein of his forearm
he continues speaking
sardonically thats about all
i wonder if man that marvel of the universe that glorious paradox who has sent me to the unknown
still makes war against his brother
and lets his neighbors children starve
taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in a drawer of the console
well then earthmen a missing link salutes you
bless you my descendants
taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the hypodermic
then flicking a switch au cut off the mozart he rises and looks up again at the longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per second
the shortest needle points to the numeral
space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness for taylor walks the short distance from the console to the after section without particular effort
camera follows him and we can now see four glass capsules or caskets in the rear of the cabin
taylor looks down at them
one of them is open
the other three are occupied by astronauts dodge landon and stewart
they too wear dungarees and boots
dodge and landon are thirtyish clean shaven virile americas finest
stewart is a handsome young woman her hair bobbed short
their eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing yet no undertaker could make them so alive
he grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into it
camera moves in as taylor dulls the glass lid shut and secures it
he adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies back buckling his safety belt
camera moves into a closeup of taylor
his eyes are open
he seems serene even enraptured
note credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to convey a sense of loneliness of separation and of the passage of time
we see a strange and distant planet
at first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen but with each new view it comes closer and looms larger as if observed from a spaceship in
a spiraling orbit of descent
the topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own
much of it is obscured by cloud cover even more of it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue
we can however make out a few narrow green belts and a patch of blue water
in the final shots of this sequence we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet
it appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles
the water is blue black the pinnacles vermillion
this is the lake powell location at lone rock
four empty pilot seats are seen in f
the four glass caskets in b
we hear the rhythmic bleat of a warning signal a rush of wind as in a rapid descent and perhaps the roar of retrojets
then a great crash as the craft hits water
the whole ship shudders on impact
loose equipment falls to the cabin floor
camera moves down the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and holds on the four glass caskets
there are three loud metallic clicks as the glass domes of the caskets swing open automatically
he now has a full beard
his eyes come open
instantly alert he rises to a sitting position gazing across at they too awaken and sit up starring at taylor
they too are bearded
you all right
he glances at the casket beside his own
struggling to his feet stewart
its dome remains unopened
the young woman is a skeleton in a churchill suit
dodge and landon have joined taylor and stare at the grinning skull of their dead comrade
a low descending hum of equipment is heard
simultaneously the lights begin to fade
a moment later they brighten but not as much as before
there goes our primary power
were on auxilliary
a slight cracking sound is heard
taylor turns quickly away and o
a trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the cabin
taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut
water the porthole is no more than six inches above the line
in the distance we discern a shoreline of red desert
were in the soup
the leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water
taylor turns away from the porthole calling dodge
read the atmosphere
dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and mounts it
taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward the console and addresses landon who is still staring at stewarts skeleton
send a last signal
dazed what signal
that weve landed
as landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f
we are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles
there is no sign of vegetation anywhere
camera pans down to a body of water that could be the bay of an inland sea
the deep blue of the sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline
camera holds on the stricken spaceship wallowing like a beached whale a hundred yards offshore
the portholes of the craft are beneath the water and only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible
the red hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it
suddenly a snorkel like tube sprouts from the escape hatch which is located amidships
dodge standing halfway up the ladder
has fastened a kit of gauges to the end of the snorkel tube
he reads the dials removes the kit sniffs the air in the tube and then taking a deep breath announces its breathable
blow the hatch before we lose auxilliary power
dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch
the spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing
the lights dim again and the sound of the warning signal fades
while landon fiddles with the radio taylor tries to get the tape recorder rolling but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises
its no use
there she goes
the escape hatch is now open
taylor darts over to the ladder and passes a folded life raft up to dodge
when landon reaches the ladder taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks and landon climbs through the escape hatch
taylor is about to follow with a third rucksack then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at both clocks have stopped the red needle of the clock
labeled self time rests on the numeral the red needle of the clock marked earth time rests on the numeral
dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and tosses it into the water
he and landon jump into the water and climb onto the raft as taylor emerges from the hatch taylor slips into the water and climbs onto the raft
he and landon begin to paddle toward shore while dodge immediately opens another kit and takes a sample of the water
half to himself briny
twenty five percent salinity
near the saturation point
looking back shes still sinking
only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible
the craft vanishes beneath the water
dodge is still busy with his kit
landon is still looking back but taylor doesnt bother to turn his head
flatly were here to stay
they gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the shore
where are we
have any notion skipper
confidently were some three hundred and twenty light years from earth
on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion
looks off at the sun that could be bellatrix
low on the horizon seen through a dense envelope of dust particles
too red for bellatrix
landon glances skeptically at taylor
you didnt have time to check the tapes so you dont really know do you
as taylor ignores him what went wrong
sardonically we werent programmed to land in water
grinning the question landon is not so much where we are as when we are
stands up in raft weve had a nice snooze
lets start earning all our back pay
as the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the raft ashore
take your soil test dodge
ill check the equipment
dodge moves inland about ten yards removes a small hand drill from his belt extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings
taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks
landon sits down on the beach
hands around his knees gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship
during this and succeeding scenes we sense that dodges obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more human for he has
many fears to control while taylor detached cool and misanthropic is something of an enigma
calls dodge got your sensors
taking inventory one pistol
twenty four rounds of ammo
two medical kits
loudly to the others weve enough food and water for three days
but how long is a day
turning landon check your communications kit
he seems not to have heard
join the expedition
crossing to his kit i was thinking of stewart
what dyou suppose happened
flatly air leak
died in her sleep
you dont seem very cut up about it
its a little late for a wake
shes been dead nearly a year
then weve been away from earth for eighteen months
by our time
smiling at landon youve turned gray
landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as taylor adds lightly apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man whos two thousand and thirty one years
casually i read the clocks
they bear out hassleins hypothesis
weve been away from earth for two thousand years give or take a decade
pause still cant accept it huh
long pause you know it
because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for theyre dust
if we cant get back its still just a theory
its a fact landon
youll sleep better
dodge enters scene
a handful of reddish sand dribbles through his fingers
nothing will grow here
theres just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates
any sign of dangerous ionization
if theres no life here weve got just seventy two hours to find it
thats when the groceries run out
he picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on
the others follow suit
decisively pointing west that way
any particular reason
none at all
he moves out
camera pans with them
they have gone only a few paces when taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts
landon is squatting in the sand sticking something into the soil
it is a small american flag the size of a handkerchief
mirth bubbles up in taylors throat
he explodes with wild laughter
he is still laughing as they move out
they descend from the plateau ochre dunes across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire black dunes
jagged bolts of lightning flash across the sky but bring no rain and thunder claps sound like heavy artillery
gray area several huge boulders are dislodged and the three astronauts run
wildly to escape the falling rocks
when the avalanche ends they sprawl on the lifeless sands breathing heavily and drenched with sweat surrounded by enormous boulders
taylor looks about him
everybody all right
murmurs of assent from dodge and landon
taylor rummages through a limp rucksack comes up with some empty food cartons rummages again coming up with a cigar butt
dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it
dodge lies back and looks up at the sky
it doesnt add up
theres a mantle of dust around this planet and yet its as humid as a jungle
thunder and lightning and yet no rain
cloud cover every night and that strange luminosity and yet no moon
landon also looks up at the sky
if only we could get a fix
needling him what would you learn
ive told you where you are and when you are
gently taylor quit riding him
harshly to landon youre more than three hundred light years from your precious planet
your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries
even if you could get back theyd think you were something that fell out of a tree
wearily all right theres only one reality left
were here and its now
you get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead
quietly im prepared to die
taylor turns to dodge throws up his hands
hes prepared to die
doesnt that make you misty
chalk up another victory for the human spirit
dodge rises and moves off o
either embarrassed by this colloquy or unwilling to hear it again
taylor cigar clamped between his teeth spins toward landon
straighten me out on something
why did you come along at all
a beat no answer ill tell you
they nominated you for the big one and you couldnt turn it down
not without losing your all american standing hard climb off me will you
and the glory dont forget that
theres a life sized bronze statue of you somewhere
its probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate
but never let it be said we forget our heroes
im telling you oh and one last item
you wanted to go on forever
pause well you damn near made it
except for dodge and me youve lived longer than anybody
and with stewart dead it looks like were the last of the strain
you got what you wanted kid
how does it taste
taylor lies down spent of his venom pillowing his head on a rucksack
you read me well enough
why cant i read you
dont bother looking off dodge
hes not like me at all
but he makes sense
held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew
i understand why hes here
youre no seeker
but im not prepared to die
heatedly id like to know why not
you thought life on earth was meaningless
you despised people
so what did you do
you ran away
taylors eyes are closed
he is silent for a moment
when he speaks his tone is soft reflective
no not quite landon
im a bit of a seeker myself
but my dreams are a lot emptier than yours
pause i cant get rid of the idea that somewhere in the universe there must be a creature superior to man
who has been wandering around studying the boulders and the barren soil
taylor and landon can be seen in b
dodge spots something and squats down to examine it
it is a tiny desert flower no more than an inch high
his eyes light up as he calls taylor
as taylor and landon hurry over and kneel down on either side of dodge
the astronauts hover over the tiny flower like three magi perceiving the infant deliverer
he digs gently around the roots of the plant with a small instrument
where theres one theres another
lets find them all
absolute desolation ochre area
the astronauts start down the canyon
as they move across the terrain top of crazy canyon
as they jump across a gap
thunder and lightning again top of crazy canyon
they march across crazy canyon overlook
wire grass canyon
for a brief moment several creatures appear
we cannot identify the species
blooming tamarisks border a
dry stream bed
taylor and landon hover over dodge who is probing the soil with his drill
their dungarees and faces are caked with dust
its a stream bed
no doubt about it but bone dry
landon strightens up and looks off startled by something he sees
with the astronauts in f
in the distance on the skyline we can make out a long row of wooden crosses
some animal or vegetable matter appears to be tied to the crosses
lets take a look
taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks followed by dodge and landon
their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured
camera holds on the distant crosses
for an instant only three creatures again appear on the skyline near the crosses
then they vanish
as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket nearer to the base of the cliff
they halt and look up at we can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to the crosses and thus mounted in a long row seem to
make a boundary or serve as a warning
the living bipeds are no longer visible
dodge and landon are still looking up at the strange crosses but taylor is scanning the terrain at the base of the cliff
the sound of rushing water can be heard
half to himself never mind the scarecrows
he breaks into a run camera panning with him as he moves toward a declivity in the face of the cliff
agonized with thirst they follow taylor
for an instant we see the bipeds again moving in the same direction
he scrambles up a rock strewn gorge and looks off at the terrain beyond
the cascade is not spectacular but the vegetation around it is startlingly lush
this location is not at lake powell but at the ranch
his parched lips break into a smile
the cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool
thick foliage grows to its very edge
dodge is on his hands and knees testing the liquid with his kit
the others wait expectantly
its loaded with minerals but safe
without further ado landon ducks his face into the pool
dodge scoops up water in his hands and drinks
taylor follows suit
coming up for air can we take a dip
looks around okay
landon and dodge immediately remove their boots strip down and plunge into the pool
but taylor does not yet disrobe
alert and curious he strolls along the bank of the pool looking around
as he briefly looks around then starts taking off his shirt
as they arrive at opposite shore
as landon sees something on shore
as he swims across
look at this dodge and taylor climb out of the pool and squat beside landon
the print of a large five toad foot is clearly visible in the wet sand
taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush scanning the ground for other sports
our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b
is partially obscured by broad leafed foliage directly in front of camera which pans slowly away from the waterfall and holds on the astronauts clothing at the edge of the
suddenly and inexplicably a pair of dungarees slithers away into the underbrush
a few seconds pass
now a pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the screen blocking our view
or is it human
the hair is matted the face bearded the jaw prognathous the orbital rim prominent
a brown thick fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and plucks at a boot
the boot vanishes
dodge is standing near taylor and looking back at the spot where they left their clothing
suddenly he seizes taylors arm and points silently at the far bank of the pool
another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears
led by taylor they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank
emerging from the water they look around in bewilderment
taylor makes hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance
the three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle or rain forest
little sunlight penetrates this dense vegetation
these shots are intercut with fleeting forms as yet unidentified trembling foliage brown shadows against a green backdrop
who stop at the edge of the clearing startled by a number of primitive bipeds male and female scarcely visible behind trees and bushes on the other side of the
clearing here a face there a portion of a head and torso
throughout this sequence the primitives are never seen clearly or at close range
they speak in whispers
they look almost human
they theres a herd of them
show them were friendly
camera pulls back as taylor advances a few steps into the clearing extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician
there are perhaps a dozen of them
they shrink back as taylor advances hostile frightened or both
we now see that some of them are clutching articles of the astronauts clothing and equipment
taylor stops stares at them glumly
try telling them our names
taylor grimaces at landon
well if were looking for an icebreaker
turning to the creatures listen folks
more shrinking back by the frightened primitives
softly im afraid they arent having any
a pistol goes off with a deafening crash and the primitive creatures scatter in panicky flight
after a while quiet returns to the jungle
they examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to don whatever is able to be worn
taylor puts on what remains of a ripped pair of trousers dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of the kit it is a torn shelter half
landon like taylor has the remains of his pants
they didnt leave much did they
shall we follow them
havent much choice
as they walk off down the jungle path
this need not be a cultivated grove
a few trees peach or apricot or avocado it matters not grow wild in a pleasant glade
nor is the grove extensive
the three astronauts sit under a tree in f
the primitives sit under a clump of trees some fifty yards away
each camp is feeding and warily watching the other
in the distance beyond the fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field
they too are sitting under trees munching fruit
there are no more than a dozen altogether
well at least they havent tried to bite us
blessed are the vegetarians
squatting on her haunches eating fruit gazing back at taylor
her hair is long and black her skin nut brown her face hauntingly lovely and hauntingly stupid
this is nova
landon looks o
at the primitives
we got off at the wrong stop
youre our optimist look at the bright side
if thats the best there is around here in six months well be running this planet
they appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm
the primitives get to their feet sniffing listening puzzled and alarmed by the primitives behavior they too get to their feet
think theyll attack us
taylor turns looks back at from which they recently emerged
there is no sign of life
they suddenly run laterally across the grove heading back toward their jungle
a rumble becomes audible it is the sound of hoofbeats
twelve horsemen suddenly emerge from the trees riding abreast at a canter like a squadron of cavalry about to charge
the horses look huge
so do the riders but at this distance we cannot identify them
cut off from their natural habitat they reverse direction and flee toward the tall grasses of the savanna or cultivated field
with an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop
the hunt is on
stupefied frozen in place
we hear a rifle shot then a flurry of shots
a bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads
they run camera panning with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep b
as the horsemen close in on the creatures fleeing on foot
he reins in raises his rifle and fires
for the first time we se that he is a gorilla
he wears a simple quasi military uniform tunic trousers and boots
running through the high grass
he is shot in the back and falls
he drops at the side of his fallen comrade
as taylor rolls him over
dodge is dead
the beaters are all gorillas
they carry long sticks and nets and their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the tall grass
a landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another
he stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him
b a third mounted gorilla flings a net over a running female
she is hopelessly entangled
this is nova
c landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain an ugly gash on his forehead
d taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees
a rider crosses his path without seeing him
e the beaters close in on taylor blocking his escape route
f taylor changes direction and decides to run for it
bent low he flees through the tall grass
a shot rings out
lying on his back
his fingers go to his throat
blood appears between his fingers
he opens his mouth in pain but no sound comes forth as taylor sinks into unconsciousness
the hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees
some of the gorillas have dismounted others are still on horseback
in the middle distance is a crude horse drawn wagon
the sides and top of the wagon form a wire cage
three captive males and one female are visible within the cage
dodge and landon are nowhere to be seen
two gorilla porters enter scene dragging a male human corpse by the ankles as two other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole
taylor dangles from the pole held aloft by the bonds around his wrists and ankles
camera pans with the two gorillas as they dump taylor into the wagon and close the tail gate
his throat is smeared with blood
his eyelids flutter as he regains consciousness
three primitive males bound hand and foot
they seem docile in captivity
the female nova clasps bound wrists around her bound ankles and gazes blankly at taylor
there is a jolt of movement as the wagon gets underway with a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from the cage
a gorilla hunter stands over a dead man one foot planted he chest of his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on abdomen
facing him is another gorilla with an old fashioned camera on a tripod
the hunter bares his teeth
the surgery is dimly lit
if possible we should be unaware of the source of illumination
taylor lies strapped to the nearer table
he appears to be unconscious
the young female captive nova is strapped to the table beside him
she is conscious
taylor is receiving a direct blood transfusion from her
hovering over taylor are a nurse and a surgeon named galen
both are chimpanzees
galen wears a bloody surgical apron the nurse a white smock
galen is removing a filthy bandage from taylors neck
a door behind them opens and dr
zira an animal psychologist enters
she too is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurses
which one was wearing the strange clothes
zira looks down at taylor
will he live
irritably i dont know
this beast lost a lot of blood
galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments
the equipment is obsolescent and the room untidy like that of a callous small town veterinarian
to nurse theres no probe here
zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table
her voice is soft and well modulated
this place is dirty doctor
defensively these animals are dirty doctor
they stink and they carry communicable diseases
why arent they cleaned up before theyre brought here
his eyes come open
over this we hear o
you dont sound happy in your work
im nothing more than a vet in this laboratory
taylor feebly turns his head and looks at nova
she returns his gaze with an unchanged empty stare
we sense that taylor realizes her blood is flowing into his veins
over this we hear o
you promised to speak to dr
zaius about me
but you know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees
taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes
weak as he is we see his astonishment at hearing them talk
as the nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to dr
galen who protests to zira but the quota systems been abolished
you made it
why cant i
what do you mean made it
im an animal psychologist thats all
we dont have any authority
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment
thats because dr
zaius realizes our work has value
the foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral function in these animals
theyre still dirty
and their bite is septic
look at that
he shows zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand
to nurse hold his head
the nurse complies gripping taylors skull with both hands
galen leans down and begins to probe the throat wound
taylor passes out
the cages are no larger than small jail cells
there are four of them
bars not walls divide the cages so that all four are visible
each of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male
at the moment the first two are quiet dozing or scratching apathetically
the third occupant is stolidly regarding a half dozen brightly colored hollow wooden boxes or blocks of varying sizes and proportions on the floor of his cage
he is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead
he has correctly selected the first two large sturdy blocks for his tower under the banana but the tall third block is too unstable on its small base to support
the broad based fourth block
taylor looking much stronger sits on a pile of dirty straw in the fourth cage
there is a clean bandage around his throat
he watches the block building primitive with contemptous amusement
both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive tries to mount his tower
he stands there staring dully at the scattered blocks then up at the unattainable banana
a door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named julius enters dressed in a keepers uniform
he quickly closes the door snatches up a broom starts sweeping
julius is obviously late for work
taylor struggles to his feet moves to the bars of the cage tries to call out
the three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages
julius barks at them
points at taylor you especially
the third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks
julius comes up to taylors cage indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its floor extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead
better give it a try stupid
unless you like going hungry
he returns to his sweeping
taylor glowers at him
a moment later the door at the end of the aisle opens and dr
good morning dr
good morning julius
hows our patient today
the minute you open the door he goes into his act
she starts down the aisle toward taylors cage
he grasps the bars awaiting her anxiously
as she passes the second cage the primitive in it shakes the bars jumps up and down
his tongue is hanging out
zira smiles stops digs into the pocket of her smock
playfully well what do we want this morning
do we want something
come on speak
the primitive continues to jump up and down energetically
zira takes a cube of sugar from her pocket holds it up for his inspection
do we want some sugar old timer
the man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars
she drops the cube in his hands
he jams it into his mouth
concerned you could get hurt doing that doctor
dont be silly
hes perfectly tame
she moves toward taylors cage julius behind her
theyre all tame until they take a chunk out of you
taylor starts to open his mouth as zira comes up to the bars
well bright eyes is our throat feeling better
frantic mouthing listen listen i can speak he winces puts his hand to the bandage
sympathetically awww it still hurts doesnt it
he keeps pretending he can talk
taylor glares at julius slams the bars
mouthing im not pretending
i can talk
zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast docket of her smock starts to scribble
excitedly did you see that
hes trying to form words
well you know what they say
human see human do
taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook
he stops mouthing points at them
taylor gestures for zira to come closer to the bars
he seems to want something
she advances tentatively toward the cage
id be careful doctor
taylor suddenly reaches through the bars tries to snatch the pen and notebook from zira
julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the bars hitting taylor in the ribs
what did i tell you
to taylor try that again ill break your arm
zira draws back looking at taylor in surprise
his face is twisted in frustration
mouthing whats the matter with you
i can talk
cant you see that
over this a door is heard opening o
and julius voice nervous deferential o
good morning your excellency
taylor looks o
julius and zira cross to a stout imposing orangutan who has just entered the laboratory
julius bows to him
this is dr
like the other apes he wears a simple tunic and trousers but his garments are of a costlier material and several decorations are woven into the sash of his tunic
zaius im so glad you could come
hes over here
zaius crosses with them to taylors cage
beneath his austere manner we sense tension worry
zira looks up at taylor her tone an appeal
bright eyes show him
do your trick
taylor just glares at her
silent mouthing my name isnt bright eyes its taylor
can you believe it
i looks like hes talking
evenly yes amusing
a man who acts like an ape
taylor turns to zaius
silent mouthing im not acting
i can talk
how much proof do you want
zaius i could have sworn he was answering you
nodding but unmoved he shows a definite gift for mimicry
zira wiggles her fingers excitedly
i wonder how held score on a hopkins manual dexterity test
zaius voice is quiet but there is steel in it
taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers
hes moving his fingers
he saw you moving yours
but perhaps he understood he is pleading silently as zaius voice is heard over the shot
hard man has no understanding dr
he can be taught a few simple tricks
i beg to disagree
according to my exper iments a warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at taylor
a word to the wise dr
experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing
im all for it
fear clouds his eyes
abruptly he stops moving his lips
zaius sees the effect his words have had on taylor
he turns to zira goes on in a more detached tone
but your behavioral studies are another matter entirely
to suggest that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is nonsense
besides men are a nuisance
they outgrow their own food supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our crops
looking casually at taylor the sooner theyre exterminated the better
he turns toward the door
a disappointed zira follows him
zaius looks back at taylor just before going out
its a question of simian survival
he stares after zaius than looks away slumps to the floor
a pause then a voice is heard
is this the one you wanted doctor
yes thank you
pause her voice much closer bright eyes
taylor looks up
ive got a present for you
standing outside the cage held on a leash by an ape guard is nova
she looks at taylor without expression
zira gestures at julius
put her in with him
julius unlocks the cage door leads nova inside removes her leash and collar
taylor has gotten to his feet
julius goes out locking the door behind him
nova hesitates then slowly reaches out takes taylors hand
zira beams at them
it is nothing elaborate a wire fence encloses a dirt yard
this compound is situated on the outskirts of apetown and the town is visible in the distance
there are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure no more than a third of them females
some of them trudge around the dusty yard like convicts in a penitentiary
others squat against the sun drenched wall
a big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it
several guides armed with whips and torches immediately close in on him
the primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives circle
he plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound
nova is at his heels
he ignores her
once again he looks off stops suddenly
nova bumps into him
he turns impatiently shoos her away then looks o
zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee dr
he wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers
cornelius glances surreptitiously around covertly takes ziras hand
do you have to work tonight
neither do i
he gives her a quick peck on the cheek
he drifts toward the fence nova behind him
they come up to the fence
zira nods toward taylor
thats bright eyes
the one i was telling you about
whats so special about him
to taylor hello bright eyes
hows our throat today
taylor stares at her impassively then looks around to a that no guards are watching hunkers down begins to scratch in the dust
nova extends unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat
taylor flinches pushes her hand away
nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her own forearm then searches for a similar bruise on taylors forearm
excited look she remembers
the blood transfusion
peeved zira come on
you know they cant he stops looking off oh oh
here comes number one
taylor looks up and o
who is approaching the two scientists from deep b
zaius is followed by a huge and much decorated gorilla whom we recognize as the leader of the hunt club
in a whisper to cornelius somethings bothering him
hes been prying around the lab for the last two days
as zaius comes nearer good morning dr
you know dr
cornelius my fiance
cornelius bows respectfully
zaius is patronizingly polite
oh yes the young ape with a shovel
i hear youre planning another archeological expedition
he has stepped back from the marks he made in the dust is watching zaius with concern
if the academy agrees
the project will require my support of course
a primitive male squats down to see what taylor has marked on the ground
in letters a foot high he has written nova at once petulant and playful erases the write with a bare foot
taylor angrily flings her aside
this violence provokes the primitive male who snarls at taylor and cuffs him
over this we hear from a distance o
i hope i can count on it sir
s a friendly warning cornelius when youre digging for artifacts dont bury your reputation
taylor slugs the snarling male who wades in trying to bite him
two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight
one of them lashes out with his whip
the other pokes his torch at taylor
its flame brushes his arm
taylor opens his mouth gives a silent yell of pain shrinks back
zira runs to the fence
to guards stop
youve hurt him
take them inside
prodding the malcreants with their torches the two guards herd them toward a doorway in the wall
zira hurries around the side of the fence and o
cornelius if you have a moment today id like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail
eagerly certainly sir
ill get my notes and come right over
he exits hurriedly
the hunt club leader turns to zaius
i dont understand these animal psychologists
zira trying to prove
that man can be domesticated
the hunter guffaws
zaius turns away and looks down at just beyond the fence we can make out the letters zaius extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence
the foot wipes out the letters
his face is a mask
he is slumped against the bars of the cell gingerly touching a large reddening blotch on his arm
julius watches him uncertainly from a few yards away
in the b
the outside door opens and zira rushes in hurries down the aisle
those fools and their torches
do you have any ointment
he moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory rummages through some drawers
zira comes up to taylors cage studies him solicitously
im sorry bright eyes
he looks steadily at zira who is only an arms length away
camera moves in on them
suddenly taylor reaches out snatching the pen and notebook from the pocket of her smock
zira leaps back with a cry
julius grabs a club races up to the cage unlocks the door
i told you what youd get
taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper
the guard moves in his club upraised
pleading julius dont
it doesnt matter
julius swings his club at taylors head
taylor lifts his right arm to ward off the blow and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand
he drops the pen and notebook
the guard swings again driving taylor to the wall
then julius retrieves the stolen articles
the guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment natural born thieves arent they
zira glances at the notebook
her face clouds
a hasty almost illegible scrawl her eyes afire with a wild surmise
her eyes never leave taylor as she tells the guard get me a collar and leash
im taking him to the infirmary
hes vicious doctor
besides its against the rules
do as i say
the guard shrugs and moves off
zira beckons to taylor
he comes forward to the bars of the cage
sotto voce you wouldnt hurt me would you
the office is simple almost spartan
there are books but no bric a brac several painted portraits of great apes but no tape recorder or other modern office equipment
taylor sits at a desk scribbling furiously on a sheet of paper
his leash has been removed but not his collar
zira stands at his elbow
cornelius paces nervously up and down reading a sheaf of notes taylor has already written
stubbornly its a stunt
humans dont write
dear youre a scientist
dont you believe your own eyes
to taylor where did you learn to do this
taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad rips off the page hands it to cornelius
jefferson public school fort wayne indiana
he looks at taylor narrowly
sardonically back on that planet you say you came from
taylor nods again um hm
to zira he may be intelligent but hes also mad
taylor scribbles something else on the pad hands it to zira points at cornelius
reads aloud and youre a fool
now just a minute oh cornelius be quiet
taylor has resumed writing
he hands the sheet to zira who reads aloud
dodge was killed in the hunt
what happened to landon
looking at taylor i dont know
scornfully and they fell out of the sky with you
taylor writes quickly hands the note to zira
reading not fell flew
taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper
flight is a scientific impossibility
and even if it werent why fly
where would it get you
taylor points to the floor and mouths the word here
he flings the paper plane he has just fashioned into the air
it describes a graceful arc around the room and lands at the feet of cornelius who slowly picks it up then exchanges a long glance with zira
softly well now
taylor scribbles on a piece of paper hands it to zira
reading do you have maps
cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk crosses to a wall map designed like a window shade
he pulls it down taylor and zira join him at the map
its not a map of the whole planet of course but only of that portion known to the apes
therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect of a map drawn by some babylonian cartographer
a swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea
in the southwest quadrant are the greenbelts of the ape civilization looking on the map like jade stones strung on crescent shaped necklace
rubyidots in the lade indicate ape communities
the northwest quadrant colored brown is apparently uninhabited
east of the green belts is a patch of green savanna and next to it the darker green of a jungle
the eastern quadrants are rendered in yellow and except for a blue lake appear to be lifeless desert and barren mountain
this area is marked forbidden using a pointer cornelius orients taylor indicating a red dot in the middle of the green belt
we are here
moving pointer you were captured about here
taylor studies the map then pointing at the lake in the eastern desert he goes into a brief charade dramatizing the astronauts landing and trek
interpreting his movements you fell in the water here
you came ashore
you marched across the desert
many days and nights
and reached the jungle
taylor nods smiles gratefully
flatly out of the question
taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration
annoyed cornelius why do you insist on provoking him
tapping map no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone
ive been there
ive seen it
taylor strides to the desk writes something hands it to zira
reading then how do you account for me
and im not going to try
but what about your theory
the existence of someone like taylor might prove it
shushing her zira are you trying to get my head cut off
dont be foolish
if its true theyll have to accept it
no they wont taylor touches zira on the arm makes a gesture of inquiry
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis quickly its probably wrong that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man
in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time the evidence was very meager you didnt think so then
that was before dr
zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy
how can scientific truth be heresy
what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed
a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape taylor bangs his fist on the desk mouths the word no
scribbles something on a piece of paper
hes touchy isnt he
taylor thrusts the sheet at zira who reads it aloud
i am not a missing link
because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls arent worth their parchment
well maybe theyre not
no thank you
i wont get into that battle
oh cornelius show some strength
zira listen to me
weve got a fine future ahead of us
im up for a raise at that moment there is a
loud rap at the door o
zaius enters with another portly figure dr
maximus is an orangutan
zaius not unkindly did you forget our appointment cornelius
i was just assembling my notes
you know dr
maximus our commissioner for animal affairs
its a pleasure to see you again
he hurries to his desk starts gathering papers
maximus notes taylor with distaste
what is that
a man dr
i know its a man
and you know the rules
no animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash
during the ensuing exchange zaius wanders idly through the office
he glances at the scattered handwritten notes but does not read them
meanwhile a rattled zira replies to maximus
but this creature is a special case
were conducting a new experiment
wouldnt it more properly be done in your office
the gorilla guards enter from outside
return this beast to the compound
he regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him
one picks up his leash
over the shot we hear o
zira stiffens looking at zaius
he is holding the paper plane fashioned by taylor
it floats on the air
faint defiance try it
a warning zira
zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand then back to zira
he smiles tolerantly
he crumples the paper plane into a b all
drops it on the desk
the ape hooks the leash to taylors collar starts leading him out
zira follows them
the caged primitives are asleep
julius the keeper dozes in a chair outside taylors cage
camera pivots moving in on taylor who is lying on his side also asleep
nova is curled up behind him
at the sound of a door opening she comes instantly awake sitting up and clutching taylors arm
he comes groggily awake raising his head in time to hear o
whats up lieutenant
two gorilla officers have just entered the compound
they wear side arms
julius has just risen from his chair
were taking number four over to surgery in five minutes
have him ready
the beasts throat is nearly healed
snickering its not his throat this time
the vets going to geld him
he stiffens but does not move
the apes of course speak freely in front of him believing the animal cannot understand
zira wont like it
she wants this pair to mate
as the lieutenant replies these orders came from dr
theres nothing she can do about it
the two gorillas exit
the guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and leash
pushing nova aside taylor rises
as julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches taylor carrying the collar and leash
murmuring if only you knew bright eyes what theyre going to do
raising collar stand still now
dont give me any trouble
the heel of taylors right palm crashes into the keepers chin nearly snapping his neck
julius falls unconscious
taylor leans over him taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt
the male has awakened
he stares stupidly at taylor
nova is whimpering little strange cries of fear
taylor moves o
he leaves the cage moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits
barefoot taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door
which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half open door of a guard room
we hear a murmur of ape voices and laughter
taylor fumbles with the keys finds one that fits the lock and opens the door
he emerges quietly locking the door behind him
two tethered horses can be seen in deep b
and another gust of laughter can be heard from the nearby guard room
taylor looks off
as already established the animal compound is situated on the outskirts of the apes community
the strange skyline of the town can be seen in the distance
he starts to cross an open field outside the compound
at that moment we hear a shrill police whistle from the guard room
taylor breaks into a run
as the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward their horses
he runs down the road starts across the long causeway that bisects a small lake looking over his shoulder
the community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane
there are no power lines no street lamps indeed no streets as such but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall
the architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and less rococo work of antonio gaudi columns and pillars of brick or exterior masonry look like the trunks
and branches of great trees and suggest an arboreal past
a small number of apes are visible on the mall taylor darts behind the buttress of a building casing the situation
he looks back at the two mounted gorilla police can be seen on the causeway galloping straight toward camera
it is evident they will soon spot taylor
he retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the building
the vestibule is nothing no set required a dark space through which taylor moves toward a shaft of light
we hear faintly the discordant chords of an organ
or is it an organ
at any rate a strange and melancholy tune
taylor arrives at a font
he appears out of darkness into half light
the rear of the temple is obscure
taylor darts behind a screen
crouching there he observes the temple itself is small and austere
there is no altar but against a plain backdrop we see a statue of the lawgiver a great ape holding a book
below the lawgiver is an orangutan minister clothed in black robes
he stands in front of a closed coffin
a dozen mourners seated on comfortable wicker chairs form a semi circle around the coffin
the ape ladies wear cowls
weep if you must but make an end of sorrow
he lives again
yes he has found peace in heaven
crouching listening wide eyed
he was a model for us all a gorilla to remember hunter warrior defender of the faith
as the minister continues his eulogy a small ape boy detaches himself as children will from the group of mourners and comes marching up the aisle toward the rear of
cherished husband beloved father generous master yes he was a font of simian kindness
who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b
the small fry is coming closer
over this we hear o
the dear departed once said to me i never met an ape i didnt like
the small fry spots taylor
shrill soprano look
its a man
the mourners heads turn
taylor slinks toward the vestibule
he is aghast
in heavens name
aside to ushers get rid of that creature
two ushers rise moving past camera and o
staying close on the temple wall taylor moves stealthily away from the vestibule door
the two ape ushers appear
pointing there he is they move toward taylor
he runs out onto the mall
taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two mounted pursuers
darting off in another direction he races past startled pedestrians
they do a slow take
you see what i saw
mustve escaped from the zoo
he has spotted taylor
drawing a folded net from his saddlebag he swings it overhead like a cowboy with a lariat and gallops off in pursuit of the man
taylor runs frantically from building to building rounding corners vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall
at one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net which falls short
taylor runs on
it is an open air structure like a greek theater located near the central mail
steeply tiered it seats no more than fifty apes
the dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level
taylor enters scene running toward the amphitheater
changing direction he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel
a moment later the pursuing cop rides into scene dismounts and walks toward the amphitheater looking around for taylor
taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp encircling the amphitheater
a retaining wall shields him from the view of the apes
pausing for breath at the top of the ramp taylor crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down the cop looks around spots taylor at the top tier
and starts up after him
he starts to run back down the ramp but is suddenly confronted by his original pursuer the dismounted cop coming up the ramp
reversing direction taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes into an exit tunnel
the cop blows his whistle summoning another cop who joins him in the chase
in which we see the fugitive his pursuers and the reactions of ape shoppers and workers
a market has been set up on one side of the mall where street vendors behind carts or tables hawk their wares fruits vegetables wearing apparel etc
as taylor runs frantically through the market place several apes join the chase
in the ensuing pandemonium like the proverbial chinese fire drill several tables are overturned
taylor runs into scene pauses panting and looks back at his pursuers
then he darts through the archway into the building
for the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing
his pace slows to a walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian museum possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals primitive artifacts and fossils
possibly the skeleton of a dog a cat etc
over this we hear a shrill police whistle
he runs again
looking at the stuffed animals as taylor races past
the mother gives a startled scream
he starts after the fugitive
he runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward camera and halts abruptly in close f
shocked by stuffed and mounted dodge bares his teeth at the world
reacting in horror
he hears another police whistle and the echoing footsteps of approaching guards which mufffle his strangled gasp dodge
taylor vanishes in a blur of movement
order has been restored in the open air market
taylor bursts suddenly into view from a building on the far side of the mall running in panic from ape guards in close pursuit
a mounted policeman spots him and heads him off
changing direction taylor is intercepted by another mounted gorilla
and then a third
camera holds angling down on the center of the mall
we are witnessing a hideous game baiting the man
the mounted police do not shoot or club taylor for he cannot escape but they circle him their long whips cracking over his head
who unfolds his net swings it overhead and flings it at taylor
this time he bags his quarry
taylor gives up
spent docile entangled in the net he stands stock still in the center of the mall
guards and civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay
they regard him warily
she pushes through the simian crowd around taylor and hurries to his side
she paws at the net crying impulsively taylor whyd you run away
zira removes the net from his face
panting with exhaustion taylor flicks a wild glance at her
he looks demented
who approach taylor and zira
they are the same gorillas introduced in scene
one of them carries a collar and leash
the other presents an i
card to zira
promptly im in charge of this man
no longer madame
he is now in the custody of the ministry of science
his colleague moves toward taylor with a muzzle
he speaks at last his voice hoarse but audible
get away from me you dirty ape
the arresting officer steps back involuntarily
all the apes freeze staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we the compound is dimly lit
taylor the bandage now gone from his throat is back in his old cage
the other cages however are empty their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo
he is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner novas head cradled on his lap
idly he strokes her coarse hair
there is a dull glow of madness in his eyes and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy like a man talking to a dog
and thats when i decided to take up astronautical engineering
i was halfway through college and i
he breaks off its an old trick
the silent treatment
four weeks and three days and not a word from anyone
or that damn julius
no onell listen
his manner is now more direct and educative
but she stares in blank comprehension
she brushes his moving lips with her fingers
he shrugs wryly
me tarzan you jane
thats all right
i had a puppy once that never barked
he just licked my hand
pause hes dead now
theyre all dead
i think maybe theyll kill me too
are they afraid of me
i cant hurt them
but i threaten them somehow
threaten their faith in simian superiority
theyll have to kill me
faint footsteps are heard o
taylor and nova look in the direction of the sound
a sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes taylor in the chest
an ape guard has a high pressure hose trained on taylor
it forces him back toward the rear of the cage
julius whip in hand unlocks the cage steps inside
he unlimbers the whip
cracks it in novas direction
the jet of water hold taylor at bay
julius grabs nova begins to pull her toward the door of the cage
taylor tries to fight his way through the water toward julius
let her alone
julius swings the whip
it cracks against taylors legs biting into the skin
taylor stumbles falls to one knee where are you taking her
what are you going to do
julius drags and pushes the girl through the door slamming and locking it behind him
taylor fights through the stream of water flings himself against the bars
raging take your hands off her you black monster
julius shoves nova across the aisle to a cage opposite taylors locks her inside
why are you doing this
say something you hairy scum
julius gestures toward the ape guard turn it off
the ape guard shuts off the hose
julius strides over to taylors cage
fiercely shut up
the reason no onell talk to you is because youre a freak
i said shut up
he slashes viciously with his whip handle against taylors fingers
taylor yells in pain
julius and the ape guard start out of the compound
apes wearing clothes
its a madhouse
he sinks to the floor as the apes go out
taylor looks desolately through the bars across to novas cage
she eyes him sadly
gently now i dont even have you
pause imagine me needing someone
back on earth there was nobody
lots of them
love making ithout love
thats the kind of world it was turning into with the help of cynics like myself
so i left it because there was no one dear enough to keep me there
pause did i tell you about stewart
looking away there was a lovely girl
the most precious cargo we brought along
if human life could survive here she was to be the new eve
morosely its probably just as well she didnt live to see this
he looks at nova
she stretches her hands through the bars toward him
i wonder if its love between us
looks around smiles ironically what a place to find it
two gorilla officers enter carrying torches
these are the same apes introduced in scene
one carries a double set of manacles
julius comes to meet them
the lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from the other officer hands them to julius whispers something
julius comes over and unlocks the door of taylors cage
he advances to taylor who does not move bends down and clamps the manacles around each of his ankles
then he straightens lifts taylors arms pulls his wrists together snaps on the cuffs
taylor looks across at nova blows her a kiss
julius leads him out of the cage takes his leash from a snaps it onto taylors collar hands the other end to the lieutenant
nova and julius watch in silence as taylor is led down the aisle and out the door
taylor wearing his manacles is seated at a table in the otherwise deserted chamber
there is an empty chair on either side of him
across the room stands a dais with three rude high backed chairs
there is a small table directly below the dais
a third table stands at right angles to the dais
taylor looks around the empty room
a door is opened by a gorilla bailiff and zira and cornelius come into the room sit down on each side of taylor
a moment later dr
honorius the prosecutor and a clerk enter take their seats at the third table
softly where have you been
why didnt you come to see me
what is this
hissing be clever
be quiet all rise
everyone gets up as the president dr
zaius and dr
maximus enter and mount the dais
the president takes the center chair the other two flanking him
all sit down
pounds gavel once this ad hoc tribunal of the national academy is now in session
president of the academy presiding
on my right dr
maximus commissioner for animal affairs
on my left dr
zaius minister of science and chief defender of the faith
glancing at prosecutor appearing for the state dr
honorius deputy minister of justice
honorius rises and bows
raps gavel once let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in
contempt of the tribunal
a beat you may proceed dr
rising by your leave mr
president the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry
the president appears to be taken aback
he glances at his colleagues
you asked for the opportunity to present your case
surely you must know why youre here
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation
promptly and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine whats to be done with him
at the very least this man has the right to know whether theres a charge against him
the accused is indeed a man
therefore he has no rights under ape law
this is a man is he not
sensing that the president has given them an opening zira smiles confidently
he is unlike any man you have ever seen as we hope to prove
answer the question
is he a man
the question is the point at issue is he a man
or a deviate
or a freak of nature
as the prosecutor continues sustained
in all fairness dr
zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law
rising then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something
honorius seems confounded
zaius takes over
this man is not being tried
he is being disposed of
pointing at zira and cornelius it is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here
well put dr
let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal
both cornelius and zira appear shaken by this threat
sensing their predicament taylor rises impatiently
then ill defend myself
although the judges and prosecutor have been told that this man can speak they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice
flustered the president bangs his gavel
zira tell bright eyes to sit down
my name is taylor
the president refuses to address taylor directly
checking a document he speaks to zira
it says here that his name is bright eyes
you gave him that name yourself
voice rising this hearing is absurd
let me tell my story
pounds gavel bailiff
make the animal be quiet
the bailiff quickly crosses to taylor and shoves him roughly into his chair
state your case mr
learned judges my case is simple
it is based on our first article of faith that the almighty created the ape in his own image that he gave him a soul and a mind that he
set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet
taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper
zira and cornelius remain attentive to o
these sacred truths are self evident
the proper study of apes is apes
but certain young cynics have chosen to study man yes perverted scientists who advance on insidious theory called evolution
as the prosecutor continues there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith come to the point dr
this wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy
we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture
the state charges that dr
zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster
on her feet thatos a lie
pounding gavel mind your tongue madame
did we create his mind too
not only can this man speak
he can write
he can reason
he can reason
with the tribunals permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination
but dont turn this hearing into a farce
honorius crosses to the defendants table and favors taylor with an evil smile
tell the court bright eyes what is the second article of faith
i admit i know nothing of your culture
of course he doesnt know our culture because he cannot think
to taylor tell us why all apes are created equal
some apes it seems are more equal than others
that answer is a contradiction in terms
tell us bright eyes why do men have no souls
what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain
hands paper to zira show this to the president
zira moves toward the dais
honorius returns to his own table
since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record
read it yourself
reading aloud i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system
i am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization
on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal while the apes remained
rapping gavel stop right there
bring me that paper
zira crosses to the dais handing the statement to the president
he glances at it laughs derisively and passes it to zaius
to zira this is a joke in very poor taste
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man
glancing at document dr
zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert
i do not state it sir
the prisoner does
do you believe him
uneasily like you i find it difficult
but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished
glancing again at document you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture
this is his assertion
where are they now
blurting it out one is in a museum
pounding gavel dr
silence that man
returning to her table zira gestures to taylor to remain silent
stuffed and mounted eh
dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories
and his other companion
he doesnt know
president i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes
thats true dr
my witnesses correction my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater
i suggest we go and look at them
the president rises starts out followed by the others
taylor is last being led on a leash by the bailiff
the inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater
two apes stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in the center of the pit below the dais
there are three primitive males the female nova and landon
he is dirty and bearded but his hair is cropped close
he turns to zira his eyes shining with vindication
a whisper its him
second from the left
zaius glances at the accused
do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures
with one of them
identify him then
speak to him
taylor moves forward for a few paces stops
landon looks catatonic
his face is in shadow stunned by landons imbecility
its me taylor
taylor steps forward to grasp his arm
there is still no response
taylor takes landons head in his hands and looks at his face
there is a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium
as taylor whirls on zira
you knew about this
no i swear i never saw this man before
whirling on zaius you did this to him
youve removed his frontal lobes
turning bailiff take the prisoner inside
the bailiff jerks brutally on taylors leash pulling him toward the door leading under the amphitheater
the bailiff enters dragging taylor behind him shoves him into his chair
moments later the other apes enter the room
all take their seats but zaius
taylor glares at him furiously
president a word of explanation the creature in question suffered a skull fracture during the hunt
two fine veternary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life
but the beast could not speak of course
nor will he ever speak taylor leaps from his chair livid with rage approaches the dais
you destroyed his memory
and you want to do the same to me
pounding gavel bailiff
stop this outburst
gag that monstrosity
the bailiff and a husky guard seize taylor who continues shouting you barbarians
the powerful guard twists taylors arms behind his back and the bailiff lashes his wrists together
then the bailiff gags taylor
his voice is cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth
the guard holds taylors leash during the rest of this scene
meanwhile cornelius has risen to his feet
his tone is firm but conciliatory
may it please the tribunal i for one grant that this being cannot have come from another planet
but this much is certain he comes from somewhere in the forbidden zone
he has described the region to us and described it accurately for i have been there
you visited the forbidden zone
why yes sir
a year ago
with the special permission of the academy
to president he exceeded his orders
his travel permit was promptly revoked
yes sir so it was thanks to you
but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written
these remarks are profane and irrelevant
to cornelius your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature
softly let them talk mr president
let them talk
rising sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity
let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoners story is false
but if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own
a beat as an animal psychologist i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute
plunging on their speech organs are adequate
the flaw lies not in anatomy but in the brain
voice rising sustain all objections but face the truth
cornelius has regained his courage
rising to ziras support he points at taylor
behold this marvel this living paradox this missing link in an evolutionary chain
pounding gavel silence
puffing with rage you have gone too far
calmly there you are mr
i warned you these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion
you were right
the advocates of heresy have revealed themselves
president i think an indictment is in order
promptly yes sir
the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy
be it so ordered
the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question
pounds gavel once this hearing is adjourned
the guard drags taylor from the inquiry room
zira and cornelius stand there stunned by the entrapment into which zaius has maneuvered them
the office is as unadorned and spartan as that of cornelius in fact with minor changes in decor the same set can be used
there are many thick leatherbound books on this scholars desk
zaius is reading one of them and taking notes
he looks up as someone knocks at the door
the two agents push taylor through the doorway
the officers withdraw closing the door
collared wrists manacled taylor stands facing the desk
the verdict is in
at the moment your simian friends and sponsors are free on bail
but theyll soon be brought to trial for heresy
who falls silent as if this were the only news of import
we note at once a change in zaius tone and attitude
he no longer treats taylor like a freak animal but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who must be intimidated by the threat of terror
what about me
offhandedly oh your case was preordained
in a way you performed a service for the state
smiling because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius
a beat and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for
do you know what that means
emasculation to begin with
then experimental surgery
on the speech centers
on the brain
ultimately a kind of living death
taylor stiffens but says nothing
zaius lets this prospect sink in then continues
however its within my power to grant you a reprieve
that is why i summoned you here tonight
a beat tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you
i told the truth at that hearingof yours
where is your tribe
my tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system
then how is it we speak the same language
suddenly intense even in your lies some truth slips through
that mythical community youre supposed to come from fort wayne
what about it
unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent
more calmly where were you nurtured
i take it you dont believe the prosecutors charge that im a monster created by dr
youre a mutant
thats exactly what zira and cornelius claim
youre talking heresy doctor
smiling of course
growing bolder all right suppose i am a mutant
why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic
because youre not unique
there was the one you call landon then you admit i admit that where theres one mutant theres probably another
a nest of them
wheres your nest taylor
where are your women
pause thank you for calling me taylor
more firmly dr
zaius i know who i am
who are you
how did this upside down civilization ever get started
strangely calm you may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level
pause the eastern desert has never been explored because weve always assumed that no life can exist there
a beat save yourself taylor
tell me is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone
i dont know
if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity
im not protecting anybody
that hearing was a farce
what have i done
youre a menace
a walking pestilence
i do know who you are taylor
as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone
decisively you have just six hours to make a full confession
after that ill employ surgery to obtain one
calling off guards
the two burly security agents open the door and enter
take this creature back to his cage
the guards seize taylor start to shove him toward the doorway
he twists around faces zaius
all right you can cut me to pieces
its within your power
with force but know this doctor
you do it because youre afraid of me
you do it from fear
zaius jerks his head silently toward the door
the apes drag taylor through it
a few hours have passed
nova is watching taylor from her cage across the aisle
he sits on the pile of straw
there is an ugly welt on his cheek made by the security officers whip
footsteps are heard
taylor and nova look up and off
a solemn teen age chimp named lucius appears outside the cage
the guard julius rises from his chair
are you julius
what do you want
im from the office of animal affairs
indicating taylor this males to be transferred to the zoo
at this hour
who says so
taylor enters scene coming over to the cage bars as lucius continues gravely with just a note of disdain
dont they tell you anything
the anti vivisectionist society is up in arms
theyre going to save this beast from those butchers in the lab
if he can speak he belongs in the public zoo
taking off but whatll probably happen is that some money mad grown up will put him in a circus
and then well have to pay to see what rightfully should have stop making speeches and show me the order
lucius hands the guard a document
it is dark here so julius crosses to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document
lucius behind the guards back signals frantically for taylor to seize or strike the guard
taylor is slow to understand
lucius shakes his head impatiently
peering at document this orders no good
it must be counter signed by dr
zaius lucius suddenly gives julius a violent shove
the guards head crashes against the bars and he is stunned
taylor complies bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the guards neck
the youngster immediately squats down gags him and begins to bind him hand and foot
camera moves in
who are you
looking up coolly so you can talk
as he works im dr
this abduction was her idea
youre not really going to the zoo
thats just our cover story in case were stopped
off again although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property come on
get me out of here
taking the guards keys lucius rises and unlocks the cage
nova enters the scene coming to the bars of her cage
he gazes at her tense with indecision
she flashes an imploring smile a mute appeal that cannot be denied
over this we hear o
weve got to move fast
as taylor leaves his cage
she comes along too
zira doesnt want your female
i want her
a shrug if you insist
but im not taking any orders fine
just let her out
lucius unlocks novas cage
she comes out quickly takes taylors hand
they follow lucius out of the compound
a horse drawn caged wagon like that used in the hunt stands near the building
zira waits at the rear of the wagon
lucius taylor and nova emerge from a doorway or archway and join her
zira notes novas presence with disapproval
they speak in undertones
to lucius i told you not to bring the other one
he wouldnt leave her
with a sigh all right
to the humans get in
put this on
listen taylor just keep quiet and we may get away with this
remember that men all look alike to most apes
taylor and nova comply climbing into the cage
lucius closes the tailgate
lucius and zira move to the front of the wagon and climb aboard
lucius takes the reins
as they move off as previously established the animal compound is on the outskirts of apetown
the abductors must cross the causeway on their route of escape
in the distance near the gazebo we can see the lights of several torches
the caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway
at the same time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side of the causeway coming toward camera
lucius stops the wagon
apprehensively gorilla hunters
we cant turn back now
as the mounted hunter nears the wagon we can see two bodies slung across the backs of the pack animals
they look out at the bodies on the horses are naked human corpses
in immediate f
near the gazebo is a similar wagon
it has lost a wheel and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway
two naked primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage
four or five armed gorilla hunters stand near the wagon two of them carry torches the others are passing a jug from hand to hand
the leader of the hunt club still on horseback holds up his hand as the lab wagon approaches
the hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their leader calls authoritatively ah doctor zira
our wagon broke down
im afraid well have to commandeer yours
as the hunt club leader rides over recognizing the animal psychologist
ive two sick humans in the cage
were taking them to the chief vet at the zoo
indicating his own wagon we bagged two live ones today
ill have to ask you to take them along
he moves to the rear of the wagon
following him frantically no no my animals are diseased
leave them alone
theyre diseased i tell you
lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon
the hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on the humans
they sound ready for sport
give him a taste of fire
one of the hunters points his torch at taylor who quite naturally shrinks back as lucius runs into scene
his bite is fatal
you would die in agony
with appropriate gestures frothing at the mouth
the hunters fall back
lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and zira run back to the front of the wagon
lucius snaps the reins and the wagon moves off
the hunters follow it a few paces pausing near their mounted leader
they treat those animals better than they treat us
i still say the only good human is a dead human
the fugitives wagon recedes beyond the gazebo as we the horse drawn wagon is silhouetted against the dawn light bumping across a semi arid plain studded with mesquite and sage
this scene can be shot either on the navajo reservation near page or on the ranch
this is the same area described on page where the hunt occurred
as the wagon rolls along a dirt track the tall grasses of the savanna or cultivated field can be seen in b
taylor is dozing but the girl is alert and nervous
she peers out at the field apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain
she nudges taylor waking him
this too is the location described on page
camera pans with the wagon as it rolls into the grove and holds on three horses
cornelius sits astride one horse the other two nags are heavily burdened with packs and saddlebags
he dismounts as zira and lucius jump down from the wagon and hurry toward him
cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss lightly ape fashion
how did it go
there was one bad moment some hunters stopped us
calmly i pursuaded them our beasts had rabies
the apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot
exasperated to be thus ignored and caged taylor kicks the tailgate shouting let me out of here
lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate
taylor gets out of the wagon stretching his stiffened joints
nova follows suit
during the ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated pacing to and fro her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or something
approaching well taylor were all fugitives now
do you have any weapons
but we wont need them
just the same i want one
he moves toward one of the horses
cornelius starts after him
look here taylor
im in charge of this expedition taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs examines it
but youre no longer in charge of me
and i dont mean to be captured again
zira and lucius have come up
peeved as you wish
zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone
thats what well try for
what about you
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy
unless we can prove our theories we dont stand a chance of acquittal
youre going back to the forbidden zone
to the diggings i worked at a year ago
its a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours
you still dont believe me do you
shrugs its a long detour to dead lake
what would we find
taylor makes a helpless gesture realizing that he cannot present sure proof
the remnants of a life raft
maybe a small flag
the emblem of my countrymen
the terrain around that lake is poisonous
there is no fresh water no vegetation
nevertheless i thank you for saving us
youll be in trouble for going there
a smile weve been in trouble since the moment we met you
nova seizes taylors arm to get his attention
trying to communicate she makes whimpering sounds and points at this is the same view of the jungle that taylor saw when the gorilla hunters emerged from the trees
whats she pointing at
taylor smiles at nova gives her a reassuring shrug
thats the way home
and she knows it
nova turns away still holding taylors arm tries to lead him toward the jungle
she turns he shakes his head says gently we cant stay there
its not safe
she looks at him sadly
wed better get started
if the mounted police pick up our trail theyll come this far at least
to lucius lets put the water and provisions in the wagon
he and lucius move off toward the horses
indicating nova are you going to take her with you
actually youre a different breed
this creature will never evolve
smiling you want her that much
testily you threw us together remember
and you guessed right
men like apes get despondent without a mate
he walks off to help lucius and cornelius
nova tags along behind him as we the caravan is crossing in a reverse direction the route taken by the astronauts on page
the three apes are on horseback
taylor and nova follow in the wagon
they are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on the bluff above the dry wash
they halt briefly and look up at the crosses
lucius is impressed
who put them up
the hunt club
to scare off humans
to scare us too
were entering the forbidden zone
they move off again riding across the dry wash
they too have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows
nova is plainly terrified
she grabs taylors arm whimpers
youll be safe with me
sudden smile here
its time you learned to earn your keep
he hands the reins to nova
she just sits there
you can do it
nova flicks the reins reacting in wide eyed open mouthed disbelief as the horse obeys her
the party is traversing a red desert to the east of dead lake
great sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor
from this vantage point the horses look no bigger than ants
this is terrain never before seen in this picture
lake powell location a few miles northeast of wahweap
the party can be seen on the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast irregular river of deep blue water
taylor cornelius and lucius are unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the backs of horses
zira watches them
zira wanders off falls to her knees
somethings wrong with your mate
taylor looks off
he and the others move quickly to nova camera panning with them
she has been retching
taylor lifts her up
she is faint with nausea
zira squats down beside them
let me handle this
ruefully to taylor you may be smarter than i am but im the veterinary on this planet
assisting nova to her feet zira leads her off toward the wagon
taylor watches the departing females then looks down at the river
where does the river lead
it empties into a sea some miles from here
thats where the cave is
the river winds o
between the sheer sandstone cliffs rising from either bank
and beyond that
at high tide you cant ride along the shore and we had no boats on the last expedition
youve never told me why this regions called the forbidden zone
no one really knows
its an ancient taboo
set forth in the sacred scrolls
the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly
shouldnt we be moving on
im for that
they start toward the horses and wagon
zira is looking curiously at nova who stands in the shade leaning against the wagon as the males enter the scene
novas nausea has passed and she comes smiling to taylor
whats the diagnosis doctor
a touch of the sun
shes not sick at all
a beat shes pregnant
consternation slowly gives way to wonder
so im not an altogether different breed you see
to reach the camp site a beach at the base of the gorge the party must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of the
they have abandoned the wagon
sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here
the camp itself consists of several lean tos against the cliff wall
above the camp reached by ladders connected to scaffolding is the mouth of a cave
zira is cleaning up the breakfast things zaius and lucius are sorting out equipment
a small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of taylor he has nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife
nova watches a look of fascinated approval on her face
taylor rinses off his knife starts to dry it
nova reaches out gently strokes his smooth if nicked chin
smiling you like it
lucius and cornelius come up zira with them
disapprovingly why did you do that
scrape off your hair
in my world before i left it only youngsters of your age wore un scraped hair
to taylor quizzically it makes you look somehow
taylor grins wryly at cornelius picks up his rifle
when are you going to show me whats in the cave
right now if you like
they cross the beach to the ladders when suddenly they hear the sound of horses
they look o
zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks
taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold
lucius runs to a lean to scoops up his rifle
lucius dont fire at them
the party rides up
youre all under arrest
to lucius you seditious scoundrel
drop that rifle
he wavers lowering his piece
zaius gorillas ride forward a few paces but halt again as taylor shouts stop right there
dont be a fool
youre outnumbered and outgunned
taylor aims at zaius and calls out if theres any shooting dr
zaius youll be the first to die
depend on it
protesting taylor youre not in command here
put down that gun
zaius knows taylor isnt bluffing
to his followers lower your weapons
taylor calls again pointing tell them to move around the point
out of range
zaius turns and whispers to his apes
they rein about and ride away through the rocks
zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone
he is unarmed
as zaius draws nearer lucius lowers his rifle
but taylor keeps his at the ready
uncertainly how did you know wed come here
it wasnt difficult
only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone
a glance at taylor i see you brought along the female of your species
taylor nods i didnt realize a man could be monogamous
on this planet its easy
zaius laughs derisively then turns to the apes
evenly i ask you to reconsider the rash course youve taken
if youre convicted of heresy the most youll get is two years
but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction youll hang for high treason
respectfully weve never meant to be treasonable sir
pointing off but up there in the face of that cliff is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts
ive seen some of your fossils and artifacts
derisively and thats your minister of science
honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge
worried taylor please except that hes also the chief defender of the faith
loftily there is no contradiction between faith and science
suddenly angered all right lets see if youre willing to put that statement to a test
taylor id rather you no
you saved me from this fanatic
maybe i can pay you back
calmly what is your proposal
when were the sacred scrolls written
twelve hundred years ago
if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls dont tell the whole truth of your history if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded
past will you exonerate them
up to the cave
he gestures toward the path leading to it
zaius zira and cornelius start upward
lucius starts to follow them
youll have to stay here and guard the horses
always giving orders
just like every other adult
youll see it all later
he pats the barrel of lucius gun in the manner of a stern but benevolent non com then starts up the trail with nova at his heels
lucius unused to taking commands from an animal scowls after him then shrugs adjusting to the idea
the sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon
the wall of the gorge in shadow is a darker hue
the crenelated east wall looking like a red cathedral is aglow with sunlight
so is the mouth of the cave as the three apes taylor and nova pass through it and o
nature has formed a vaulted room here
it need not be enormous but should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit
there is an ape made excavation in the floor of the cave some ten feet square and eight feet deep
some small objects lie on the rim of the excavation
zaius cornelius zira taylor and nova enter from the outside
authors note the effect should be an eyeful
i wish to create an illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave flooding it with direct refracted illumination transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern
present your evidence cornelius
cornelius clambers down into the pit followed by zira
taylor bends down examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the excavation
nova sits beside him
pointing it was at this level i discovered traces of an early ape creature stage of primitive barbarism really dating back roughly thirteen hundred years
it was here i found cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas
camera on boom moves in slowly as cornelius continues but the artifacts lying at your feet were found here at this level
and thats the paradox
the more ancient culture is the more advanced
admittedly many of these objects are unidentified but clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy
camera keeps moving in on the group in and around the excavation as cornelius continues indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture
in certain ways almost equal to our own
some of the evidence is uncontestable
interrupting dont speak to me in absolutes
the evidence is contestable
to begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least
there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations
perhaps thats why theyre on your staff
zaius flicks a hostile glance at taylor then looks down at the artifacts
he nudges them with his foot
secondly if these tools as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as evidence of anything
promptly but theres the doll sir
pointing right there
the human doll
zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up
it is only a porcelain fragment but the head is intact and it is unmistakably the form of a human child
what does this prove
my grand daughter plays with human dolls
exasperated zira turns to the man for confirmation
he has a point
on my planet children often play with ape dolls
zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near nova
she picks it up studies it
cornelius tries again
a doll alone proves nothing
but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit
your conclusion is premature
have you forgotten your scripture
the thirteenth scroll
quoting from memory and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him
impatiently no sir i havent forgotten
for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets
until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed
keep digging cornelius
youll find evidence of the master of this house an ape
as zira again appeals to the man
are you going to let that pass without an answer
taylor who has been toying with objects in the dirt looks up
i have to agree
from all youve found so far his positions as good as yours
annoyed what are you doing there
reconstructing a life
care to have a look
cornelius and zira cross the pit and zaius walks around the rim of the excavation
as the apes come close
a number of artifacts have been arranged in front of taylor
to cornelius these were found near the human doll right
cornelius nods well whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape
he picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles
as taylor continues his monologue he picks up the other objects one by one
he wore false teeth
pause he suffered from a hernia and used this truss to hold up his insides
pause and toward the end these little rings of stainless steel enclosed a prefab ricated valve in his failing heart
zaius picks up two of the steel rings studies them
i dont say he was a man like an earthman but id call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of mans ills
to zaius pointedly yet fragile as he was he came before you and was superior to you
a calm smile thats lunacy
i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects thats equally as inventive as yours
but it would be conjecture not proof
she is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll
from it comes a distorted sound
the apes stare at the doll in astonishment
taylor snatches the doll from nova brandishes it at the astonished zaius
would an ape make a human doll that talks
zaius looks at him speechless
at that moment the crack of a distant rifle shot reverberates through the cavern
all present freeze listening
taylor alone is armed
raising his rifle he glowers at zaius
cornelius is already crossing the pit
he climbs out arid races toward the mouth of the cave
taylor runs after him
zira and nova hurry after taylor
expressionless he looks down at the doll then moves toward the mouth of the cave
cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward camera
he halts in f
looking down at two of zaius gorillas have disarmed lucius and are clubbing him with their rifle butts
two other mounted apes are driving the scientists horses back beyond the trees
cornelius taylor nova and zira in that order can be seen high above descending the trail
camera pulls back to disclose a gorilla sniper in immediate f
crouching behind a boulder near the water
he sights his rifle at the man on the trail
taylor is still too distant to make a sure target and so the sniper waits
this portion of the trail has no cover or concealment
unaware of the sniper taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent
the gorilla fires
the bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head
taylor scans the terrain bewlow looking for the sniper
nova comes to his side pointing at his head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece
he aims and fires
taylor has missed him but the sniper ducks behind the boulder
taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where zira is standing
outcroppings of rock offer some cover here
taylor pushes nova down behind a rock and signals for zira to follow suit
the snipers second shot rings out
instead of returning the fire taylor looks up the rail at he is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the mouth of the cave
bent low he comes charging up the trail toward zaius
the snipers third shot splatters rock fragments around him
zaius starts to retreat to the cave but stumbles and falls on some loose shale
no sooner has zaius regained his feet than taylor overtakes him
seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm
taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into zaius kidney
he spins zaius around using him as a shield
taylor releases the pressure on zaius throat but keeps the gun pointed at his back
tell him to pull back
a hoarse cry cease fire
his command echoes from the west wall of the canyon
the sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore and walks off along the beach
taylor lifts the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back of zaius head
i ought to kill you right now
nudging him lets go
they move off down the trail
zira rushes down the trail to lucius who is sprawled on the ground
he has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead
nova and cornelius come next then taylor prodding zaius ahead of him at gun point
lucius appears to be more humiliated than hurt
they took me by surprise
sneaked up on me while i was watering the horses
whats happened to honor
pause glum i got off one round to warn you
gloomingly theyve taken everything
they left a hostage
a pause how do you feel lucius
turning on but vindicated
ive been right all along
you cant trust the older generation
its a matter of values gently all right all right
will you do me a favor
pause what is it
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner
thoughtfull pause yes i can do that
say i want a weeks supply of food for the woman and myself
and fifty rounds of ammunition
what if they wont agree to your terms
then tell them dr
zaius wont leave here alive
shocked taylor you cant
calmly oh yes he can
hes a born killer
to lucius deliver the message
lucius looks to taylor for confirmation
the young ape hurries away through the rocks
taylor crosses to a useless saddle picks up a coil of rope gestures at zaius indicating a nearby tree
zaius squats on the ground beside the tree
taylor sets his rifle against the trunk fashions a noose and places it around zaius neck
then using an ingenious combination of knots he ties zaius hands behind his back and finally fastens the rope around the base of the tree
as he works now minister of science let me explain certain principle stress and strain
if you exert pressure to remove these bonds youll choke yourself to death
itll be suicide you see
zira and cornelius look down at the captive mandarin
their rebellious spirit has evaporated and they are clearly afraid
taylor please dont treat him that way
wasnt i humiliated
by all of you
didnt you lead me around on a leash
that was different
we thought you were
wintry smile and now you know the truth
to zaius cornelius has beaten you doctor
he proved it
man preceded you here
you owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have
quietly then answer this if ran was superior why didnt he survive
shrugging he might have been wiped out by a plague
like a fiery storm of meteors
from the looks of this part of your planet id say that was a fair bet
weakly but we cant be sure
indicating zaius he is
he knew all the time
long before your discovery he knew
to zaius defender of the faith
guardian of the terrible secret
isnt that right doctor
as zira and cornelius look at him expectantly
what i know of man was written long ago set down by the wisest ape of all our lawgiver
to cornelius open my breast pocket
cornelius crosses to zaius and takes a small book bound in black leather from the breast pocket of his tunic
read it to him the twentythird scroll ninth verse
cornelius thumbs through the book finds the citation and reads aloud beware the beast man for he is the devils pawn
alone among gods primates he kills for sport or lust or greed
yes he will murder his brother to possess his brothers land
let him not breed in great numbers for he will make a desert of his home and yours
drive him back into his jungle lair for he is the harbinger of death
cornelius falls silent and looks down at zaius
quietly i found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man
and i still live by its injunction
lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse
zaius five mounted gorillas appear behind him
taylor calls out to them stay where you are
lucius comes up with the horse
taylor checks the provisions in the saddlebags
lucius is frowning
they think youre behaving foolishly
i must say i agree
where will you go
ill start by following the shoreline
a smile and my nose
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland
how will you survive
firmly he wont survive
all look at him do you know what sort of life awaits you out there taylor
that of an animal
if you arent eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you
then there is another jungle
shrugs then sardonically of course you could return with us
our society might find a place for you and your mate
in a cage
where else but in a cage does man belong
ill take freedom
taylor mounts the horse extends a helping hand to nova who vaults nimbly onto the horses rump
taylor looks at zira and cornelius
would you like to come along
its better than going to prison for heresy
they cant convict us of that
you proved our innocence
indicating zaius his culture is our culture
good luck then
he reaches down grasps cornelius hand then grins crookedly
zira id like to kiss you good bye
all right but
tears in her eyes youre so damned ugly
taylor smiles leans down kisses her
softly go with god taylor
half smile thats an old expression
it comes from both ape and man
god bless you
he extends his hand to lucius who takes it
i think youre making a mistake
thats the boy
keep em flying
the flags of discontent
its the only way anything ever gets changed
to zaius dont try to follow us
pats stock of his rifle im pretty handy with things like this
of that im sure
all my life ive awaited your coming and dreaded it
like death itself
taylor looks piercingly at zaius more troubled than offended
from the first ive terrified you doctor
and in spite of every sign that im an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me
calmly without rancor because you are a man
and you were right i have always known about man
from the evidence i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy
his emotions must rule his brain
he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself
no weapons were found in the cave
the forbidden zone was once a paradise
your breed made a desert of it ages ago
he waits then wearily were back at the beginning
i still dont know the why
a planet where apes evolved from men
a world turned wrong side up
a puzzle with one piece missing
softly dont look for it taylor
you may not like what you find
taylor shakes his head still baffled digs his heels into the horses flank
it canters off along the sandy shore
zira cornelius and lucius sadly watch the departure
cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from zaius neck
behind them the five mounted gorillas gallop forward
zaius gets up waves them to a halt
let him go
taylor looks back sees that zaius has stopped the mounted apes slows his horse to a trot smiles at nova
zaius watches as taylors horse moves farther away along the beach
then he turns to an ape called marcus
quietly fetch your explosives
were going to seal the cave
he remounts his horse and rides o
aghast seal the cave
and you will both stand trial for heresy
but the proof
in a few minutes there will be no doll
there cant be
honest regret im sorry
cornelius throws himself at zaius
you gave your word
zaius looks emptily at one of his apes
what i do i do with no pleasure
a hairy hand is clapped over cornelius mouth
he is dragged off struggling kicking
julius unafraid glares at zaius
zaius this is inexcusable
why must knowledge stand still
what about the future
zaius looks benevolently at julius
i may just have saved it for you
julius and zira look at each other befuddled
once more their eyes follow the retreating figures of taylor and nova
the beach separating the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream
what will he find out there doctor
his face is a mask his tone enigmatic
a moment later as they watch taylor and nova vanish around the bend
taylor and nova are already far downstream
there is a striking change in the terrain
the area is still desolate but some vegetation can be seen on the palisade above the narrow beach and the river has widened to form a vast tidal basin where
it meets the sea
a note on production if feasible at new location site this scene should be shot at high tide so that the water laps at the base of the cliffs making
a passage difficult and risky
he is alert sniffing the salt air sizing up the situation
hearing the cries of birds he reins in and looks up
sea gulls are soaring overhead
his expression is expectant searching
nova emits a whimper of anticipation pointing off
a verdant forest atop a distant palisade
their view of the beach below the forest is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance
he smiles at her hopefully
yes nova i see it
looks again at forest in my old profession green meant safe
green meant go
the horse moves off at a trot camera panning
but they have gone only a short distance when they hear the distant thunder of an explosion
taylor reins in and looks back
a column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream
frowning with concern taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke then decides this is no time to linger
he digs his heels into the horses flanks and they move off at a canter riding toward the promontory that splits the beach
they are nearing the promontory that blocks their view of the beach beyond
as they round the promontory the tip of a strange rock formation comes into view
it appears to be jutting from the sea
he reins in momentarily baffled by what he sees
then he rides on
an immense column juts from the beach at a thirty degree angle
we can now see that it is not rock but metal
green metallic tints show through its gray salt stained surface
as we draw closer the object takes on the appearance of a massive arm its top shaped like a hand holding a torch
frowning with consternation
his horse proceeds at a slow walk
near the base of the column where the shore and water meet are a row of metal spikes
from this angle they look like tank traps
dumbfounded he slides from his saddle approaches the spikes
nova dismounts and follows him
a cry of agony my god
he falls to his knees buries his head in his hands
camera slowly draws back and up to a high angle shot disclosing what taylor has found
half buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the statue of liberty
