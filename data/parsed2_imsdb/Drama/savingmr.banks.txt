written by kelly marcel sue smith music string violins treat us to a familiar song opening and then a voice male
winds in the east mist coming in a whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky spinning spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
white fluffy clouds
a shadow oddly shaped like an umbrella dances amongst the nimbus
like something is brewing about to begin the shadows direction becomes purposeful taking us down through the clouds whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance
cant put me finger on what lies downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens
there a ten year old girl plays in the lush grass she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in benches made from
twigs trees from flowers picnic cups from acorns and gives a satisfied nod
she wraps her arms tightly around her chest lifts her face to the sky a half smile threatening to break across her concentrated face
this is the young p
travers whom we will also know as ginty
but i feel whats to happen all her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then all of a sudden the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes
travers sits in her rocking chair in the same position as above arms clasped tightly around her body face to the sky
older beautiful striking blue eyes aid her air of stiff and steely determination
her office is a canvas of a life well travelled
buddha smiles from every corner framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere china
hens sit on shelves their wings clasped to their chests brooding
despite the multitude of objects the room is peaceful white
downstairs the doorbell rings
pamela closes her eyes breathes
it rings again pamela shakes her head tuts
she stands up smooths down her skirt with flat palms
pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold
diarmuid russell bright youthful waits to be asked inside
pamela is not pleased to see him
pamela and diarmuid sit in silence
diarmuid looks at her she looks out of the window
youre ready to
like pink clouds on sticks
the cherry blossoms i was trying to think of what they diarmuid looks at his watch
the car should be here may i use i cancelled it
mrs travers please why sugaring his tone why would you cancel the car
i shant be going
diarmuid buries his face in his hands
weve been through this ive changed my mind
with all due respect mr russell i am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making capabilities
diarmuids shoulders visibly sag he lets out a long frustrated breath
you made an agreement
do you understand
a verbal agreement
why in the world are you speaking to me as if i am a neonate
he is most welcome to every penny i dont have
ive represented you for a long time
i like to think of you as a pamela snorts
i like to think of it believe me i know its not reciprocated
i would never suggest you do something that would cause you anguish but theres no more money pamela mrs travers
simply no more
sales have dried up no more royalties
you refuse to write further books so do you understand
im frightened that you dont understand what that means
pamela looks out of the window the cherry blossom her focus
i know what hes going to do to her shell be cavorting and twinkling
careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze weve been trying to do this deal for twenty years
hes agreed to both your stipulations
no animation script approval i use her to pay my bills
if i believed in a hell id be sitting in its waiting room script approval
hes never granted anything like that before
i dont know what else to he looks around
where is polly
i fired her
diarmuid shakes his head sighs
its just as well
it seems i cant afford her anymore anyway
pamela looks to the ceiling breathes
you dont know how much she means to me
of course not polly
pamela huffs digs her heel into the rug
its a filthy word los angeles
you have only to go there and work for two weeks
you havent signed the rights over yet
you must make it work mrs travers oh i must must i
you need the money
i dont want you to see you broke
stop saying money
its a filthy disgusting word
i am picking up the telephone mrs diarmuid gets up
i have final say
i have final say
and if i dont like what they are doing to her
you dont sign the papers
he cannot make the film unless you grant the rights
its an exploratory trip pamela looks at the cherry blossom again a piece floats away from the tree and sticks to her living room window
what do you say
i want to keep my house
a large hand taps ginty on the shoulder she looks up and smiles
travers goff is handsome and rugged a wild poetic look like ted hughes or dylan thomas
excuse me maam have you seen my daughter
i was quite sure i had left her around here somewhere
her name is helen no shirley erm goodness
ive quite forgotten
could it be prunella
youre right still doesnt sound quite im sure i have a special name for her ginty
why thank you maam
ginty it is of course
now have you seen her
travers puts his nose right up to hers peering into her face
so it is
well thank goodness for that
i was positive i was going to be beheaded for losing her highness the royal princess ginty mc featherfluffy
you cant lose me
i will never lose you
he swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through the park neighing like a horse
we mustnt be late
the adventure is about to begin
pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet bag into an overhead locker
can i help you
im perfectly capable thank you
the flight attendant tries to help anyway
theyve used all the space so greedy
she glares at the people around her
ill take it madam
i can put it up here i dont want it up there
i want it here in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat
the flights closing in just a few moments maam
ill have to take it
pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say i dare you
a woman with an infant stands up
you can put my bag up front instead
the flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the womans bag with pamelas
will the child be a nuisance
its an eleven hour flight
er no i jolly good
pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window she looks out at the tarmac
she closes her eyes takes a deep breath opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together
she folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead
i hope we crash
the passenger across the aisle hears her horrified
biddy and margaret the girls mother delicate weak stand outside of their lavish red bricked home
suitcases bulge at their feet
margaret breathes a sigh of relief as she sees travers hurrying towards them he swings ginty from his shoulders and plops her on the ground
who needs a carriage my love
a stroll is a gift
beat excited everybody ready
margaret takes her youngest child moya from the nanny
come along my team
we mustnt miss the train
to her staff thank you so much
see you soon katie nanna
she picks up her own case katie nanna turns away heartbroken
the family get into line one behind the other travers in the lead
dont forget andrew
ginty takes andrews leash her own case and somehow helps her sister too
and off we go
passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as travers and the girls march down the street
left right left right
margaret stays for a beat longingly taking in and storing a picture of the home she leaves behind
the procession continues into the bustling downtown
its hectic as tickets are purchased and a clerk marks a chalkboard with destinations and mileage
ginty stops looks at the list
the last city is the great western queensland train chugs its way westward from the verdant green of maryborough toward the brown cake of allora
as it disappears
ginty stands on the last train platform watching her home her past fade into the distance
gintys face speaks resignation as it and the train recede as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame
pamela jolts in her seat her eyes flit open
shes disturbed by her dreams she flicks her hand in front of her face as if somehow batting the memories away
she sighs loudly and digs her heel into the carpet of the plane
a bleary eyed pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals area
shes immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies she scans paramount warner brothers mgm finally falling upon her own
travers underneath walt disney presents
oh does he indeed
she approaches the uniformed driver ralph mickey mouse on his lapel who bursts into a beaming smile
welcome mrs p
welcome to the city of angels
he grabs her bags
let me take those
im perfectly capable of oh nevermind
ralph ushers pamela through the doors and into the sunlight
sun came out to say hello just to you
dont be preposterous
pamela sniffs the air
chlorine and sweat
the shiny black tinted windowed limo cruises up la cienega blvd passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish billboard advertising
pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car
she eyes the champagne on ice the flutes clinking in the in car bar
ralph looks at her in the rearview
you okay back there mrs p
its not mrs p
its just mrs oh its so hot
we got a brand new air conditioning system missus cool you right down in no time
just about make you feel like youre in good old engerland again
things they can put in cars these days he shakes his head in gosh almighty
pamela presses her fingers to her temples
she looks around finds a button pushes it and the screen rises between passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of ralphs natter
happy as a clam no problemo
with its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun
the limo glides into the forecourt
a porter opens the door to pamelas suite and places her belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway
would you like me to unpack for you maam
to take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe maam
young man if it is your wish to handle ladies garments i suggest you take employment in a launderette
the porter has no idea what to say he hovers at the door
his eyes flick to his empty palm and back to pamela
she closes the door on him
she turns and for the first time takes in oh my
the ludicrous suite she has been assigned it is opulent beyond imagine but its classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of disney gifts splattered across every surface
of the room
oh no no no
disney flowers disney champagne disney exotic fruit baskets disney chocolates disney posters cuddly donald pluto and minnie toys and taking up the entire bed the biggest stuffed mickey mouse imaginable
pamela cannot contain her horror
she stares at it in disgust for a moment and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket
she stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out
she turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her
muttering to the pears this wont do
she throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat dust dazzling sunlight arid heat dazzling sunlight
travers margaret and the children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway
from their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home
the surrounding land yellow and burnt unlike the lush greens of maryborough
the house is ramshackle and meagre
a swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch
complete with mighty steed
travers puts an arm around her shoulder
well build beautiful memories here my angel
margaret offers him a trusting smile
travers takes ginty and biddys hands and they run towards their new home
the chickens scatter
in the distance in this house you get to share a bedroom
margaret looks at the surrounding area theres simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles
a green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another splosh
we rise through the water to see pamela on her balcony throwing the pears one by one into the swimmer free swimming pool
she breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors
well first things first
she gathers up the disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in a closet
she picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where the biggest stuffed mickey mouse imaginable takes up the entire bed
pamela drops her bags grabs mickey and places him on the floor facing the wall
and you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety
pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack
she takes from it a bottle of pills which she places on her night stand followed by another bottle and another and another
the potions keep coming as do creams and books and make up the bag is endless
things things and more things come streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature buddhas
finally she takes out an impossibly large framed picture of herself
she holds it up admires it takes down an existing painting and replaces it with her own image
pamela is restless she looks around the room stands in front of a full length mirror admiring herself
she turns her face slightly to catch it at its best angle
she leans forward and explores the contours of her face surprisingly unlined for a woman of her years
she smiles full of vanity
answering an imaginary well no i dont suppose i do mind
she laughs but pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort
then scolding herself silly girl
she turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement
she points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the tv bursts into life
she clicks again the tv goes off again and its on
a housewife advertises dish soap with glee as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented
soap for the brains
she changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen
it takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming moustached kindly face of walter elias disney on the wonderful world of disney show
pamela raises an eyebrow well well there you are
walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out
theres nothing wrong with your television set
this is a pixie bell the sound is much too high for human ears
tinkerbell flies into shot
oh there you are tink
she covers walt in fairy dust
get that stuff off of me
you know a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly
pamela cant help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly narrows her mistrusting eyes at walt and switches him off
thats how we deal with you
a tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door
pamela lies in bed awake staring at the ceiling she shakes her head trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there
the moonlight casts a shadow of mickey on the wall beside her bed
pamela waits under the hotel awning dressed immaculately not a hair out of place
the limo pulls up to the curb and pamela groans as she sees ralph jovially jump out of the car and rush round to open the passenger door
good morning mrs
its not mrs its oh why do i bother
were just not going to get it right are we
will it be the same driver every day
oblivious to her tone yes maam
im all yours
sun came out again
you say it like youre surprised
like the sun is particular about whom it appears for
it seems you think that i am responsible for its miraculous dawning every day
for goodness sake its california
it certainly is
he gestures for her to get in
trying a british accent madame
pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap
ralph climbs into the drivers seat
as much to herself as i would so much rather be accountable for the rain
oh thats sad
sad is entirely the wrong emotion
i shant bother explaining why she makes gesture for flying over his head zip
the rain brings life
so does the sun
ralph starts the engine and drives away
three men in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the enormous gates of disneys burbank studio and pulls up in a very twee forecourt
they are don dagradi and the sherman brothers robert he leans on an old worn cane and richard who has a bright sunny almost cartoon ish face
don opens the car door for pamela and puts out a hand to help her from the vehicle but she pushes it away
it is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name
the shermans look at each other
i do apologize mrs travers
i am don dagradi the script writer
co script writer
i shall certainly be having my say mr
i welcome it
if indeed we ever sign off on a script
bob and dick flash each other a look
what the fu
okay so this is the rest of your team dick and bob sherman
music and lyrics
boys this is the one and only mrs p
travers creator of our beloved mary
never ever just mary
to dick and bob a pleasure to meet you though i fear we shant be acquainted for too long
these books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing
certainly not a musical
now where is mister disney
id very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible
not a music
if youll point me in his direction
we had planned a little tour of the studio for you no thank you
wanted to show the place off
no one likes a show off
pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building
mrs trav its a long way to don hurries behind her bob looks like he is about to murder the woman and dick is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing
the shermans don and pamela are riding through the studios on a golf buggy
i am perfectly capable of walking
a couple of disney characters donald and goofy bounce up to the golf cart waving brightly
goofy opens his arms to pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror
the characters stop bouncing and di gradi gives them a nod meaning beat it
bob and dick sherman are in shock
don leads pamela into the plushly appointed outer office where dolly a young perky secretary smiles brightly at her
could you let over to dolly would you let mister disney know i have arrived please
dolly loses her smile at the terse tone nods curtly and picks up the phone
whispering into phone shes here
a word of advice mrs travers if i may
whether i heed it or not will be another matter entirely
its just that he cant stand being called mr disney
we are all on a first name basis here
we hear a mans cough before a beaming walt disney in the flesh appears at the end of the corridor his arms outstretched
well there ya are at last
pamela gets up smooths down her skirt and makes her way serenely towards the man who rushes down the corridor to greet her
oh my dear gal
pamela is open mouthed
you cant imagine how excited i am to finally meet you
pamela doesnt know what to do with this amount of enthusiasm
she extends a formal hand before he manages to get her in an embrace
he squeezes her tight and then lets go
pamela struggles to compose herself she hasnt been that close to a man in decades
its an honour mister disney
walt you gotta call me walt ya know
mister disney was my old man
theres a hint of something mournful in the way he says old man
he links his arm through hers much to her chagrin and leads her into his interior office past an imposing floor to ceiling cabinet bursting with academy awards
he smiles at tommie who mans the second desk
tommie say hi to the one and only p l travers
its so nice to but pamela has already been whisked through to disneys personal office
disneys office is tastefully furnished and filled with pictures of his daughters and wife
framed posters of his films provide splashes of color to the cream walls
have a seat sit down
he gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but pamela takes a seat in front of walts desk instead glancing at the sign above it we can make them
walt perches on the edge of the desk close to her gazing at her
ya know i cant believe it
travers right here in my office after all these years almost twenty of em
shakes his head twenty
pamela narrows her eyes
wish ya coulda seen me then pam
as lean as a whippet i was
a race horse
interestingly she doesnt pull him up on using her first name and shortening it too
but now here you are
look at you
i could eat you up
that wouldnt be appropriate
he turns a photo of his daughters diane and sharon to face pamela
when diane here was seven years old i can i get you a drink
a pot of tea would be most welc she was seven years old and i was walking past her bedroom and there she was on her bed reading to sharon
and well they were just giggling their little socks off
he picks up the phone presses a button tommie pot of tea please dear youre a doll
he puts the phone down shes a doll
anyways i asked them girls whats so funny
and diane said to me mary poppins daddy
well i had no idea what a mary poppins was
and then she gave me your book
and by gosh
he stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his point
my imagination was caught on fire
and i mean on fire
and those embers have burned ever since as you know
so you keep ive been asking asking pamela stops talking and waits for disney to calm down
i got old asking
he sits back down on his desk
what a charming story
about my getting old
about your daughters
yeah i suppose it is
he looks at the picture theyre both women now
can you believe it
children grow up
now pam a man cant break a promise to his kids
no matter how long it takes to keep
no matter how long
you mightve kept me dangling all this time but now we gotcha
mister disney if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself
i was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasnt for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when
you approached me every annum for the subsequent years
honestly i feel corralled ensnared pam pam the last thing i want is to make you feel my name if you please is mrs travers
you see i promised them
thats a fact
you got kids
i have never i swear never broken a promise to either one of my disney girls
well thats very honourable of you thats what being a daddy is all about right
this movie isnt just going to make my kids happy
its going to make all kids happy
you see my guys are gonna do things with it that are well are revolutionary
hes up again
pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the room
mary poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books
the door opens and tommie comes in with the tea walt gestures for her to bring it to him
this magical woman who has only lived in your head youll be able to meet her speak to her hear her sing
tommie places the tray on walts desk and leaves the room
walt picks up the tea pot
yes this singing i am glad youve come to that
addressing his tea milk first
walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and picks up the milk jug he pours
now the tea he picks up the pot again and pours the tea
and a spoonful of sugar
you dont mean for this film to be a musical
i absolutely do
he presents her with the cup
she takes a sip he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good
no mister disney mary poppins does not sing
oh yes she does
in your books
those arent songs
she is not a giddy woman she does not jig
singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess an educatress
it would just ruin it
walt is baffled
he takes a sip of tea its disgusting he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously then coughs loudly
pamelas jaw drops
i wont have her turned into one of your silly cartoons
walt takes a sharp breath on silly and then plasters the smile back on
tell ya what
you just listen to what my sherman boys have come up with and if they dont knock your socks off then im the king of england
pamela rolls her eyes
if youre the king of england then you shant exist and knowing the little of you i do i shouldnt think you would like that very much
bet you would
she smirks as does he
i do quite like greensleeves
come to think of it
thats a song i wouldnt object to
hes not sure if shes playing with him
pam i want you to know that the last thing i would do the very last thing is tarnish a story i have cherished
he moves closer to her takes her hand she needs it for her teacup its awkward
gazing into her eyes the pages are worn down to tissue dog eared and falling out
i have poured over them gripped tormented
because i love mary poppins you got to share her with me
pamela is torn between finding disney captivating and totally barking
a course nothing happens without your say so
she extricates her hand
its all in the rights agreement
as approved by your agent dermot
disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her pamela takes it without looking and folds it up
waving the agreement a live action film
id like that on tape
your promise and all the discussions we have here on tape
tape you say
she pops the rights document in her bag
walts joviality his bright demeanour vanishes in a split second
ah there you are
mary poppins and the bankss theyre family to me
she stands up and smooths down her skirt
shall we begin
he holds out his hand for her to shake
lets make something wonderful
she leaves his hand hanging in mid air
lets see if thats at all possible
pamela gets up smooths down her skirt snorts at a picture of disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room a smile
across her face that disney does not see
travers sits looking out at the dimming sky playing a mournful air on his tin whistle ginty curled up in his lap andrew the dog asleep beside him
margaret steps out onto the veranda an almost imperceptible glance at the half empty bottle at his feet
its rather late travers continues to play
biddy and moya are already asleep
travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs
he kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap
good night father
good night dear
margaret strokes her hand over gintys hair as the little girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door watching her parents
travers pats his knee and margaret perches on it
ill make us a good life
ill make you proud again
margaret strokes travers face and turns her face to the sky
look at the stars
pamela sits at a large meeting table as dolly bustles around her placing refreshments
pamela lays out her pencils one by one makes sure her notebook is just so
a bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she snatches it away glaring at the table which is now laden with every type of snack and beverage
imaginable from bagels to candy coffee to soda there are exotic fruits enormous bouquets of flowers
peering around a vase at what is all this jollification
we have a whole script to get through
its gonna be a long day mrs t
she shoots him dead with a killer stare
we could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone
ugh its so vulgar
she gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of dicks piano
bob moves it from the piano to the floor
that is a very expensive piano
and these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window looked out and gazed upon them happily
minding their own business and very much still alive
bob hasnt a clue what to say
pamela smoothes down her skirt and re takes her seat
pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which don duly turns on
let us begin
she perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script walt disneys mary poppins
a rustling of papers and one or two uneasy glances as the men too open their scripts
exterior cherry scene one
whats tree lane
dick and bob cover their faces with the embarrassment of it all
it means the scene is taking place outside
ah i see an abbreviation
exterior oh im sorry mr dagradi did you feel you should
no no mrs travers please go ahead
yes i do think its best
ive the most practise
readings of my books you know
anyway scene one
cherry tree lane london
thats good that can stay
thats just the scene heading
though i do think we should say number instead of just yes
no ones going to see it
i will see it
she makes a note in her script and looks to the others who are dumbstruck
write it down write it down chop chop
don makes the note and is ready to move on but pamela is staring at dick and bob
they dutifully pick up their pencils and note their scripts too
is that on the tape
don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods
they are interrupted by dolly carrying a new tray of refreshments
im sorry to interrupt
is this a joke
do you think you are a comedienne
im sorry i dont understand
dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance
pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore dolly and carry on
number cherry tree lane
bert a one man band she looks up the rumour is that this is to be your mister van dyke is it
we do hope so
hmmm well see about that
hes totally wrong totally and utterly
dick is one of the greats
dick van dyke
robert my dear olivier is one of the greats burton guinness greats without question
speaking loudly into the i can assure you dick van dyke is not
back to script bert a one man band plays to a small gathering outside the gates to the park
she looks to don you can do bert
through gritted teeth thank you
alright ladies and gents comical poem suitable for the occasion dick jumps up and sits at the piano
extemporized and thought up before your very eyes
alright here we go dick begins to play and sing he pounds the keys with gusto smiling away acting it out with all his heart and soul almost unable to
contain himself with glee
bob occasionally joins in for a word or two but is much more serious eyeing travers for her every reaction
room here for everyone gather around responstable
now how does that sound
no no no no no no no
dolly winces on everyones behalf and leaves the room
responstable is not a word
we made it up
well un make it up
dick quickly hides the next set of sheet music entitled ive a thought
ive always liked ta ra ra boom de ay
now that would be a wonderful song for the film
and admiral boom could sing it
do you see
dicks fingers crunch the piano keys
pamelas door opens a crack and another half eaten room service meal appears as she kicks it into the hallway
she shuts the door quickly behind her
pamela lies awake staring at the ceiling
a tiny park about half a metre square it has grass tiny trees made from flowers a small hole filled with water for a pond park benches made with twigs
and miniature wooden clothes peg people
ginty puts the finishing touches to the bandstand and sits back staring in wonder
the moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears atop his horse
ahhh theres my girl
the horse moves up to her
thats it albert
give ginty a smooch
theres a good boy give her a little smooch
the velvety muzzle of the horse smooches gintys neck and ear as travers climbs down from the nag
poor old albert hes your secret uncle you know
but a miserable horrid witch turned him into a nag
why did she do that
because she hated the sound of his laugh
poor uncle albert
how can we fix him
we have to teach the witch how to be happy again
im not quite sure darling
your mothers been calling you for a good hour
i shouldnt go if i were you shes after little slaves for housework
ah i must scrub and bake and sweep till stars are beginning to blink and the young lie long and dream in of the matching of ribbons for bosom and
travers sighs lets the words ring in his ears touches the end of daughters nose
do you want to know what it feels like to fly ginty
he hauls himself onto albert leans down and swings ginty up so she is facing him
you trust me
she nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder
he grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms
gee up albert
travers kicks the horse into a trot then into a canter he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars
ginty squeals with delight
pamela looks out of the window at the palm trees the empty sidewalks
she looks dazed extremely tired nobody walks
leisurely strolls a gift
the limo floats along the windy canyon roads cresting the top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista
beautiful aint it
refusing him the if you like that sort of thing
travers and ginty gallop at great speed
the horse kicking up great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance
don dagradi and the shermans are escorting pamela along a row of storyboard illustrations for the film
dolly trundles along behind carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from
we do find it helps to have a visual
she stops in front of a sketch of the banks house
no no no
the banks house doesnt look like that
my house is a terraced house with a pink door white bricked with a crack in the gable
the window frames are lead lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink gesturing to the tape did we get that
to herself slightly oh dear its all a big mistake
its all wrong
its all wrong
its too grand
the banks family theyre normal everyday sort of people
this isnt normal
it isnt everyday
theyre not aristocrats
don allows a tiny smile
she is right
pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on
she stops again in front of a sketch of mrs banks wearing a suffragette ribbon
do i even have to say it
why in the world have you made mrs banks a silly suffragette
i wonder if emmeline p would agree with that adjective quite possibly looking back
dick mouths oh my god
it does seem strange that mrs banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of are you calling
mrs banks neglectful
of course not
we just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining being a mother is a job
a very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to that not everybody should have taken on in the first place
the boys see that pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment until i will not have her called cynthia
it feels unlucky
dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at bob
no it should be something warm a bit sexy
they all nearly choke at the word sexy coming out of her mouth
how about mavis
i could go with winifred
yes thats because its very good
she comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it a split second of utter confusion crosses her face
this isnt mr banks
she turns to face don and the boys
this isnt him
ahm yeah thats him he has a set of moustaches
in the books he i told the illustrator i didnt like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me
this is my film and this time around i shall have my way
clearing her throat mrs travers it was a specific request from walt
pamela doesnt acknowledge that dolly has spoken dolly flushes
to the boys why
everyone shrugs they dont know why
he didnt he doesnt mr banks is clean shaven
bob buries his face in his hands and lets out a long loud unashamed moan
does it mattterrrrrrr
bob bob bob pamela stares at bob
you can wait outside
she points at the door ordering him out with her finger
bob is literally stunned
dick stifles a laugh
i shant say it again robert
bob storms out of the room as fast as his limp and cane will allow him slamming the door and from behind it we hear what is wrong with his
he got shot
pamela smiles sweetly
can i expect anymore drama from anyone else
pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator
she spies the bar full of people laughing exclaiming enjoying one anothers company
she takes it in melancholically for a second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly relieved when the doors finally slide open
travers faces his reflection in the mirror as ginty looks on from the doorway
he picks up his razor and begins to scrape away the stubble
why do you do that
for you my dear
he flicks the blade in the air like a swordsman swish
which kind of kisses do you prefer gintamina
scratchy ones or silky ones
a man must shave for to spare his daughters cheeks
pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror
she runs a finger through the steam on the glass
dolly carrying a tray of cakes stops at the rehearsal room door where fractious voices ring out
what on earth are you talking about
supercali or whatever the infernal thing is
its something to say when you dont know what to say
well i always know what to say
the slamming of a piano lid
dolly pushes the door open with her foot
if you so much as step one foot in here with that tray i shall scream
one cannot live on cake alone
dolly stands in disneys office
hit me with it
she has a lot of ideas
what kind of ideas
about how she uh sees things
and just how does she see things
dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad
the name cynthia has been changed to winifred
okay thatll work
she wont approve dick van dyke
walt laughs dolly allows herself a little giggle too
the sketches of the banks house make it look too opulent there must be no hint of romance between mary poppins and bert she wants to know why mr banks
has been given a moustache the i asked for that
they did tell her but she wants to know why
because i asked for it
uh the tape measure mary poppins uses to record jane and micheals height must be a roll tape not a ruler we must add gravi gravitas she says
she only wants green vegetables and broth i dont know what that is but she wants it in the room from now on and oh
she doesnt want the colour red in the film at all
dick don and pamela sit around the meeting table
bob hovers by the door in a right humph
disney prefers to stand grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy
ive simply gone off the colour
their mouths are agape
you did say i was to have final say did you not
we cant make the film without the colour red
its set in london for petes sake
theres buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms heck
the british flag
pamela im not sure why i understand your predicament mr disney i do
i just hm i dont know what it is im just suddenly very anti red
i shant be wearing it ever again
disney comes and sits on the table in front of pam and locks eyes with her
is this a test pam
are you requiring proof of how badly i wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together
pamela averts her eyes for a split second embarrassed about creating something beautiful with walt but quickly recovers and eyeballs him right back
i took you at your word mr disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied
there will be many more so perhaps we should just call it quits and i should hand you back these
she takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him
disney smiles at pamela
no red in the film
pamela glances at the tape recorder
don and the shermans cant believe he has given in
disney strides out of the room
disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal room
he stops turns goes back to the door puts his hand on the handle stops himself and moves on
dick don and bob are left astounded
they look at one another
he doesnt have the rights all three turn their heads to turn to her
pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys smooths down her skirt and opens the script
now if youre insisting upon this musicality you feel is so important for my film then i suggest i hear one of your ditties
no one is in the mood to sing for her
i shall keep an open mind
yeah do nanny
dick begins to play wanted a nanny for two adorable children
pamela sighs so do don and bob
if you want this choice expecting dick to stop position no no
they cant make deman have a cheery disposition but dick ignores her and carries on
who in the world put that in
play games all sorts
you must be kind you must be well of all the ridiculous
very sweet and fairly pretty take us on outings give us completely defeats the bob and don are trying to stop themselves from laughing as dick barrels right over everything
pamela says almost as if the two of them are doing a duet
sing songs bring sweets no sweets
never be cross or cruel who would give a child cast never give us castor oil or
dick grimaces a la michael banks
love us as a son and daughter and never smell of barley what in the world does water smelling of barley water have to do with anything
you wrote that in your book
she wrote that in her
yeah i think over you cant say that if you wont scold and we will never give you cause hate is too strong a wor to hate us we wont
hide your spectacles into tape recorder so you cant see nobodys listening to me
put toads in your bed ridiculous
or pepper in your tea no
sincerely jane and michael banks jane and michael banks
well i simply dont know what to say
thats the worst song ive ever heard
walt stands looking out of his window
pamela sits on a bench her feet tucked together her arms clasped around her body her face to the sky
she sits perfectly still until the limo pulls up and ralph gets out patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her
pamela opens her eyes and ralph nods hello
he opens the back door for her and she climbs in
tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to walt
what do you think
what do i think i what
youre a woman
thats a canny observation walt
what am i missing
you think the female of the species has some kind of psychic insight when it comes to others of her kind
walt continues to stare out of the window
youll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling
give it up
tommie waits for a response but hes still window bound filled with intrigue as he watches the car disappear
pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator
she spies the bar again a few people chatting over cocktails
the elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar instead
good afternoon maam
what can i fix you
a pot of tea
pamela looks around at the other women in the bar all glamorous coiffured very different to the practical mrs travers
the tea pot arrives
tea is a balm for the soul dont you agree
but the barman has already moved on to another patron
time moves swiftly the teapot is drained the customers come and go
the barman talks with another customer further along the bar
nobody notices pamela
in this setting she looks like a little old lady awkwardly perched on a stool staring into her empty cup
ginty in a rather tattered school uniform is diminutive in front of the huge double doors to the bank
an upright top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open chivalrously for her
ginty and the man enter the bank
a bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman
good afternoon mr belhatchett
cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously
ginty and randolph belhatchett are startled for a second by a loud crash
their eyes flit to the glass door of travers office
the etching on the glass reads travers has just dropped purposefully a tray of coins on the floor
he has a wild edge to him he may well have been drinking
its a ridiculous moniker
and mr belhatchett has complained that i opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he
in a comedy voice times money goff yknow
times money my man
the clerk laughs nervously
thats what it means
and i suppose if the poor dumb lambs on his downs are five minutes late with their calving or they dont drop dead on schedule when he wants a roast
he takes to them with the business end of his beautiful hatchet
travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air stabbing piles of papers filing cabinets desks
thatll teach you for not dropping your bairns on schedule
travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his eyes widen
through the door mr belhatchett
allow me to travers pushes the door open to reveal ginty at his side and is felled
i want you gone
all eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to have forgotten
travers is overcome with embarrassment and guilt
what are you doing here
ginty looks up at belhatchett and the manager
you said today was ice cream day
what kind of father am i
are you fired again
ah yes it does seem that no
no sweetheart he isnt
just wait in my office for a second darling
randolph walks away stopping to whisper in travers ear
if you cant straighten up for your own sake
do it for your daughter
muttering to himself irresponsible
travers holds out his arms to ginty and she runs into them
ice cream is so rare because it only comes from siberian cows
did you know that
ginty and travers sit by the river
ginty eats an enormous ice cream and travers sips continuously from his hip flask
we share a celtic soul you and i
this world is just an illusion ginty old girl
as long as we hold that thought dear they cant break us
money money money
dont you buy into it ginty
itll bite you on the bot
how did we end up here eh
look at it
get as far away from this place as possible my love
find yourself a patch of green
its a chimera you know
the world the bank you and i mr randolph whackety whack belhatchett
all an illusion
he stares across the river experiencing a wave of deep melancholy
ginty looks up at him aware of his profound unhappiness but unable to understand its source
another untouched meal in the hallway
pamela lies in the dark the phone pressed to her ear
i loathe this place mr russell
how can a place so sunny be so cold
we dont hear what diarmuid says
i meant heartless
im afraid a jumper wouldnt suffice
its bringing up these its so hot and stuffy i feel like i am being attacked
these odd dreams like my subconscious is after me
punishing me for entertaining the idea that i might hand her over
i am at war with myself mr russell
the script is ghastly exactly as i yes a few more days and then ill i know i know i need the money
itll bite you on the its all an illusion you know mr russell
all an illusion
good morning and goodnight
she hangs up the phone and continues sitting upright
staring into the darkness
pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for something to help her
she groans as she drags herself out of bed pacing the room counting steps
serves me right
money money money
bit me on the bot
her eyes stray to the big mickey mouse
she drags it onto the bed with her and climbs back under the covers clinging onto the stuffed toy for comfort
the room is decidedly more lively with sketches of the cast and models of the sets all about the place
and of course the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now accompanied by some healthier options vegetables and a fluorescent looking soup
bob and dick are at the piano
don sits in the corner sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a cartoon sketch of pamela travers
its gotta be like a slogan
her prescription for life
a stitch in time
an apple a day
from across the room time and tide wait for sugar
thats not jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday
they put it in a cube
medicine in sugar
cubes an odd word
dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off his stool
yeah we have sugar
pamela steps from the car and walt is there to greet her
may i walk with you
im sure your country doesnt have any laws about sharing a pavement
as they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot
dick is playing about with a verse
go back to the chorus
singing it incorrectly just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
she always does whats unexpected
she goes up the bannisters
dick is confused
so go up
dick plays a high note
he takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks dicks sheet music
dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano singing down in an up just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
don looks up from his sketching
the sound of walts cough signals his imminent arrival
man is in the forest
pamela and walt enter the room
i want you to hear this
to the boys play him what you got
walt takes a seat beside the piano
pamela folds her arms across her chest defiantly
its just a chorus tell us what you think
he knows dum dum will help dum dum dum duuuum
bob whistles what will end up being the robins part of the song
just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the medicine go do own medicine go down just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a
most de da dee daaa
well work out the other lyrics
you see how it goes up on the word down
on the word down it goes up
forget ironic its iconic
pamela rolls her eyes
i wont be able to stop singing that for weeks
it seems enormously patronising to me
the very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park i daresay
all giddy and carefree encouraging children to face the world unarmed
all they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and theyre equipped with lifes tools
dick is completely deflated
whats your point pam
my point is that unlike yourself mary poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy
she is truthful she doesnt sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know
she prepares them for it she deals in honesty
one must clean ones room it wont magically do it itself
she waves the script in the air
this whole script is flim flam
where is its reality
where is its heart where is the gravitas
she opens a window and flings the script out
no weight mister disney
dick don and bob look out of the window as the pages flutter downwards and spread themselves over the disney lot
no whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children
you think mary poppins is saving the children mr disney
pamela sighs shakes her head
pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for ralph
she sits down wraps her arms around herself closes her eyes
it goes up
margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately shushing her screaming infant
shush shush now ginty and biddy run in and out of the sheets chasing a large hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the girls
to the girls if you could just ahoy goffs
the girls and margaret look up surprised to see travers so early
she runs at him and swings her high into the air with one arm catching biddy with the other
what a lovely surprise
did you finish early
i couldnt stop thinking about my beautiful girls on this beautiful day in this beautiful place and i thought to hell with it
to ginty and biddy and what do we say about beauty ladies
a thing of beauty is a joy forever
buts are for goats my love
he dips her and smooches her
whispering to margaret ill put in extra hours tomorrow
what are we playing
the hen got out and weve been trying to catch her
travers spies the clucking demon
thats no hen
thats aunt ellie your mothers horrendiferous sister
thats a made up word
not the aunt
catch her before she flies away on the east wind
travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase the hen tearing through the clean sheets and treading them into the ground
ill wash them again my love
margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs
the kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life
even the dog joins in margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket she slips it back inside out of sight
out of mind
go sergeant ginty
fell the beast
ginty dives on the hapless bird who pecks her soundly and scarpers
travers the girls the dog and the evasive hen running into each other falling over each other cursing and laughing
oh shes a foul fowl
biddy and moya sleep but ginty is awake the hen snuggled firmly under her arm
she can hear the tense voices of her parents
darling its just that um a meg sweet i had a throat scratch the bank is getting you down again
perhaps my sister god no
i can endure
i will endure
for the girls sake just please not ellie
oh my dear travers weeps and ginty closes her eyes buries her little face in the hens feathers
pamela sits up in bed leaning back into the open arms of mickey mouse applying face cream then hand cream her face is screwed into a twist of unhappiness
disney sits on pamelas bench deep in contemplation
piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a all around the cathedral the saints and apostles look down as she sells her wares walt is dragged from
his thoughts and gets up to follow the sound
although you cant see it you know they are smiling each time someone shows that he walt walks towards the music room visibly moved by the song a cough rattling
in his throat
also in lamplight dick sherman sits at his piano
bob asleep on a couch in the corner
walt pushes the door open dick knows hes there but keeps tinkling away
though her words are simple and few listen listen shes calling to feed the birds tuppence a bag tuppence tuppence tuppence a bag
dick nods still playing
walt makes his way to the piano sighs sits next to dick on the stool
shes going to say no isnt she
womans a conundrum
dick stops playing and flicks to a new page of sheet music
a man has dreams of walking with to carve his niche in the edifice before the mortar of his zeal has a chance to congeal the cup is dashed from
his lips the flame is snuffed aborning hes brought to rack and ruin in walt laughs out loud he sings with dick reading the lyrics from the music sheet
my world was calm well ordered then came this person with chaos in her wake and now my lifes ambitions go with one fell blow its quite a bitter pill
inspired by someone we know
youd have to ask bob
the men smile bittersweet
she might surprise us all
you dont know that
i know it i know it only too well
ive fought this battle from her side
pat powers he wanted the mouse and i didnt have a bean back then
dick raises his eyebrows
he was this big terrifying new york producer and i was just a kid from missouri with a sketch of mickey but it woulda killed me to give him up
walt peers down at the sleeping bob
honest to god killed me
that mouse hes family
walt leaves the room
pamela sits by the pool arms clasped around her looking at the stars
the pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the water making it look like a chalk painting
the world is an illusion ginty
ginty sits on the front step of the porch arms clasped around her body face to the sky
the sounds of the evening closes in crickets the last deafening chorus of the birds
travers walks up the path to their home trailing his suit jacket over his shoulder his shirt and tie loosened
his shirtsleeves are marked with sweat
his face is a study of something close to despair
he looks up to see pamela sitting on the front step and immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of greeting
ahh the countess mary sparklestick
pray tell me what are you concentrating so hard on
i am laying eggs
today i am a hen
i can see the feathers sprouting as we speak
margaret steps out onto the veranda takes one look at her husband and knows he is drunk
helen goff would you lay the table for supper please
im not helen
she cant possibly lay a table shes busy laying eggs
i need help
her face contorts in im sorry
she goes back indoors and slams the door behind her
ginty gets up to go indoors and travers catches her by the arm
he swallows hard eyes welling
urgent his voice dont you ever stop dreaming ginty my love
you can be anyone you want to be
i want to be like you
dont leave yourself always searching for something he coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the porch
ginty is unnerved by her travers demeanor she creeps around to the side of the house where she watches her father appears in the window of the washroom
she doesnt know what to do as he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing
ralph looks at pamela in his rear view she seems weak the steely fight flown away on the east wind
her arms wrapped around her chest her face turned to the window
ya alright mrs
pamela doesnt even hear him
ginty stares out of the window in a daydream a paintbrush in her hand dripping colour down her arm
she is nudged to the present by her teacher mrs corry
wake up dear
you want your banner to be ready for the fair dont you
ginty turns back to her painting her banner reads around the words ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses one of which is white with roses on its
margaret biddy and ginty walk into the fairground
tents are erected farmers show off their sheep children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others roses upon its
mrs brill said fathers presenting the medals
a flutter of pride he is indeed
on behalf of the bank
pamela stares out of the window not really concentrating on whats going on in the room
again she doesnt hear
pamela looks at don
we were just saying that wed like to play you the song in the bank
would that be good
pamela nods noncommittal
as dawes snr so you have tuppence
may i be permitted to see it
changing voice to michael no i want it to feed the birds
back to dawes snr fiddlesticks boy
feed the birds and whatve you got
singing more sotto than but
if you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank safe and sound a small stage and dais stand central of the event over which a large sign reads soon that
tuppence safely invested in the bank will compound the allora townsfolk are out in force
ginty walks with her family
her father attempting to memorise speech notes as they pass through the crowds
and youll achieve that sense of margaret nudges him as randolph belhatchett and his family walk past
clears his throat mr belhatchett
randolph looks at travers then at travers shaking hands his family nod and move on
margaret looks upset by this
as your affluence expands travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them to ginty and biddy
travers biddys stomach oh for gods sake meg stop whinnying like an old nag will you
margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut
ginty notices travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent
father will you ride the carousel with me
but the refreshment tent has travers in its grip
meet you there in a blink of an eye
in the hands of the directors who invest as propriety demands
ginty stands with her family at the carousel eyeing the refreshment tent
ill take biddy to get ready for her dance
wheres your father
margaret sees the direction of gintys gaze
her face falls but she takes biddy by the hand and heads for the stage
come on biddy
ginty appears in the tents entrance
on first glance she sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers
relief begins to dawn and she turns away
it is then that she hears travers laugh and turns back to see the group part revealing travers at its centre
indeed a published poet she takes a deep breath and moves forward grabs travers hand
father come and look
in a moment my princess
back in ireland i miss her green but shes she really wants you to watch dad
youll miss it
not now biddy
devastated ginty doesnt know what to do she pulls at his shirt sleeve again
you said dont give up
a waiter approaches and takes her by the arm leading her away
excuse me miss
its gentlemen only in this section of the tent
i think youll be more comfortable at the far end
are you alright sweetheart
im scared my father is despairing she looks up and sees her mother carrying moya in the entrance
her mothers face falls and crumples
travers steps heavily one at a time up the steps onto the dais and finds his way to the speakers podium
margaret and ginty watch hearts in mouths biddy blissfully unaware
good afternoon distinguished guests our biggest supporter mr randolph belhatchett and his lovely wife ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
randolph looks at travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff
why is he speaking for the bank
hes the manager
im honoured to be here on behalf of the belhatchett bank of australia
shortly it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers
but before i begin id like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the er the bank in our community
ginty allows herself to breathe
so far so good
hes using too many verys
he always says very too much when she cant say it
ginty takes her mothers hand but margaret pushes the hand away
pamela turns away from don and the shermans and takes herself to look at a sketch of mr banks pinned to the wall he still has a moustache
as dawes snr very well my boy give me the no i wont i want it to feed the birds
as dawes snr banks
when you deposit tuppence in a bank account soon youll see that it blooms into credit of a generous amount travers is now in lip synch with dick sherman
and youll achieve that sense and youll achieve that sense of stature of stature as your influence expands as your influence expands to the high financial strata to the high
financial strata that established credit now that established credit now don is up and singing with the boys
they are enjoying themselves so much that they dont notice pamelas eyes well slightly
you can purchase first and second think of the foreclosures
all manner of private enterprise
as dawes snr while stand the banks of england
theres a smattering of applause travers is encouraged margaret and ginty look relieved even hopeful
but then travers momentarily looks lost a slight breeze tugs the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front of the dais
thank you kindly
now what what am i doing next
its a marvellous idea to encourage children to open accounts
my daughter the princess ginty shes uh
looks at ginty how old are you
come up here
ginty glances to her mother and then on trembling legs makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais
margaret watches growing uneasy
ginty has a bank account and thats good
give her a drink
the audience is shocked
i mean give her a hand
everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable
i shall return in just a moment to present the awards
but right now i must relieve myself
gasps from the audience
give us your shoulder ginty will you
theres a good girl
father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage travers leaning on gintys shoulder
the shameful glare of allora burning into them
when fall the banks of england england falls
travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps and topples off the stage
theres an audible horrible snap as he lands in an undignified pile
but despite his ugly injury travers cannot stop laughing
the boys are laughing congratulating one another
i love it
you think walts gonna like it
pamela takes a last look at the mr banks picture and spins around viciously
why did you have to make him so cruel
the boys jubilance is halted immediately
he was not a monster
who are we talking about
you all have children yes
and do those children write you letters make drawings for you
mine like to make folded paper cutting him off and would you tear up those gifts
in front of them
they know where this is going
its a dreadful thing to do
i dont understand
why must father tear up the advertisement his children have written and throw it in the fireplace
why wont he mend their kite
why have you made him so unspeakably awful
for all the world to see in glorious technicolor
you claim to make them live if that happens cant he
cant they at least live well
pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress
i cant bear it
the boys are shocked at the level of upset
please dont ill feel like i let him down again she leaves the room head hung
travers is in bed his leg elevated and set with plaster
he is shaking badly with dts his mood is poisonous
ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the doctor packs up his bag
i dont suppose theres any more you can give me for the pain
the doctor shakes his head at travers wanton greed for more
leaving the room when will enough be enough travers
ive brought you something father
be a darling ginty my old pal
help father out wont you
ginty is wary
in my washroom theres a bottle of medicine that father needs mother took it away
travers slams his fist on the bed scaring ginty
nervous hopeful ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper from her pocket
i wrote a poem for you
it it won first prize at school
travers takes the page tries to hold it steady in his shaking hand
would you like me to read it to you
the agony as ginty watches the shaking hand
finally the humiliation is too much for travers
he scans the page rapidly and lowers his hand
its hardly yeats is it
ginty is devastated
but more than this theres a hardening in her small face a sense of disillusionment that so far shes held in check
here are the first signs of the pamela to come
pamela rushes from the rehearsal room down the corridor her face twisted desperately trying to maintain composure
don rushes out after her
he stops recognizing she doesnt need to be followed
ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets drawers the trash but doesnt find what shes looking for
pamela rushes past minnie mouse and daisy duck through the lot past ralph whos taking his lunch at the cafeteria and towards a patch of green a communal lawn at
the back of a soundstage
ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans finally finding what it is shes looking for
pamela flops down onto the ground digging her fingers into the dirt and lawn
ginty creeps into her fathers room he sleeps fitfully and presses the half full bottle into his hand
covering both hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room
pamela picks a daisy finds a stray twig and arranges them in the grass
pamela looks up her eyes are red rimmed but shes not crying
i uh brought you a tea
he hands her the tea in a takeaway cup
its blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup
ralph shifts nervously from foot to foot
hes not quite sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea
pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits and pieces of twig and bloom that shes plucking from the area around her
everything okay maam
would you like me to drive you home
all the way to england
ralph lowers himself onto his haunches
you got family back there mrs
youre an impertinent man you know
you ask an awful lot of questions that have no relevance to you being able to carry out your duties
i do do that
and you have no barometer
ralph is confused
let us say that i havent family whod notice whether i was halfway across the world or sitting in my living room
she pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt ties two twigs together
ralph sees that she has a little collection of things he looks around for some more
pamela takes a stick and digs a small line through the grass then hands it to him
make a little furrow there
ralph dutifully does as hes told looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in disney soil
ralph pokes the ground thinking
i gotta kid
well most people do
jane shes got all kinds of troubles
pamela raises an eyebrow
handicapped you know
shes in a wheelchair see
thats why i concern myself with the weather sunny day she can sit out in the garden
rainy day i have to leave her cooped up inside
worry bout the future but then i stop cuz you cant do that
pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes holes in it
she takes the lid twigs now sticking out of the poked holes and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of pamelas tiny parks she
gently rest a leaf on the twig struts forming a roof
its a band stand
she takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid into ralphs trench which runs all the way around the park
i wish i could take her there
he points at the miniature park
wouldnt that be nice
ginty biddy and moya sleep soundly ginty clutching the poem to her chest
the door creeps open and margaret stands in the shadows looking at her children tears stream down her face but she seems calm something has crossed over in her eyes
theres just nothing there i know you gave it to him
squeezing gintys hand all the hope is in the bottom of that bottle helen
i want you to take care of the children
ginty is groggy she doesnt understand
watch over them
ginty sits up
i know you love your father more
but one day youll understand
margaret leaves the room and ginty is straight out of bed following her
behind in the room moya has awoken and is crying
ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden like some ethereal ghost
she runs out into the yard but stops as she hears biddy
ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her mother but margaret has disappeared into the darkness
the baby is screaming now
ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps biddy in it she scoops moya up from the crib
once upon a time there were three little girls alone in a house
they were frightened of the big wide world just outside the door
she takes them through the hallway stopping momentarily outside the door to her fathers bedroom
it is slightly ajar and he looks incredibly frail and delirious
they were so afraid
she moves forward her eyes flit to the front door expecting her mother to be standing there any minute but there is nothing
the mud stained hem of margarets nightdress sweeps along the ground as her feet move towards and then into the water of the creek
one step two three the water coming up over her ankles soaking the nightgown
but the stars were guarding them they glittered as they spoke we shall send a guide to show them the way to the magical ladder which will bring them all
the way up to biddy and moya are calming as ginty places the girls in front of the fireplace
and who do you think those sparkling messengers sent
who was it that came flying through the starry starry sky to carry us up to see them
ginty wraps moya in a blanket and puts her in biddys arms
ginty begins to untie albert from the fence still speaking to the girls through the window
their old uncle albert of course
beat to biddy stay right here be good ginty climbs atop the horse
are you going to the sky
im going to find the end of the story so i can bring it back for you
is it happy
ginty rides fast desperately searching the darkness for her mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp still burns on the porch
margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the creek
she wills herself forward into the water
she wants to sink down and simply float away
from behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves
margaret turns her head and there atop the horse is ginty
margaret begins to weep
ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother wading into the water to grab hold of her
ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep water
sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own cant see past the end of his nose
its time to go home ma
she reaches out her hand pamela looks through a stack of books intently jotting something down on a piece beverly hills hotel stationery every now and then
presently the phone rings
pamela almost jumps out of her skin
she rushes to grab it
walt sits at his desk flicking through cartoon drawings of penguins
coughs into phone pam
callin to check up on you
are you a doctor
check ups are for medical practitioners no
pam are you always so battle ready
travers in her breast plate and chain mail sword up in the air and off with your head
what can i do for you mister disney
please i beg of you please please call me walt
i heard things didnt go so well today
they went as well as theyve gone every other day that ive been here
i dont recall special phone calls from you on any of those other evenings
whats this all about pam
im wondering what i have to do to make you happy
arent you wondering that too
he has an idea you know youve never been to disneyland
its the happiest place on earth
shouting away from the tommie
cancel my morning tomorrow
im taking a ride with my favorite author
i cannot tell you how uninterested no positively sickened i am at the thought of going to see your dollar printing machine mr walter
she notices mickeys innocent eyes staring at her and gently turns his face away
oh come on
when does anybody get to go to disneyland with walt disney himself
disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air
walt slams the phone down
pamela stares at it in shock
he hung up
i cant believe he hung up
walt leans back in his chair and grins tommie enters
im not a violent man tommie but if mrs p
travers were to get hit by a large truck i he doesnt allow himself dick bob and don are drained
they stare at each other in silence
just the look tells us how much this all means to them
walt flings the door to the room open
we gotta fix this
ginty sits beside her father he is restless and sweating in his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge
the sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence
and then a new voice clear as a crystal bell
margaret my poor child
i simply had to come
we must fix this
travers eyes spring wide open in horror
a parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair
an enormous carpetbag similar to the one pamela carries plonked on the living room table and there beside it upright imposing and matronly is aunt ellie herself
hair scraped back hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket a very different version but mary poppins all the same
ginty looks on in awed silence as ellie begins to remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag
now ive brought every new fangled treatment available in sydney
biddy is open mouthed
close your mouth please biddy we are not a codfish
to both girls i spy a multitude of jobs to be done
theyve been so worried ive do stop babbling nonsense
im here now and i shall fix everything
feverfew and camomile to lower his body temperature
garlic sorrel sage
and if those dont work well i shouldnt like to say
young pamela and biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance as item after item emerges from the carpetbag
tincture of horseradish to ginty and biddy i thought i had made it quite clear you were to begin helping
ellie claps her hands together
ralph drives along solemnly
pamela looks out of the window confused
where are we
this isnt the way
change of venue this morning apparently
realizing where shes ugh
i was thinking about our tea party
im sure i dont know what youre yesterday the little park
i havent a clue what youre talking about
concentrate on the road
always chitter chattering
ralph drives pamela up to the entrance to the park
two security guards stop the car briefly and then the gates pull open to reveal walt disney waiting for pamela
ralph is goggle eyed at seeing walt
isnt that nice
never met him myself but there he is
ralph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but disney is there first
welcome to the magic kingdom
pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of her head with brightness of the place unbelievable colour and excitement
is it all like this
pamela pops a headache pill
isnt it wonderful
ralph hovers at the car filling his eyeballs with as much walt disney as he can get before he has to drive away
do you always get everything you want walter
with the exception to the rights to my books of course
war aint over yet pam
walt takes pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp
a young woman breaks free and rushes up to walt
i love you so much
she proffers a pen and paper but walt is prepared he takes a signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and hands it to the woman
you should get hers too
gesturing to pamela this womans a bona fide genius
the woman looks expectantly at pamela who just snorts
she realizes shes getting nothing and clutching her precious postcard to her chest melts back into the crowd who part like the red sea for walt and his guest
walt and pamela make their way down main street
walt stops anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out postcards to anyone who gets near
in adventureland there is a tree this is a fun fact
it has three million leaves four million flowers
and they said only god could make a tree
pamela rolls her eyes
there is a protracted silence as they walk both encompassed by their own thoughts
the sunshine the joyful crowds just background colour
they pass by a store front and walt glances up at the window
it reads elias disney contractor est
pamela notices the look but doesnt say anything
where did she come from
i think you know who
she flew in through the window one day
through the window huh
pamela nods curtly
its just that easy isnt it mrs travers
he sees right through her
i know you dont wanna be here so im gonna take you to one ride my favourite amusement and then ill set you free
way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance
the carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children climb down from the horses and disappear into the park
mrs travers i would be honoured if you would ride jingles
shes mrs disneys favourite horse
he escorts pamela to a beautiful white horse roses on its bridal
no thank you
im happy to watch
no greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child
pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel
theres a child in us all
maybe in you mister disney but certainly not i
get on the horse pamela
pamela sighs and allows walt to help her onto the horse
when we first met you said to me theyre family
i said what
mary poppins the bankss theyre family
the boys have had an idea for your mister banks
i think itll make you happy
you brought me all the way out here to tell me that
i brought you all the way out here for monetary gain
had a wager with the boys that i couldnt get you on a ride
he clambers onto his own horse gestures to the ride controller and off they go
pamela gently bobs up and down walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in mister disney spilling out
the tiniest tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars
travers has a violent coughing fit he looks to his hand disturbed to see blood there
he grimaces at ellie who has her back to him as she folds clothes a look of deep satisfaction on her face
well begun is half done
his face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon ginty outside the window sweeping
their eyes meet for a brief moment an unspoken understanding of what is to come before his close with tiredness
all the tables have been pushed to the walls don is just pushing the last one away as pamela comes in followed by dolly with the tray carrying pamelas tea
good morning mrs travers
she looks at the new arrangement of the room
what horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today hm
bob clenches a fist but dick gives him a look that says keep calm
now mrs travers you sit here
he ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room
he hands pages to bob and pages to dolly
don and dolly drop to their knees so that they are half the height of bob
pamela raises an eyebrow
we thought about what you said mrs travers and mr banks isnt cruel
weve got a new ending for the film
oh god i hope you like it
bob pulls a kite out from behind his back
michael says he mended it
however did you manage it
he mended it
dick strikes a chord on the piano
with tuppence for paper and strings you can have your own set of wings with your feet on the ground youre a bird in flight with your fist holding tight
to the string of your kite oh oh oh oh bob takes the hands of don and dolly and he dances around with them awkwardly as they are still on their knees and bob has a limp
pamelas eyes on the fixed kite
lets go fly a kite up to the highest height lets go fly a kite and send it up through the atmosphere up where the air is clear oh lets
go fly a kite don notices pamelas foot tapping he stands up
and then mrs banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon
as mrs banks a proper kite needs a proper tail dont you think
don drops to his knees again
lets go fly a kite up to the highest height is pamela humming too
lets go fly a kite and send it don bows to pamela puts his hand out to her and to his surprise she accepts and they begin to waltz
pamela is surprisingly elegant and accomplished
up through the atmosphere up where the air is clear oh lets go fly a kite everybody is up and dancing its like something out of a disney movie
when you send it flying up there all at once youre lighter than air dolly breaks away and rushes from the room
you can dance on the breeze over houses and trees dolly pants her way to the top of the stairs and sees walt just about to enter his office
walt spins around
im sorry to interrupt
its just she shes dancing
shes dancing with don
he cracks a great big smile
with your fist holding tight to the string of your kite as before
oh oh oh oh lets go fly a kite up to the highest height lets go fly a kite and send it up through the atmosphere up where the air
is clear oh lets go fly a kite
they all collapse in a heap exhausted and thrilled
he fixes the kite
oh i love it
dick punches the air
though proper english would be let us go and fly a kite
bob glares at her
but i might be willing to overlook that
did we get that on tape
everybody sighs with relief and pamela looks to the caricature of mr banks with deep warmth
ginty sits with her father hes a shadow of his former self extremely ill
the shaking has stopped his lips are parched and blueish
look at you all ship shape
travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up gintys perfectly plaited hair
i re wrote the poem father
travers doesnt respond
ginty reaches into her pocket takes out tuppence
the aunt gave me tuppence
she shows it to him in her open palm
shall i buy you something father
pamela sits bolt upright in bed panicked
ginty skips off the porch clutching her tuppence
chattering to herself about pears
the limo crests the top of the hill
ralph admires the view as he always does
do you know youre quite right
it is beautiful
its always new
pamela leans on the piano peering at her script
the boys are dotted about the room all are mid work
so jolly holidays in
as you wish
pamela is genuinely curious
now how in the world does mister disney propose to train penguins to dance
are you serious
ive heard about his implausibly leaved trees so i assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched
can you train penguins
no i dont think you can train an theyre animated
pamela is confounded
he draws a little squiggle in the air to illustrate his point
pamelas face turns beetroot red she pushes herself away from the table and storms out of the room slamming the door behind her
are we getting real penguins
pamela comes storming into the offices suite
dolly smiles up from her desk
good afternoon mrs travers
where is mister disney
if youd like to take a seat i would not like to take a seat thank you
i would like to she heads for disneys office and dolly is up and running after her down the corridor
mrs travers please
pamela blows past tommies desk
pamela pushes open walts doors catching him in the midst of signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face an unlit cigarette in his pen hand
walt im so sorry
dont worry tommie please close the door
disney gestures to his cigarette
never let anybody see me smoking
id hate to encourage bad habits
please sit down
i shall not sit in the seat of a trickster
mrs travers what in the world has upset you so
walt is confused
penguins have very much upset me mister disney
animated dancing penguins
now you have seduced me with the music mr disney yes you have
those sherman boys have quite turned my head but i shall not be moved on the matter of cartoons
not one inch sir
its a sequence you promised me
you promised me that this film would not be an animation
and it isnt
so theyre real penguins
no theyre animated
to herself smiling you foolish old woman
pamela reaches into her purse and pulls out the assignment of rights papers and leaves them on the table
good day mister disney
she turns on her heel and leaves
disney stares at the pages aghast
pamela flies past dollys desk
please call my driver and have him pick me up
yes maam when
pamela flees to her bench wrapping her arms around herself
disney comes after her
please mrs travers you must listen
you shouldnt make promises you cant keep especially to children they hold on to them you see
and those promises they just sit there inside of them like little doses of poison all those broken promises eating away forever
i dont understand why this is so hard for you
please make me the books werent written for the children
they were written for the promise breakers
the promise breakers
mrs travers i but shes gone face to the sky eyes closed breathing
ralph pulls up and gets out of the car
im such a huge fan
its such an honour to he suddenly sees that pamela is more deeply entrenched in herself than usual and his priority becomes her
ralph moves past walt and gently taps pamela on the shoulder she opens her eyes relieved to see him
you ready to go mrs
im so sorry mister disney
to have put everyone to so much trouble
you must reconsider
i simply cant give her up
perhaps not ever
i dont know you do know why
i cant hes hes
i just goodbye mr disney
she goes to get in the car and disney puts a hand to stop her but ralph blocks it
the ladys ready to go now sir
walt steps away and ralph closes the door to the car
walt watches the car disappear wracked with frustration and confusion
he takes a seat on pamelas bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky
ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for pamela
he gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and opens the trunk of the car
its been a pleasure driving you mrs
no one likes a fibber
i really have enjoyed it
didnt know who you were at first and then guess what
you found out
i was telling my daughter all about my day and how i was driving this nice writer lady mrs travers for mr disney and he leans into the and she
makes me go to her bedroom and get this
he pulls out a mary cant stop reading it
im very slow mind you
would you like me to sign it
id be honoured
ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write
your daughters name
like the girl in the book
reading as she writes to jane and her dearest father she looks at him ive just this instant realized i dont know your name
she shakes his hand
youre the only american i have ever liked ralph
ralph is chuffed to bits
may i ask why
now take this she hands him the piece of beverly hills hotel stationery with her notes on
albert einstein van gogh roosevelt frida kahlo what is this
they all had difficulties
jane can do anything that anyone else can do do you understand
ralph looks at her in awe
look at the bottom
deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior
pamela turns to leave
thank you mrs
pamela doesnt look back
tommie and dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and broken walt disney appears in front of them
tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at walt apologetically
flight left minutes ago
tommie hands him the itinerary he glares at it
expecting to read her goff
whos helen goff
thats her real name
walt is confused
yuh didnt you know
shes all hoity toity
british this and british that and shes really an aussie called helen goff
stuck up then whos travers
tommie and dolly look at each other and shrug
smiles to himself ive been talking to the wrong person
ginty skips up the path clutching a brown paper bag
she ruffles andrews fur before entering the house
ginty senses something wrong she hears hushed urgent and emotional voices in the hall
she pokes her head into the hallway
there huddled together whispering are her mother the doctor and aunt ellie
ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets
ginty stands frozen trying to still the panicked beating of her heart
margaret spies ginty and moves towards her as if in slo mo
there are flecks of blood on her dress
she is ashen shattered
she comes down to gintys level
ginty cannot react
margaret sweeps her into her arms and ginty drops the brown paper bag it tears and scatters pears all over the floor
gintys eyes fix on aunt ellies umbrella on the back of the chair drawn into its beady black eyes
i want to see my father
no you mustnt
i want to see him
suddenly she turns into a wildcat lashing thrashing biting screaming
nothing will stop her seeing travers
let her go margaret
margaret is forced to let go and ginty runs for her fathers bedroom
ginty stands in the bedroom a long way from the bed
she stands there it seems for an eternity
then finally step by step she draws closer
the empty bottle on the floor
the sheets twisted still wet with sweat flecked and spotted with blood
the front of her fathers nightdress is also bloodstained
gintys eyes reach his face
travers lies eyes open mouth open teeth slightly red stained neither peaceful nor distressed
i dropped the pears
she perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand
im sorry daddy
ellie appears in the doorway ginty addresses her without turning around
you promised you would fix everything
a black london taxi pulls up outside the house
pamela climbs out of the car struggling to pull her huge mickey mouse out too
pamela moves through the vestibule lugging her suitcase
pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in darkness
she gently closes her eyes ringed with sadness and a lifetimes despair
theres a knock at the door and she jolts awake she doesnt know how long shes been asleep but its black outside
she gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will take her
she swings it open
oh dear god
standing on the doorstep is walt disney
pamela is quite literally speechless
it was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight let me tell you
but you always get what you want eventually
isnt that right walter
he looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking
how about you show me how to make one of those nice english pots of tea
pamela sits at the table as disney carries in a tray with a teapot a milk jug a sugar bowl and two cups
these he places on the table and proceeds to pour tea
the milk goes in first
he attends to it
ill have whiskey in mine
disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter
she takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup
oh well when in rome
he pours a slug into his tea too
youve come to change my mind
to beat me into submission
no ive come because you misjudge me
how do i misjudge you
you look at me and you see some kind of hollywood king midas
you think ive built an empire and that i want to use your mary poppins as just another brick in my kingdom
you think i see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks
and dont you
if that was all it was would i have pursued an cranky stubborn dame like you for twenty years
idve have saved myself an ulcer
no you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure i did
you see i think life disappoints you mrs travers
i think its done that a lot
maybe mary poppins is the only person in your life who hasnt
mary poppins isnt real
oh no thats not true
shes real as can be to my daughters and to thousands of other children adults too
shes been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people
well where is she when i need her
i open the door to mary poppins and who should be standing there but walt disney
mrs travers i am so sorry
i hoped this would be a magical experience for you for all of us
but i let you down and in doing so ive broken a twenty year old promise to my girls
ive been wracking my brains trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and i you see i have my own mr banks
mine had a moustache
not true then that disney created man in his own image
but it is true that you created yourself in someone elses yes
she doesnt answer
walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little
ever been to kansas city mrs travers
do you know missouri at all
cant say i do and as i have no plans to ever set foot on american soil again im afraid i never will
its mighty cold there in the winters
walt stops talking catches himself looks away and then gives in
his enthusiasm completely disappears and hes suddenly as ragged and as weary as pamela
it pours out my dad elias disney he owned a newspaper delivery route there
morning and evening edition
elias he was a tough businessman
a save a penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldnt employ any delivery boys he just used me and my big brother roy
i was eight then eight years old
like i said those winters were harsh and old elias didnt believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so honestly mrs travers the snow would
be up to here he gestures to his knees
youd push through it like wading through molasses
and the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces and sometimes id find myself sunk down
in the snow waking up cuz i mustve passed out for a moment i dunno
then school too cold to figure out an equation
and back into the snow so by the time we got home itd be just getting dark and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came
back to life in the warmth
my mother would feed us dinner and then itd be time to go out again for the evening edition
best be quick walt best be quick or poppas gonna show you the buckle end again boy
walt smiles at pamela sips his tea
now i dont tell you all this to make you sad mrs travers i dont
i love my life its a miracle
and i loved my daddy boy i loved him
but there isnt a day goes by where i dont think of that little boy in the snow and old elias with his fist and strap and im just so
tired im tired of remembering it that way
arent you tired mrs travers
we all have our tales but dont you want to find a way to finish the story
let it all go and have a life that isnt dictated by a past
its not the children she comes to save
its their father
its your father
i dont know what you think you know about me walter you mustve loved and admired him a lot to take his name mrs
its all about him isnt it
all of this
pamela looks at her hands theyre shaking
its what i learned from your books
i dont need to forgive my father
he was a wonderful man
no you need to forgive helen goff
life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself
pamela looks down at the table top
give her to me mrs travers
trust me with your precious mary poppins
i wont disappoint you
i swear that every time a person goes into a movie house from leicester to st louis they will see george banks being saved
they will love him and his kids they will weep for his cares and wring their hands when he loses his job
and when he flies that kite oh
they will rejoice they will sing
in every movie house all over the world in the eyes and the hearts of my kids and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come george
banks will be honoured
george banks will be redeemed
george banks and all he stands for will be saved
maybe not in life but in imagination
because thats what we storytellers do
we restore order with imagination
we instill hope again and again and again
trust me mrs travers
let me prove it to you
i give you my word
pamela is alone
the unsigned rights papers in front of her on the table
she looks at mickey who occupies the chair opposite her her face softens under his gaze
disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads mary poppins opening soon
walt exits the building
hes but a few steps out of the door when tommie appears behind him
she hands him a sheet of paper
invitation list for the premiere
is that everyone
she looks at walt questioningly
well premiere in london as well
itll be more convenient for her
tommie holds his look
therell be cameras press interviews i have to protect the picture
walt walks away hes lost a bit of steam
tommy watches him go
pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto
she pings the return and breathes satisfied
i should say so too
the doorbell sounds voices
pamela begins to tap again
pamela tuts tries to carry on with her work
pamela rises from her chair smoothes down her skirt
for goodness sake
she rises from her chair smoothes down her skirt and makes her way to the front door
please dont screech like an alleycat
pamela and diarmuid sit together
pamela is quite changed she looks younger radiant worry free
i am so pleased to hear that mrs travers
i should think youll have a draft very soon
wheres that tea
its coming along marvelously
polly kicks the door open with her foot and plonks the tea down in front of pamela and diarmuid
she sneezes twice doesnt bother to pour and turns to leave
would you pour please
youre perfectly capable of doing it yourself
polly leaves pamela rolls her eyes
shes quite the worst maid ive ever had
so why do you keep her
i dont know she reminds me of me
do you have a title
mary poppins in the kitchen
should we start talking about the film rights
pamela narrows her eyes at him
now tell me have you got your tiara for the premiere
oh im not going
hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me
anyway its not he hasnt invited you has he
pamela doesnt reply
mary poppins wouldnt stand for that
pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin baggage into an overhead locker
the same flight attendant from the top of the film appears
can i help you
im perfectly capable thank you
the flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to horror
suit yourself maam
ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and welcome aboard this flight to los angeles
just a few announcements before we begin our taxi for takeoff pamela takes the seat next to the window she looks out at the tarmac
she closes her eyes takes a deep breath opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together
she folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead
walt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own office
dolly opens her mouth to speak but hes already past and tommie sits arms crossed and stares half bemused at walt
tommie nods toward his office
pamela is sitting in a chair back to them
walt semi recovers as quickly as possible and enters his office
how wonderful to see you
what brings you to im here for my premiere
i didnt receive my invitation but i just assumed the american postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual
she smiles sweetly
ill have a uh replacement sent to your hotel right away
thats very kind mr disney
i knew you wouldnt have forgotten me
pam how could i
you did after all assure me that i wouldnt be disappointed
the porter lets pamela into her room and doesnt even bother hovering for a tip
pamela turns and its like deju vu the flowers the chocolates the champagne a vip invitation to the premiere of walt disneys mary poppins
and of course the ubiquitous stuffed mickey mouse
i thought i left you in london
pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her shoulders
would you call me a taxi please
the doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo pulls up to the kerb
pamela doesnt dare get her hopes up but the door swings open and there he is her favorite person in america
had a feeling a certain friend of mine might be needing me tonight
she rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug
you look like a million bucks
lets get you to the ball
he opens the back door for her and she climbs in
disneys biggest hollywood opening
bulbs flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red carpet
ushers are dressed as english bobbies
reporters stand on podiums in colourful suits penguins dance their hearts out in front of the theater
pearly kings and queens play for the onlookers
crowds and crowds of fans scream every time a bulb flashes waving their autograph books and posters in the air
every disney character imaginable bounces up and down the lines of well wishers hugging them dancing for them signing their booklets
hollywood blvd is completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest party you could ever go to
ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds
onlookers press their faces against the windows trying to make out who is inside
pamela is nervous everyone else has someone with them but pamela must brave the crowd alone
the limo stops at the edge of the carpet and ralph jumps out
he rushes round to pamelas side and helps her from the car
immediately a round of flashes go off and pamela puts her arm up to shield her eyes
its too much
in her ear this is your night
none of this would be possible without you
she brings her arm down straightens her dress and breaks into a smile making her way down the carpet to frantic whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of who
is that anyone
pamela spots walt dick van dyke and julie andrews being interviewed together up ahead
mickey mouse bounces down the carpet and slows he and pamela lock eyes for a brief moment
he holds out his gloved hand she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds of
coloured balloons fly out of its roof and into the air
pamela moves through the spangling glittering perfect toothed hollywood crowd and no one pays any attention to her
the auditorium is jam packed
pamela is seated in front of walt disney
don the shermans and their families are in the same row as her bob sherman next to her
the lights begin to dim
the overture begins we stay close on pamela as the sounds of the overture fade and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of travers old melodys rings
in her ears
we hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain with pamela
she looks around at the faces in the audience laughing humming sad happy joyous
intercut with images from pamelas childhood and the voices of bert and jane ellies parrot head umbrella you know begging your pardon but the one my heart goes out to
is your father
the carousel horses at the allora fair there he is in that cold heartless bank day after day hemmed in by mounds of cold heartless money
the tuppence and rolling pears i dont like to see any living thing caged up
uncle albert with ginty on his back carrying her river soaked mother back to the house father in a cage
ginty pressing the final bottle into her fathers hand they makes cages in all sizes and shapes you know
the image of the dead travers in his bloodstained bed bank shaped some of em carpets and all
children in the audience their little faces tilted upwards
you wont ever leave us will you
whatever would we do without you
i shall stay until the wind changes
and then an image from the film george banks walks away from us down the misty tree lined london street on his way to be fired from the bank
walt disney watches with quiet satisfaction
pamela however has tears coursing down her face
her shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud but people are noticing looking at her
disney leans forward placing a hand on her shoulder
she reaches up and grips it tightly unable to speak
its all right mrs travers
mr banks is going to be all right
pamela nods in gratitude but cannot contain her sobs
its all pouring from her now in one immense catharsis
its just that i cant i cant abide cartoons
we stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the film lets go fly a kite
the audience around her are smiling laughing singing along
pamela the tears silent now still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics
and in her head one final image appears
travers gaze falls upon ginty outside his bedroom window sweeping
their eyes meet for a brief moment an unspoken understanding of what is to come before his close with tiredness
i will never lose you
the shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten year old ginty sitting in the lush grass arms wrapped tightly around her chest face to the sky as a smile breaks
free across her face
