and the underground station is deserted save for a colored cat well dressed in a silk scarf and wearing light pink shades over his eyes leaning up against a tier

anthony in a stark white walled toilet a violin anthony softly playing off screen a classic mozart melody
writing with pencil on wall in large capitals to be real
semi documentary effect to this scene camera dwells on free
some stock footage out of the great fencing scene in the sea hawk with errol flynn battling his adver sary in the castle their two huge silhouettes leaping up on
the stone wall behind them
its effect camping the seriousness of a
s feelings perhaps this implying his own ability to see himself comically
ability being what makes him go on and not give up the difference between him and alexander
violin is still playing through this scene
footage is cut at the moment flynn kills his adversary
camera panning a park discovering man in the cold in the day not raining his head in his hands looking at a small fire burning in wired trash barrel

i am what youre going to be
alexander handsome all in voluptuous black walking this away from poster down a few steps into his apartment
scene as very important to the well as the apartment are theme of the movie alexander being a throw back to the a blow up feelings expressed through words through
poetry of dylan in his apartment and a romantic unframed portrait of anthony rimbaud the young french poet he identifies with
in the apartment with him is more modern more uncertain of his symbols so far genet movie actors vogue and glamour models being his only glow ups he makes alexanders
trip here in the apartment and later again one last time in prison where alexanders destiny is unfolded along with anthonys two different roads but sprung from a similar source
alexanders dark brooding clothes accentuate the idea of a modern bewildered hamlet lost in a sea of words in a world where words are dying
during the course of his monologues the camera will pass through his apartment picking up objects such as his two cats one striped one siamese the paintings the blow ups
of comic book characters alexander has but on his vjall a poster of jim morrison of the doors and several large plants optional and flowers
the apartments colors could be plain white and black either black walls and ceilings and bright white furnishings or vice versa but a plastic stark contrast between two schemes old
white chairs bubble tables with neons glowing on them abstract portraits that of rimbaud could be semi abstract red and green contrasted to this single classic furnishing alexander all in
black pacing through his large one room apartment studio
a picture window looking out on the dark city way below
also a fireplace above which hangs a torch
not an apartment stressing wealth as alexander is beyond it almost mythic to anthony
as written the camerats effect is to circle the room time and again panning the objects as the spoken words themselves encircle themselves
the siamese sits in a white plastic chair looking
the striped cat is on the move
alexander gliding past his objects finding a cigarette anthony is sitting across lighting it standing
from him in a chair dressed in a light motif contrasting to alexanders black
looking at alexander anthony in his clothes looks like hes burned his lar t candle
alexander looking at him understanding softly whats happened anthony
a pausing shrugging saying oh like the french say it
camera wandering away from him his voice off soft almost an interior monologue strange things happen to me
feel like a little boy inside a crazy crazy city trying to close a window
and the windows jammed
i keep having accidents camera moving around room takes in another anthony sitting there in another outfit spilling champagne on himself camera continuing past him as if nothing has happen

i feel foolish
she says man youre so square

she throws a boot at me shot of boot hitting the wall next to a

snake people cat people dog people

find something and youre looking very hard
youll it anything just to try anything emphasizing find out and if nothing is available you go out and force a in street walking and because you yourself to look
shot force yourself these crazy people pin a label on it masochist why do you punish yourself
alexander so now what
pause a shrugging shifting mood camera dwelling on timbaud shifting to the comics
im sick of sitting in movies

alexander and anthony looking at each other

alexander turning away from tableaux asking a are you a killer who kills anthony
going on you have never
betrayed yourself to me
ever its sad that youre this way
you insist really on being your own hero in your own little tragedy
his offscreen voice a s words the images begin
four quick images from anthonys mind tumble on screen each image running through his mind with a click as from a slide viewer
killing the anake with his knife seen later
shot from a
as sole survivor of massacre
shoulder of desolate stream bed in the forest seen later
being decorated in dark shadows
a dark hand in a greta garbo glove putting an orchid on his afghan type uniform
the silver bird airplane flying across the
sky seen later
silver bird on airfield runway stopped alexander the door opening
parents the hero returned
diana others there
four strong black brothers in furs bearing a pink marble coffin strewn with yellow and black flowers from the plane
shot of horror on parents faces looking diana alexander bowing his head tears on his cheek hard offended by this heroic act
i dont think you know yet whether you want to live or die
close shot as face
pause becoming hard
i see before me with my eyes
i see a siamese sitting pn a chair camera follows these objects he mentions
i seeposters of dylan morrison superman
people with secret identitie
i see a library full of exalted expectations written by people whove been eaten by worms
i see a portrait of rimbaud
young tender bold
camera dwelling on portrait who after all his travels and adventures was delivered back to the beginning dying of syphilis into his mothergs arms
and i see one writer camera directly on alexander humbling him beginning to reveal his identity he wrote a poetic book at the tender age of eighteen
hes lived inside these hes done nothing since
four walls for more than a year now wrizing to all hours dream ing thinking imagining having his women around him like little insects and without knowing it himself becoming
an ultra sensitive very tender plant an interior this wounds alexander
a long pause
monologue delivered offscreen between the two of them in urgent intimate whispers something they might have said to each other before somewhere in the past soft said quickly
when i die will will you let me in
i see your face at the gates of eden
i dont think id let myself in
alx camera which has been panning the room during this short interior dialogue returns to alx
who is talking more to himself in a wistful vein its we really live like plants though
the wordless part of ourselves where things just happen to us
were hard on our animal selves so hard and we travel such a long way looking at dylan blow up its so hard to very few of us young ones
ever get on
and so few so really make it turning to a
after a long pause ive been here tco long
my mindistooloose my legs areinstagnantwaters last night
i asked my
insect woman to leave me
she did shot of a
listening to alxs conversational story imagining it
alx on floor in lotus position diana his diana painting s face with long snaky luminescent colors alx sprouting from the eyes the nose about the forehead
she looking very indian very intense about to be brutal
stands looks in the mirror says something he to her looks at her tenderly
she leaves a
as soon as she left i set my poems and my books everything on fire shot of flames seen in same
it was everything i had done is last year we i took a bag writing and but it made no difference
went to the end of it as far as could go and you know all else had what i found
i found nothing but myself
fallen truth illusion whatever it is and the dream had very suddenly come down to an inescapable almost implacable unmerciful factor factor inanition one
i like some poor poet would say had punctured by beautiful beautiful quintessence
quintessence is a lung
walking to a flat table designed as a chess board with the pieces on it all of them white a x picks up a castle in his hand rolling it
over saying a bit more gayly alx so i started playing a game of chess with myself today turns to a
it makes sense
camera on the all white chess pieces a x replacing the castle
and i shall play until ive completely lost track of which piece belongs to which of what belongs to what of who belongs to who
and then when the game is over he pauses
camera on superman blow up shifting to one of tarzan
alx you know anthony what the most beautiful dream in the world is
its the iris of a glistening green serpent snowfloating on a film of mosspink water perforating pupil gazes at your naked back it slices its through the fluid brim
it goes on and on fingers of the dawn
indifferent to any meaning alexander attaches to it words
these are just a i dont understand
words fall out of alx but words are thoughts
the sky like this rain
they glide from street corner to street corner
camera dwelling on cat the striped one moving the siamese looking at him the cats play a little game as the monologue continues
thinking theres always one more word one more thought nonetheless isnt there
train of thought
on the last on the next corner corner
what was it
i passed it by
you search you fail you wish perfection in the mind you are close closer yesterday but one tomorrow but one so close you are almost there
it collapses and where are you
thinking dimly thinking
on and on through a threnody of streets through words made of rain
looking at the rimbaud portrait
hollow distant boys i wrote the inexpressible i fixed frenzies in their flight
i purged my mind of all human hope
pounced with the stealth of a wild beast
called to the executioners
i gnawed their rifle butts as i died
the banner of raw meat against the silk of seas and artic flowers
veerings of chasms
music and the clash of icicles against the stars pause i re turn with limbs of iron dark skin and furious eyes people will think to look at me that
i am of a strong race made of i will cover myself with gashes tattoo my body as gold
i howl through the streets
ugly as a mongol youll see will be raving mad and never work and never show my jewels and one night pause the demon will seize me
and embrace me and we will wrestle on the floor and one night i will lose and come to regard as sacred the disorder of my mind shot of anthonys
face closer up closer his face dissolving into the trees blowing in the forest right after the explosion seen later shot of alexander looking out the window down at the city
goes on talking
as he talks camera casually panning anthony as he rises puts his coat on and leaves he has be to go back outside to the street which calls
alexander come really just another object in the apartment
his back is accepts his leaving without saying anything
the camera alter turned
he is speaking as if to himself
nating between the apartment and the rainy street anthony is walking down last night i was alone alexander his voice off at the musicend of death
staring flatfaced into a pond
the sea the ghosts of the lungs
the promise of things to be
a bony damp cavern where women grow like in the night seaweed from the sea they owl iboo iboo
cry her hand like an edge on my isolated shoulder so sweet as i rest in her breath in her breast my head on her shoulder and weep
shot of comic book blow up fading to shot of anthony chasing joanna through the woods seen later the fingers of the dawn they weep
all is seen through an eyeccave of bonepillars that redound
percussive m porous
stumbling towards spectrum
slipping on sound
t eating air
i tell myself reminding myself it is wet in my shell in my strong strong shell it is wet and now i feel
i feel the days melting into years and light years liquidating the years and time itself crumbling
through the lungs the ghosts sing their songs carry into the air air atmmsphere air all about shot al face quick cut to a
emerging in the street sniffing gratefully the wet air
air air fixed and silent how silent
long silences inhabit this air the drip drop of it in my ear in the air perched sounds tediums sweat like the movies a forgetive imago in black and white
and chevied with chiaro yes scuro
and in the zoo it takes two days to say yes
the only word that matters in the language
its in eden yes
walking down a street hooded with construction on the wall painted in red are timber the walls in blue
the words freedcm for greece
alx concluding out on the ocean slow shot of ocean late just before the sunset when it is green and desolate and cold and the big waves come up slow
shot of seagreen blue waves rising and falling out of the emotion
water thrashing on the skull
i dip my face inwards camera panning to an anonymous youth floating by himself in the water and float my starved eyes on the wide window of the sea
and lull my eyesockets to a wide eyed sleep
strange sample of the sea transfusing the spark of ingenuity shifting asking there is no ingenuity in the sea is there
i wonder what sharks are poised between here and there what fish lie lonely under the waves
walking back cut to alx
to the camera
looking in a mirror puzzled perhaps realizing a
has left and he is alone his words are much slower now a face
is a face
the end of truth
is this face
pleading his voice off flee the fugitive dream
it glistens in the moon
it dances on slithery serpents shot of slithering snake in shot thetemple
by rushing waterfalls
seenlater squeezed inwards by the stream in the forest seen later flesh fed pythons that coil slimes of eternity about my eyes shot anthony being bitten by the snake seen
to forgive forget
free to finish my hope
me both question and exclamation
shot francis at the stream dying seen later
cut to alexanders sad face
alexander approaching the end which is played out later in prison
street these words following him anthony on the hes tired exhausted worn leans up against the blue fence
his offscreen voice whispering fighting off the desire to give it all up words
just words wrapped around words
anthony in the dissolve to previous scene
bathrobe scrawling on the wall with the pencil bleak white to be real
but instead of the previous semi documentary style this scene is shot again with a closer realer camera catching the strong desire in anthony to achieve what he writes
dissolve forest stream temple the city time and place and worlds have changed
has been unreal frightening
here a much more relaxed primitive world that of snakes slow quiet but suddenly anthony moves very fast very violent and very dangerous
from the fear of the cat into the dream of the snake
he and never for will be bitten by it and he will kill it
getting it will journey on into the final deep sea world of silence
a has gone to the east to fight with the mercenary hes part soldiers against the wild tribes of the forest
of a small detachment of fifteen twenty men resting deep
in the jungle forest of a small old abandoned buddhist temple
the relics are broken the statues on the floor mixed with the mercenaries light individual equipment rifles small knapsacks grenade belts
in this temple buddha still stands some stray unknown forest people still coming to worship here there are fresh joss sticks burn ing
several mercenaries mostly black in their early twenties r are inside the temple sprawled on the floor on their ponchos a small fire going
one is sleeping another reheating a piece of meat they have killed a wild deer and his half eaten corpse is still slowly roasting on a stick built over the
several of the blacks are smoking the forest hash which they are passing sound in they wear an two pipes which are very long and beautiful
individual mixture of uniforms although their pants are all if they wear the same light tight fitting breeches
shirts several are bare chested with medallions bud dhist christian sharks tooth other designs and tattoos the shirts are loose some of them ruffled and mixing with the camouflage of
the jungle green and tan gold some wear head bands around black and white striped etc
their long hair silver bracelets beads one wears sun glasses another brother with a thin hawklike nose wears a black bandanna tightly wrapped on his head as if like the
other brothers he was just off the city block taking this is to be kept in mind for the a trip in the jungle
fate that befalls this outfit results from the fact that they are not really part of the forest
very few of them spite of their disguises from the city
will be able to survive the primitive ordeal of this world though th outfit has been several weeks in the forest the blacks have no beards
a small transistor
radio plays inside the temple and two of the brothers are dancing softly to the sound of soul music
the white world is for the most part outside the temple sprawled about it in the thick grass relaxing
some have beards others have shaved but their faces are hard and dirty dust and dirt is deeply ingrained in the cracks of skin anthony is an exception he has
kept him self clean his beard barely visible although there are small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar under his left eye the result of a previous wound not serious
he tends to rub it occasionally
ironically in the war he has become even softer
time has crumbled he is spacing himself
the contrast is made then by camera closeups of the black and white features the blacks are tenderer softer
the whites are tired cruel
the blacks sing dance
although inside they are as blue as the sky and scared
opening shot set to music contrasting to the world of words anthony has just left behind in the city
a black soldier with rifle and grenades but hat less like all the rest is striding through thick elephant grass and thicket the camera with him as he walks catch
ing the effect of the green elephant grass splitting apart as he walks the sun gleaming through the trees almost moving with him seen and then not seen and seen again
from a distance inside the temple on the radio sam cookes song cupid is playing loud and sort of sad like all cookes songs giving a texture of music and
sunlight to his walk
he breaks through the thicket into the crystal clear sun shining over the tiny clearing around the temple
the whites sprawled about
as he breaks through the thicket anthony wear ing silver bracelets and a buddhist medallion around his neck and a ruffled dirty shirt his hair unkempt longer than before is
taking his picture from a distance through a telephoto lensed camera which for the first time he a
snap carries with him radio still playing cupid
the shutter again
photographic freeze of robinson ping and anthonys first use of his eyes the soldier xus c are themes inherent to the forest
camera on a
as he moves about the clearing pictures of the white soldiers
their photographic taking freezes
introducing their hard faces
shooting lee who is at the head of the out fit later described
shooting bunny the youngest soldier who is handsome and tender looking though later his actions describe him as stupid and cruel
pausing walking a little bit further away from the temple
isaac a a
approaching from a distance moder with sharp attractive ately tall slender muscled indian features no beard whatever his long black hair curling down over his forehead could look like a
little boy but he stands there away from the rest sharpening his long glistening hunting knife
his chest is without hair and he wears a thin loose fitting vest of black cloth hanging from broad the way he sharpens unbuttoned hls shoulders
his knife with stone and cloth it is obvious this is his most important possession
raising the camera to his eye to take his sees isaac raise his head picture
through the lens a shakes as he feels the camera on him
looks at camera
turns away from the camera a
walking back into the temple after his trip
the scene in the temple as described into the white world
dancing to the music he previously stops at the threshold of sunlight thinks about taking in here cannot cant this wrld a picture but knows he goes and sits by
francis a brother be photographed he has tender features he who is very close to anthony
listening smoking the bowls as they come directions
around from both they are all feeling very nice
on the radio smokey robinsons tracks of my tears is playing and as the two brothers dance francis who has a very high singing voice though not as good as
smokeys whom most people mistake for a woman he sings so tenderly starts to sing with the radio people say im the life of the party cause i tell a joke or two although i may be able to laugh loud and hardy deep inside im blue so take a good look at my face youll see my smile looks out of place if you look closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears i need you
need you since you left me if youve seen me with another girl seeming like im having fun although she may be cute shes just a substitute because youre the
permanent one so take a good look at my face youll see my smile looks out of place look a little bit closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears etc
song his brand of blues the camera as francis sings closes on him in the backdrop buddha sits
as he sings the rest do not look at him sing they know he can sing theyve heard this song a hundred times they know it too
they lie where they are look at what they do and deep inside where its blue they listen
the two brothers on their feet dance slowly a gestures with their hands about shoulder level and few their feet moving in a tiny circle of tenderness the pipes continue
to circulate francis even interrupting his singing momentarily to smoke hold ex he is not performing he is hale and then sing again
just singing along
the smoking of the hash naturally has some relationship to the surrounding dream world of the forest but isn t really significant and like the singing is very casual going
almost unnoticed by the camera
the song ends
camera dwells on buddha at peace another long the camera moving to afternoon in the forest drifting by
adams who is very high off by himself in a corner of the temple
he is one of the whites wandering through his head his low interior monologue
the monologues here are done swiftly voices following quickly on other voices
adams off theres no entertainment out here
theres no movies no shows
i live in a beautiful world
where things dont make any dif ference
it will take them a long time to come where i am at
maybe they think im crazy
but im not
i have friends
camera moving from adams to the ones he calls his friends
to king who is the biggest brother very black with big white cotton picker s nails
his large pink hand some tongue as he says adams the king has a pink tongue es
he says he eats a lot of chicken
there aint no chicken here a
in the forest
kings voice off following quickly on adams king cotton is easiest to pick its tall i could pick pounds in a day

once he told me when i asked him why he took allthcse pictures he said hed never used his eyes before
he says this wasteland is beautiful
thats what makes him crazy
talking like that
those kind of people never seem to get killed though
he got grazed below the eye
we thought he was dead
somebody somewhere looks out for him
me id never used my ears before i came to the forest
id like to write when i get out id like to write down what i hear
first id go back and get some schooling and catch up on my spelling
therere a lot of questions i have but theyll probably never get answered like how high is the sky how many flies there are in the world
how do they know people dont live in the stars
as adams is wandering around in his head camera moves from a
to jeremiah called rhah who is strutting up very confidently his walk snake like all waves un dulating
he looks older than the rest his origins seem he speaks with a slight obscure probably from the south
arriving standing above the relaxing group
rhah over a slight malicious smile on his face
looking them francis looking up smiling whats happening rhah
pausing fixing the whole circle in his rhah eye settling on buddha for his address smiling rhah im whats happening and if you dont dig me your shit is hanging
in the wind that gentleman is what say
baaaaaa he delivers this last like a growl a neigh implying i am what i am
lerner the only other white with anthony and adams in the temple a jewish looking boy from the city young and freaky with curly hair thin he was the boy
at the elevator in scene looks back at ah his tongue hanging out like an alcoholic grotesquerie
and baaaaaaaal back on you delivers it with all the contempt and venom he can shaking his head a stuporific look in his eye making a grotesquerie out of what
rhah delivered with a certain style
rhah looking at lerner hard with distaste
rhah if youre going to do it do it right
rhah winds himself up and with a dramatic downsweep of his fist at the same time taking a step with his foot de livers a huge convincing baaaaaaaaaa
his head shaking staring wide eyed at lerner
the group laughing
aah draws himself up
smiling and proud of himself
lerner looking at shah with half closed eyes

lerner taking his head into his hands shaking his hair pretending to weep im a child

shot of a
francis to lerner wow man dont take it so bad werner raising his head oh it doesnt bother me what rhah says

pause lerner head bowed saying whew
anthony has listened
on the radio which had temporarily broken down during rhahs appearance starts up again manny playing with it
as when francis was singing most of the brothers have not seemed to listen to f i make his scene they hear but they dont look as if their ears
eyes and mind were all separate senses
manny toying with the radio gets it playing again but some crazy station and lili marlene is being sung by marlene dietrich about ten seconds before nanny slightly embarrassed behind
his black shades turns to the soul station saying thats some old time sides theyre throwing at us
s smoking like an old f ah has seated himself
outside camera moving to the commotion
windowless sunlight hole on the side of the temple several shot such holes around the walls about by feet
through this frame of some whites chasing around
get the snake
camera outside closer shot of a large yellow black and red snake moving very fast over the ground the snake moves fluttering white hands trying to catch it
with great twists of its body making you wonder how it can camera move so fast
knowing these hands are death
dwelling on this snake moving at about five miles an hour sliding through over under but unable to get out of the large circle the whites have made around it
we almost sympathize with the poor snake fighting wildly through the circle and they
are running suddenly it breaks after it again
they cannot catch it but the powerful snake making one mistake and unable to pick out isaac the indian who is standing perfectly still watching slithers unknowingly through isaacs spread
we havent seen isaac yet
first shot of his legs and the snake sliding through
his hand speeding downandpinning it by the neck
tilt up medium shot to his face as he scoops it up
a grimace of pleasure on his face snake dangling by its neck its tongue flickering sees it helplessly
lets it dangle isaac hisses at it
wraps it around his is non poisonous
wrist on the other wrist coincidentally he has a replica of a snake done in silver smaller three or four coils the snake crawls up his arm wrapped around his
wrist towards his neck
this scene with isaac and the snake is shot fairly fast not too dramatically
long shot of isaac and snake through the temples taking a sunlight hole
focusing his telephoto lens picture
freeze of picture
isaac seeing a
take the picture close shot of isaacs eyes a virile smile on his face and wordlessly because it is his snake walking out of the small throng of whites who
are around him admiring the snake walking in his soft tread towards the temple the snake now wrapped around his neck by now it should be obvious that it is not poisonous its tongue and head swaying over isaacs chest
on his bicep isaac has a small graceful tatoo born to kill long shot of him approaching temple
francis off crazy people dig snakes crazy people
violence is like snakes
we hear the snap of his shutter as he takes another picture of isaac approaching
very quick o veq unexpected
quick freeze of snakes head swaying
side shot of isaac moving from the waist up
the camera zooming out slowly on isaac till it brings francis and anthony into view looking through the sunlight hole at the moving isaac
he scares me man hes francis off at first he plays his knife like she was wild crazy in the head
taking another picture he moves nice man
its funny its tender its soft
o its so all alone
shot out to front of what they see
isaac has already glided in around them in the tiackdoor of their temple
as the camera is focused out through the light hole there is a slight rustling behind them the sound a snake makes when it sways
frontal they turn swiftly
shot of isaac standing right behind them the snake wrapped around his arm its head swaying out in front of francis
francis doesnt move but his face muscles tighten and his eyes dilate a little
francis dont fool with me man dont fool with me isaac smiling
behind him still sprawled around the radio flaying are the brothers and shah and lerner and adams but things are quieter and without look ing they listen
isaac anthony is also repulsed by the snake
smiling a bit says slowly isaac you been staying a long time in the shade anthony
fixing to get a tan
like his nodding at francis or red like mine
he smiles isaac coiling the snake in the cup of his hand it up to a
hesitating a moment putting the camera away looking at isaac takes the snake not looking at it as its wet living body winds through the fingers of his hands the
snake isaac smiling
looking directly at him
a look of comprehensix and re winding up anthonys arm
isaac sees it laxation coming into his face
isaac its alive isnt it
nodding taking the snake in his hands anthony passing him around his neck his waist beginning to feel a tremendous joy in this living wet damp creature his fear of
the snake responding p beginning to calm down on anthonysbody
at this point isaac says give it to me
attracted by the power in isaacs eyes
he gives the snake back
isaac cups it in his palm
isaac to anthony come they go down together down the three steps which separate the raised floor around the inner wall of isaac leads anthony the temple from the worshipping
up to the buddha as they walk we pick up from the radio the hollow voice of sam cooke again singing lets twist the night away almost a four oclock
in the afternoon voice at the dead end of the day this accent on twist twist twisting the night away
isaac places the snake on buddha has many arms
the one of these arms
anthony to his side watching
snake in the arms of this new almost golden object starts glistening and sliding wildly through its many arms isaac drawing his long hunting knife with his right hand from
his left hip his features dedicated as a priest before the blood letting
isaac not looking at a
quickly he pins the snakes speeding head with his left hand and without hesitating violently slices its head off a cruel look of brutality on his face
with his left hand isaac whips the snakes im
iw head in the air as if it were a scalp
his arm is quivering
his head is down the gesture not deing that solemn but more spontaneous quick contemporary the gesture has already faded he pulls in his arm
puts the head to his lips
looking turns to a
offers him the head
at isaac powerfully attracted by the look of strength in drinks
takes the snake head
it goes down tastes the blood in his mouth
a smear of it on his lips making them corral close shot of isaacs colored
close shot of his lips
wide strong mouth
a shot a single rifle shot is heard from out side
its echo dies
they look at anthony and isaac havent moved
isaacs eyes alight with anticipation at the each other
anthonys eyes completely rifle shot the call of danger
lost in isaacs animal eyes feeling a powerful attraction to this almost human fire
shot of fire
anthony under close of isaacs face
shot standing the fire is in people and between them the other soldiers the rifle shot is repeated
are hurrying out of the temple now not having been alarmed by the first shot
the radio going with them
shot of isaac and anthony standing in front of buddha
solitary shot of the rifle that fired being raised by an arm into the air
resting in the sky flat in indian style
a cry is heard
explained later the cry is freedom but in a strange language
the screen is in blackness for several seconds
then a chant begins in the blackness a dionyslan chant or something similar
what is the name of the father what is the name of the son what is the name of the father what is the name of the son dionysos dionysos
god of joy god of love dionysos dionysos dionysos example taken from dionysos in off bdway play the chant is repetitive accompanied by a tarn bourine but in this repetitiveness in this lack of desire to search for new interpretations there is a real feeling for love which is really a source without words
the screen slowly comes to light and we see a young tribe maybe a dozen dancing freely in the forest by a stream
perhaps they are the enemy it is not made clear yet
they are a mixture of young men and women and their children white and black
they dance hugging each other their long hair jumping in all sorts of love contortions that display their freedom
they are all in love with each other with and easy as it is forest
their god with the to make fun or laugh at this scene at first must be done with the camera truly involved in their spirit of joy and freedom
the hair some are blondes some black haired
long the players young and contemporary looking and above to preserve the spirit of the scene they must move all well in some sort of time to the tambourine throwing
their bodies into it
ideally they are naked and some but barring that they wear fiasy of them body painted
threads hand made of beautiful colors primitive tribal a few wear colorful head exposing their handsome bodies
bands all of them some kind of ornament bracelets beads native jewels clasps etc
the colored tribesmen do not exactly wear the same clothes as i think they would look sort of silly
their threads suit them and nobody else and there is no need to establish any equality similarity as far as clothes go saying that freedom has if theyre not naked
then let them no respect for clothes
what they look beautiful with their own motif in mind want to be is left up to them in his mind the writer forms the image of the black panther
a sort of ineradic able wariness at the root of their freedom unlike the white who when he loses his mind really proceeds to lose it and to embrace the new
whether the blacks actually dance is left up to them
they could be sentinels in the woods they could be on the stream watching the others do their dance
camera paning up slope from the tribe into the
long shot woods
their singing carrying with the camera
of soldiers moving slowly in single file through the woods in the same combination of clothes as at the temple carry ing rifles small knapsacks on their backs hatless
having cautiously camera zooming slowly into the point man who is bunny the youngest one set out to prove hes as good as any man his features assuming a distorted
camera now encompassing lee who is second in the file he is small carrying a map in his hand a young sergeant
with a heavily repaired face indicated by the seam of scar tissue running from his ear along his jaw to his chin
he wears a red bandanna around his neck
bunny still in the cameras eye turning back lee gives him to lee as he hears the sound of the music
a tight look squinting he frequently squints nervously assuring himself of which part of his face is really his
comes up on bunny
puts binoculars over his eyes
do not know what he sees
brings binoculars down
looks at his map
turns motions to the men with his arm to sweep out downslope slowly
finger to his lips to indicate silence although the men know what they are doing anyway and can hardly see his gestures
frontal shot the men disappearing in the forest
of them inching down the slope to the stream
then side there are view of them approaching
music growing louder
no sentinels around oddly
they approach the stream and quietly crouch down behind rocks trees dead logs
take off their knapsacks
what they see at first does not really excite them they are much too wary and as a group have up to now functioned as soldiers
shot of as face
moving up further very interested
they have been watching for a while and un francis and controllably they start inching further up
they pass another brother joining a
from different sides
anthony putting his rifle and each other a puzzled look
knapsack down taking his camera out and shooting the tribesmen
shots of adams lerner
shot of lee his tight body on the ground his
binoculars to his eyes propped on his elbows looking
puts the binoculars down
picks his rifle up puts it to his shoulder his eye squinting medium to close shot he is an expert marksman his legs loosely spread and the stock of his
rifle deeply imbedded in the shoulder the rifle slightly twisted inward his rear elbow coming up off the ground as he sights in for a little man he shoots high off the body very confident very precise
camera dwells on him as he is about to shoot
but he hears footsteps behind him
takes his eye from the stock squinting not looking around
the footsteps getting closer
on the feet shot of the feet next to lee are moccasins they are isaacs lee looking up at isaac who has a small french submachine gun cradled in his
arms and is looking down at the stream bed
isaac giving lee a look and proceeding down to the stream his action fore stalling a massacre
lee with hate in his eye staring at isaacs back
as isaac walks down to the stream in the openl the tambourine stops
a female in the tribe sees him
shot of one of the tribes blacks they stop dancing
standing up from where he was watching and warily looking at lsaac proud but who walks on down to the stream
he stops a little puzzled for the first time in his life
dis tame away
the leader of the small roving tribe no older than his early thirties calls to him
making with his hand peace and joy a small sincere gesture something like this x the word peace showing the back of his hand joy the front of his hand
implying an empty hand stretching it saying join us
isaac pausing puzzled
j o are you
the leader smiling turning around to give the sign for more singing dancing
the tambourine resumes playing and the tribes people resume their dancing and singing as if nothing has happened
the few blacks are still wary but the whites fall to it and soon are becoming more intense than ever perhaps thrilled that they are dancing the passion dance in
the eyes of the cobra with the gun
they carry no weapons
shots of individual soldiers seeing what has they start creeping slowly down to the stream
isaac puts spreading out on the logs and rocks watching
his weapon away and sits watching by himself
the blacks in the tribe have become more wary seeing these other soldiers but they cool it although they rightly feel lee remains up in the wood
theres going to be trouble
the black soldiers more is the last to leave him
bunny or less assemble together on a huge fallen log and watch
anthony with them
the whites other more thinly spread
a shot of shah looking
the dancers growing increasingly erotic their limbs interlaced men on the ground women passing their bodies closely over them feeling everywhere with their hands
shots of the soldiers faces growing more and more desirous
isaac perhaps feeling this desire wanting suddenly to be alone and think retreats into the woods by himself without a rifle pensive looking
his disappear ance is fatal as he was the only force that could have suddenly prevented what occurs
the dancers writhe
with a yell lerner rips off most of his clothes and jumps in with them and starts to writhe and join in the spirit of freedom
the tribe accepts him but with no display
he mixes well hs belongs but his action only agitates further the other white soldiers
shot rhahs face
a hatred for lerners fool ishness on it
shakes his head slightly saying quietly you child
not the dancers almost copulating to the music
even singing anymore
shot one of the males on his knees his head buried in a womans belly her arms around his head writhing against his head
cut bunny heaving the same girl up on his chest
she is so far gone into the ecstasy she doesnt notice really who it is
he grins madly and the other starts making off into the woods with her
whites with shouts following him hugging the women like satyrs at the rape kicking the almost unconscious help less men away with their boots some knocking them away with their
lerner fighting for the women but the women begin to realize what is being knocked aside
one a few screams
happening and start struggling
heavily bearded white chasing a girl no more than sixteen shah wading out to into the stream thrashing with her
help her struggling with the big soldier who throws him off
shot of lee in the woods raising his rifle and expertly firing into the water around rhah warning him off
a black rhah looking wildly up into the woods
tribesman jumping on him
they scramble in the water shot of lee putting the rifle away doesnt he squints looking down at the chaos pleased
shot of isaac deep in the woods hearing the turning around slowly his face muscles hard but shots
he doesnt his eyes already resigned to what has happened
shot of the rape from behind the brothers who anthony is no longer there
are still on the log watching
camera moving to their side shooting them in profile watching resigned indifferent
robinson the soldier who was coming through the bush at the beginning to the sound of cupid rises
i might as well cut myself a piece too
one starts he looks back
they look at him
eating the food he has carried
robinson shrugs moves off
cut to anthony
hes way out in the woods on the far bank of the stream opposite his companions with the his rifle looking intently for something he has seen
music is still playing in the distance but fades as he runs after joanna
he is not aware of what will happen at the stream
it is before runny began the rape which will be simultaneous with his
cut to joanna leaning her hands behind her up against a tree
her naked body painted green like a sn e her face as well
she is a stunning her hair is blonde
anthony at last finds her approaches hesitantly looking at her as if she were unbelievable but naturally he stops p uts his rifle downc drawn to her primitiveness
takes his magazine belt off not taking his eyes from her
a snake is hanging from the tree above her head
a long pause
youre not scared of snakes are you
joanna anthony no not any more
youre not scared of me are you
a hesitating no
camera on anthony as joanna says joanna take your clothes off then
the snake in the tree rustles anthony takes his clothes off
stands there naked in front of her
joanna vho are you
anthony hesitating anthony j
here she either takes the snake down off the tree and she wraps it around her neck its head swaying over her breast or more easily done puts her hand
up into the tree and the snake glides around her hand and arm or she just simply slides off the tree saying i am called joanna
but anthony joanna looking at him smilingly with her eyes and shaking her head will never have joanna because he is scared of her arei he will never catch her
she laughs and starts moving away
snake rustles and dry anthony watching her
bird calls out of the trees
the distant sound of the tambourine
anthony who has never really pursued before he hears the bird calls increase
begins to follow her
the dry dangerous clicking rustle of snakes which seem to she walks faster inhabit the forest
he walks faster
they move from not bothering to look over her shoulder
the chase tree to tree both naked in the green forest
begins a long sequence
their movement is deeper into the forest away from the fast fading music
they increase their speed until they are running as fast as they can through the trees
joanna is as swift as a deer and al but ways seems to elude anthony who is also very swift
rather than lose him she hides and he finds her or she lets him see her and the chase begins again the only sound their speeding naked feet on the
forest floor as anthony runs he sees the snakes in the trees and at their foot and in his path too but the chase has made a young savage out of him and he runs by these hissing snakes without thought or concern
just to take her like his companions are taking back at the stream
the chase is long
he catches her at the base of a tree perhaps the same tree where they began the same snake hissing in the tree
they entwine taking long deep breaths shot in slow motion they are falling togeth er onto the forest floor their eyes closed anthony so happy f so out of breath
his breathing her breathing his shot animal moan the only sound now in the forest
low as they fall together of a snake biting anthony in the arm seen later is shot in slow motion so that it melts into their fall also in slow
motion possibly a superimposed image
the camera on them as they writhe in each others grasp like two snakes feeling touching in the wild freedom seen at the dance all over each other anthonys face
in close up a picture of pleasure and pain and breaking through that to freedom a great expressive ness in both their faces
the camera leaving them alone panning slowly back to the stream passing the trees the snakes
the pan dissolving putting the screen in dark reluctantly we come back to the rape at ness
slowly the stream
bunnys boyish the screen still in darkness
angry voice off f
hats the matter do i smell bad
am i dirty
sound of hitting her hunh dont am i ugly
you people believe in sex or do you just dance hunh
hits her you people her voicetyou coudlnt understand
could never understand
bunny what do i got to understand
hits her how to feel
she screams very loud like a bird dying
the dull monotonous he hits her again and again the echo fading echo of slaughter on the black screen
on the screen a shot of the girl lying beaten
shot emphasizing to death draped on a broken tree limb
she is already very white and looking stuffed
she is the same girl seen earlier in the motorcycle suit fossibly a silent shot of looking at rodins the kiss
camera dwells on this this previous scene cut short
trying to kill
anthony springing on bunny
bunny butitsan even match and they go on fighting use lessly and camera losing interest in them pans to tribe people running off into the woods on the other side
of the stream like fauns
some soldiers are standing around the dead girl some of them amazed that the rape should end in murder
anthony and bunny both exhausted are struggling off to the side out of breath
the leader of the tribe striding up to the girl picking her up she dangles wax white in his strong arms a lifeless puppet
he speaks to the soldiers clearly slowly all of you will pay for this black as well as white
shouts you are animalsi you are beasts
cut to leader moving away in the rain across the stream from them the girl lifeless in his arms moving up the other slope it has begun to rain but
we did not see it begin it is already in progress in this shot the rain will continue till the very last scene in the forest when it suddenly breaks
on the opposite bank joanna clothed now waits at the woodline for the leader in the same pose of waiting that she uses later when she waits for isaac at
the edge of another woodline overlooking this same stream
anthonyceases to struggle with the exhausted bunny and on his knees dirt all over his face he looks up and sees her
she sees him
then vanishes in the wood following the leader
anthony still looking after her
shot anthony running through the woods after joanna
shot anthony entwining and falling on the floor the camera doing the same pan of the forest with joanna
as before across the trees back to the stream
his voice youll have our child
ill have the child of many fathers
her pause go
him go and kill yes
her ill come back
him her no the camera pans right into the rain as it heads
downstream the above voices do not begin until the camera is into the rain and picks the mercenaries up later on their march
long shot through the woods of them walking right down the stream itself which comes up around their knees
the bush on both sides of the stream is now to they are walking in a staggered thick to walk through
double file one on the right side of the stream another further back on the left another further back on the occasionally crack of thunder come out of right etc
cries of the deepening the rain grows worse
lee at the front with
the men are soaking wet
they squat on bunny motions for them to take a break
the rocks on the edge of the stream pulling their ponchos out and covering themselves up completely looking like great sad useless tents hardly paying attention to the surrounding forest
shot whiskered old looking rhah pulling his poncho out getting into it his tired lined face peering thinking
out from under the hood
squatting on a rock
pilling the pulling out a bowl and a small plastic bag
bowl with the last of his forest nash
throws the bag in wearing his the stream
anthony slowly comes up on him
poncho which he drapes over rhahs head as rhah strikes a smoke match and lights the bowl
a crack of thunder
rhah s face rising from the poncho
coming off his face
glowing with contentment as the thunder peals again
offers the bowl up to anthony who taking it seats him self next to rhah and smokes
they both look out into the camera hard rain thinking
shot of rhahs exhausted face
to anthony who is staring into the woods on the side of the stream the rain beating in his face
the camera going to what he sees a tangle of forest and leaves falling off the trees and rare cries
dianas petulant voice off why do you hide things
hide hide hide
he answers in a his eyes slowly pan the trees
tired voice off because
his voice shot as face his eyes cast down
off without you joanna
i loved you
it is darkness
shot of the woods
his eyes rising
even tu shot f ahs face in profile
ally he says in passing isaac didnt come back
during this scene of thought on the rocks between rhah and anthony francis and a few other brothers includ ing the white smoker adams make a slow individual pro they
cessional by rhah and a
to take a pass on the pipe
come by in ones and leave again to go back to their own rocks the effect is almost of a ceremony celebrated for the last time
lee at the front semi shielded from the rain sniffs the weed in the wind
looks hostilely towards nmh and anthony
his hand goes out to move out and re luctantly bunny the point man moves out the others taking their time rising
shot from side fading into shot from front of mercenaries moving down stream bunny way out in front
it is the battle that now erupts is not heavy
like the snake very quick and deadly and violent it is over fast brutally it is achieved in silence and almost the revenge is almost entire
bunny still way out front thunder peals again
passes a water snake reclining on a rock the snake not bothering to move at the sight of these heavy waterlogged tired objects inching by
toward the snake camera passing bunny zooiiis off screen the trickles of stream water and a fast rus tling like a snake
but the rustling is heavier now like bodies moving very quickly on both sides of the stream he wades out to inves bunnys face as he hears
the stream is tigate
the men behind him havent heard
deeper where he wades and the gurgling water rises to his waist
he advances down the stream
the noise stops
his eyes almost shot the bush he sees
he pans it
of naturally come to settle on a pair of bare feet painted green like the bush
he goes by it almost comes back
his eyes tilt up and he sees isaac standing there next to a tree looking down at him proudly knowingly his face painted with brilliant colors his whole body nearly
the paint ingrained in the naked striped like a snakes skin not dripping off in the rain
zoom to closeup of isaac his submachine gun still cradled in his arms
closeup bunnys amazed frightened face several cracks of a rifle
closeup of the blood spreading on his young face
he falls into the stream
closeup a huge mine set in a tree
same shot repeated three times in quick succession
shot of the trees silence
a bird crying
blowing with the force of the explosion the same shot anthony saw in his mind back at alexanders leaves and branches flying through the air noiselessly
quick black out
in the silence the screen opens again with a francis full screen blow up of francis face as he is hit
panning to a bandanna floating collapsing into the stream
the by itself in the stream
a body tumbling onto it
heavy machine gun the body was carrying crashing on the rocks next to him
camera zooming out slowly catching the living trying to fish the dead and woulded out of the stream manny one of the wounded still gesturing to his radio which is
sinking in the stream
a brother reaching for it
he jerks back shot in the head
camera still zooming out on the chaos still the silence catches the brother robinson coming out on the bank opposite to the one on which the dead machine gunner lies
and sprinting closely past the camera into the bush
sound returninq we see his white eyes full of fear
sound of firing and cries of the wounded and from the opposite bank the cries of the attackers all painted man and woman black and white charging down to the
camera swivelling around as robinson hurls a grenade
on one knee trembling pulling another grenade the out from his belt
sound of first grenade exploding last sound
back to silence
robinson pulling the pin from the grenade across his body its a faulty device the grenade blows right in his face
the same explosion that killed robinson
shot a poisonous snake slithering through the rocks tryin to escape this madness anthony being hurled by the close explosion down over the snake the snake in reaction anthony jerks
g rimacing with the biting him in the arm
anthony on his knees the snake slithering off
pins the hissing in quick reaction pulling his knife out
fleeting third of a second images of
isaac slicing the snakes head off in the temple fading swiftly into
anthony and joanna in the woods falling together entwined
as knife slicing the poisonous snakes head off
he recoils from his action samgely a bit stunned his eyes glazed with savagery
the butt of a one of the tribes rifle no sooner crashes on his head
men straddles him as he lies on the ground his head bleed ing about to scalp him a brutal look of revenge on his face
it is the former leader of the tribe
his knife in the air
the tribes a hand grips it hard
man turning to isaac
rugs off to kill again
isaac looking at the unconscious anthony
his smashed camera lies next to him
seeing the dead snake taking it all in with a little gleam of the eyes perhaps amused by the irony and as joanna runs up on him carrying a rifle
isaac bends to quickly cut the poison out of as arm
joanna feeling anthonys brow and the would on his head her savage look of revenge melting into tenderness looking at isaac who nods quickly to indicate hell be alright she
runs her hand over his forehend quickly one last time and runs off to fight
this whole scene could be ridiculous if it isnt done brusquely swiftly like a dream in plqthonyts head
the battle coming to an the sound is off again
the attackers end
the next scenes speeding by dreamlike
pouring down in mass onto the stream even little children fade into a black tribesman on top of a young black soldier both of them straining the tribesmans knife is
back in his hand pressing against the soldiers belly the latters hand gripping his wrist
they are both looking each other in the face straining
the soldiers hand slips
he cries out and dies the knife enters his belly
in his black enemys arms
fade into one of adams wounded crawling on his belly
the women picking up a heavy rock and hurling it down on his head
fade into lerner glazed drugged running crazily out of the woods
rhah who is slightly wounded clubbing him with his rifle
lerner on the ground crying in pain
rhah above him breaking the silence saying quickly you fool you crazy fool
then clubbing him again so he wont cry rhah rutting lerners headband quickly ripping his clothes off
on taking his old rifle and despite the lad of warpdlt runklg off into i
woods hollering like mad
fade into raising king closeup stumbling into a thicket

fade into isaac dragging bunnys corpse out of the stream onto the bank and taking his scalp
the battle is over
lee the rain has broken
is bloodied on the stream bank on his back still lying barely breathing his eyes closed he is squinting madly like a fish on land trying to breathe
his bloody red bandanna is loosely draped around his neck on his belly
sees a passing female member of the tribe
him the shoots him
long shot of her shooting him
hollow clack of her rifle
still the long shot as she runs t into the woods with the rest of the tribe
in the distance the stream is we hear the drone of a helicopter coming up
same long deserted but for the bodies littered around it
camera turning to catch isaac at medium range shot
the looking down at the stream the last to leave
the trees conceal helicopter approaching
the stream from the sky
the wind from the hovering helicopters blades is blowing the trees wildly back and forth
standing on the slope looking down at the stream he raises his rifle in the classic indian fashion flat in the air the same shot seen earlier at the temple
except we only saw his arm and shouts a word in a strange language
a subtitle flashes on the screen isaac runs off into the woods the wind in the trees blowing wildly
joanna waits for him at the edge of the woodline just as she waited for the old leader
he disappears in the forest
prison anthony awakes as from a the story goes on
dream at first isnt sure of what he is anymorel falls back on his distrust of life is arrested put in prison here in endless silence the silence of the
fish he cuts his final tie to the world of alexander and regains his sense of feelings in the person of jonah who is a briefer of isaac at the same time alexander his own form prisoner wrapping his words about himself severs his every link to the world
anthonys relationship to jonah from it he accepts that is brief dreamlike beautiful

love life itself is just a dream
dreams dreams are feelings
dream is freedom is dream

sound of other electric doors opening and closing
grating metal on metal followed by this underwater hollow silence
a momentary sound of bubbling water in a fish tank
a shot tropical fish swimming in the aquarium
fading into of the a shot of a strong muscled black standing gripping the bars looking out blankly his t shirt off muscled arms and his powerful chest exposed
a sardine a black beard
fading into shot of shaped ring hanging from his left ear
anthony in shabby light beige prison pyjamas
the top removed revealing a sleeveless t shirt exposing his under arms
he is sleeping on a mattress on the floor of his cell
blankets lying messily about a few prison books
his long hair is completely his sleep is simple childlike
he sleeps with his mouth closed on his belly one arm loosely wrapped around his neck the other flung out
camera dwelling on him fading again into the aquarium full of tropical fish fading from there to the prison block about ten cells to the block and one dayroom the
shot is five six prisoners in each overcrowded cell
of the prisoners in singles walking about pointlessly just to move not more than six or seven treading
the prisoners are all young except for one or two old lifers they are mostly smugglers hard types out of motorcycle gangs repair shops broken families and in california style
young they have smiles that say they know the score
quite a few have beards and tattoos but no external ornaments which is not allowed s as distinguishing marks they use their threads
each walks differently from the other like different types of fish in an aquarium
there is also a large minority of old hippy types youngr not so tough a fatalistic young romantic look about them society was unchangeably lame and it was inevitable they
should end up behind bars
tr hen they get out they pjill probably split into the hills to llexico south america their hair is very long islands unheard and never return a lot of golden
brown beards and once suntanned faces very quiet keeping to themselves not even talking each sits they look very primitive in their by himself and meditates
shabby pyjama pants and t shirts
camera panning through the block
getting into the car
over there camera fading to catch three of the prisoners swarming high up near the ceiling on the barsi like fish rather than monkeys looking out the small slit of
a window looking down into the parking lot

passes two walks further on down the block
brothers with pompadours sparring with each other in the passes by them space between the cells and the bars
unconcernedly and passes out of the cameras eyes as the they move well camera remains to dwell on the brothers
taking it easy equally sized
they start slapping a little harder noses bristle sweat starts up a few others gather round coming from separate directions alone digging the action
the camera observing their faces as the fighters pass out of the cameras eye the mixture of hard types and nomadic types
one the fighters come back into view dancing of them with a brother is now anthony jabbing sparring who is probably an amateur boxer and is getting the better of
a slapping him harder and harder with his open palm his own nose starting to open and close his mouth working small cries as if he were taking a black vengeance on the white boy
the hard unsympathetic faces of the gathered crowd
as blurring vision his opponents face fades into that of francis hitting him harder and harder his face fading into the blow up at the stream his dying face crying

later at night is looking out the bars
he has pulled himself together has combed his hair showered removed his t shirt stands barechested has washed his face he is thinking
fade into his thoughts he sees the faces of joanna isaac francis and joanna standing painted green ah each of them separately
francis singing his under the tree where he first saw her
isaac offering him the snakes head to drink
giving him the coat in the hospital
on the other side of the bars looking in he sees alexander the camera panning past him casually no element of magic in it
around walking back to his cell
anthony turning alexanders voice off low as an interior monologue once i spoke to you of long silences where we stare just stare at air
once spoke to you and said life was but a dream its been said i said i was what you are
i am what youre going to be closeup anthonys face
he enters the cell
anthonys voice off as in interior monologue dont the winds ever change
he sees sonah huddled up in a blanket on the floor slightly trembling as if this prison were too cold for him
hes rubbing himself slightly under the blanket
his hair is black indian long and wavy hanging to his shoulders the reincarnation almost of isaac but younger about seventeen eighteen
he has a beautiful face much warmer features than isaac his two eyes bright and looking straight straight ahead as if he were on a permanent high
his voice is soft and when he talks he smiles tenderly he has a slight with his eyes and sometimes his mouth accent sounding almost israeli or european
anthony sits down next to him on the floor not feeling any need to explain why he sits down next to him
he is simply attracted by him by his warmth and by the sensitivity that makes him tremble in the cold prison
jonah looks at anthony with his wide eyes
he anthony is forced smiles trembles but doesnt speak
to ask what did you do
jonah smiling wrapping his hands around his shoulders under the blanket they call it white slavery anthony looking at him puzzled jonah the little girl told the judge she was
raped steadily for half a year
and she was so beautiful in a pink dress in the court the judge he believed her
laughing a little so they take me to the big prison tomorrow a for how long j looking ahead trembling for five years jonah seeing pause
sorrow on anthonys face

anthony returns voice off i remember
anthony slowly takes jonahs head in his hands brings it together with his
anthony releases his breath
jonahs hand feels his cheek gropes along on it
they kiss each others mouth tenderly their eyes closed
fade past the faces of joanna francis isaac rhah in that order back to the face of alexander who sits all in black by himself in his apartment slumped in
a chair his hands between his knees looking very sad his head hanging off his left shoulder
his voice off very low we dreamt
your mind was mine anthony
we discovered reality and it died with the dream we grew another and what we dreamt we could never have
mind we emancipated our souls and the cost
was that our feeli gs died
we buried ourselves in the security of thought and not knowing it we fell prey to our own minds
cannot eat other minds and our thought was hungry
other minds cannot eat it then like some horrible plant which yc accused me of being the mind will curl in and eat its own self
fading into alexander rises from the chair
anthony and jonah together fading into
alexanders face returning painted in vivid his tribal colors yellow black red blazing colors
books and papers are strewn on the floor in fl c nt of him
he is pouring gasoline through his apartment the posters and paintings are ripped off the walls except for the rimbaud which he now stops to look at
his voice off big explosions pockmark our skies joyce
ending like literature in death and disease rimbauds hollow boys voice off and one night i will lose and come to regard as sacred the disorder of my mind
alexander taking the rimbaud off the wall and throwing it with the rest on the floor
alexander his voice off kneeling to examine what he has devoted his life to for this
descend sin by sin into a maelstrom full of false dreams arising like twilight false words tilxt dance by the moon and mirror themselves god
i at the bottom of the oceans floor
swallowed sleeping did my very best
i opened moons
sighs too i sang songs that sighed with effort
deep for words and prayers from the deepest pit of the brain god
emerging i was in you and you were in me
from leaping up like winter spring ardor to mists
light sodden coals of creativity it was patience and it was passion it yearned in the horrifying silence of infinity
does appetite grow again
and i a god am i reborn
did zeus swallow his own flesh in order to preserve it do i not swallow my own self in order to live again
alexander rising on camera
his voice still off in parody of what he has just said i was conceived by my father born of my mother suffered under both was crucified for this pointing
at papers died and soundly buried but the third day i rose again from hell and ascended unto heaven where i sit on the right hand of god the father fiction from whence i shall come to judge
all painters all poets all creators
amen walking towards his fireplace taking the old medieval torch off the hall shifting moods his voice off must smash the sin must rise up
barrier of my selfish ego
through the ego he
malked walking to and fro
thrcagh the eg
to and fro he walked
through the ego through the garden of ego
i holds it next to him lighting the torch
burning brilliantly casting a weird surreal light on his painted face
his voice mocking
in many centuries from now
when the futurians dig up theageold crusts of our earth
they will discover a bronzed likeness of a human being from the twentieth century and they will marvel at this figurepiece and they will hang it in their lighted museums
for all the survivors to see and they will flock about it and they will celebrate it and they will never again commit it to earth for
wrll be me
checks himself what who is this laughing at who
which alexander laughs at which alexander
which alexander shall inherit the earth
shall inherit ye the earth
shifting a mock puzzled look on his face the voice is gone
shifting again theatrical but alas
a face is a the birth of faith follows
faith and face
for have i not functioned on samefaced everyday forever believing having to believe in as simpk a thing e as divine good divine aid all the divinities my fear urges
me to snatch at
at any time at any pace i came cracking downward creativeness i thought forever purloined
how shall i function on miracle of miracles sprung from the holy ghost loins of the virgin llary alexander made flesh in it ball of fire come to cleanse the
earth turn water to b lood
tausing shifting again o
turn life to death
turn death back again
taking a random sheet and setting it to fire as he does this his voice businesslike the world it was writ shall be cleansed this time not by water but
the sheet alexander with his large looping handwriting on it burning
looking at his two cats who are circling uncomfortably under a table it burns
like cats slinking away slowly at first it grows
it is a wind high it flies higher
the long romantic loops of my bowelbound and visionary
hand scratched by the she pen she knows everything i know and am about to know flame has engulf d the sheet alexander still holding it in his hand tasting
the fire disappears in an insanity of flame the fire in my eye
the siamese hissing at alexander alexander smiling ssssss go
gargoyle sit on my mind no more petulant and fed with boiling seething creatiousness
like a succubus
like a sea
like a vast cinerama leech
alexander putting the torch to the books and then papers
it starts up just as in the opening scene
the cats the hair it quiets and starts to spread and burn
on their hacks retreating up against the wall hissing
al off the fire rumbles like a pig in frightened so very frightened still of its the slough fate its awareness that i am real not unreal not false
mow in the hot heart of hell this real i burns the she out of it indicating the papers stealing the light out of my love stealing stealing killing killing
my eyes are pearls of religious light lit with a lustre of wrath spiking the skulls of dead demons lying in the burning slough of hell o fantastic these insane
words and words and words marching over my mind an army of cannibals icccold sinfraught moistness of these words gush pond foam
of enemy kings cast in viper pits to wheeze themselves out in celestial slowities of death the little pigs grunt the sizzling snakes stand on the wall and black butterflies
sail up into the air and there in the air die asphyxiated
spineless reptiles as swift as doom ridden windswept poetry snow floating in blood washed gush pond
foam roll over and by ice alerted
alert over rise and roll rise and roll he pauses the flames spreading wildly through the apartment
the cats shot of anthonys fleeing footsteps scene
alexander backing off from the heat his eyes alight with madness sounds of breaking and tearing and the roar of the flames sound fades
his voice off calmer more lucid bringing to an end in the garden when i was young the they are beasts of a fabulous small graceful lions run
elegance they sniff flowers and crack open pink parasols when i was young in the aethiopian gloom in the shaded of afternoons splendid with ambitious odors and memory primitive yearnings
and i embraced it all sing
that once stood in front of the dawn and bathed my sandals in the sea that once on freezing frontiers my armies roamed that i kissed the hands of fantasy
queens and bade my time pausing on flowers these and arabia too where the winds shrive in the sapphire waters off moorish spain fields of flanders and wheat so golden it devoured the sun songs of swedish castles and sonqs of spiders groans of feeling from dungeon corners and keening organ music in german towns and nights in the forest and days so black widows tears ran with the ehine
the christ was long distant and light so far ahead and i lay my cheek down on the side of an alp and ran my toes through the wows of
in the north was the nothing towards the south the void and over it an old god had hung an invisible mantle he veaningless called life
its so sad so meaningless
ness in his voice in its bosom we play the practice of our hearts
our hearts expire puff adders vex the desert sand
without warning we see the genesis and the genius
and harmonies collide
and the eye is lost in puzzles of fire alexander is now a negative his voice
off my throat above the fire
my throat in the fire floating backwards
the last secret to madness
the core the rot
beinglessness embrace the steel
choke on the semi circles of the moon
fantasy blood purple flamed
then gut and sink
into the wealth of fire at the music end of death
alexanders negative engulfed in the fire
slow fade on the fire engulfing everything
fading into anthony and jonah embraced but anthonys face as if he knows what has happened is looking up looking at nothing
there is sadness in his face
fading into mirth the realization of dream
his voice off feelings are dreams dreams its are feelings
dream is freedom freedom is dream
all nothing but a dream
he kisses isaac
the movie camera begins to purr offscreen coming to the end fading from the characters implying that life is just a movie
from the death of words we start a sweep up beginning by making a movie of into anthonys future
what has passed
first still photographs come on the screen the freezes of the faces and things anthony has known
purr of the movie camera is heard offscreen until the end
photographs blow ups the fire father vother diana rimbaud alexander francis rhah isaac buddha joanna flash genet jonah anthony these shots fade very quickly into one another
they could be closeups distant shots shots in action shots mixed in time but an effect of passing speed and dream a shot of alexander as a young boy writing
then a shot of him in his apartment with anthony
lastly a shot of him as a negative

fish stripes dots collide they merge
