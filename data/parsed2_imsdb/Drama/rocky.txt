href b b rocky by sylvester stallone the club itself resembles a large unemptied trash can
the boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle
the lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting
in the ring are two heavyweights one white the other black
the white fighter is rocky balboa
he is thirty years old
his face is scarred and thick around the nose
his black hair shines and hangs in his eyes
rocky fights in a plodding machine like style
the black fighter dances and bangs combinations into rockys face with great accuracy
but the punches do not even cause rocky to blink
he grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead
the people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood
they lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters
in the thick smoke they resemble spectres
everyone is hustling bets
the action is even heavier in the balcony
a housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet
the bell rings and the fighters return to their corner
somebody heaves a beer can into the ring
the black fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at rocky
to cornerman im gonna bust his head wide open
in rockys corner he is being assisted by a shriveled balding cornerman who is an employee of the club
he works on rocky without any enthusiasm
lackluster ya waltzin give the suckers some action
hey overriding ya movin like a bum want some advice just gimme the water
a fight fan rushes up to rocky
he is sixty five with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses
should i bet the fight dont go the distance ya feel strong
ya want some good advice
i just want the mouthpiece
the bell rings
rocky makes the sign of the cross
the fighters engage in battle
the other fighter grabs rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him
the butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of rockys eye
rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the mans body
rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night
the fans throw rubbish into the ring
rocky ignores it
the fans loudly go about collecting bets
the referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher
two new fighters enter the ring
rocky slips on a tattered robe
embroidered clumsily on the back is the italian stallion
winner rocky balboa next a six rounder between local lightweights
without pomp rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator
the fighter on the stretcher passes behind him
he watches for a moment and continues up the aisle
before he even reaches the rear of the club the bell rings and the next fight has already begun
rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club
rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat
also in the dingy room are ten other fighters
two taped fighters talk shop in the corner
tomorrow me an my woman are gonna tip on down to atlantic city man
its cold bro
thats right i got the city to myself
another paces nervously
two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor
a young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable radio that is blasting music
the fighter that rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters
some of the fighters are smoking
the room is cloudy
a short man of fifty enters
he is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t shirt
rocky raises his head
the promoter steps over
continuing twenty bucks for the locker an cornerman two bucks for the towel an shower seven for tax the house owes ya sixty one dollars
the man peels off the money and departs
rocky closes his locker nods to the defeated fighter and leaves
rocky is on the trolley heading to south philly
the trolley is empty except for a thin old black woman
the black woman studies rockys bruised face
rocky becomes self conscious
almost apologetic im a fighter
tired yo iz an accident
rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block
he waves at a pair of high heeled hookers and they wave back
rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty bookstore
rocky drags the man into a protective passageway
further down the street rocky pauses in front of the animal town pet shop
he peers into the dark store and sees a sad huge dog sitting in the window
he mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner
a short while later rocky approaches his apartment located in the most deprived section of south philly
he kicks away the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and enters
the narrow hallway is painted olive brown
a single light bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor
the one room apartment is drab with a curling boxing poster of rocky marciano tacked on the wall
nailed against the far wall is a mattress
the mattress is used as a punching bag
stuffing spills out of the center
rocky drops his coat on the floor
he puts on a pair of glasses
he crosses to a small turtle bowl
he lifts the creatures
look whos home
rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate then places an old rpm record on a battered phonograph
the record is a tune all in the game
as the crackling music begins rocky picks up his hairbrush
using it like a microphone he mimes to the record
he assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to thousands of adoring fans
he then switches into a bullish fighting stance and throws several punches
the water boils
rocky soaks his badly swollen hands
we see the jagged skyline highlighted by the towering figure of william penn that rises above the dawn haze as it sits majestically above city hall
rocky is walking along the waterfront
he has a bandaid over one eye
he looks at the rugged stevedores going about their business
he stuffs his hands in his cheap wool jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded
rocky passes two thick mafia types leaning against a parked car
these men look like blood drinkers
yo rock hows your boss
yeah here an there
mebbe we make sum money togather soon
give ya boss my best
rocky shrugs and moves away
he nears a heavy man working the crane
the heavy man looks frightened
he stops the crane and hurries into the ships hole
rocky dashes up the gangplank
the man enters the ships hole and runs past tons of stacked crates and coffee beans
rocky sprints after him
he lunges and flings the man by the neck against the wall of stacked cargo
terror filled dont hit the face
not the face
gazzo wants the two hundred now
honest to god im broke gimme a break
gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb
please i need my hands to work christ dont bust my thumbs
at wits end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores
rocky remains cool
the man drops the hook
whats ya name again
look bob if ya wanna dance ya gotta pay the band if ya borrow ya gotta pay the man
me i aint emotionally involved
rockys determined expression strikes home
the fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills
continuing counting a hundred an thirty
thats it im broke
what about for food an stuff
you have my food in ya hand
rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat mans flushed expression
the juice is climbin every week
i know the juice is climbin i been workin six months just to pay the damn interest
ya still light seventy
ya dont have to break nothin here take my coat its worth fifty sixty dollars
the man quickly removes his coat and extends it
continuing see ya a smart guy gazzos dont have to know nuthin
ill go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb
gazzo wont be wise to nothin be a smart guy keep the coat well fake like ya broke the hand
the man extends his coat again
rocky suddenly grabs the mans thumb and bends him to his knees
almost a whisper no no no please please please dont
rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock
the thumb is fine
thats what coulda happened
later that morning rocky passes animal town pet shop in south philly
the shop is not very prosperous looking
in the window hangs a sign reading todays special mixed kittens
rocky stops at this shop every morning
he stares at a litter of lhasa apsa puppies
he taps the window and whistles
he sees a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the hunchback of notre dame
the girl nervously looks away
the girl behind the counter is adrian klein
she is not very attractive but pleasant looking
thirty years old
brown hair pulled back
she wears glasses
rocky really stops by to flirt with adrian but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started
could you take the puppy out it can breathe
please please nothin i paid for this dog and can do whatever i want with it i can throw it through the window if i want now give me my
two dollars back before i do throw it through the window
rocky walks over to her stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand
he removes the puppy and hands it to adrian
get away from me give me that
rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it to the lady
she nervously exits
hows the turtle food this week
me im kinda aggravated
aint your fault heres the problem
though charmed she is slightly intimidated
the last food i got here had more moths than flies an the moths get caught in my turtles throat that makes them cough the owner a squat woman of
forty steps out of the back and waves at rocky
continuing yo gloria i was talkin about the turtle food like i was sayin the moths get caught in the turtles throat an makes em cough
coughs a little cough an i gotta smack em on the shell an whatta think they get
continuing i smack em hard on the shell an they get
i dont know
both the owner and adrian smile
startin with the bad jokes early today huh
inventin jokes aint easy
rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop
inside is a huge dog
continuing hows butkus this mornin
aint had time to check em
rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks very happy
yo butkus dead
the dog plays dead
what kinda dog is this again
the owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago
were not responsible for animals left over thirty days we board it aint a animal shelter yknow
adrian i want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs theyre a mess
rocky waves goodbye to adrian and exits the shop
gazzo picks up rocky
gazzo and his young body guard sit in the front seat
rocky is in the back seat
he only had a hundred an thirty
i think hes good for the rest next week mr
patiently sure rocky bobs good for it
gazzo hands rocky a twenty
tomorrow collect from del rio hes late three weeks
howd you do last night
gazzos bodyguard looks at rockys bruised face in the mirror and smiles
did ya get the license number
of the truck that run over your face
gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to rocky
did i give you a job this mornin
how come ya didnt break this guys thumb like i asked ya
when ya dont do what ya are told it makes me look bad kid
i figure if i break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and cant pay nothin no more
it dont matter
its my reputation
these guys think they can get off light
its bad for my reputation its bad for business
see ya killer
gazzo gets into his car
to bodyguard the rocks a good kid
emotionless a meatbag
they pull away
gazzo drives off and rocky strolls across the street to goldmills gym
on the way he passes several familiar people and exchanges waves
out front is a young irishman who runs a soft pretzel stand
his name is rudy
it is apparent from his face he was a prize fighter
he is blind and mentally defective
see the fight last night
nah i was fightin myself
apollo creed beat the bum to pieces
mickeys gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons
out front a crowd of young blacks talk and jive among themselves
two winos lean against the entrance
rocky enters the gym
the place is nearly full
the measured beat of skip ropes and throbbing speed bags makes the room come alive like it was a mindless piece of machinery
over the loudspeaker music by the isley brothers blares out
the music adds a background to the clang of the automatic timers snorting sparring partners and the thudding of heavy bags
the room is divided fifty percent black thirty five percent latin ten percent white five percent other
as rocky walks through the gym many of the fighters pause to wave and yell greetings
hey hear ya knocked spider rice out in the sixth
the third shoulda seen it
rocky passes another fighter punching the heavy bag
removes glove hey rock touch my hand
cmon its important
rocky touches the fighters bare hand
continuing can ya tell i just whacked off
rocky smiles and moves away
the dressing room is lined with dented lockers
wooden benches stretch across the room
on the wall is a sign that reads no kissing
rocky goes to his locker
he tries to open it but fails
he leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers
still it does not open
he shakes the lock forcefully no luck
rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation
after a moment of deep thought rocky stands seizes the bench and smashes open the lock
opening the door rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes
mumbling these aint my clothes
he sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside of the door
continuing these aint my pictures
a short powerful man of thirty five enters
his hair looks like it has been shaped with hedge clippers
his name is yo mike whats happenin here
it aint your locker no more
whatta ya talkin about it aint my locker no more
listen im with you but ya gotta talk to mickey i put ya stuff in the bag over there
rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping bag and follows mike across the room
mike leans his head into the shower room
two latin fighters are lathering up
hey peanut gimme some soap man
irate hey nobody yeah you nobody you dont call me peanut
peanut gimme some soap
the fighters laugh
inflamed mike removes a bar of soap from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter
it hits just above the mans head
the fighters are shocked into silence
mike turns and exits with rocky
the fighters curse them loudly in spanish
rocky and mike move past fighters going through their training routines
you were ready to bite that guys face
yeah see the fight last night
apollo creed beat that english guy bad
mike fakes a friendly punch at rocky and hurries off to another chore
the owner mickey sits on a stool near the entrance
he wears a baggy suit
he is in his late seventies
mickey is conversing with another fighter
i dont care what nobody says this bum creed woulda never made it in the thirties hey how ya feelin mickey
i said how ya feelin

rocky turns and looks at dipper sparring
dipper is a young muscular heavyweight with a mean expression
continuing dippers a climber youre a tomato
facts is facts
i run a business here im cleanin house mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time skip as his trainer sings fascinatin rhythm
continuing how old are ya

it took me two months to learn the combination of that locker
the legs must be goin
yeah theyre goin thats nature
that was my locker for six years
did ya fight last night
yeah did ya win

mickey shoots rocky a quick indifferent look and removes a rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers
continuing ya want the truth ya got heart but ya fight like an ape the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke keep ya nose
pretty whats left of ya brain an retire
listen im gonna take a steam did good last night shoulda seen it
hey ever think about retirin

shrugging rocky moves away
continuing i think im gonna take a steam shoulda seen me fight did good yknow
mickey leans over to mike who approaches with a mop and pail
gesturing towards rocky known him since he was fifteen a waste of life
dejected rocky travels to the locker room
he passes big dipper sparring in a ring
dipper spits a mouthful of water in a bucket and looks smugly at rocky
to rocky i dig yo locker man
dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring
scene fades on rockys crestfallen expression
he moves off
at sunset rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet shop
he is eating colonel sanders fried chicken out of a bag
he taps on the window with a chicken bone
inside adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter
she hears the tapping sees rocky and tenses
good night to catch pneumonia
adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter
rocky fumbles idly among the pet toys
continuing ah i came in here for somethin
oh yeah would ya like somebody to walk ya home
the girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority complex will not permit it
continuing hey hows my buddy doin
looks into butkus cage nice dog well ill see ya later
adrian watches his departure with mixed emotions
a short while later rocky arrives at andys bar
he throws the colonel sanders bag and bones in a large public litter can
the trash can has a bicentennial picture of george washington pointing at a pile of garbage
the caption reads there was no litter at valley forge
rocky enters the bar
he sits the drunk in a booth
several drinkers wave at him
old andy sets a mug of beer in front of him
rocky seems to be looking for someone
catch pneumonia out there seen paulie
andy casually nods towards the mens room
rocky traverses the room and passes two drunks leaning on the bar
rocky enters the restroom
it is a vile stench hole with years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall
paulie is presently trying to comb his hair in the only remaining piece of mirror in the room
paulie is in his early thirties
he is medium height
he has a foul personality
a classic misanthrope
very drunk yo rocky look at this mirror
id like to kill the friggin moron who broke this mirror
your sisters givin me the shoulder
you could do better than my sister
every mornin every night i pass by i smile

rocky covers his nose with the neckline of his t shirt
continuing shes a loser she dont enjoy life she reads brainy pushin thirty friggin years old
shes gonna die alone if she dont wise up
im thirty myself

i dont see no crowd around you neither
pointing at the wall i wanna kill the friggin moron who broke the mirror

the restroom door opens
rocky guides paulie out
though stumbling paulie talks as he walks
the girls dryin up
shes gotta live a little before her body dries up
youre a pal rock how bout yo talk to her
yknow its thanksgivin tomorrow
tomorrow you come for some bird right
paulie smiles and rocky guides him to a booth
rocky steps to the bar
andy leans over to him
that was alotta crap to go through for a dinner invite
rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a suspended television
the nightly sports broadcast is on
the sports commentator is at the airport and about to interview the heavyweight champion of the world apollo creed
creed is twenty eight years old
he is a tall smooth muscled black with barely a scar on his light coffee colored face
he is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and cornermen
also tagging alone is a small group of hangers on
the commentator interviews creed as he and his followers disembark a private jet
how was the flight champ
very high an very fast
apollos crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he says
apollo how would you rate this last british challenger henry wilcoxson
he was big an very nasty so i destroyed him in a hurry now im gettin ready for mac lee green next month
youre referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight
thats right its gonna be the greatest sportin event in this countrys history a gala occurrence

the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gonna be held in the only place it can be held philadelphia

apollo draws his wife close

any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls
looks straight into the camera stay in school an use your brains dig be a lawyer be a doctor carry a leather briefcase an forget about sports
sports can only make ya grunt an smell be a thinker not a stinker
apollos entourage laughs and they move on
the commentator faces the camera
jerry simpson at kennedy airport with the champion apollo creed
the sports show cuts away but rocky continues to look at the television with a pensive stare
andy has been speaking the following dialogue over apollos broadcast
nobody cares whats happenin in the world of sports nomore downhill
baseball downhill basketball downhill
footballs goin too
bank on it
baseball use to be americas best sport
sure nuttin like squattin through a great double header but now baseballs all business
the news report with apollo ends
continuing where are the real fighters
today we jig clowns
he took his best shot an became champ what shot did you ever take
yo rock you aint happy with yourself
but me i gotta business here i dont need to take no shot
becoming despondent rocky rises and crosses to paulie slumped unconscious in the booth
rocky exits the bar
andy turns to his customers
continuing boldly take a shot he says
sure ill take a shot
laughing andy pours himself a shot
rocky passes an all night sandwich shop
in the window hangs the sign atomic hoagie shop inc
out front are several young men and women
they are much too young to be out so late
a boy with a badly chipped tooth beckons to rocky
aggressively yo rocks buy us sum wine man
no wine bad for ya brain
cmon man its cold man
yo rock gimme a dollar
sarcastically cause we dig ya man gimme a dollar
hey give rocky a dime
so he can call all his friends
mildly embarrassed thats an old one
buy us some thunderbird man
rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who is smoking and leaning whore like against the wall
is that marie
marie ya brother know youre hangin out so late
the girl marie assumes an indifferent attitude attempting to impress her friends
awed whatd you say
screw you yoyo
the gang laughs
angered and shocked rocky grabs her arm
did these guys teach you to talk dirty

shakes her dont you never say that to the gang you guys talk like that in front of a little girl you guys are scum
this is our place dig
the gang reluctantly backs up a step
dont ya never come round this girl go home
this is our corner man

rocky moves forward and they scatter
they quickly move off
backpedaling well kill you man we gotta gun
pull heat on me
ill dent ya face
rocky leads the girl away
rocky is walking the young girl home
they are presently cutting through a dark public school yard
they pass through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights located at the top of the school building
the atmosphere is somewhat eerie
how come ya wanna hang out with those guys
they teach ya bad things
i like em
if you dont you can f hey
when i was your age there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood
she attempts to light a cigarette
rocky nonchalantly tosses it to the ground
make your teeth yella i like yella teeth
makes your breath like garbage
maybe i like garbage
rocky and marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard
nobody likes garbage anyway this girl with the dirty mouth wasnt bad lookin but the guys wouldnt take her out for any serious datin
cause thats the way guys are they laugh when ya talk dirty
they think ya cute for a while but then ya getta reputation an watch out
nobodys ever gonna take ya serious

yo a bad reputation twenty years from now people will say dyou remember marie
no who was she
she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop
oh now i remember
see they dont remember you they remember the rep
rocky and marie exit the dark school yard
standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers
the light from their cigarettes flares red in their faces
the muggers pace rocky across the street and follow them down the block
rocky sees them and stops and faces the three
the muggers pause and study rocky from a distance of twenty yards
rocky gives a loud boxers snort wipes his nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders
the muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away
rocky turns to marie who has been standing behind him
points down the block thats your house aint it
continuing listen i hope ya dont
what was i gonna say
ya hope i dont keep acting like a whore or ill turn into one right
ya somethin like that
they exchange smiles and marie moves away
rocky has made an impact on her life
she takes a few more steps and pauses again
fuck you creepo
the girl runs to her house as rocky looks on in dismay
walks off yeah whore you to give advice creepo
apollo creed and his lawyer and trainer are seated in the offices of miles jergens
jergens a successful promoter looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of apollo creed
are the doctors reports confirmed
definitely reading it says here mac lee green has suffered a seriously cracked third metacarpal in his left hand
i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green
it aint just green what about the time apollos invested i believe we can find a solution
solution nothin what about the bicentennial fight
jergens dont play games with my client
apollo has already done nearly a million dollars worth of publicity ten millions worth
and has made contractual obligations with over twenty different organizations he doesnt want to be embarrassed
you best find me another ranked contender an i mean in a flash man

apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it
shape nothin theyre afraid
they know everybody in the worlds gonna see this fight an none of them gotta prayer of beating me so theyre makin excuses so they dont have to be the
chump thats gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world
apollo im sure theres a way to salvage this
nobody wants to be dissected on the countrys birthday
all i can counter with is that im a goddamn good promoter ive promoted in every country in the world and ive tried to the best of my abilities
perhaps youre right and no one wants to be beat on the countrys birthday
i dont know what else to say i do maybe what this fight needs is something new a novelty

rocky enters his apartment and gazzo drives off
the scene reverts back to miles jergens office
apollo pores over a large record book
how bout this billy snow
how bout this big chuck smith
too old dull fighter
points at a name bobby judge is a good boy
i dont feel heat from the name
joe zack is a good prospect exciting boy

everybody leans forward
continuing much amused the italian stallion hes my man
rocky balboa his records poor dont matter that name

shhiii sounds like a damn monster movie
rocky and paulie walk towards his house
even though it is cold and dark a group of kids conduct an energetic game of half ball
half ball is a variation of stick ball
mimes throwing i usta be deadly at half ball
i hate the friggin game
id like to talk some business

paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist
continuing inflamed joints walkin in an out of a freezer carryin meat plays hell on the joints

gazzos gotta come to you hey paulie its a bad job do what you do now
they continue past the atomic hoagie shoppe inc
a group of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front
he sees marie the little girl from the night before hanging around with the guys
she sees rocky
marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the opposite direction
the gang smiles and continues to pitch quarters
anger and disappointment register across rockys face
you know her
rocky shrugs and the two men move off
filling the night air is the metallic sound of pitching quarters
the men arrive at paulies home
it is at the top of a dimly lit four story walk up
ya sister knows im comin
yeah sure shes very excited
paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters
rocky stiffly follows
paulies sister steps out of the kitchen
a large serving spoon is in her hand
the tv is on
she stops short and eyes rocky
she is visibly unsettled by rockys unexpected presence
weakly paulie youre late
she looks at rocky again
did you call the hospital
to rocky if im ten minutes late she calls the hospital
adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door
an argument ensues and rocky overhears
over the argument is heard a sports broadcast rising from the television
unfortunate luck for fifth ranked heavyweight mac lee green
the slugging fighter acquired a serious fracture in his left hand after an aggressive day of sparring champion apollo creed says hell be shopping for another victim to fill greens
vacancy for the bicentennial championship fight to be held in philly next month
by the way rumor has it that this will be the most widely viewed sporting event in the entire world and that includes the super bowl folks

paulie turns and leaves the bedroom
he enters the kitchen
grabbing a large fork he opens the oven and spears the turkey
with the turkey suspended on the end of the fork paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window
adrian has seen this and is shattered
she runs back into the bedroom and locks the door
ya want the bird go out in the alley an eat the bird i want ya outta the house enjoy ya friggin life

paulie opens the front door and gives rocky an encouraging smile
continuing whats ya sister like to do

rocky and adrian enter a deserted skating rink

i think its closed
i think mebbe were early or somethin from across the rink a cleaning man yells at them

look at her ya can see she aint feelin good needs a few minutes exercise few minutes

adrian has on skates
rocky follows her onto the ice
he wears street shoes
arent you skating
aint skated since i was fifteen thats when i started fightin gotta watch the ankles
yeah fightin use to be tops with me but no more
all i wanted to prove was i werent no bum that i had the stuff to make a good pro
and you never got the chance
the cleaner yells from the sideline
hey i aint cryin
i still fight
kinda do it like a hobby
see im a natural southpaw an most pugs wont fight a southpaw cause we mess up their timin an look awkward southpaw means lefthanded
but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best right
but you never had a chance to prove yourself
adrian slips and rocky breaks her fall
i just dislocated my finger
it aint your fault i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight
opens his wallet thats me fightin big baby crenshaw big baby was the size of an airplane an i broke my hands on his head i lost but its a
nice picture dont ya think
how bout some cokes

this guy is beautiful get the cokes
adrian does a slight turn and rocky has to speed up and nearly falls
continuing see i aint graceful yknow i dont move good stink as a dancer too but i can really swat i hit hard real hard but im a southpaw an
nobody wants to fight a southpaw
havin a good time
adrian nods and is very nervous
the cleaner moves carefully across the ice
continuing yknow how i got started in the fight racket
here three minutes
yeah my ol man who was never the sharpest told me i werent born with much brain so i better use my body
for the first time adrian laughs
continuing whats funny
my mother told me just the opposite
she said you werent born with much of a body so youd better develop your brain
the cleaner walks over as rocky and adrian get off the ice
continuing thats ten bucks
i must be goin deaf cause i thought ya said ten cents
rocky hands him a dime
weakly how bout for the cokes
rocky and adrian start to leave
rocky pauses at the door and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars
continuing had ya goin didnt i huh
he grins and leaves
some people are very shy by nature
i would say youre very shy bu nature
some people think bein shy is a disease but it dont bother me
it doesnt bother me either
then why did i bother bringin it up
cause im dumb thats why
yknow i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts im dumb an youre shy
it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter
ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug
its a racket where ya almost guaranteed to end up a bum
i dont think youre a bum
im at least half a bum
yeah fightin is a crazy racket
the roughest part is the mornin after
after a rough fight ya nothin but a large wound
sometimes i feel like callin a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom
ya eyes hurt ya ears hurt ya hair even hurts
but the thing im proud of is i been in over sixty fights an never had a busted nose bent an twisted an bitten but never broke
why do you do it if it hurts so bad
pause cause you cant sing or dance
rocky and adrian enter his one room apartment
she is nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room
rocky goes to the icebox
would ya like a glass of water
adrian looks at the mirror above rockys dresser
she sees a high school photo of rocky
he once was handsome and smooth faced
rocky steps up behind her and his face is reflected in the mirror
he turns on his cheap record player
he reaches into the turtle bowl
heres the guys i was tellin ya about this is cuff an link
i sold them to you
very embarrassed oh yeah i bought the whole kit yeah ya sold me the turtles the bowl an the mountain i had to get rid of the mountain cause they
kept fallin off
do you have a phone
i had it pulled
people callin all the time
who needs it whod you wanna call
i wanna let my brother know where i am
dyou really wanna call
yes i do
i think he might be worried
ill call your brother
rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn
continuing yo paulie ya sisters with me
ill call ya later
rocky closes the window and faces the woman
she is not smiling
she looks frightened
continuing whats the matter
ya dont like the room
its only temporary
its not that whats the problem
you dont like me dont like the turtles what is it
i dont think i belong here
no i dont belong here
its all right youre my guest
ive never been in a mans apartment before
gesturing theyre all the same
im not sure i know you well enough i dont think im comfortable
yo im not comfortable either
standing i should leave
but im willin to make the best of this uncomfortable situation
adrian moves to the door
rocky intercepts her
continuing softly would ya take off your glasses
rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes
timidly t thank you
do me another favor
could ya take off that hat
after a moment adrian removes the hat
she is becoming rather pretty
continuing i always knew you was pretty
dont tease me
the woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing
rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body
i wanna kiss ya ya dont have to kiss me back if ya dont feel like it
rocky softly kisses the woman
her arms hang limp
he puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond
her hand glides like smoke up his back
she embraces his neck
the dam of passion erupts
she gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years
the following day rocky strolls down the street to goldmills gym
out front a group of young blacks stop talking and study rocky as he passes
rockys eyebrows knit in confusion
rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym
in a matter of seconds his presence is known and the athletes stare in wonderment
the big black heavyweight contender dipper throws down his towel in disgust and turns away
mike quietly approaches rocky
hey rock what happened
mickey goldmill steps out of his office
did ya get the message kid
message what message
mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket
he hands it to rocky
a rep from miles jergens promotions was lookin for ya they need sparrin partners for creed
ya puttin me on
heres the card
when was they here
bout an hour ago
probably lookin for sparrin partners
i said that before
rocky turns from mickey and jogs out of the gym
mickey fumbles with his rosary beads
continuing waste of life
rocky steps off a bus in mid town philadelphia
he hurries down broad street
every few steps he breaks into a trot
he enters a skyscraper
rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of miles jergens productions
the secretary is slightly startled by rockys excited expression
may i help you
rocky hands her the business card
continuing your name please
balboa rocky balboa
the secretary rises and enters jergens office
rocky eyes the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls
the secretary returns
you may go in
rocky collects himself and enters
miles jergens warmly greets him
balboa im miles jergens please have a seat
balboa overriding rocky
rocky do you have any representation
no just me
rocky would you be interested in sparrin
i know ya need sparrin partners im very available
im sure you are
absolutely sparrin with the champ would be an honor yknow what
i wouldnt take no cheap shots
id be a good sparrin partner
jergens seems very amused
he lights a cigar
rocky would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship
like i said id make a boss sparrin mate
did you hear what i said
sure an im smart enough to know that no sparrin partner should take cheap shots at the champ
hes just there to help condition the man
not spar im asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship
the weight of the statement comes crashing down in rocky
for a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case as he ponders the statement
he half regains his senses
the scene fades and becomes a black and white television
rocky and adrian are at her home watching an old black and white television
the film now cuts to apollo being interviewed
howd you like the city of brotherly love
i like my philadelphia brothers
an im patriotic
apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting microphone
continuing mock seriousness if yo dont back up im gonna send yo home with a microphone in yo nose
the reporters laugh
why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning
if history proves one thing everybody gotta chance didnt yo all ever hear of david an goliath
course i woulda knocked out goliath
it is a coincidence that youre fighting a white man on the most celebrated day in the countrys history
the same coincidence that hes fightin a black man
whatre your feelings about the challenger
what does that mean
it means if he cant fight i bet he can cook
rocky and adrian laugh at the interview
paulie her brother takes offense
do me a favor his lungs punch em out
rockys interview now fills the screen
rocky squints and looks nervous under the hot lights
this is your largest payday ever how do you feel about it
how will you fight apollo creed
mind elsewhere creeds great aint he
ill do what i can
where did you get the name italian stallion
i thought of it bout eight years ago when i was eatin dinner
is it true the most youve ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars
four hundred but that was a long time ago
and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
listen i wanna say hi to my girlfriend yo adrian
adrian blushes and laughs
sure i did
they continue to watch the remainder of the interview
the head commentator is looking directly into the camera
a bicentennial fight january first
it will be the first sporting event on our two hundredth birthday and is already being called by many the greatest farce in sports history
if this man lasts more than a minute i would say hes on borrowed time
sarcastically its matches like this with their exorbitant prices that give sports a bad name not only is this match bad people its sad
why a rocky balboa
at the state athletic commission larry duggan reporting
irate the guys a friggin moron
dont it matter none hes makin ya out a fool
id break his lips
it dont matter
hes takin cheap shots
it dont bother me none
yo rock now yall be lookin for people to help right

ill do okay
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise mebbe somebody to be standin by with a towel or run errands yknow
hey who cared about me yesterday huh
nobody i think im gonna train myself
without havin good people around ya wont have such a good chance
adrian is not happy with her brothers overbearing attitude
she faces him
einstein flunked out of school
roosevelt finished last in his class beethoven was deaf an helen keller was blind i think rocky has a good chance
rocky stands in adrians doorway
he kisses her
see ya tomorrow
rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he converses with adrian who remains upstairs
his voice echoes up the stairwell
continuing howd ya like hearin ya name on tv
i dont know i was shocked
why did you do that
ya puttin me on right
smiles absolutely what time should i expect you
ill be waiting
rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to adrian on the top floor landing
yknow how i said that stuff on television didnt bother me
as rocky completes the last word he exits the building and slams the door which resounds throughout the apartment house
gazzo the bodyguard and rocky are standing out front
they are eating hot sandwiches
yknow i wont be able to work for ya no more
hey if a good man can make a better life let him make it
i feel bad about walkin
take your shot kid you got money for trainin expenses
a few bucks
gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills
heres five hundred put it in your glove
do i have to pay juice
gazzo looks at the bodyguard and shakes his head as if to imply whys this guy asking such a foolish question
gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white caddy parked at the curb
they enter the cab
smiles does santa claus charge juice
merry christmas now hows about my present ya gonna win
listen kid im with ya
ya know im with ya italian were blood
you kill this rug we guinneas gotta show these afro americans where its at

rocky smiles and gazzo gets into his car
rocky follows him across the street
yo you gonna show tony
where else am i gonna go
to bodyguard bet three grand on rocky
hes a bum are you kiddin
slaps bodyguard no
im not kiddin
rocky walks away
rocky returns home and enters his apartment
after turning on the light he flips on his record player
he now feeds the turtles
look whos home
rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold
he approaches them with a sense of awe
he opens and reads one
settling on the bed he reads the other
a knock is heard
rocky opens the door
mickey goldmill the gym owner stands framed in the doorway
stiffly i seen the light
i figure somebody was home
hey mickey whatta ya doin here
here sit down
rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair
continuing best seat in the house hey mick this is too much
how do you mean
im usta seein ya at the gym but seein ya here in my house its kinda outta joint
by the manner in which goldmill listens it is obvious something important is preying on his mind
rocky is slightly uncomfortable almost embarrassed at having outsiders see how he lives
listen rock youre a very lucky guy
whats happened is freak luck
freak luck for sure
look at all them other fighters
real good boys
fight their hearts out for peanuts but who cared
they got it shoved in their back door
nobody ever give them a shot at the title
uneasy freak luck is a strange thing
mickey does not hear
his attention is drawn to the turtles
turtles domestic turtles
businesslike im here tellin ya to be very smart with this shot
like the bible sez ya dont get no second chance
mickey looks hard into rockys eyes
continuing ya need a manager
i been in the racket fifty years
i done it all there aint nothin about the world of pugilism that aint livin up here
he lights a half smoked cigar
at a loss fifty years huh
stronger fifty years
the rep is known around philly an a good rep cant be bought but i dont have to tell you that
how bout a glass of water
rocky dya know what i done
driving each word hard i done it all
ive done an seen everything
believe what im tellin ya ya shoulda seen the night in brooklyn i smacked ginny russo outta the ring september same night firpo knocked dempsey outta the ring
but who got the press
he had a manager september
softly ya got a good mind for dates
mickey deafly continues becoming more engrossed every second
look at this face twenty one stitches over the left eye thirty four over the right my nose was busted seventeen times the last being the sailor mike fight new
years eve in camden new jersey what a professional pastin i give him
here read about it
shows a tiny press clipping points to cauliflower ear an he give me the vegetable on the ear
i got pain an experience

rocky points to his most prized possession
nobody ever said that theres his picture
yeah ya kinda remind me of the rock
ya move like im
mickey has rung the bell
nothing could please rocky more than being compared to his idol
really think so
ya got heart
heart but i aint got no tocker
rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch
christ i know this business
rocky when i was fightin it was the dirtiest racket goin see
pugs like me was treated like fightin dogs throw ya in the pit an for ten bucks ya try to kill each other
we had no management
fought in boxcars in whorehouse basements any joint with a floor october i fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an punched so many
holes in my face i had spit shootin outta my cheeks i never had no manager watchin out for me see that picture outside the gym mighty mick thats me in my prime
i had all the tools
i coulda starched any lightweight husky on the east coast but i had no management
nobody ever got to know how slick i was but i had a head for business an stashed a few bucks an opened the gym its a dirt hole i
know it but that an a lotta scars is what i got to show for fifty years in the business kid now you come along with this shot an i feel like its me gettin the shot i never got
yeah we was treated like dogs like them dagos no offense in the colosseum in rome there an now i got all this knowledge i wanna give it to ya
so i can protect ya an make sure ya get the best deal ya can
rocky rises and opens a window
continuing respect i always dished ya respect
ya gave dipper my locker
almost begging im sorry i i made a mistake
kid im askin man to man
i wanna be ya manager
the fights set i dont need a manager
look you cant buy what i know
ive seen it all
i got pain an i got experience
i got pain an experience too
tightly whatever i got i always got on the slide
this shots no different
i didnt earn nothin i got it on the slide
i needed ya help about ten years ago when i was startin but ya never helped me none
mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up
he remains on one knee
if ya was wantin my help why didnt ya ask
i asked but ya never helped nothin
like the bible sez ya dont get no second chance
yells rocky im seventy six years old
maybe you can be the winner i never was your shot is my last shot
rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door
mickey struggles to his feet and like a beaten man leaves
several moments later rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed
springing up a second later he runs outside
rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form of mickey
way in the distance we see rocky stop the old man beneath a street lamp
he places an arm around his shoulder
the following morning rockys alarm clock goes off at exactly four a
not accustomed to rising this early with great difficulty rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the bathroom
he turns the light on and roaches scatter
at the top of the mirror hang the telegrams
rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water
rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs
he cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill
his body quivers
rocky steps outside
he is dressed in a well worn sweat suit with a hood gloves and sneakers
it is pitch dark and his steaming breath attests to the cold
he begins running down the center of the deserted street
he can only be clearly seen as his form passes beneath the street lamps
two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass
rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight of stairs
he stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear into the morning gray
taking a deep breath he starts up
from the start he looks out of shape and halfway up his legs give way
standing he brushes off and descends the stairs
rocky passes city hall and veers to the river
he pauses heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths
he throws several lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his aching sides
men delivering the morning papers observe with amusement
rocky forces himself to begin running again
heading along spring garden street rocky passes beneath an elevated train station
the roaring train overhead seems to blend perfectly with his muscular running style
the sky is beginning to lighten
the fighter now runs along the piers and past anchored freighters
it is five thirty and rocky approaches the loading platform belonging to eastern packing company
alongside the loading platform come several boxcars
rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door
it soon opens and paulie guides him inside
paulie is drunk
how ya feelin
i got whiskey here
rocky notices two puerto ricans lounging alongside theshipping office
this is the guy whos fightin apollo creed
heavy accent good luck kill him man
as though rehearsed badly hip hip hooray
cmon hip hip
walks away hooray man
rockll be comin by every mornin to pick up some prime cant train on that store crap
rocky smiles and paulie leads him out of the office and to the large metal door of a walk in refrigerator
the freezer resembles a modern torture chamber
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the darkness to the far end of the refrigerator
the blower overhead causes the men to speak loudly
teasing if ya dont pay gazzo ya end up hangin on the hook right
gazzos a good man
how bout you talk to em about me
tightly please do me that favor
keep this job ya eat better
paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat
he swills whiskey from a pint bottle
yknow dya think you an my sister ah doin good together
whatta you think
aint sure whats the story
the story whats happenin
paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for quite a while
continuing ya really like her
sure i like her
nervous laughter whats the attraction
i dont see it
i dunno she fills gaps
shrugs and takes meat she got gaps
i got gaps together we fill the gaps
sharply you ballin her
turns around dont talk dirty bout ya sister
tersely cmon ya screwin her
from across the room rocky looks him hard in the eyes
thats why i cant put ya together with gazzo cause ya talk too much big mouth
he steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef
the punching of the beef is a muted challenge and rocky responds
rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs
the grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse
rocky moves to the next one and hooks
rockys face reveals a never before seen concentration as though he were locked in total battle
hit the rump
yall break the ribs
rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef
paulies eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch like he were receiving it
rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator
only the dull sounds of his pounding fists can be heard
rocky works his way to paulie again
every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive
continuing we do that to creed an theyll take us to jail for murder
rocky looks at his hands
they are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood
paulie hands him a package of beef
dont talk dirty bout ya sister
rocky takes the package and runs out
paulies bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment
the gym is filled to capacity
the noise is deafening
rocky pounds a heavy bag
mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his pocket
i cant stand it
youre off balance
he motions to his bullish helper mike
he hands him the string
continuing tie it to both ankles leave two feet slack
i never had good footwork
mike completes the task
forget the footwork youre off balance
the legs are sticking everywhere
marciano had the same problem an the string cured it
when you can hit and move without breakin the string youll have balance
youll be a very dangerous person
two young boys in street clothes interrupt mickey
rocky could we have your autograph
irate dont you boys ever interrupt when im conductin business or ill kill you both go away
the boys depart
ya wanna be a writer or a fighter
mike looks off across the gym
we got visitors
mickey strains his eyes to see a group of reporters and news cameramen entering his gym
approaching can i help you guys
to cameraman set the camera up over there
to mickey were from channel seven covering the pre fight training
i own the place
the reporter has a hundred things on his mind
he turns from mickey and nods to his crew
the other television crews rush to set up
to the camera were here at goldmills gym a philadelphia landmark of sorts since the stench of toil permeates every corner
the sweat a trademark of a unique profession
yet the most unique fixture is an unprecedented to underdog heavyweight named rocky balboa
the camera turns to rocky
to mickey should i do this
mickey nods and rocky faces the glaring lights
so much has happened lately has it changed your life style much
people talk to me more
howre you preparing for this bicentennial bout
a young punchy fighter yells out readin fuckin history books man
the gym explodes with laughter
flushed we can cut that out later
apollo creed says hell let you stay three rounds before he puts you away
honestly apollos a great fighter
do you feel you have a chance
maybe he faces mickey
mickey whispers in his ear
continuing ill tear his head off
do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion
yeah hes great
apollo creed and his entourage enter the gym
bellowing i am the champion of the whole world
the gym freezes
everyone turns and stares in wonderment
mickey goldmill shakes his head in disbelief
he now realizes it is a publicity stunt
continuing approaching rocky italian stallion i come over to tell you to be very smart an after this fight donate whats gonna be left of your body to science cause
after this fight whats left wont fill a tuna fish can
so beware mon cher
apollo turns to the cameras
rocky is speechless
continuing this classic fight thas right this bicentennial fights goin down in the history books cause january first im gonna be the first man to bounce another man offa the
dipper stands in the far ring
the attention rocky is receiving makes him a killer
continuing now i gots a special announcement yhear
for the first time in alotta years this championship fight is gonna be on your home t
free course thats just for philly my present to the city
now some yall aint much on likin me but ya gotta admit apollo creed is one damn generous pure government inspected afro american folk hero
dipper moves across the room like a large snake
he brushes people aside and steps behind rocky
he nudges him
rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it
dipper pushes harder and rocky looks questioningly at him
loud ya nothin boy
apollo stops his sales pitch in mid sentence
the television crew faces dipper
continuing i say ya nothin
whats happenin here
this pig is takin my shot i iz a contender
dumbstruck yo dipper whyre ya shaking his fist spar me in front of these here tv dudes i knock ya ass to jersey
dippers fat black trainer holds out his hands and dipper slaps them soul style
to dipper you can forget about sparring kid
yo know i iz the best man here
yo said so yoself
almost apologetically to the crew why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin or breakin a hand
take a shower dipper
dont mouth me old man ill knock yo out too
cmon wop spar me let everybody see whos got the heat around here
silence looms over the gym
apollo is apprehensive
the scene is becoming too real
the frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment
continuing insanely man yo best keep them cameras out
fight me boy
let creed here see the kind of punk hes fightin
mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind rocky
dont chance it man hes sick
this is gettin outta hand rocky will fight in the ring january first not here
yo yellow old man
not yellow cautious
to the crew see its very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps rocky very hard across the side of the head
the gym becomes stone cold
dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it
if yore afraid to fight me then get down an kiss my feet boy
mickey looks nervously around and knows its only seconds before the blood will run
rocky stands motionless
softly lets take a walk rock
please dont take a chance
he wants to hurt you so you cant fight
rocky swallows his pride
he still has the string around his ankles
he starts to shuffle away with mickey
dipper steps forward and viciously slaps rocky again
mike jumps forward
why you tryin to cut im man
back off scumbag or ill bite your face
dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks mike flat
the room reeks of fear
apollos eyes flick back and forth between rocky and dipper
apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away
now boy kiss my feet
rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor
he shuffles forward and stands before dipper
continuing almost in a whisper kiss em
rocky looks at mickey then lowers his eyes to dippers feet
rocky starts to bend towards the shoes
without warning he explodes with a pair of combinations into dippers exposed ribs
a crack is heard and dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain
the room is silent except for dippers moaning
apollo is stunned by the scene
the gym has become a very gloomy place
he eyes rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension
mickey is the first one to shake off the chill
he shakes his fists at the reporters and puts his arm around rocky
the kids got cannons print that
the crowd disperses leaving dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor
they enter the dismal apartment
on the floor are at least ten telegrams
rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside
next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams
dont you open them anymore
they either say kill the nigger or hope you die honky
what ya got in the bag
adrian steps to the window
she pulls a pair of short but lovely curtains from a shopping bag
the colorful curtains glare in the dark room
sharp real nice
really you dont think theyre overly feminine
sharp you look great
adrian smiles and pulls out a small christmas wreath
his eyes show what he feels for this woman
adrian you really look great yknow but i cant fool around durin trainin makes the legs weak
dont want weak legs
cant fool around you look very great
but i think weak legs aint bad sometimes yknow
rocky approaches in a seductive manner
adrian uncharacteristically removes her sweater
underneath is a t shirt that reads win rocky win
i thought it might be cute
ya right laughs mebbe we best just hold hands the shirt made me feel guilty yknow
rocky is running
for extra weight he carries his huge dog butkus
after a half a block he sags under the weight and laughing begins to wrestle with the dog on the pavement
rocky tries to sneak away from the dog but after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the street
it is early morning and as usual rocky jogs to the meathouse
he is followed by his new dog butkus
he is stopped short when he notices several television news vans parked out front
he and the dog enter the freezer area and see several reporters and men with mini cameras milling around
paulie is waiting for him rocky is upset and goes outside
i made a few phone calls an thanks to me ya goin to be a big man thatta dog

rocky follows paulie inside
a reporter points in rockys direction and suddenly he is surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned beside a slab of hanging beef
the camera lights go on
just relax mr
balboa to the camera today were here with heavyweight challenger rocky balboa
the reason we are standing in a refrigerated box is that mr
balboa has an unusual method of training and in a moment he is going to demonstrate it for our viewing audience but first rocky how did you ever come to
train in an icebox
ah my buddy paulie let me in one day an i hit the beef here an liked it an since i become a challenger the owner dont mind neither
is this a common training method i mean do other fighters pound raw meat
i think me and paulie invented it
would you give us a demonstration
rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with incredible intensity
everyone present is taken aback
rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his hands dripping beef blood
the commentator is unnerved and rocky looks straight into the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists
diane lewis in the meathouse with the southpaw rocky balboa
apollo sits behind jergens desk
jergens is not present

meanwhile the trainer sits across the room in a darkened corner looking at a small television
he is watching rockys bloody exhibition on the news
he waves at apollo
worried apollo you oughta come see this boy youre gonna fight on tv looks like he means business
apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork
i mean business too to men the gross rental of the arena is gonna include the four hundred ushers right
gimme some coffee
it is a moonless night and paulie staggers across the street and enters his building
he staggers up the stairs
paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a chair
he rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen
he takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox
as he swills the wine he hears the sound of rockys and adrians voices traveling from his sisters room
paulies face tightens and he staggers towards the bedroom
he stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a crack
rocky adrian and the dog are watching tv in the otherwise darkened room
and he called the reporters yeah

paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball bat
rocky and adrian quickly follow
i dont want ya messin up my sister no more hes scum from the corner i dont raise ya to hang with no bum

rocky goes into the bedroom
adrian has buried her face in a pillow
she is rocking slightly
rocky cradles her and kisses her cheek
continuing wanna hear a dirty joke
smiles yes mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym
the room is dark
blankets are tacked over the windows
rocky is watching mm movies of apollo creed in action
rocky watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like a huge dancer around the ring
his defense is great cant lie bout that you have a rollin style
cant retreat as fast but your style aint retreatin
they both watch the flickering images
continuing see how he plays sometimes drives his cornermen nuts
nobody knows his next move him included
they watch more action
creed has a fighter helpless against the ropes
continuing killer instinct ya both got the killer touch
right cross combination
but you got the power to rip the body
they watch more action
continuing rocky when ya climb into the square an know ya meetin the best fighter in the world ya gonna be ready ya gonna be ready cause i been waitin
for fifty years fifty years
when im done with you youll gonna be able to spit nails
youll gonna be able to eat lightin and crap thunder youll be a very very dangerous person
the scene fades on mickeys voice and rocky staring transfixed at the images projecting on the wall
rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration
as he strikes from all angles mickey instructs
rocky now works on the incline situp board
while doing situps he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell
the pain is evident on his face
pushups between two chairs as mike sits on his shoulders
mickey coaching drives him on
mike has on a pair of target gloves and rocky moves around the ring swinging at them
drenched in sweat rocky hums the speed bag
his expression is hard and flushed
mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats rockys shoulder
he is very happy
rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball
dino hands him a towel
paulie crosses the gym as rocky heads to the steam room
a thin man crosses the gym and mickey nods
what cha say benny meet the rock
this is our cutman benny stein
check the eyes ben
benny checks the skin around rockys eyes
seen worse cover up an things should be okay
take a shower
heading towards the shower rocky is intercepted by paulie who traverses the gym
he stops rocky at the shower room entrance
yo rock i think i found an angle to make some bread usin ya name ya mind
exhausted rocky studies paulies face a moment and nods yes
rocky sways into the shower room and paulie strides off
rockys crowd of trailing boys has tripled
dashing through the streets he resembles the pied piper
it is twilight and rocky is alone at the very bottom of a huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens
rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never ending stairs
halfway up his body shows the strain
nearing the top rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at the very top
he looks down the steep stairs and swells with pride
he is ready
rocky is led into mayor rizzos office by an aide
rocky is very nervous as he approaches the mayor who is seated behind his wide desk
sit down rocky
flips open a thick file that lays in front of him
continuing ive been going over your record youve been the busy type reading nineteen arrests probation three times expelled from seven public schools in and
rocky tries to sink into the chair
continuing im a very busy man but i just wanted to remind you that youll be setting an example for thousands of guys like yourself and maybe start them off
in a new direction and give our police force a break i also hope you try your very best and bring pride to philadelphia
the mayor presses a button and a photographer enters
would you stand up please
rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand
their picture is taken three times
the photographer exits
continuing thank you for coming by rocky good luck
turns any time
after the fight youll have nearly a hundred and fifty thousand dollars what do you plan to do with it
smiles run for mayor
the mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big friendly laugh and rocky exits
adrian and rocky are at his apartment
they are looking at new scrapbooks
newsweek magazine headline the italian stallion or donkey
philadelphia magazine rocky stands with the mayor
rocky do you realize everybody in this country knows your face and after the fight everybody in the world is going to
she flips through sports illustrated the american sportsman ring magazine world boxing true and a multitude of other clippings
the telephone rings
rocky rises and walks to the new white object hanging on the wall

rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door
continuing to dog come
rocky arrives at goldmills gym
he unlocks the gyms door
rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym
rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the steps to mickeys office
at the top of the stairs he looks down at the ring reflects for a moment then enters the office
after turning on the lights he quickly cleans the cluttered desk and sets up the projector
he goes to the cabinet and removes a stack of mm films
the office clock indicates it is several hours later
rocky is engrossed in watching another apollo creed film
he sits motionless
rocky sits upright
something catches his eyes
he springs at the projector
he reruns the scene several times
several hours later rocky is engrossed in watching another apollo creed film
he sits motionless
something catches his eye
rocky stops the projector as apollo is delivering a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent
rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it was a priceless painting
he backs off and begins writing on a note pad
the first light of dawn streams through mickeys filthy windows
rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he has lost interest in watching the movies
the film has completed its run through the projector and lazily flops around on the top reel
listlessly rocky rubs his reddened eyes
the door opens and mickey flips on the light
the two men stare at each other for a long moment
mickey studies rockys despondent expression and knows what is on the fighters mind
i know what youre thinkinm kid at least ya gotta shot all ya can do is try ya best
rocky stands and with his dog inches past mickey and exits the room
mickey walks over and turns off the projector
he idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it slides off the desk and crashes to the floor
after leaving mickeys gym rocky and his dog listlessly move down the street and head for home
rocky arrives at his apartment
adrian is asleep on the couch
he lowers himself beside her
her eyes open
cant do it
i cant beat him
yeah i cant beat him
adrian touches his face
i been watchin the movies studyin he aint weak nowhere

oh rocky you worked so hard

adrian touches rockys face
the fighter gently lowers himself beside his woman
continuing no foolin around
it is the night of the bicentennial fight
the location is the philadelphia spectrum
the spectrum is filling to capacity
grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat
nearly everyone is holding a red white and blue sweater
the arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red white and blue
high above the ring are huge posters of george franklin and apollo creed
apollo creed sits in his dressing room
it is dead silent except for some noise that filters under the door from the arena
it is a close up of apollos hand being taped
the rasping sound of the adhesive tape is very pronounced
the atmosphere is identical to apollos dressing room
adrian watches in silence as mike wraps rockys hand
again the most pronounced sound is the rasping of the adhesive tape
apollos other hand is being wrapped
dead silence except for the tape and apollos breathing
rockys other hand is being wrapped in a close up
the only sound is the tape and rockys mounting breathing pattern
close up of drops being placed in his nose to help increase his intake of oxygen
the tremendously magnified sound of close up of the drops being placed in rockys nose
a heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the champions eyes
in an extreme close up the eyes shine brightly with the grease
grease is smeared around rockys eyes
in the extreme close up several deep scars are seen
close up of apollos trainer digging his fingers deeply into the thick neck muscles of apollos upper back and neck
close up of mikes arms wrapped around rockys waist and lifting his diaphragm up
magnified breathing roars from the screen
apollos trainer slips a mouthpiece into apollos mouth
apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places another one in the champs mouth
creed nods yes
everyone present is motionless as rocky is in the bathroom
alone rocky is on his knee praying
completing his silent prayer he stands and looks at himself in the mirror
suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge of his life
out in the dressing room the door opens and a guard leans in and nods that it is time
rocky steps out
its time kid
rocky nods and moves toward adrian
ill wait for you here
rocky nods and she kisses him
the fighter leaves with his trainers
adrian is on the verge of tears
rocky mickey and mike start down the long hallway
up ahead are three security guards
rocky rubs his bare shoulders
yo mick can i have my rob
rocky puts on the robe
embroidered across the back in flaming letters is pennzoil mike helps him into the robe
mickey is not amused
dont you care what the people will say
im doin it for a friend

i get the robe an paulie gets three grand
two ringside commentators sit in front of a panel of closed circuit televisions

the electricity is everywhere tonight
rocky balboa a fifty to one underdog is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples imaginations all over the world to quote a popular sports magazine the fighting style
should be the caveman against the cavalier
from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring
his record is forty four wins twenty losses and thirty eight knockouts
i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds vegas odds say no
a wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring
many people wish rocky well as he passes
people also hurl insults
from the expression on mickeys face it is also the greatest night of his life
in the audience are familiar faces from the gym
from the back of the arena a roar goes up
apollo creed is in a mock boat dressed like george washington
he throws silver dollars
the noise builds to deafening proportions
creeds trainer holds the rope and creed bounds into the ring
he tears off the washington outfit and it is clearly seen that apollo creed is garbed in an outrageous uncle sam outfit
on his head is a red white and blue sequined top hat
the robe is sequined red white and blue
his boxing trunks are red white and blue silk with stars around the waistband
the boxing shoes match the trunks
on his chin is a pointed white uncle sam beard
you could go deaf with the noise it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring am i seeing right
creed is approaching the ring in a boat
is he supposed to be george washington
its been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington a great way to start off
immediately creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle
he passes within inches of rocky in his uncle sam outfit
i want you
i want you
the crowd loves the taunting
apollo creed floats back to his corner

the announcer steps to the center of the ring
several men in suits stand against the ropes

paulie waves back and secretly gestures at his date
rocky smiles and gestures back

frazier rumbles to the center of the ring
the crowd cheers
apollo puts on a show
he grimaces and gestures like hes going to attack frazier
his cornermen hold him back
frazier goes to rockys corner
save some of him for me
the commentators beckon to frazier as he exits the ring
the former champ looks great can we get joe over here here he comes
joe frazier stands in front of the commentators
continuing joe what are your feelings about tonights fight

joe laughs and exits
the timekeeper rings the bell

italian stallion rocky balboa
a good crowd response
in the far corner wearing red white an blue weighing in at two hundred and ten pounds undefeated in forty six fights the heavyweight champion of the world the master
of disaster apollo creed
the arena explodes and creed puts on a display of hand speed
the referee motions to both fighters
they step to the center of the ring
as the referee explains the rules apollo and rocky stare hard into each others eyes
the referees voice fades and the fighters expressions fill the screen
something soulful and frightening is being communicated
now come out fighting
the fighters return to their corners
god bless ya rock
thanks mick im gonna try
the bell rings
creed dances forward and boxes rocky as though he considers the man an amateur
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face creed doesnt look the best hes ever been but is
moving smoothly creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner oh a solid hook by creed a master of fist men
the champion is smiling and toying with the man trying to give the fans their moneys worth and make a show of it with the badly out classes challenger another
left to right combination
i feel sorry for creed is down
rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw
creed is dropped
the arena explodes
creeds eyes show disbelief
so do rockys
rocky backs into his corner
mickey and mike yell at him
you can do it
goddamnit you got the power
the body get the body
ya got him goin
creed is up
his playful attitude is gone
he is now all business
his lightning jab stings rockys face repeatedly
come at me sucker
rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against apollos chin followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes creed to cringe
apollo counters with jabs and rocky whips brutal combinations to the body
the bell rings
how am i doin

breathe deep keep ya chin down

apollo does not sit
he stands and clowns with the spectators to prove he is not hurt
to trainer that boy damn near broke my arm

the bell for the second round rings
rocky rushes out fast and furious
apollo melts out a left hook that raises a goose egg over rockys eye
apollo employs footwork that dazzles rocky
he has class
he studies rocky and employs his lightning jab with cutting accuracy
still rocky shuffles ahead bombarding creeds midsection with hooks
the round ends with apollo assaulting rocky with blinding combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that flings rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose
the round ends
apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans but he is beginning to show the strain from the body punches
man i rearranged his face with that right the people love whats happenin tonight
people nothin you in a fight my man ya best believe what you hear

rocky sits as mickey and benny try to reduce the swelling around his eyes
the nose is shattered
ya nose is broke
hows it look
cant hardly tell
dont swallow the blood go for his ribs
dont let im breathe
the guys great
why dont ya tell im youre a fan
the commentators are caught up in the action
they speak rapidly into their microphones
if you had asked anyone who knows boxing they never wouldve predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion
most fighters will tell you receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying
round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away there goes the bell
apollo comes out dancing
he skips and side steps rockys sledgehammer hooks
an expert ring general apollo uses the ring fully
rocky keeps tearing in and creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling
near the end of the round rocky fires a penetrating punch to the heart
apollo almost sprints out of his corner feints and throws a pair of left right combinations
balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creeds temple not much movement from balboa duck a left a right another left and explodes
with a right hook to the temple i mean explodes
the champ backs off
theres no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power
no way but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky
creed on the offensive balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart
the wallop knocks apollo off balance
the camera goes to a steep angle shot from the floor vertically up apollos body
the scene goes into slow motion
rocky releases a terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under creeds eye
creeds face contorts with excruciation
yelling cover your face
to assistant my mans cut my mans bleedin get ready
the bell sounds
apollos corner works frantically to close the wound
the ring doctor inspects the cut

in the next ten rounds apollo cuts and slashes rocky to ribbons but pays dearly
both his eyes and lips are cut
welts across his midsection attest to rockys body battering
adrian is unable to remain alone
she is lured by the growing roar of the fans
she exits the dressing room
stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor
the mounting cheers make her speed up
she opens the door at the end of the corridor and is hit by a thunderous wave of sound
the guard at the door inspects her and goes back to watching the fight
adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the battle
she is entranced by the power of it all
back in the ring rocky keeps grinding ahead
he plants a thumping left over the champions heart and creed winces
rocky is game but losing
at ringside paulie is frantic
he is living the fight from his seat
gazzo and his bodyguard watch from the second row
gazzo looks proud
the bodyguard impassive
a huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the bar
they see rocky driving creed against the ropes and cheer loudly
the rocks got real stones
the men are fighting with appalling tenacity
rocky rips and tears into the body
apollo counters with a ceaseless stream of rapier like lefts
the challenger is seriously outclassed
cmon lemme cut yo
rocky wades in and creed employs incredible footwork
he sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross to rockys already broken nose
blood sprays from the wound and red droplets drip from his chin
rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a torrent of combinations
rockys eyes are closed
but creed cannot drop him
the bell rings
the commentators shift in their seats
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen the ringside audience is spotted with blood
this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall not only has he refused to fall but he has beaten the champions body without mercy
and the bout has become a vicious slugfest
apollos corner is in turmoil
the champion is definitely hurt
to assistant get that doctor
youre hurtin man
im feelin good bro
in rockys corner things are frantic
his eyes are swollen shut
wanna keep goin
would you keep goin
no more ya wanna lose an eye
open my eyes please open my eyes
mickey nods to benny
he secretly places a small ring knife between his index and middle finger
in one smooth movement he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers the draining wounds with gauze
it is done so quickly no one is ever aware of the operation
at the rear of the arena adrian looks transfixed at the ring
she is caught up in the heat of the battle
the bell rings for round fourteen
rocky bores in close but apollo still has spring in his legs
he seems determined to end it this round
apollo catches rocky flush on the jaw
rocky is staggered
like a wolf apollo cuts loose with pure savagery
rocky is driven against the ropes and receives a devastating beating from the champion
rocky is dropped
rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring
everything is a distortion
he looks for familiar faces as though to ask for help
mickey and mike scream frantically for him to stay down
six seven eight rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy
he is like a wounded wild animal
the tide suddenly turns
rocky drops low and catches apollo with a pair of terrific body punches that seem to drive apollos diaphragm up to his throat
a crack is heard
a glaze of pain covers apollos eyes
it is only a supreme effort that keeps the champion upright
apollo is badly hurt
he is bent over
rocky moves towards apollo
apollo flicks dread jabs into rockys eyes
the italian wades in with punches that seem to bulge out apollos back
creed takes the punishment like a stoic
blood is running from apollos mouth
in the clinch he leans over rocky and it drips down the italians neck and shoulders
apollo shields his wound from the ringside judges and continues to fight
the bell rings
apollos men rush out and guide him to his corner
ribs broke blood trickles from the corner of apollos mouth
the trainer feels the ribs
yo bleedin inside man get that doctor
one more round
dont kill yourself man let the doctor stop the fight
cover the ribs look here elbow down tight tight stand straight youre the best youre the best
rocky no longer resembles himself
his face has completely been beaten to jelly but his mood is buoyant
how i look out there mick
truly worried great kid great
the ring doctor leans over rocky and checks the eyes
one more round how do you feel
rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life
he cannot be bothered with pain or doctors
fine go away im gonna make it im gonna make it
everyone is distraught over rockys dangerous condition
we gotta stop it kid
ya gave it ya best shot
nobodys gonna say ya didnt give ya all
i cant let ya go out
rocky stands and eyes them all
impassioned and quietly ill kill ya all
dont stop nothin the bell rings
apollo moves cautiously out of his corner and circles to rockys right
the commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters
the fight has slowed down to a near stand still creed circles to rockys right
the spectrum is nearly silent neither fighter has made a motion to throw
ive never seen anything like it in the last round of a championship fight
apollo spits blood on the canvas
it appears he is protecting his right side
his ribs were probably injured at the end of round fourteen
its confirmed unofficially creeds ribs may be broken apollo fakes a left and throws a big tired right balboas mouthpiece is out
creed attacks with one hand
apollo feints and rocky falls for it
the champion unleashes a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts rockys mouthpiece into the second row
rocky sags against the ropes in a crucified position
the insane crowd leaps to their feet
rockys bloody teeth snarl at apollo and he waves him to come ahead and fight toe to toe
apollo obliges with a weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have k
written on every punch
rocky counters the assault blow for blow
gimme ya best
mickey looks at the clock
ten seconds to go
continuing gimme ya best
blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside photographers
they are horrified and wipe away the blood
the fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit of strength from their souls and beat each other without mercy
they look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain
the bell rings
the arena explodes with thunderous approval
their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters
in the midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other with unabashed respect they stand like blood drenched gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives
as though reacting to some unspoken command they both step towards each other and embrace
apollo whispers in rockys ear
aint gonna be no rematch
dont want one
mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to his corner
mickey embraces him
the announcer enters the ring with a microphone
ladies and gentlemen tonight we have had the rare privilege to have witnessed the greatest exhibitions of stamina and guts ever in the history of sports
the crowd roars
continuing ladies and gentlemen we have a split decision
apollo did not expect this and tenses
his corner nervously tries to reassure him
it does no good
rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at mickey but mickey is frozen with anticipation
judge walker scores it eight seven creed
judge roseman scores it eight seven balboa
apollo is rigid
fear radiates from his eyes
to lose the crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill him
a silence has blanketed the arena
judge conners scores it nine six creed
winner and still heavyweight champion of the world apollo creed
rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of cheering fans that circle the ring and reach out towards him
mickey grabs rockys hand and raises it
the crowd roars
i dont care what they say youre a winner
yo can i have my locker back
mickey and rocky look at each other and grin
mickey hugs rocky like a son
mickey raises rockys hand again
rocky turns away from mickey and pats benny the cut mans shoulder
benny smiles wearily
rocky stares across the ring at apollo creed who stands victorious but his face and body are badly distorted
the two men lock stares that reflect admiration
apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward screaming his name and waving red white and blue banners
rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well wishing fans rumble forward
mickeys eyes show mounting apprehension as the fans become abnormally active
they shove the police aside and clutch wildly at creed
creeds army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity
apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried along by a legion of fans
on the opposite aisle rocky is experiencing the same overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be frightened by it like apollo
mickey tries his best to control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing clamor
the fans shove the guards aside and hoist rocky to their shoulders
rockys and apollos fans are aggressively competing against each other
chanting creed creed creed
rockys fans counter by bellowing rocky rocky rocky
paulie tries to get to rocky but is shoved aside and he starts swinging
both rocky and apollo are completely at the mercy of the crowd
they are being passed overhead and remain helpless as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands
the chanting is deafening
fearful that rocky is in danger adrian tries to move forward
running headlong into the crowd she angles through the mass to get to rocky
she is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions but she keeps her feet
she sees him
in the distance rocky floats into view and adrian flattens against the wall and waits for the procession to pass
the procession approaches and she clearly sees rockys unbelievably battered but smiling face
he appears to be king of the world
the procession approaches and passes adrian
she jumps on her toes and waves frantically but is not seen
she screams rockys name
somehow the delicate voice knifes through the racket and reaches rocky
rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages to see adrian jumping up and down waving
the crowd is carrying him away
he attempts to lower himself but the crowd wont permit it
rocky instead turns and begins climbing across peoples heads and shoulders
he resembles a man trying to go up a down escalator
people are jammed so tightly together rocky manages to crawl across them to adrian
still suspended in air rocky leans down and adrian jumps up and they lock in an embrace
i love you i love you i love you
the two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can remember
