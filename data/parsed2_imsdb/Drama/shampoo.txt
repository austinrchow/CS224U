b if window
href b b shampoo by robert towne and warren beatty dark screen november th a darkness where even outlines are not discernible
there is a dim point of light coming from a dot on the hi fi which is playing the beach boys when we could say good night and still stay
wouldnt it be niiiice
we could be married then we could be happy wouldnt it be niiiiice
through it there has been the sound of banging distinct and rhythmic
it grows louder as the music ends
there are also whimpering sounds from a woman
nobody can hear it
it bangs a couple of more times
it makes me nervous
it continues to bang until felicia screams over the banging of the headboard
she follows the scream with a few yelps
now the sound of the phone ringing
complimentary oh my god
the phone continues to ring
a slightly different tone you going to answer it
meaning no uh uh
it continues to ring
being for her very mischievous want me to
let it ring
and it does
it continues to ring killing all other considerations
boy whoever she is she doesnt give up
after a moments fumbling george finally picks it up
a little surprised ah hi
the girls voice on the other end of the phone can be heard only fitfully when george holds the receiver loosely by his ear
it is tina
what took you so long
wasnt sure it was you
laughter sizing it up immediately all right whore you with
lively but muffled no
shes heard felicia awww ill call you back

she starts to kiss him the sheets are rustling
the phone shit

george flips on the light
whoever she is she doesnt give up does she
bare assed george swings out of bed looking for something
whatre you looking for
i thought you said you werent going anywhere
i mean ive gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes
you mean that girl dont you
george finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes a pair of crumpled levis and a brightly colored shirt
he leaves his shorts and socks on the floor
hes obviously in a hurry
what girl shes not a girl shes just a friend of mine
felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses
you son of a bitch
george sighs shrugs and heads toward the door
wait at least wait til im dressed
she starts to get out of bed
oh christ do you have any kleenex
george is a little desperate now
he runs to the bathroom tosses her the whole box
thanks a lot
desperate listen baby dont leave really
ill be right back its just that this girl is a different girl
she has attacks
its got something to do with her
george is trying to remember the rest
shes got a
suddenly interested does she have a pancreatic ulcer
anxious to go now yeah i think so

gee thats very serious
ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer
it turned out to be cancer
so what are you doing going over there

percodan she ran out
before felicia can say anymore george goes to the bathroom and grabs the first pill jar he can find moves to felicia and kisses her
and listen ill be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back
acquiescing youre very rude
if you dont come back ill be back in a while
i dont want to see you anymore
ill be right back baby really
george on his bike threads through traffic on the strip
over this we hear a few bars of the mamas and the papas monday monday
he pulls up to a signal beside a faded eugene mccarthy billboard
hey baby whats happening
not bad nothing my sisters back from vegas
thats too bad
i have to see you
hey stop by the shop
he takes off
winds through alleys and heads up the hill to jills
its a shortcut whose precision should make it obvious hes traveled it a number of times
george jumps off his bike and pounds on the door
soft who is it
furious who do you think it is
jill opens the door
there were some shots
whatre you talking about
gunshots there were some gunshots
looking around where
here in the canyon
well its a big canyon
seeing shes upset honey im sorry but ive gotta get back
just for a minute
let me come too
pleading please dont leave me alone
whats gonna happen
near tears i dont know
every once in a while i just get the feeling something awfuls going to happen
well like what
i dont know
somebodys going to get me
jill starts to cry
she ambles into the carport in her nightgown
ive had these dumb dreams lately
theyre dumb somebody
i dont know
you said somebody
shes not answering
i dont know
i cant remember
it was just in my dream
george comes over to her
nobodys gonna get you

uncertain george i dont youll do what i tell you
now get the fuck inside
she backs inside
he moves in after her
george moving after her keep moving now george nobodys gonna get you but me
he leaps after her and she screams delighted
george chases her into the bedroom
he throws her on the bed and leaps on top of her kissing her
she likes it
how are you baby
how are you
great great fantastic
incredible really incredible
im gonna open the shop baby im gonna open the shop
im getting it together
rising right now im at the epitome of my life
right now i feel so good im afraid somethings gonna happen
he gets off the bed
jill is fascinated
when i was a little kid i used to want to go to europe but right now wherever i am im gonna be in europe
honey what happened
i just came from a meeting
i cant talk about it now baby
but in a few days see im disgusted with my life
i thought you said you were at the epitome of your life
i am i am
but ive had it with chicks
theyre like an occupational hazard
six guys working for me
im gonna retire or settle down or something
what about me
meaning it youre different
do you really mean that
hey baby im gonna retire with you
he kisses her
they start rolling around on the bed
why am i great
george is a little annoyed
jesus i dont know
jill looks a little perplexed
will we live together
we live together now
but in the same house you know one house
just a slight hitch sure
she hugs him
george in bed beginning to sleep
hubert humphrey expresses opinion at his chances tomorrow on tv
maybe you dont even like children
of course i like children
youve never even been around one
im around you and i like you dont i
smiling despite herself yeah
sinking back down night baby
after a moment george
not right now i dont mean right now
grumpy okay baby
jackie says she wouldnt bring children into this world
that its hypocritical and overpopulated
a few bars of the beatles and sgt
pepper over george on bike whipping into bank parking lot
george sits talking with mr
pettis a bank vice president
he is perspiring a little
somebodys breathing rather heavily
pettis seated behind his desk now and opposite george
hes going over something
looking up now oh yes
shumann called about you
how is she
i went to school with her husband
pleasantly affirmative so you want to go in business for yourself
and you need money
right thats right
smiling you do know what moneys like these days
no well yeah
pettis grabs a sheet off his desk one in plastic containing rates
jesus look at this
nine nine and three quarters thats our prime rate
and ill tell you something else the big boys are going for it
after all mr
roundy were paying six percent
fhas at eight and a half no we wont be going back to the old days
i guess not
its got nothing to do with inflation
rates for example rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully
historically thats always been true though most people dont realize it
an uncomfortable pause
what sort of references do you have
well i do barbara rush
embarrassed now her hair i do barbara rush
i mean credit references mr
jill haynes and jackie shawn in mini skirts and boots are having coffee at one of the interior decorator hangouts outdoors off melrose in west hollywood
a car honks
a cadillac pulls up to the curb
its occupant honks again obviously trying to attract their attention
jill starts to look over
i think youre crazy
dont look over its lenny silverman
who is that
deadly a real swinger
hes been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years
leonard is now calling jackies name
jackie cant avoid it anymore
pleasantly hi leonard
jackie whatre you doing
theyre having coffee going for a pony ride at kiddielands want to come along
i have to meet a client
whore you dating
jackie looks off and spots a billboard
ill call you
see you later
anyway youre crazy
i mean why
oh honey dont be totally naive
maybe i am
hes a very good hairdresser
jill looks at jackie
well he is
annoyed so whats your point
jill im just trying to be helpful
i know im sorry
i spent three years with him
i just couldnt take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent
his unemployment or mine
george was adorable but it drove me crackers
now at least im comfortable
lester does what he says hell do
maybe youre happy living like a gypsy
george is great but i know what you mean
face it you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later youve got to find somebody
face it time isnt on your side
i guess not
george and mr
giving it all hes got ive got the customers
thats my point
im the one they want
if i had my own shop theyd leave and come to me
i have a lot of customers
roundy why dont you make out a financial statement
itll save us both some time
miss michaels here can show you
have it notarized and well see where we go from there
miss michaels would you get me a couple of forms
pettis rises shakes georges hand and disappears
george is left with miss michaels who has been more or less within earshot of the whole conversation
george is very upset
jill thumbs through a life magazine with eldridge cleaver on the cover waiting for an interview in the outer office of the building whose open window overlooks a smoggy chunk
of the city
shes one of so many girls that at first shes not recognizable
all of them have composites which they carry in leather folders
they eye each other uneasily
there is the producer barry and the director johnny pope
but why egypt
well thats where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad
you seem disappointed
how long did you say
pope chagrined shoots jill a look
hes trying to get her the job
look is there somewhere else youd rather go
maybe we can change our location
no its not that
do you have children
are you married
do you have something against traveling
unable to interpret popes looks to her no
well do you have something against us
jill laughs a little embarrassed
to pope hes wasting time john
ignoring him go ahead jill you can say it
now im embarrassed to tell you
she is too and pope can see it
well let you know tomorrow
please dont misunderstand
id really like to go
a little sarcastic thanks for coming by
jill is at the door
she turns back
shaking his head this town
at the shop on brighton way in beverly hills
a few bars of simon and garfunkels sounds of silence covers george pulling up on his bike
the street is empty of traffic except there are scores and scores of parked cars a few parking lot attendants and some meter maids
george starts toward the shop
a pair of women in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop
they look like medusas
they hurtle down the sidewalk as if theyre running from something
then they find their respective cars and begin pouring pennies into the meters
clink buzz clink buzz
george looks glum
hes walking along the street
a girl stops him
shes driving by in a
hey baby whats happening
nothing i reconciled with ron you know the guy i divorced last summer
i hope you make it
somebody honks in back of her
i dont have your number stop by the shop
waving goodbye okay
george looks after her smiling
then disgusted god damn it
he goes into the shop
a large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop
it covers most of the wall it leans against
an attractive young woman in her early thirties everything matching a real french garden leans forward into shot and looks at herself in the mirror
she studies her image carefully
she moves closer to it
she seems uncertain at first
then as she looks her conviction grows great
she turns back to dennis lolly her hairdresser
she takes his hand
with her other hand she touches her hair
do you think theres enough height
i mean do you think theres enough height
now she and dennis look into the mirror at her together
dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck
felicia in far corner waits defiantly
george spots her
george do you think theres enough height
on way to felicia yeah sure
dennis doesnt think so
man i didnt say a word
well what do you think
is there enough height
both dennis and tina turn back to the mirror for further deliberation
youre late george
taking her to his cubicle i gotta talk to you
i dont want to talk about it
but you dont know what happened
i dont care
george do you think theres too much height
seating her its great
you dont know what happened this girl she almost got a little hysterical i dont care about that girl i dont care if shes dead
calm down baby
calming down im perfectly calm george im simply saying you have no respect for me that youre incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood
numbers and i dont need to place myself in that kind of position
gloria tugs on georges arm
whatre you here for
as if giving away a secret a wash and set
you need a cut
norman said said what
whispered i just needed a wash and set a wash and set thats all
well baby im george and it needs to be cut
to felicia but i dont want to place you in that position either
i like myself far too much far too much
i dont want to place you in any position to be put in that kind of position
to gloria ill have mary wash you
a schvar yeah
looking at gloria what with
nudging her a brillo pad i dont care anything
mary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are several photographs of models and one of a handsome young black marine in fatigues
george has gone to pick up a razor changes it
you takin a lot of shit lately george
mixing but then again you ask for it you just like my otis cant keep his hands outta ladies hair either
laughing too oh my yes
burning with anger george calling back im coming baby to mary hows otis doing anyway
that boy always does great
hes a corporal or a squad leader or something just wrote me from some place called kwang due
i dont know if you dont know george
george winks at mary heads back
going right on im not used to that kind of treatment
what kind of treatment
going right on ive never been treated that way and im not going to start now
jesus i dont know baby i been cutting too much hair lately
im losing all my concepts
jill has entered the shop
she approaches george
hey baby whats happening
they want me to go to egypt for three weeks
jill stands there now not knowing what to say
jill say hello to felicia
how did it go at the bank
george looks away
could i talk to you for a second
hey im you know could i
george moves away from felicia
with some feeling i said i wasnt sure if i could go
oh great listen baby i gotta get back okay
okay but how did it go at the bank

the shops owner george
youre late were all backed up and youre supposed to go to buffums
ive got heads here norman
you promised youd do the show
oh fuck norman
dont use that tone of voice with me
never mind ill take gordon
george turns back to felicia as ricci comes by
hes near tears
do you know what that lillian bercovici just did
working on felicia no man
right after i sprayed her
losing control she touched it
then she played in it and got it all into something else
now i dont know what it is
hes waiting for george for sympathy
jill steps away gathering patience
i cant even stand to talk to her on the phone
sympathetic shes heavy
to felicia see norman expects me to get in here take care of all the customers and then do his show out in norwalk
i gotta have my own shop just out of self defense
i can see that
youre looking great baby
whatre you doing later
half kidding whatever you say
we have this political thing tonight
could you comb me out at the house
george is torn
i dont know
im beginning to feel guilty
all i ever do is play
i should be doing something to get my own shop open
why dont you see lester
a little alarmed your husband
not sure what shes driving at what about
i think youre a good investment and i dont mind telling him
hey listen baby im a star
hey baby say hello to felicia
i already said hello
when can i talk to you
baby im in the middle of work
i know but this is important
i have to make a decision
whether or not im going
honey have they offered you the job
no but i think they might
to jill just a second ill be right with you
he turns back to felicia
jill moves away
interested is she all right
i dont know
just a minute
george moves over to jill
what do you want
they didnt offer you the job yet
i want your feelings about it
look either we have a meaningful relationship or we dont ive got to know
really harassed look baby can we talk about it later
felicia is watching them
when i get off work
when is that
ill call you
when is that george
ill call you
really upset but i never know when youre working and when youre not working
half to himself neither do i baby
nothing ill call you okay
back to felicia
as jill leaves
i hope shes all right
you really think id be a good investment
i wouldnt say so if i didnt
no i know
and i certainly wouldnt tell lester
i mean it or i wouldnt say it
you look great baby great
dennis look at felicias hair
hes with the desk girl
both of them great
jill in street on verge of tears
moves to her car
sits for a long moment
george on bike pulls into office building
the music over is in his inner office
lesters on the telephone staring out the window
look kurt i dont care where you have to go
i want beluga caviar there
call jurgensons call chasens
i dont care how much it costs
then spend it
just make sure its there
youve got all the money in the world to buy it
just make sure its there on the table tonight
he hangs up jesus
to george to no one youve got to do everything yourself
suddenly lester gives george a steely look
it covers his hair his clothes
george is acutely uncomfortable
felicia says youre a very good hairdresser
she says youre a fabulous hairdresser
i didnt say it she did
howd you happen to get in that line of work
george sort of knows what lesters driving at
oh well i went to beauty school
you know you go to beauty school
and you get your operators license
and you graduate
and youre a hairdresser
george hasnt told lester what he wants to know
its an unusual trade
yes it is
an awkward pause
but the important thing is youre successful at it
in a way
im better than the guy i work for
this seems to interest lester
well george i invest for a lot of people
i make a lot of money for them
more than they could do for themselves
after a while that hurts
he appreciates this
its good you want to do something george
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into
suddenly direct almost enthusiastic no theyre a pain in the ass theres no way of keeping track of anything
its a cash business and youve got to watch your operators or theyll steal you blind am i right or am i right
who needs that kind of aggravation
who needs that kind of aggravation at my age
when i finish work i want to
the door bursts open
its one of the secretaries
jackie is right behind her
she bounces in not seeing george
im sorry but i need an extra garage key
in lesters presence she seems distinctly younger than she did with jill
shes startled when she sees george
what do you need the key for
jackie continues to stare at george
the man from sloans is coming
i called you about it
how did you lose that key
oh george this is uh miss this is jackie
oh hi i mean hello weve met
a little suspiciously is that right
almost immediately on the defensive well yes george is a wonderful hairdresser
is that right
so hows norman
whos been doing your hair
jackie glances at lester
i go to the bluen gold barber shop in westwood
the guy in the third chairs dynamite
george is going to open a shop
really interested no kidding
your own shop
george starts to say yes
george could you excuse us for a minute
he leaves the office shuts the door leaving jackie and lester alone
lester shuts the door
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy youre always on the phone
who were you talking to
who do you think i was talking to
my secretary saw you with that boy
whatever his name is that actor
jackie looks for a moment as if shes going to get very emotional
steve slutes and hes not a boy
a touch bitter steve couldnt get arrested as an actor
he couldnt get arrested as a boy
then you were talking to him
i ran into him at the station on little santa monica what was i supposed to do hide in the ladies room
yes i was talking to him
lesters a little chagrined now but not much
an outburst im always on the phone because you never let me see anybody i cant even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you
youre driving me up the wall lester
youre even jealous of the dogs
i mean ive gotta have somebody i can talk to
im not jealous of the dogs
jackie looks at him in disgust
very positive now listen jackie im not jealous of anybody i just cant afford to get caught
so i cant talk to some broken down actor what do you think im going to tell him im screwing lester karpf
of course not
thats not very logical lester
picking up the tail end of this
he thinks the room is soundproofed
dont tell him its not
hell have that awful construction crew back again and they can never do anything right
trying to think of why its very logical its the most logical thing in the world
you wouldnt feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner and a little conversation and so forth
how about starting with tonight
by her tone jackie indicates shes been saying all of this for months
lester repeating it like its just occurred to him genuinely upsets her
shes near tears and shes not the kind of girl who cries easily
lesters sensitive to it
sweetheart i know its rough but at this point my business involves handling money for some very touchy people politics and so on
felicias at a very difficult period in her life
any divorce and settlement and so forth my finances would have to be looked into
jackie knows what hes talking about
quietly you and your touchy investors
you do well for people they dont ask you to stop
nobody wants you to stop making money doll not even uncle sam
they all want their share
jackie comes over to lester
youre lying about one thing lester
youre still jealous
shes said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can be with him
hes almost benign
god youre a doll
he takes her in his arms and she responds
he means it well work something out about tonight i promise
the door opens
jackie and lester emerge distinctly subdued
angie give miss shawn a garage key for the bowmont house would you
angie opens her desk and goes through some files pulls out a key puts it in an envelope and hands it to jackie shes lightning quick about it super efficient
well lets go down together
cmon george ill walk you out
jackie turns to stub out a cigarette in a standing ashtray
quietly felicias really interested in the shop isnt she
jackie moves back
normal tone now well george you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people
i mean i know
so im going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject
the elevator doors open
the doors close on the three of them
george is looking at lester waiting for an answer
looks up slowly how about tonight
jackie looks to lester
lester winks at jackie
yeah little election party im giving at the bistro
its a pain in the ass but i have to do it
well have a little time to talk there
the elevator stops on the third floor
a man in a suit and a middle aged woman with a cane get in
theyre strangers to each other
the elevator proceeds
quiet almost solemn in their presence maybe you could on your way you know pick up jackie here
theyve reached the basement and are standing as bill the maintenance man races around the cars to get to lesters rolls
its good you want to do something george
george doesnt answer this time
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do
anything i dont care what it is just so its something
i know what you mean
lesters car is backed up
the door opened for him
thoughtfully maybe he ought to go to beauty school
anyway see you tonight doll okay
lester slips bill a few dollars and takes off leaving jackie and george looking at each other
jackie shakes her head
your car down here
they walk toward it
listen im supposed to take jill to el cholo tonight
shes really going to be pissed if i dont
maybe shell come with us
if i tell her how important it is to me i dont think shell mind
i dont know
jills really great isnt she
so hows everything with you
theyve reached jackies sl
great more or less
she starts to get in
how long you had this
oh about six weeks now
lester well hes very sweet
hes a very private person actually
yeah he doesnt happen to know that we went together does he
jackie has started to get in the car several times
this stops her again
it never came up
you going to tell him
smoothly what for
honey ill see you later
they kiss each others cheeks she gets in and takes off
tooling along the tracks in jackies sl
jill youre a real sweetie pie
you really are
she glances over at jill youre sure you dont mind
dont be silly
youre really a love you sure
well what is it honey
it must be something
well its george
i thought you said things were great with george
well they are
but we have problems
you say things are great with lester
is he going to marry you
we dont think marriage is important
but you have problems
i dont know
one minute hes up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everythings going to be great and hes getting his own shop
and then suddenly he disappears and he wont even talk to me
its driving me crazy
jackie pulls away from the signal a little jerkily
five times a day
sighs then i guess its all got to do with this shop
really jill arent you exaggerating just a little
five times a day
embarrassed well you know what i mean
after four years
no i dont
and i dont know too many girls who do
giggling a little jackie what
taking a little breath well
its not so much the number of times he does it its
he does it for a long time
well yes you know that about george
its been so long i dont how long
quite a while
an hour an hour and a half sometimes forty five minutes thats quite a while isnt it
i would say so yes
i think youre going to hit that car in front of us
jackie slams on the brakes
see i just know that if i go to egypt well things happen i just dont know whatll happen to us he just never seems to think ahead does he
when you say forty five minutes or an hour do you mean continuous time
just continually without stopping
well not going in and out i dont mean just that
why are you asking me
you went with george longer than i have
i guess i just blocked it out thats all
well there was this one time a little devilish yesss
i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show
meaning yes uhh huhh
well it was very hot so id left the door open and the water was running so i didnt hear him come down the stairs
now jackie has begun to lose her self consciousness and is into the story
a little faint edge of nervousness or something like it begins to take over jill
he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just
lifted up my skirt and you know right there
didnt you have any panties on
remembering he reached up and tore them
what did you do
i just kept wiping that dish
maybe it doesnt sound very sexy but it was
faintly perturbed no it sounds very sexy did you just stay by the sink all that time
no he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck god it was hot
the wood on the sundeck everything
a gardener is riding a mower around the front lawn
there are three cars parked in and around the circular driveway
he slips into a cardigan sweater
his vanity is restricted entirely to how well pressed and clean everything is he wears
he goes out of the dressing room toward the kitchen passing lorna on the phone in the living room and felicia at dining room table hair in curlers reading cosmopolitan
do you think george is a fairy
well i dont know for sure
hes a hairdresser
mona brings her coffee from kitchen
thank you mona
lester has swallowed some vitamins in the kitchen
turns to her
maybe hes just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that
why do you ask
im thinking of investing with him
he worries me
maybe hes too flighty and irresponsible
thats why i asked if he was a fairy
i dont know
hes a hairdresser
really asking you suggested it dont you think its a good idea
that you were just indulging me
no doll i listen to you
and if a deal loses money thats not so bad either if its handled right
he gives felicia a peck and starts out
hes a nice boy
i invited him tonight
im sorry hes a fairy
george is busy
hes working on anjanette

anjanette looks around

ricci comes up to him ready to cry

ricci is stunned

mary her back to george sits holding the telephone to her ear

no its a very groovy girl

mary runs out of the shop tipping over a magazine rack
wheres the caps mary
shes exiting front door in a hurry
whats goin on mary
he pulls up to a rustic house
he gets his little case off the bike and then hesitates
he walks to the door and rings the bell
jackie answers the door
she seems distracted and at the same time a little wary
much the same in fact as george
jackies wearing a robe
they walk into the living room the dogs yelping
shut up its all right
to george automatically do you want a drink
well i do
she starts to mix herself a drink
she changes her mind pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back
she does it again
when she turns back to george hes looking at her noncommittally
where do you want to do this
probably the bathroom
cant you do it out here
george looks around
well it depends
if you just wanted a combout
i guess i could
jackie turns to him honestly uncertain
well what do you think
george himself is tentative
i dont know
why dont you sit down
jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down on the glass topped coffee table
meaning her position is this all right
george moves in
he draws the drapes back so light comes in from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen
he takes her hair in his hands
the contact makes them both nervous
she looks away
george continues to run his hands through her hair
a little nervous well what do you think
id cut it
yeah i think so
almost irritable you dont seem very sure
no im sure
there is a moment where jackie is trying to decide whether shell let george actually cut her hair
but i want you to know one thing
almost a threat ive got to look great tonight i mean i have to look great okay
felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses
she seems in a hurry
she leaves the bathroom moves quickly through the house to the kitchen
she passes lornas bedroom
lorna is changing from her school clothes into a tennis dress
she watches her mother flash by
she is holding a dangling pearl earring in her hand
mona comes out from the laundry room
felicia has called a little too loud
indicates earring have you seen the other one of these by any chance
i want to wear them tonight
before mona can answer oh
when george gets here tell him to wait
i have to pick up a dress and i may have to have it fitted but be sure
lorna ambles into the kitchen expressionless
to tell him to wait
but i have to go to the market
just be sure he doesnt leave
felicia flashes out the door and into the carport visible through the kitchen
she takes off
lorna slowly slips a white swetlet onto her slender wrist
which includes a sauna
jackies got on a terry cloth robe
george has been wetting her hair in the basin
her terry cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way
jills coming with us
after a moment she loves you george
i mean great
george begins to cut
jackie winces a little
george notices it
getting my hair cut is always a little nerve wracking
the cutting goes on
the bathroom is very close
george has begun to perspire a little as has jackie
i dont get it done often
its hot in here
after a moment its the sauna i keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot
george stops and takes off his shirt
hes wearing a purple t shirt underneath
he goes back to cutting
jackies getting more and more edgy partly because of georges proximity and partly because of her concern over what hes doing
george on the other hand is now less tentative more focused on the job at hand
finally not too much dont cut too much
jackie would you argue with your doctor
george stops and looks at her
both are perspiring freely now
seemed to think i hated men
you still see him
jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror
george gently pulls her back
with some feeling no
jackie doesnt answer
he tried to
make it with me
jackie looks up slowly
george is still cutting not looking directly at her
it was after you baby
breathes deeply boy that sauna is really
cant you turn it down or something
lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it
jill alone sits on bed
gazes into bureau mirror shaping her hair
the phone rings
oh hi johnny
are you serious
tonight im busy i
oh no you really couldnt come up here
with jackies hair considerably shorter
george is sitting now as he works his knee wedged between her legs working very close
anyway he offered me a silver cloud
at least he should give me a ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something
amused did lester know about him
there was nothing to know
if i cant have love i have to at least have money
i have to have some pride i can do something
george has started to dry her hair
he picks up the scissors
her hair is askew still so its difficult to see what george has done
staring at the scissors a warning george
i just have to do one little thing
if you screw me up for tonight ill kill you i swear to god ill kill you
i wont screw you up
his dark blue rolls royce
hes listening to the radio keeps switching to pick up fresh news reports
he turns off sunset and heads up coldwater canyon
how about felicia
did i what
you know what im talking about
hey i dont tell
teasing can i count on that
i just want to see lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight
well did you or didnt you
george shuts the blower off
he picks up his comb for the final comb out
if i told you about her
then you couldnt count on me not telling anymore
you did didnt you
theyre very close and jackies moving closer
shes intrigued amused and at ease
george is trying to keep some distance
you did i know you did
one of my few virtues is discretion
you just cant stand to miss one of them can you
shes moving closer and closer being deliberately provocative to seduce the information out of him
lester pulls into it
he stops reaches in the glove compartment and pulls out one of the little airline bottles of vodka
he pours it into a glass drinks it
he notices georges bike in the driveway
next to him on the seat is a prettily wrapped package
george sprays her
he turns her around in the chair to face the mirror so she can see herself for the first time
she should look really different her hair significantly shorter and modishly and beautifully cut to her face
jackies lips part
staring at her yeah baby
youre a genius
her hand automatically goes up to take his
he starts to pull it back
grabbing it thrilled youre a genius do you know that youre a genius
she turns and throws her arms around george kissing him
its too much for george
he kisses her back
trying to resist oh no
george is obsessed
he wraps his arms around her and she responds passionately
they are grappling pushing and pulling with each other
george kicks away the stool by the mirror and tries to bend jackie to the rug covered bathroom floor
forcing her down i dont want to
she throws her arms around him kissing him and shoving him away
george is tearing at his trousers
they are on the floor now rolling around bouncing gently off the ceramic molding from the sunken tub
itll ruin everything
you dont know i know
dont dont dont
they hit the sauna room door as theyre rolling around and the door opens
steam comes pouring over them momentarily obscuring their struggles
george has trouble getting his pants down
at the last instant jackie gives them a helpful tug
moans oh no
suddenly the dogs begin to bark
there is the sound of the door opening
jackie sits up
shes frozen with fear
muffled hey doll
where are you
get up get up get up
george is already trying to pull on his trousers
jackie is up and clutching her robe unable to move
oh god oh god oh god
do something please god do something
nearer hey baby are you sleeping
frantic what are you talking about
equally frantic forcing her sit down
hes moved into the bedroom carrying the package obviously a gift for jackie
hes been a little puzzled
his puzzlement is rapidly turning to suspicion
lester opens the door
hes hit with a blast of steam and the sight of george stripped to the waist ostensibly working over jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel
george has a comb in one hand and now turns on the dryer blowing it with a somewhat exaggerated gesture
shut the door shut the door
oh im sorry
he shuts the door
then he thinks better of it
he opens the door again and takes a step into the bathroom
george waves the comb at lester a little impatiently
its wet and sprinkles lester
look either come in or stay out
shut the door lester
what do you think this is a picnic
confused now sorry honey i
thats okay thats okay just shut the door
lester shuts the door feeling a little chagrined and relieved
he sits on the bed and puts the present beside him
in a moment george emerges
shes very upset
what about tonight
seizing the opportunity that and
ill be done in a minute
he goes back inside
just stare silently into mirror at each other
hey i brought you a little something doll
george has his case of comb and scissors etc
and is standing with lester
hes anxious to go
you look like youve had quite a work out
its nerve wracking sometimes
women can get you very upset
i know it i know it
this doing hair its
i know it son
but tonights going to be even tougher
george just looks at him
lester walks him to bike
george i know you have to deal with felicia and youre caught in the middle and if you can just bear with me tonight well i appreciate the way youve
handled the situation
its a difficult situation and i want you to know i appreciate it
tonights going to be real tough for me i dont know what to
son well do business i can tell you that
george roars off on bike
jackie is cleaning up some dog food
lester stands there for a minute
id like a drink
looking up just a second ive gotta clean this mess up or the dogsll have it all over the house
you ought to get rid of those dogs
jackie looks up and then controls herself
they get hair all over the place
theyre yorkies and they dont shed
jackie goes into the living room and fixes lester a drink
giving him a drink here
arent you going to have one
because i dont want one
lester goes over to her to kiss her
cmon doll its five oclock have a drink
jackie turns away and explodes
i dont want one
first you tell me not to drink then you tell me to drink which is it
i dont want a drink
lesters now a little intimidated but even more suspicious
i called to tell you i was on my way but the line was busy youre always on the phone
george pulls into the circular driveway
covered by a few bars of the mamas and the papas california dreamin
theres only one car
george gets off the bike and goes to the door
he hears the sound of a ball banging
he looks toward the tennis court
is banging away on the backboard
theres a basket of balls nearby
she hits with considerable skill and power until she misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh surrounding the court
george is standing there
lorna looks at him
you here to see my mother
shes out but youre supposed to wait
theyre eating silently
lorna has hauled all kinds of food out of the refrigerators
she watches george as he eats with some relish
she gets up and goes to the steel doored refrigerators
indicating refrigerators this is the one thing i like about this house
want some lox
youre my mothers hairdresser
warily i do her hair yeah
are you gay
theyre cold but theyre good
did you hear me
well are you
are you queer
laughing cmon are you or arent you
trying to avoid it gee this is great
he slices a piece of cheesecake
lorna sits down in the chair nearest him now
cmon tell me
dont be afraid
why do you wanna know so bad
see if youve been making it with my mother
looking at her for a minute he changes his tone what would my being a faggot have to do with that
nothing i guess
have you ever made it with a guy
have you ever made it with a girl
i asked you first
ive made it with a girl
well are you
am i what
making it with my mother
george wants to avoid this at all costs
he stares at lorna intently
id like to do your hair sometime
just you could look very heavy
dont make conversation with me
you dont have to make conversation with me im not my mother
do you have a thing about older women
thats sort of faggoty isnt it
george is weary and getting annoyed
yeah it is
i never get my hair done
in fact i dont think ive ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life
you think thats funny dont you
laughing a little yeah
you live a phony cheap cop out existence
determined to be light yeah
beverly hills hairdresser
what kind of a thing is that to do
you might as well be a faggot
think thats funny too
then what do you think
that youre just like your mother
i am not like my mother
i am not
lorna is furious
i am not
he starts to placate her look
then defiantly do you wanna fuck me
george stops eating
hes not prepared for this
uneasily right now
a little more tentative now that the moment has arrived yeah
a scraggly bearded waiter with long stringy hair sets down two huge green salads before jill and johnny pope
in so doing the waiter drops a wooden menu hes been carrying
as he bends down to pick it up he kneels beside pope
pope taps him on the shoulder
tapping him oh scraves
the waiter looks up and moves
taking your hair out of my salad
oh im sorry
pope nods jill giggles
the waiter goes off
pope tosses out a few pieces of lettuce from the top of his salad
why dont you ask for another one
are you kidding
his hairs probably the most nutritious thing in here
see youve reduced me to eating weeds
my friend doesnt like it here either
all right forget this filth
continue about your friend
well hes not exactly a friend
is he an enemy
laughing of course not
hes sort of a boyfriend
sort of a boyfriend
you mean he just sort of fucks you
my god did i say that
i dont believe it
he looks under his chair to see if it was somebody else
im terribly sorry
amused never mind
what does he do
is he an actor
good for you
hes a hairdresser
pope drops his fork in the salad bowl
how do you a
meet a hairdresser
getting your hair done
looks at him abruptly would you like to go to a party
not with your hairdresser
pulls into the driveway
she gets out of her car spots georges bike
she sees the food spread out
moving through the house
she stops by lornas room
lorna has a sliding door which is closed
felicia opens it
lorna is sitting on her bed in her tennis dress but with her tennis shoes off
shes straightening a string in her racket
she looks to her mother expressionless
have you seen george
hes in the bathroom
the toilet flushes
the sink runs and george emerges
hes looking a little haggard
coolly hello george
they walk out to the lanai together and george picks up his case
there is considerable tension from felicia as they walk into her bedroom
felicia slides the bedroom door shut an action which george unhappily notices
she turns to george
she looks very hostile
ive missed you
george is taken aback
he gropes for a moment
missed you too
felicia comes to him
she comes to him and touches his arm
george suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds his fist into a high backed chair turning away from felicia
she clearly misunderstands the action
touched its okay honey
its okay now
she moves to the door and quietly locks it
she comes back to him and kisses him gently
she kisses him again with more passion
george tries to respond
comb my hair out later honey
no thats okay ill do it now
im glad youre coming tonight
she gently tugs at him leading him toward the bed
george is miserable
looking toward the door but arent you
right now i just dont care
as they sink to the bed felicia switches on the hi fi
the tijuana brass begin to play
covered by a few bars of bob dylans like a rolling stone
he turns down his street and pulls into his driveway
he gets off his bike and only as he starts up his walk does he see jill
shes been quietly waiting on his front porch hidden in the shadows of the overhang
she doesnt look happy
george stops cold
jill says nothing
wheres your car
a friend dropped me off
whereve you been
a business meeting i told you that
they go inside
the living room is messy
george looks around in disgust
what business meeting

what do you mean what is it
its some political bullshit
i have to have jackie ask me

look at my hair
wait a minute god damn it
do you think i want to go to some god damned party
im trying to get that god damned shop open
im trying to get a little bread together

georges outburst has shocked jill
george maniacally begins straightening the mess
i just wanna live like everybody else thats all
i want clothes in the closet and food in the refrigerator and i dont want shit all over the house and running my ass all over town
i want my own house
i want an appointment book
i want to get up in the morning and go to bed at night
i want a normal life like everybody else thats all
he collapses into a chair
she comes over to him and knee beside him
i know honey
maybe i should get a dog
no it would just shit all over the house and id never clean it up
laughing a little touching him oh honey
if we had one place we could have a nicer place and i could take care of it
were almost never here
a signal red porsche cabriolet pulls up into mirror
the top is down
under the brightly lit streetlights jills blonde hair and features are visible
in her mercedes
george still looking through the rear view mirror
jackies a knockout
looking at george looking in mirror youll be the prettiest thing in the room lights green
he takes off oh yeah
what do you know about this guy
gesturing toward rear window this guy with jill
hes a director
pull up pope right behind george
parking attendants leap for the doors
a few photographers of the movie freak variety ask each other who these arrivals are
one assures several others that theyre nobody
to attendant do i need a ticket for this
well remember you
as they move to take his porsche
shaking his head ill park it
pope drives his own car onto the lot
waiting for pope who is now ambling toward them
to jill what does he direct besides traffic
television or movies
quietly to george feel better
pope has joined them
they clear it to see the long elegant bar bathed in soft light filled with elegant customers
george looks and sees someone
a fortyish woman attractive
to jackie jesus christ theres norma stern
look at her hair
what about it
looks like somebody took a dump in it thats the worst color job ive norma comes over hugs george
george pointing to her hair baby youve been chippying on me yes isnt it awful smiling yes
jackie tugs him by the arm
were upstairs george
now come on
behave yourself and for christs sake do me a favor
dont let me drink too much
going upstairs you dont do that anymore do you
jackie doesnt answer
theyve reached the top of the stairs
theyre hit by the full force of the upstairs gathering black tie posters of nixon agnew reagan and murphy vaguely familiar faces crossing back and forth clustering watching early returns
on television sets that are blaring from various points around the room
an orchestra plays meyer davis society jazz
jackie and george hesitate
pope and jill are behind them
pope jostles george as he stops abruptly
george looks around
hes holding jills hand
jill disengages her hand casually as though it were necessary only for the walk up the stairs
jackie nudges george forcing him to move into the room with her as lester comes toward them
hes stopped on his way over
can i get you folks something
a stinger please
a tomato juice
ill take a some white wine
and you madam
searching the room oh ill uhh just a coke
the waiter moves on and they wait for their drinks
lester finally makes to them
george glad you could make it son
lester this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope
glad to meet you jill mr
george turns to get his drink from the waiter as do jill and pope
lester takes jackies arm
who are they
quickly jill haynes jill haynes ive told you about jill a hundred times lester you never remember anything i say
does she know about us
jesus shes my best friend
whos the guy georges boyfriend
i dont know
why dont you ask him
cmon jackie im only trying george he draws george aside
do me a favor kind of keep your eye on jackie shes a little high strung tonight yeah
see she doesnt drink too much
jackie has heard this last
lester turns to her
see you later doll
jackie puts down her coke picks up a glass of white wine from a passing tray and downs it in one gulp putting it on another tray and picking up
another glass of white wine
with cleavage carefully prominent in a strapless gown spots george
she excuses herself from the couple she has been talking with and goes straight to the powder room
checks herself out in the mirror glossing her lips with a pale tint of something or other
she gives a final anxious look then hurries out nearly bumping into a lady coming in
she moves through the crowd up behind george turning him around
she kisses him full on the lips lingering on it
without batting an eye hey baby whats happening
oh this is jackie
jackie say hello to felicia
it is only now that felicia sees one of georges arms has been holding onto jackie
also without batting an eye hello felicia
instantly suspicious of george hello
felicia looks from george to jackie and back again
im so glad you could make it
ive been looking forward to seeing you
pours his drink on the cuff of a distinguished man sitting beneath him at a table as he sees george and felicia and jackie clustered together
lester what the fuck do you think youre doing
jesus nate im sorry
lester fumbles tries to clean nate off with a napkin
never mind ill do it myself
he dips the napkin into a glass of ice water and proceeds to clean off his cuff
nate goes back to the tv monitor where agnew is making some remarks or commentators are repeating his comment about being a household word
so far so good
aw theres nothing to worry about
you never know
why didnt you come alone
lester invited you
did you have to bring her
looking toward lester well she
shes a friend of jills
and whos jill
she spots jill
well shes a friend of johnny popes you know the director
she looks at pope who is saying something to jill which is making her laugh
is threading his way through a crowd holding two drinks one of them a coca cola
its a little more raucous now with election returns from the television sets creating a more festive mood
now and then someone jumps up from a set and hugs someone so carrying drinks is a little dodgy
jackie sits alone by the bar an unlit cigarette in her mouth
a man offers her a match
she stares at the burning match as if its obscene
she blows it out
the man looks a little shocked moves on
has his arm held
its kenneth a red haired decorator
excuse me i know i know you but i cant think where
look id like to help but felicia grabs georges other arm pulling him away from kenneth
kenneth looks a little shocked at the ferocity of felicias move
there you are
she tugs him with her
wait a minute she takes him right into the ladies room george still juggling the drinks
watches felicia and george disappear into the ladies room looking over jills shoulder
jill has not seen it
this other couple that were here with do you know them very well
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room
jill looks around and stares at the door
was he alone
i dont think so
well did he go in there with jackie
pope points over to jackie sitting at the bar drinking now
george is a hairdresser isnt he
jill doesnt answer
desperate baby you gotta let me out of here
felicia kisses him
sweetheart its a bore out there
lets lock the door
you want to get us killed
dont be silly
ill just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints
she pulls two joints out of her beaded bag
only a few seats from jackie jackie staring daggers at him lester aware of it
hes talking to a pair of lacquered eminence grises
fellas fellas just listen you both have tidelands you both want uncle sam to come through with offshore drilling permits so do it together has taken an olive from an
olive tray and hit lester on the back of the head
hes finished this little dissertation
he sees the source of the missile
he grows pale frozen
sixty four year old bejeweled woman in b
so little red riding hood says my what big teeth you have and the wolf says all the better to eat you with my dear and she says eat eat
eat doesnt anybody ever fuck any more
jackie has now picked up a carrot from a relish tray
dont do it
that son of a bitch everything he says is a phony piece of shit what does he think im some cigar butt hes got between his teeth almost picking her
up cmon cunt youre going for a walk
he takes her into the next room and lester watches the move with a mixture of relief and concern
jackie is now near tears
he just completely ignores me
he could have at least said something introduced me or something
sweetheart youre drunk
she leans on george
oh god what do i want george
lester comes hurrying in sweating now
hi doll whats wrong
you know whats wrong
felicia trips coming into the small bar
lester lester straightens up like hes been shot
oh felicia there you are you know george and uh uh hes genuinely forgotten her name
yes jackie shawn my wi felicia
to felicia your hair looks well fabulous
its just fabulous
to george an attempt at levity think you could do anything for me
he takes it seriously well i could try
do you wash your hair every day
isnt that bad for it
no it keeps the skin peeling
youve got to keep the follicles open
you lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and thats how you lose it
george actually touches lesters hair professional interest growing
this really ought to be layered
well yeah otherwise it just sort you know lies there layer so it kind of fluffs out he starts to fluff lesters hair a little when johnny pope walks in
with jill to this
pope stares at them
i think theyre waiting for somebody to start dinner
have they sat down
everybody but us
theyre waiting for you lester
dinner is pretty much finished waiters have begun picking up plates
to jill i guess its almost impossible to get work in the business these days
pope watches sokoloff make his move
i read for a soap the other day
a daytime soap opera
i was too old
what was it somebodys daughter
she holds up her wine glass
george looks at her
one word out of you and ill gargle with it
the waiter pours the wine
george looks to jill shrugs
jill mouthes try and stop her
george mouthes back are you kidding
sid roth has been eyeing jackie
arent you hungry miss shawn
jackie looks at roth
roth shoots his cuffs and smiles
not for rubber chicken no
sid roth smiles
jackie smiles back
intime well maybe i can get you something
thats very sweet of you mr
you must be a very important executive
almost a whisper well whatever i am i think i can get you whatever youd like
same tone as sids well more than anything else indicating george id like to suck his cock
she points to george
george chokes on the last of a piece of chicken
sid roth is stunned
he doesnt know what to do
george is coughing badly
jackie slaps his back
felicia is listening to lester
the agnew and nixon posters are directly behind them
to east senator you shouldve seen those little kids
about forty of em all blind
we put out these mattresses on the front lawn and they came running out of the house tripping and falling all over the place having a hell of a good
i mean they were blind of course
but it really gave you a feeling of accomplishment
i tell you i never had such a good time
felicia during the above has looked up to see jackie fawning over george
she cant believe her eyes
lester let me understand this was exclusively a home for blind children lester yes senator just a minute dear lester dont you think that uhh now lester spots it
hes very confused
that girls making an awful spectacle of herself

jackies now moving around kissing george on the mouth
jill is watching
johnny pope is fascinated

plaintive dont you want to jackie can we a little louder whos the greatest cocksucker in the world
cmon george looks around sweating now
very quietly you are
fuckin a with that she slips right under the table
its a surprisingly fluid move
almost simultaneously rises knocking her chair back
sees both moves and interrupts the senator
senator excuse me a moment he turns to felicia and then looks over toward jackies empty chair and literally doesnt know which way to go first
hes a little like the bear in the penny arcade that is shot and keeps turning one way then another
finally he heads toward jackies vacant chair and george
his chin to the tablecloth is fishing under it for jackie
now jackie trying for aplomb shes a very compulsive girl
i can see that
lester rushes up
a desperate smile hello george
your friend feeling a little under the weather
jackie surfaces through the tablecloth
to lester you phony asshole as if he didnt hear it oh dear thats too bad
with quiet desperation to george get her out of here get her out of here
a cheer goes up as some late returns come in
dirksen is talking about a new mandate for law and order and peace with honor
to sid what was that
doesnt know what hes saying oh good
lester glances back toward felicia who is watching him
jackie cmon george moves to jill
ive got to get her out of here
well arent you what
indicating pope ill see you later
not liking it too much okay pointed ill see you later
he moves away with jackie
lester turns back toward the main table
driving down sunset boulevard
there is a long moment of silence
the radios playing the eve of destruction
george gives jackie a couple of sidelong glances
she sits up lights a cigarette i dont know what gets into me
you were great
no i blew it i blew it with lester
no you didnt
you dont think so
you were great
you always say that
i really care for lester dont i
that sounds like me

she starts to scrunch over and kiss him then stops
where do you want to go
he still having parties
he never stopped
a woman rosalind is painstakingly and painfully introducing the senator
to have this man
who has helped
as has everyone here to bring so many people together
of all races creeds and colors
rosalind droning on b
she finally introduces senator east
yes sweetheart shh

she gives him a look that could kill

there are now o
calls for east to do his indian chant
this tells of the ancient grandmother who upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood stops a moment and says hello garden gate hello garden gate garden gate hello
finally exasperated look felicia this party involves more than you and me you know
these people are concerned about more than each other you know
is that right
yes were all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in believe it or not
has begun his weird chant beating out accompaniment on a cigar box and a pewter vase
glancing up is that what this is all about
yes and you dont have to be sarcastic about it thats a beautiful thing hes doing some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks
lester youre a miserable man
youre not helping anybody
youre just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves this is just business dont kid yourself
and you know the worst thing about it even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i cant possibly imagine youll never know the difference
youre just sweating and kidding yourself and youre kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl or that shell keep
her hands off him
he turns like a shot what are you talking about
she laughs think what you have time to think lester
lester grabs her
what are you talking about felicia
suddenly theres a rumble in the room and east has stopped chanting
several men have stepped to the center of the room
one of them in a slate suit raising both hands
excuse me senator
ladies and gentlemen were going to have to evacuate this room as quietly and quickly as possible
theres nothing to worry about
wed like you to exit through the door here on my left
down the steps into the street please
there are whisperings and rumblings of a bomb and rejoinders to the effect that its a hoax
nevertheless the exodus begins and grows to bedlam
waiters who had been fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing them down the stairs even going over them to make the entrance
the emergency doesnt keep autograph hounds from inhibiting the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that flows onto the street
jill and johnny pope are caught up in the swirl of the crowd
pope temporarily loses jill
he looks around
jill taps him on the shoulder
here i am
well as i see it weve got two choices
we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off or we can go to my party
lets do that
lester is with some security people trying to find out what theyre doing
are several police cars a fire truck and the fire truck ambulance
lights are flashing
have they located it
a car honks
lester is pulled to the side
looking toward driver oh sorry
then he sees its felicia
she gives him the finger and lays rubber nearly sideswiping him
what was that all about
somebody else says who was that
are dancing to a tape of good vibrations
georges coat is off his tie loose
they are near the entryway and sitting on a large staircase b
a young girl can be seen breast feeding her baby
george and jackie are obviously enjoying themselves
the tape ends
georges silk shirt is clinging down the center of his back
he moves with jackie where she picks up a coke at the bar
a black in a caftan with a huge afro offers jackie a joint
she takes a drags she and george move outside the living room
as they walk she hands the joint to george who hands the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the door all without really losing
theres a long rolling lawn
the lights are soft coming from the living room the music more muted
jackie nevertheless is breathing rather heavily from the dancing
george is looking at her intently too intently for her not to notice
she appears not to notice
what are you looking at
the lawn it looks like it goes on forever doesnt it
she turns back to george
look you dont have to entertain me
a slight laugh am i entertaining you
well if you feel like playing go play
jackie looks past george into the living room
theres a lot of players in there the twins come up behind george and jackie grabbing george
the move should be a little startling almost as if it were an attack
they grab george and spin him around temporarily pushing jackie out of shot
pleasantly hey whats happening
were going to the jacuzzi
tugging cmon with us in the jacuzzi
sure why not
come on george no later maybe go ahead ill catch up with you they head off ive got he turns back to jackie to finish what he was going to
say and shes not there
only a wisp of her cigarette smoke hangs in the air and then it disappears
george looks surprised and disappointed
several tall stringy types are eating out of the refrigerator with a couple of dogs eagerly watching others are eating hash cakes off the formica counter
red dog sits in a corner sipping wine out of a measuring cup
he smiles and looks up to jackie who has her arm on his shoulder
strobe lights from an adjacent room can be seen where the fuck you been jackie
real good to see you man
so whats been going on red dog
hey its the same old shit aint it
no matter where you go its the same old shit
nothing ever changes nothing man nothing
with sudden intensity hey you ever been to cuuliacaan
george a little hastily moves through the kitchen spotting jackie
hes nearly upended by a couple tall man and woman at the refrigerator
they grab him and kiss him and he shakes through them moving to jackie
whered you go
oh i thought you were what
hey man whats happening
thats right man
and he laughs
george silently takes jackies hand and they move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds in the rear of the house
the crowd has thinned out to a trickle but popes red porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other cars
pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone else
lester stands swaying a little unsteadily in the lot
the deputy secret service man seen twice earlier comes on up to lester
we cant find a thing mr
turns to him cant find what
oh well thats good isnt it
hes serious its good if theres no bomb
if there is a bomb and we cant find it thats not good
lester thinks this over
no of course not
coming up to jill were going to be here all night
these bastards have me hemmed in
to jill whats the problem honey
they have it blocked
oh thats no problem
to deputy take care of this boys problem will you gene
pope and deputy go off together
listen i wonder if you kids could give me a ride
im kind of stranded here
sure thing mr
they walk toward popes car
the trucks are being driven off
everything okay son
now all i have to do is find my car keys
he heads back into the bistro
lester and jill stand outside the porsche
ill get in the back oh no honey ill do that
theres not much room thats fine lester opens the car door and pulls back the seat
he has a hell of a time squirming into the back but tries to be lighthearted about it
jill gets into the front
the door on the drivers side is still open and lesters feet are poked out it
his head is pushing on the canvas top
see nothin to it
jill turns and smiles but its a mistake since lesters upper body is almost leaning on her as it is
lester puts his hand behind jills head forcing her to hold the position almost nose to nose with lester
what did you say your name was sweetheart
not moving his head jill
jill cant really move her head back and lester is obviously captivated by jills face
trying to be casual yes jill
still holding her gee
thats wonderful jill
very uncomfortable thank you
fondling her head moving her closer just wonderful
is heading back to his car
he stops when he sees lesters feet hanging out the door
another irritant oh no shit
pope gets into the car
hi what are we doing
lester falls back and hits the isinglass rear window
oh johnny mr
karpf needed a ride home and i said wed take him
do you mind
furious of course not
call me les
where to les
oh say how would you kids like to stop off for a drink
jill and johnny pope exchange glances
jill shrugs to say gee im sorry
well wed love to but were going to another party
thats wonderful ill stop by there for a drink
pope is furious
he starts the car backs it up quickly jostling lester around as he goes
lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool
the house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges and all sorts of random shrubbery
jackie and george watch the twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a couple of androgenous men
the twins stand up in the jacuzzi arm in arm and half move half throw themselves to another end of the jacuzzi
she stretches yawns
lazily very nice very nice
yes mmm a pause
she glances at george scarcely moving her head
but you never were much of a tit man mmmm ass and legs look whos talking
yes you well of course
who loves a big fanny on a man
not me pal
the twins have gotten onto some sort of splashing contest with the boys
water hits george and jackie
theyre hit again
they shrug george rises takes jackies hand
they walk on around the pool beside and along a maze of hedgerows
as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property
whose place is this
by the open staircase
pope is greeting sammy
sammys a tall jesus figure with an indian shirt that goes to the knees on his levis
sure i know jill
lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still sitting on the staircase nursing her baby
she looks up smiles at lester who manages a nod back doesnt take his eyes off the sight
noticing the bars in there les
embarrassed oh fine
he strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through the open foyer
where jill and george were earlier
lesters ordered a drink
the huge black in the afro offers him a toke
lester stares at it dumbly
a little lamely indicating drink im
he takes his drink and half toasts the black
he stops and his eyes pan the room
lester is virtually the only person on his feet
everyone else is either on the floor or on deep sofas side by side head to feet barely talking barely moving
in fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke from the joints
lester shakes his head as if to clear it
he takes a drink and almost on cue the acid rock music hits and the strobe lights go on
lester is momentarily alarmed as if it had something to do with his drink
he manages to stagger out of the strobe light effect hangs onto a railing in the next room
jill stands over red dog who hasnt moved an inch his measuring cup of wine still half filled
so whats new red dog
same old shit
its the same old shit wherever you go nothing ever changes
pope looks up sees lester just outside the kitchen door
jill scraves is a he points toward the kitchen door where lester looks like hes about to enter
pope takes jill and they move out the back door in the direction of the rear grounds that jackie and george had taken earlier
peers into the kitchen
its filled mostly with unkempt beards
he decides against it turns up a small staircase and continues up it until he finds himself in a den
several people are seated on the floor quietly smoking and watching television
they seem a shade better dressed than those in the kitchen
lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and partially blocked by someone sitting directly in front of it
he kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a pipe
whispering hows it going
quietly just fine
squinting to see is that illinois
taking a good look at lester then no thats sally
lester looks at the screen
sally handled by bare arms is being placed on a foam rubber cushion
pointing with his pipe stem to a girl by lesters ear also watching the set sally
lester looks at sally
she looks at lester nods
turns back to screen to watch herself
lester turns from sally to see a television camera and the foam rubber mattress now abandoned
lester shakes his head
theyre walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the pool
one of the twins is still in the jacuzzi
so when are you going to egypt
you mean when are you going to egypt
she turns and shakes her finger at pope
now i didnt mean that you rat
two weeks from tomorrow
jill stops cold
she turns to pope
those arabs wont be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes
she hugs him why didnt you tell me before
just before i ask you out
i cant do that
lets get out of here before good old les catches up with us again
theres a flash of light from the poolhouse window
jill turns toward it then back to pope still making up her mind
angle shifts slightly to hold on light from window
george has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge
hes looking at jackie closes the refrigerator lamely
it opens again and he closes it again
do you want ice
interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside
george pops the tops of the cans hands one to jackie
neither one of them drink
theyre staring steadily at each other their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis court lights which someone has turned on
finally were kidding ourselves
staring right back we are
last night i dreamt i was fifty years old and mary told me i was supposed to meet jill at the shop
it seared me shitless
i cant imagine being with jill when shes fifty years old
i cant imagine not being with you
george moves to her
jackie is waiting for him
it is long and lingering and deliberate
george breaks away and goes to the poolhouse door
theres no lock only an eye latch on the screen door
he latches it tests it
it gives slightly
nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to jackie who stands waiting
but what about her
i dont want to hurt jill
george takes the coke out of her hand
she lets him
walks back in the foyer holding a drink swaying
the strobe lights are going again in the living room
suddenly he sees a girl at least half nude her huge painted lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights
the vision disturbs him greatly
he carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get near her
she seems to move
he moves after her through the lights down the length of the room going as quickly as prudence allows
finally when they reach the end of the living room shes disappeared
then he looks out and sees her poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged path that leads down to the pool
he lunges toward the vision and bounces off a sliding glass door
have made it through the entrance and popes porsche is in sight
jill suddenly stops and looks at pope
we cant really leave that poor man here alone
hell never know the difference
jill is clearly thinking about something else besides lester
still at least we should tell him were going
going along with it protesting im telling you he wont know the difference
now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move every step is a possible disaster
from jacuzzi hey
lester looks down sees one of the twins
her arm is outstretched her breasts dripping water visible through the shrubbery spotlights
shes holding a joint
its getting soggy
lester takes it
just put it on the bench over there and come on in
lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it over to the bench
he puts the joint down
stares at it
he looks up and theres the other twin standing beside him nude with her breasts visible through the towel loosely flung over her shoulders
meaning joint could i have that
lester silently hands it to her
stares at the pool and the other twin isnt there
he looks back and the one who had taken the joint is gone
he looks back to the pool and the other twin surfaces with the force of flipper beside the guy in the pool
lester stares then he sighs and pulls off his pants almost falling down as he does
carrying them he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi
say what is it now man
do you know where i can find a towel
holding his trousers his tux shirt hanging half down over his boxer shorts lester moves on over to the poolhouse
he tries the door
the latch creaks
he pulls at it again and the latch pops open
he starts to open the door then hears the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense love making
the girl is quite carried away
he listens as her sighs interspersed with fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity
he thinks better of it
he takes his hand off the door knob and quietly closes the screen door
he starts to walk away then notices the window on the side
he cant resist
he moves to it
he cant see anything
he moves closer
the dim dark but classical outline of a man mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity can be seen
the sounds are not as loud from this angle but gradually they can be heard as the womans cries grow louder
lester is glued to the window
there you are
les les les were leaving
the angle has broadened to show lester holding his pants not taking his face away from the window
jill and johnny pope stand beside him
shhh with genuine awe now thats what i call fucking
pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window
as he does a light begins to flood the room
it is the refrigerator door slowly opening due in part to the rhythmic impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end table to another end table and
to the refrigerator
it opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of george and jackie
who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him
his face freezes
it is harsh and determined
he turns slowly away from the window and walks past jill without looking at her
what she turns to the window and sees george and jackie herself
watching oh my god
oh no oh no
she turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it through the window shattering the glass everywhere
screaming you son of a bitch
george has leapt up
whereve you been
weve been looking everywhere for you
jackie doesnt move only stares wide eyed through the broken window at the screaming jill
softly oh god
an ashtray is hurled into the room smashing against the wall and jill can be seen now storming off with pope
george with one leg in his pants rushes over to a far window pulls it open
hes got the pants on backwards
he turns back to jackie who has already slipped into her dress is stuffing pantyhose into a purse
jesus well you better go after her
he bends down turns his pants around and is hopping into them
he grabs his shirt wait here honey he runs out of the door beside the pool past the jacuzzi and into the maze of hedgerows
the twins stand motionless side by side in the water
to twin two who was that
george searching wildly through hedgerows is calling jill
he cant find her
he finds himself next to a ten foot ivy covered wall
he cant reach the top
he moves along the wall
arrives at a wrought iron gate
he peers through the gate calling frantically jill honey
inches from his face on the other side of the gate the bare teeth of a huge german sheperd growl at him viciously
george chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the house
he trips and falls
george running through the strobe lit party to the foyer
hes bare footed but his pants are on
his frilly shirt is unbuttoned
breathing heavily spots red dog
hey red dog
you seen jill
she just went out the door man
george charges out the door in time to see the red porsches taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it purrs off into the night
george turns and runs back into the house and through the strobe lighting living room
george heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse
the refrigerator door still hangs open
window glass is scattered on the floor and george steps on it cutting his foot hopping a little pulling out a shard
he opens the poolhouse bathroom door
he runs back out the door of the poolhouse
she went up to the house george
youre a trip and a half man
george runs through the living room again and the strobe lights
again he reaches the foyer
red dog is still there
george is heaving deeply now
pointing out the door man
george charges out the door this time seeing jackies sl pulling away tires screeching
he looks down defeated
his foot is bleeding on the pavement
george on his motorbike covered by a few bars of buffalo springfields for what its worth has thrown on a peacoat but kept on his velvet trousers
hes riding up what should now be a familiar road to jills
the lights from the city below flash in and out of view
her slot in the three car garage is empty only the oil slick stares at him
theres the sound of a car coming down the road
he looks up expectantly
as it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed at his feet
george turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door
he pulls out a key blows the dirt off it and goes inside
swaying in jill
he looks in bedroom then moves back to the phone and dials
it rings three times
yeah this is yes george
i guess you havent heard from her yet
he hangs up
stares around the room
jills apartment is as usual good little girl tidy
a contrast with jackies particularly kitchen
george walks over to the window and looks at the city
he walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair
there is the sound of a car idling
george opens his eyes
above him is the carport and jills yellow mustang has just pulled in
he walks into the living room as jill comes down the steps to the kitchen carrying the paper
the kitchen clock reads
george glances at it
then back at jill
she looks at him frightened but not moving
her hair is stringy and shes got no makeup on
theres a bruise on the inside of her upper arm and a small one on her neck and one on her left thigh all of which george will note in
the course of the scene
george looks her up and down
i dont want to fight george
i dont want to fight either
uh i love you
moving to her taking her arm i do jill
at this point he notes the arm bruise
jill stares back at him unflinching
how come you took your own car
getting a cigarette i didnt want him meeting me here
well thats something
you didnt plan on fucking him tonight
jill doesnt answer
she walks into the bedroom kicks off her shoes starts to take off her dress then changes her mind and puts on a robe over it
you did fuck him didnt you
im very tired george
jill goes into the living room
george grabs her arm again
didnt you baby
let go of me
let go of me or ill scream ill call the police
he lets go of her
the phone rings
jill answers it
her tone alters appreciably
listen can i call you back
no everythings fine really
she hangs up
that was him
you told him i was here and he wanted to know if i was beating you up
jill smiles thinly
well did you get a job out of it at least
id like you to leave now
george doesnt move
jill goes over and fishes into a tote bag by the wall
she returns with felicias missing earring
and take this with you
where did this come from
who knows im sure you dont but if itll help any i found it in your bed
jills anger is growing and her hurt is beginning to surface now
tears start welling in her eyes
unsteadily so who else was there besides jackie
baby dont do this
i do love you
obviously there were others werent there
george stares at jill
what do you wanna know for
i just want to know thats all
what difference does it make
i just want to know while we were seeing each other
i just dont want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing
jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable
george moves to her and tries to put his arms around her
baby please dont
i love you
breaking away i dont want to be a fool
i want to look them in the eye and say i know
shes backing up hes trying to touch her baby dont do this fighting for control itll help me if youll tell me
please baby no itll help me really how
ill know youve lied to me
ill know youre incapable of
thatll help me
not now but eventually
its been rising in him the last few exchanges
now all georges restraints seem to leave him
he stops trying to touch her and stands his ground exploding you dumb cunt everybody fucks everybody grow up for christs sakes
youre an antique you know that
look around you all of em all these chicks theyre all fucking theyre getting their hair done so they can go and fuck thats what its all about
come into the shop tomorrow and ill show you i fucked her and her and her and her and her i fucked em all
thats what i do i fuck
thats why i went to beauty school to fuck
i cant help that theyre there and i do their hair and sometimes i fuck em
i stick it in and i pull it out and thats a fuck its not a crime
george leans on a glass topped coffee table for support not even bothering to look at jill
jill has been pulled together a little more by the speech
well im glad you told me
his eyes closed jesus
his tone has indicated disbelief and disgust
i mean you know thats
she cant finish it
at least youre honest with me
does it make you happy
jill doesnt answer
i wish youd go now
thats all youve got to say
tell me something did you talk about me
thats not like you
yeah i know
george now cut this out
yes yes i did
what did you say
george if you keep this up im going to scream
what did you say
what did you say
i said you were a loser
she starts to cry again
no im not a loser baby i just sort of break even
george turns and walks up the stairs and out the door
george shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the living room
george finds himself facing lester and two other men who look like hoods
lester sits in the chair george sat in the other night
before him is a bottle of j b a paper bucket filled with melting ice
the other men rise when george walks into the room
lester glass in hand stares silently at george
to the other two wait outside would you
the two men walk toward george and pass him on either side coming very close
both of them are much bigger than george
they stare through george as they pass him
george continues to stand there
lester drinking continues to stare
lester glances idly around the living room
then back to george
you live like a pig
lester doesnt answer how long have you been here
looking it all night
who are those guys
what do they look like
are you unhappy with me about something
yeah im unhappy with you about something
now wait a minute
i said sit down
one of the men opens the door and peers through the screen
everything all right
ill call you its okay
george site down
lester has risen to his feet a little unsteadily
now george i want to hear it from you
either you admit it man to man to my face or ill have him pound it out of you and he does a hell of a job believe me
i believe you
lester waits standing over george
i wanna hear about it
oh jesus christ
lester slaps him
i wanna hear about it george
hey have em put me away or whatever youre gonna do okay
im too tired to lie im too tired to tell the truth
im too tired for anything

i wanna know your thinking i wanna know how someone like you thinks

thats got nothing to do with it
youre so beyond my comprehension i cant even discuss it with you
just have em beat me up or whatever youre gonna do

lester freshens his drink

lester has listened to this with some alteration of his intensity
yes i follow your thinking on that

lester goes to pour himself another drink
to george want a drink

lester gets up and goes to the kitchen
you dont have a clean glass in the house
talking to himself ill have to wash one out
he turns on the faucet in the kitchen
he brings the glass
jesus what a way to live
i never lived like this not even when i was your age not even when i never had a dime
george takes the drink
lester just shakes his head
hell of a way to treat a business partner thats all i can say
hey you were never going to give me the money

lester sits and stares into his drink
i tell you you never know

george looks at him

lester shakes his head

he opens the door and goes out
the two hoods are standing there

george looks shocked
lester laughs gives george a playful punch
just having a little fun george
to hoods go on home

norman is by the front desk

norman from upstairs shouts down

george starts to say something but hes tired
he goes to his corner slams his jacket down
temper temper george
george fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses knocks over one where the top was not on and the shampoo spills all over the table top and starts to drip
on the floor
oh jesus that fucking goddam mary he starts to look for a rag and sees that mary wearing a cloth coat is coming into the shop
get over here
mary moves very slowly george waits hands on hips
it should almost be a little faggy his petulance as if inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him
mary where were you yesterday
mary doesnt answer
you ran out on me and you left it like a goddamn pig pen
whats wrong mary are you drunk
look ive had a rough night one of the roughest ive ever had now im not in the mood for any sulking bullshit whats wrong

she points to his picture on the wall
my son otis
he was killed in vietnam

its suddenly very quiet
the sound of the shampoo dripping on the floor can be heard
mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on georges shoulder
you shouldnt talk to me like that no matter what george

you shouldnt do me like that
hugging her please please forgive me
crying you know better
after a moment why did you come in today
left my bag didnt have no money
how did you get here
took a bus
cmon ill get you home
on his cycle drives up bowmont into jackies driveway
her car is there
george jumps off his bike fairly races to the door
its open and he barges in
hes met by jackies yorkies who bark furiously jumping up and down nipping his pantlegs for attention
just a minute youre early jackie comes walking out
shes carrying a large cooking spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit a pantsuit
shes wearing more makeup than usual
she stops when she sees george
good afternoon youve got to leave
george is not prepared for this
ive got to leave
yes honey youve got to get out of here
lesters on his way
george stares at her then walks past her into the living room
bags are packed a coat thrown over them
the wire kennel carrying cages for the yorkies are beside the bags
george looks into the kitchen where jackies been cooking some pasta
where are you going
please well have to talk later look about last night exasperated but not unkind forget about last night its okay well talk when i get back its not okay i
mean weve got to talk now
where are you going
look either you leave or i leave because i dont want the two of us here when lester arrives
i just dont the level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty decibels
theres the sound of a car outside
my god thats him george looks out the window
thats it then im leaving
with that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes out the door
george starts after her
the dry cleaner comes to the door stopping george
george has to fumble with jackies cleaning and keep the dogs contained
he does tosses the cleaning down and races outside to his bike
he sees jackies car rounding the corner going up the hill winding around the curves
george guns his bike and takes off after her
almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn
jackies on the curve above him
catches up with her pulls even to her
pull over pull over
he threatens to run her into the curb
she stops the car sharply and jumps out
theyve reached a cul de sac where theres a parched view lot not built on
yellow october weeds cover it and theres a huge television antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon wind
jackie has run onto the lot then slows to a walk
she grabs one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas stares down below her
her house can be seen from this angle the malones truck just pulling away
george comes up to her
looking below her youre going to kill me
no turning to him imploring well then what are you trying to do i want to marry you
i want to take care of you and i want your children and i want you to be my girl
thats all i want
thats all i want out of my life and its a lot
she stares at him in disbelief
she actually clutches her stomach
look i dont know if ill ever make it
i mean im a fuckup but ill take care of you ill make you happy i swear to god i will
jackie doesnt answer
she slowly sinks to the ground
george sinks beside her
her eyes are wet
answer me for gods sake answer me
if you knew how many times i wanted to hear you say that
so im saying it
its too late
whats too late about it
look were not dead are we
thats the only thing thats too late
lesters left felicia
hes taking me to acapulco on the five oclock flight
hes asked me to marry him
you dont love him do you
whats that supposed to mean
i dont know
george now is very near tears himself
what he says now he has to force out of himself as if its the biggest secret he holds
i dont trust
george lets his head fall on her shoulder
shes kneeling supported by the television aerial and george cries quietly on her shoulder
she has her arm around him
oh my baby
as shes holding george and looking down the hill lesters silver rolls pulls up
lester gets out of the car goes to the front door
god theres lester
dont go jackie
i cant just let him stand by the door
dont leave me
ive got to
ive got to tell him where i am
i dont know ive got to
she gets up and hurries over to her car starts it and goes back down the hill
george sits under the television aerial and watches her car go down the hill periodically flashing finally she pulls up while lester is pacing back and forth
she hurries to him
he taxes her by the shoulders
they talk for a moment
the discussion looks like jackie is giving lester directions
she glances uneasily up toward george
george is watching them
he sees that lester and jackie have their backs to him his arm around her shoulder hers around his waist
theyre going through the front door
