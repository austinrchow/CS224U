cinema paradiso by giuseppe tornatore by giuseppe tornatore shooting script the october sun slashes through the gray clouds cuts across the shadow towards the sea along the coast where the
new suburbs of the city of giancaldo have been built up
bright light streams through the windows glancing off the white walls in an almost blinding reflection
maria a woman a little over sixty is trying to find somebody on the phone
salvatore thats right salvatore

if he were to find out we hadnt told him hed be angry
she takes off her glasses
could i please speak to mr
salvatore di vita
im his mother
its late but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown
inside a high powered car a man around fifty is driving
it is salvatore dl vita
elegant just growing gray a handsome face creased by deep wrinkles
his weary expression hides the determined sell assured manner of the successful self made man
he must be a heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his cigarette
he stops at a red light
he stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the window as a little fiat uno pulls up alongside
a rock tune plays full blast on the radio
salvatore turns instinctively to have a look at the man at the wheel a boy with a brush cut standing straight in the latest fashion
he studies the boys expression with almost exaggerated attention but devoid of curiosity coldly
the girl sitting beside him lots of curly hair overripe red lips returns salvatore look provocatively
the boy notices turns to salvatore in a surly voice hey
what the fuck you looking at
the fiat uno shoots off leaving a trail of music in its wake
the apartment is luxurious tastefully furnished
there is no one waiting for salvatore
through the picture window on the terrace the city can be seen slumbering in the night
salvatore gets undressed on his way to the bedroom
he moves quietly as if to make no noise
he doesnt even turn on the light finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window
a rustling sound a movement on the bed the voice of a woman waking up
but what time is it
she turns on the bedside light
it is clara a young woman around thirty
salvatore climbs in beside her under the covers kisses her sweetly then in a whisper
its late clara
sorry but i wasnt able to let you know i wouldnt be corning
he fondles her but he is tired feels like sleeping
go to sleep now
he turns over on the other side
clara shuts her eyes is about to drop off but whispers
your mother phoned
she took me for somebody else
surprised and whatd you tell her
i played dumb so as not to disappoint her
we had a nice little talk
she says you never go see her and when she wants to see you she has to come to rome
is it true
salvatore doesnt answer
god only knows how often hes heard that question before
she phoned just to say that
she reaches out to switch of the light buries her head into the pillow
she said a certain alfredo had died
and the funerals taking place tomorrow afternoon
a strange look suddenly comes into salvatores eyes
the idea of going to sleep has clearly left him
its a piece of news he didnt expect
thats taken him off guard
clara would like to carry on the conversation but sleepiness makes it almost impossible
an she can manage is one last question in a faint little voice who is it
a relative of yours
go to sleep
she falls asleep in the dead silence of the night
salvatore is seized by a sort of chill a deep troubled feeling
he gazes through the window al the city with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness suddenly shrouded in a heavy curtain of rain
but he gazes off beyond the row of houses beyond the dark sky the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless memories drawing forth from
the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he thought had vanished been wiped out and instead now re emerges comes back to life takes on light superimposing itself on the mellow middle aged features of his face in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm until another image is formed an ancient remote image
an image from over forty years before
in the baroque church of giancaldo
salvatore is nine years old
dressed as an altar boy he is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands
the congregation is also kneeling
the priest is consecrating the host
little salvatore has just got out of bed is still half asleep yawns and doesnt notice that the priest is standing there with the host in the air glaring at
him as if trying to tell him something
salvatore finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the withering look of the priest
he gets the message at once and rings the bell
now the priest can carry on lifts the chalice and the bell is heard again
cut to the service is over
the priest is in the sacristy removing his vestments
and salvatore is also there removing his altar boy tunic
but how can i make you understand
without the bell i just cant go on
always half asleep you are
what do you do at night anyway
eat instead of sleep
father at my house we dont even eat at noon
thats why im always sleepy
thats what the vet says
the priest has finished disrobing
he takes the bell salvatore was holding during the service and turns to leave
all right toto get moving ive got things to do
say hello to your mother
interrupting him and dont ask if you can come
because you cant
shoo shoo off with you
salvatore gives a shrug and leaves
the priest goes down a corridor opens a door another corridor and finally a door leading to an outside courtyard
he cuts across it and disappears into another door
the priest enters a movie house
not very big seats on the main floor and another seventy in the balcony
along the walls posters of films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures
in one corner a statue of the virgin mary with flowers
the cleaning lady has finished work and is leaving
up in the balcony over the last row of seats are the holes of the projection booth
the middle hole is camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion all in plaster and the lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth
there are two smaller holes through which the figure of a man can be made out appearing and disappearing
it is alfredo the projectionist
he is around forty skinny and bony with a tough peasant face
he has finished loading the projector and is checking the carbons in the arc lamp
then he removes the glass from one of the holes and looks down into the theatre at the priest who waves his hand
ok alfredo you can start
he sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre
up in the booth alfredo lights the arc lamp and sets the projector going
down in the theatre the light goes off and out of the lions mouth streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen
string music sweet and ominous spreads through the theatre
on the screen appear the credit titles of an american film of the s
the priest screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on the arm of his seat
at the back of the theatre behind the last row a curtain moves opens a crack and salvatores gaunt little face appears
he has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a word spellbound watching the movie on the glowing screen
the credit titles have long come and gone
the story is at a turning point
up above in the hole of the booth next to the lion alfredo watches the film but his eyes keep looking down at the priest who is now drumming the
bell with his fingers
on the screen the male and female lead two hollywood stars are in close up the dialogue is passionate romantic
salvatore carried away by those faces by the way they talk by the beauty of the woman slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he is sitting on
the floor his eyes glued to the screen
the love scene reaches a climax the music crescendos and the love struck couple finally fall into each others arms and kiss
instinctively the priest raises the bell into the air as in some age old ceremony and gives it a loud ring
up in the booth alfredo hears the bell its the signal hes been waiting for
he takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that specific scene as it winds on
to the reel
the projection continues
and also the kiss of the two actors
the priests nervous look lingers on those black and white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last declaration of love before separating
salvatore is wide eyed hes probably never seen a man and woman kiss before its a vision that for him has all the attraction of forbidden fruit the horror of
the screen is now filled with the figure of a woman getting undressed showing for one instant the white voluptuous flesh of her broad naked shoulders
salvatore stares in open mouthed wonder
the priest in a fury grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth
from the sound of the bell to another sound
the tolling of the bell tower rings out over the square
it is noon
the vast square pale and dusty is alive with people
a noisy line of men women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water
peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries
people come and go in front of the town hall
the working mens club is deserted
the entrance of the cinema paradiso is shut
hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been seen on screen
up above the windows of the projection booth are open
the hum of the projector can be heard and the loud lofty music typical of the end
then dead silence
the showing is over
despite the speed numerous white streaks spin around on the reel created by the slips of paper alfredo has inserted into the loops
he is rewinding the film by hand on the film winder
when hes not talking alfredo usually sings to himself
salvatore stands beside him taking in everything he does with those quick thieving eyes of his harshly shouting you must not come here
how many times do i have to tell you
and he slows down the reels with his hand
the slips of paper are about to arrive
heres the first
if the film catches fire runt that you are youd go up in a burst of flame
and turn into a piece of
overlapping him and turn into a piece of charcoal
hes used to his terrorisms pays no more attention
not even his grim look scares him
anyway alfredo catches the joke starts to give him a slap but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors
angrily christ thats a sassy little tongue youve got
watch out or someday ill snip it off
and he snips a piece of film pastes the ends together and goes on turning the handle
salvatore picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look
he sees a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman
can i have it
alfredo snatches it out of his hand furiously at the end of his string
are you deaf or something
ive got to put this back in when we wind up the film again
youre a real pain in the neck
salvatore reaches into a basket full of strips of film
he takes out a handful all kisses that have been cut
then why didnt you put these back when you wound up the films again
alfredo is caught out
he stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck in and cuts the scene cause sometimes you cant find the right place any more and so
they stay here
finding an excuse besides there are more kisses than you can count
excited so i can have these
alfredo explodes flies off the handle
he grabs salvatore by the shoulders and shakes him
before i kick your ass all the way to china and back lets make a deal
these strips here are yours i give them to you
one youre not to stick your nose in here any more
two ill keep them for you because you cant take them home for god forbid and save our souls if they catch fire all hell will break loose
and now scram
he takes him and turns him towards the stairs
for him the matter is closed
he returns to the film winder
salvatore sneaks back and while alfredos attention is elsewhere snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter stuffs them into his pocket and
what sort of deal is this
the strips are mine
so why cant i come see them
and he stares at alfredo with a sly saucy look
alfredo clutches his hand darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass
he shrieks get out
and dont show your face here again
and before the kick reaches its destination salvatore has already dashed off down the spiral staircase
that was not the first theft of film strips
salvatores hand reaches into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film
he takes out a few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp
gazes at the figures that remind him of the films seen at cinema paradiso and in a whisper mangles fragments of dialogue the shooting of guns the musical climaxes
shoot first think later
this is no job for weaklings
the house has no lights is gloomy and cold
salvatores mother maria is leaning on the table in front of him
she is young around thirty and her pretty face is haggard marred by all the sacrifices
she is sewing some clothes is a seamstress
lia his four year old sister is sleeping on a cot in one corner
the kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on the wall figures of prairies gunslingers thugs
salvatores voice changes turns even tougher
hey there you lousy bastard take your hands off that gold you black hearted pig stay away from me or ill smash your face in
in the heap of movie frames there are also several photographs
salvatore picks them up
a man in an army uniform
then the same man with a girl beside him whose smiling face can be recognized as maria
salvatore takes a closer look at the mans face then whispers to his mother ma if the wars over how come daddys never come back
maria looks up at him with a sweet smile
hell be back hell be back
one of these days
but there is not much conviction written on her face
she looks back down at her sewing
salvatore goes on looking at the photos
i dont remember him any morema wheres russia
it takes years to get there
and years to come back
now go to bed toto its late
salvatore puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box under lias cot near the charcoal burner
a noisy crowd of little children in black smocks white collars and blue bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm trees
the boys head for one door the girls towards the opposite one
the janitors line them up two by two ready to enter
here and there parents and relatives accompany the younger ones
beneath one of the palms salvatore pulls off the altar boy tunic stuffs it into the khaki colored cardboard schoolbag takes out the smock and puts it on as one
of his schoolmates passes by
it is masino and hes crying desperately because he doesnt want to go to school
his father drags him along yelling you can fool your mother but not me
get yourself a damn diploma and become a policeman
you good for nothing
i dont want to go to school the sound of the bell
the black lines move up the steps towards the school
salvatore is sitting at the front row desk next to peppino a little freckle faced boy
his attention like that of the whole class is concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard
the teacher is standing there watching a plump little boy shy and not quite all there do a two figure multiplication it is nicola scorsone known as cola
he is red in the face has one purple ear and one white one
he stares in terror at that x written on the blackboard
the teacher yells waving a birch rod in her hand
five times five equals
cola stops to think a moment then
the teacher grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers on the blackboard
a large thud echoes through the room followed by a roar of laughter
the teacher slams her rod on the desk
then to cola the five times table
one times five five
the class repeats with the teacher in a sing song chorus teacher and class two times five ten
three times five fifteen
four times five twenty
with a wave of the rod the teacher silences the class and finishes the sing song with the fateful question
five times five
another blow of the head on the blackboard
slapping of the rod on the desk
salvatore secretly shows cola the picture of a christmas tree on one page of the book and mouths the word twenty five
cola smiles he has finally caught on
im asking you for the last time blockhead
five times five equals
cola turns to her with smiling eyes and answers blissfully christmas
salvatore clutches his head in anger watches the teacher flogging cola on the back with the rod
cola screams at every blow and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder
salvatore stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically
but he is not thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling but is drawn rather by that strange regular beat finds it similar to another regular beat that of
the rolling pin alfredo uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just been unloaded
salvatore carefully watches alfredo every move
he is not in the projection booth but up in the balcony standing on top of the last row of seats
he peers through the hole next to the lions head
his bright little eyes fix in his mind the things alfredo does as he loads the film into the projector shuts the fireproof housings turns on the amplifier checks the
carbons in the arc lamp then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre and finds himself face to face with salvatore
sternly what are you doing here
i bought a ticket
ive come to see the film
meanwhile the usher comes up behind him and grabs him by the collar and he almost jumps out of his skin
yelling go sit downstairs
you good for nothing sponger
to the audience worse than rabbits they are
salvatore has run downstairs
the main floor is more crowded than the balcony like every sunday and there is a greatdin
the boy selling ice cream soda pop and candy shouts and runs around like a chicken with its head off
now the lights dim the hubbub dies down and the performance starts
before the film there is a preview for stagecoach
the screen fills with images ofjohn wayne the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile indians etc
salvatore is sitting in the front rows right under the screen next to boccia cola masino peppino and other kids all with their noses in the air
boccia the biggest show off of the group is smoking a cigarette
an old man appears through the entrance curtain takes a couple of steps and shouts hello everybody
at once ssssssh
cant i say hello
its a double feature today
i couldnt care less
i come here to sleep
all at once a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre
up on the screen a globe of the world appears spinning among the stars the logo announcing the newsreel
hooting and whistling for christs sake
cut it alfredoooo
the children in the front rows also yell but salvatore goes on being alert
he turns and looks up at the holes of the projection booth as if it were an impregnable fortress
he watches the crazy dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a cone
and besides that lions head mysterious almost gruesome emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies
in his dreamy eyes that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar
salvatore has a frightened look
another lion roaring
but up on the screen
the mgm lion
the throng of children imitate the famous growl all together shaking their heads in unison
the film starts it is viscontis la terra trema
salvatore is in bliss
his wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light
the title music
another old man enters at the back of the theatre but before sitting down says hello in a loud voice
greetings to one and all
sssssh drop dead
hey kids were here to see the film
now there is an important sequence
the audience is silent
concentrated on the screen
boccia passes the lighted cigarette to salvatore
he takes a puff and hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen
the beautiful star of the film appears on screen
a different kind of attention takes hold of the excited audience
salvatore and the others stare at her with open mouths
she leans towards the leading man a languid expression their profiles touch
but all at once just at the best part there is a sudden jolt
the kiss isnt seen
what a shame
ive been going to the movies for twenty years and i never saw a kiss
salvatore is the only one to laugh to himself
he knows what has happened
and when will we see one
up in the balcony the audience is more sedate
the tickets cost more and the people are richer more refined
among them a man with a moustache the look of a public notary is sitting right in front of the railing
seriously without batting an eye he spits down below with contempt
right on the dot a voice is heard followed by a chorus of protests
voice and audience bugger
the bell tower rings midnight
the square is nearly deserted
except for a landowner near the refreshment stand with a moustache and a hat don vincenzo by name who is picking out from a group of labourers the men hell
be needing in the country at dawn
he chooses points his finger calls
people come out of the movie house after the last showing
the usher locks the front door as alfredo climbs down from the projection booth
among the crowd there is only one kid salvatore
tired half asleep
hes seen all the showings
he starts to walk away when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner wrapped in an old coat
shes waiting for him in a temper
salvatore drops his eyes to the ground mortified
he knows whats coming
he goes over to her timidly uncertain gives her a questioning look
ive been looking for you all day
did you buy the milk
then wheres the money
somebody stole it
maria gives him a slap
salvatore holds back the sobs but his eyes brim with tears
alfredo and the usher are nearby have heard everything
whatd you do with the money
go to the movies
salvatore nods his head and the sobs increase
maria in despair flies off the handle slaps him again but looks as if she doesnt really want to as if deep down she forgives her sons escapade
alfredo catches on speaks up on behalf of signora maria dont do that
hes just a kid
to salvatore and why are you telling fibs
to maria we let him in free
he must have lost the money inside the movie theatre
salvatore stares at him in amazement goes on listening to him
how much did you have
maria wipes away his tears
to the usher what you find tonight on the floor between the seats
the usher reaches into his pockets pulls out some odds and ends
a comb two heel savers a box of tobacco
alfredo very skillfully reaches out with fifty lire he has taken from his pocket
and like a magician he draws the money out of the ushers hand
and fifty lire
to maria see
he hands over the money under the ushers astonished eyes
thanks uncle alfredo
she walks away dragging salvatore by the hand
alfredo gives him a wink
salvatore smiles and winks back but hes not very good at it he cant manage to shut only one eye
everybody leaves and the square empties as the village idiot comes up to the group of labourers beside don vincenzo motioning them all to get moving
ive got to shut down the square
the squares mine
the squares mine
salvatore dressed as an altar boy walks alongside the priest who is wearing the ceremonial vestments
they are tired have walked a long way
behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little white coffin and a bunch of flowers
behind that a little procession the parents and relatives of the dead child
the road is very wide covered with white earth
the spring sun is dazzling
the funeral procession kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy like a dream rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea
the procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery
alfredo working in the fields takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by
cut to the funeral is over
the priest and salvatore are walking back to the village
alfredo appears out of the countryside on e bicycle with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket
he comes pedaling up beside them
good morning father
its hard on the feet huh
getting theres downhill and all the saints help you
but coming back
the saints stand there watching you thats all
gods will be done
salvatore is about to open his mouth wants to say something to alfredo but he doesnt have time
alfredo pedals harder and rides off
salvatore is crestfallen
he looks et the priest then at the bicycle riding away
his eyes light up an idea
he suddenly yells ouch
i cant walk
throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him
the priest leans over in alarm
up ahead in the distance alfredo turns around to look
cut to there is a smile on salvatores face
he is riding on the crossbar of alfredos bicycle
on their way back lo the village
alfredo did you know my father
of course i knew your father
he was tall thin pleasant and had a moustache like mine
he looked like clark gable
theres something salvatore wants to talk about but he doesnt know how to start
he has a try with an innocent stratagem
alfredo now that im older im not saying i can start coming to the projection booth to the movie house
maybe why dont we become friends
alfredo knows exactly what the little rascal is up to and answers in a strange theatrical tone as if he were repeating something he knows by heart a remark taken
from some old film
i choose my friends for their looks and my enemies for their brains
laughs youre too smart to be my friend
besides as i always tell my kids be careful to pick the right friends
surprised but you dont have any kids
spluttering all right all right
when ive got kids thats what im telling them
the outlying houses of giancaldo finally heave into sight
lia salvatores kid sister is crying outside the front door terror stricken
her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half scorched and soaking wet
maria is distraught damp with sweat and tries to console her hugging her in her arms
the fire is out
thatll do thatll do
alfredo and salvatore come up behind them
salvatore has barely leapt off the bicycle when his mother sails into him like a fury shrieking miserable boy
youre the ruin of me
your sister would have been burnt alive if i hadnt been there
and all your fault
salvatore darts off chased by his mother swift as a deer
alfredo doesnt understand what has happened leans over lia who goes on bawling her eyes out and sees on the ground in the middle of the water a flowery box
all charred and still smoking and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and several singed photographs the photos of salvatore s father
alfredo gets the message now looks up at maria who has caught salvatore and is dragging him home hitting and slapping him all the way
salvatore covers his head with his hands to stave off the blows
maria turns to alfredo in a stern indignant voice
but arent you ashamed of yourself uncle alfredo playing with a little boy at your age
whats it got to do with me
and who gave him all those films
promise you wont give him any more of this trash
dont let him set foot any more in the movie house
the boys crazy
all he talks about is movies and alfredo alfredo and movies
alfredo is crestfallen didnt think that salvatores craziness his morbid passion for movies could go this far
i give you my word donna maria
maria now turns one last time to her son
gods got to grant me one wish
send your father back home
and hell see you get whats coming to you
salvatore lowers his hands looks at her and with the dreadful sincerity of children daddys not coming back
an icy flash runs through marias eyes
its not true
its not true
ill show you hes coming back
and she beats him desperately as if to enforce her stubborn hope slap after slap
this time alfredo doesnt step in lets maria give vent to her rage and fury but salvatores cries make him feel guilty
a crowd of men has gathered in the square around the cafe where there is a loudspeaker
they are listening to the running commentary of the soccer games
they check their sisal pools coupons
nicolo carosios voice were at the seventh minute of the second half
turin is leading one to zero
the goal was scored by
the scene is seen from above by alfredo who peers out of the window of the projection booth
carosios voice drowns out the soundtrack of the film being shown
alfredo is bored
he goes over to the projector looks through the hole
its the last sequence of the film
the music swells to a climax as the end appears on the screen
swift as ever alfredo turns on the lights in the theatre stops the projector
looks back through the hole to see
the house packed to the rafters
voices and laughter of the children
smoke ice cream soft drinks
the usher has opened the emergency exits to let in air
he fights off the gate crashers who are trying to get in free
the sound of the sports commentary fills the theatre
the village blacksmith is sleeping in his seat his head thrown back and his mouth wide open
the kids blow up the empty ice cream sacks and pop them next to his ears
the blacksmith wakes up with a start in a sea of laughter
he yells ah
ill wring all your necks
or my good name means nothing
salvatore doesnt laugh
he is sad
he turns and looks up at the projection booth
he sees alfredo through the lions mouth
alfredo also catches sight of him
salvatore gives him a timid wave of the hand as if asking if he can come up a moment
the look on alfredos face is unmistakable irrevocable n
salvatores not surprised after what happened it wont be easy to win him over
yet there must be some way
but what is it
as usual salvatore is smart as the devil when hes out to get something
through the emergency exit he sees a woman pass by with a packet in her hand
it is alfredos wife and the packet is his supper
salvatore leaps to his feet and runs out to her
alfredo starts up the projector
its time for the documentaries and cartoons
salvatore peers in from the top of the stairs
hes scared of alfredos reaction but pricks up his courage and shows him the packet
alfredo sees him is about to pounce on him
on the defensive your wife told me to bring you this
his expression betrays the put on
alfredo sighs realizes its another one of his little games
sternly give it to me
he takes the packet unwraps it and lifts the lid shuts it again and puts the container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm
salvatore hasnt missed a single gesture but speaks with his eyes to the poor
i told my mother you werent the one who gave me the films
that it wasnt your fault
but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me
now that i know i wont steal any more from you
thats all i wanted to say
he turns to leave but alfredo takes him by the shoulder and stops him
toto come here
all things considered there is something in that little boy maybe his feverish passion that strikes him
hell talk to him seriously without resorting to terrorism try to convince him
he lowers the volume of the monitor sits down on the stool
salvatore raises his eyes from the floor and looks at him at last
now listen to what ive got to say
i took up this profession when i was ten years old
in those days there werent these modern machines
the films were silent
the projectors were run by hand like this with a crank
and you wound the crank all day long
it was really rough going
if you got tired and slowed down boom
everything would go up in flames
then why dont you want to teach it to me too
now that theres no more cranking and its easier
firmly because i dont want to toto
this is not a job for you
its like being a slave
youre always alone
you see the same film over and over again because you have nothing else to do
and you start talking to greta garbo and tyrone power like a nut
you work on holidays on christmas on easter
only on good friday are you free
but if they hadnt put jesus christ on a cross
youd work good fridays too
then why dont you change jobs
alfredo sighs irritated
he reaches out to turn the knob of the carbon rods
he gazes at salvatore as if he were a grown up somebody whos making things hard for him
because im an idiot
how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist
only a jerk like me could do it
besides i wasnt lucky
when i was a kid there was the war
when i grew up another war
now its all different
times have changed
and you want to be a dope like me
good for you toto
good for you
im only saying this for your own good
he gets up and speaking all the while goes into a closet with a bucket in it the toilet of the booth
he turns his back and pees
cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter
you breathe in smoke gas fumes and earn practically nothing
salvatore listens to him but taking advantage of the fact he cant be seen he turns the knob of the carbon rods just as he had seen done a moment
in a loud voice but dont you like anything about what you do
salvatore gazes at the photos on the wall keaton garbo snow white
alfredo smiles to himself
sure theres something about that damn job he likes with time
you get used to it
besides when you hear from up here that theres a full house and that people are laughing having fun
then youre happy too
alfredo is lost in thought doesnt notice that the documentaries and cartoons have finished
the screen is blank
and down in the theatre laughter is not heard but an uproar of whistling and swearing
salvatores eyes sparkle he seizes the opportunity
he turns on the lights and stops the projector just as alfredo would have done
at which alfredo buttons up his pants in a hurry and rushes over alarmed but sees that everything is in order
salvatore looks at him all smiles as if he expected a medal for civil bravery
instead alfredo reacts like a wild animal
so ive been wasting my breath
you pretend to agree with me but as soon as my back is turned you do what you want
he gives salvatore a kick in the ass shrieking get out of here
i dont want to lay eyes on you again
this is the last straw
your mothers right youre crazy
he pushes him towards the stairs
salvatore suddenly vanishes scared out of his wits
alfredo talks to himself in a fury but howd he do it
the little bastard
by watching hes learned
he peers out of the window yelling as he sees salvatore running through the square
im letting the box office know youre not to set foot even into the theatre
there are no more tickets for you
and im also talking to father adelfio
you wont be an altar boy any more either
you little runt
salvatore looks at him
yells something offensive alfredo go fuck yourself
but his words are drowned out by the sudden shouting of the people outside the cafe
holy mother of god
a man in the crowd crumples to the ground
the others swarm around him alarmed
they hold up his head
his face is pale
they check the coupon he is clutching in his hand
a voice rises like a siren from the crowd
ciccio spaccaficos won the sisal
the yell can be heard
inside the movie house
the audience murmurs
somebody opens an emergency exit
the neapolitans won the lottery
lets go see kids
northerners are always lucky
the whole audience leaps up and heads for the exit
laughing and joking
summer has come
the village has a different look
the peddlers sing their monotonous refrains in the village streets
in one street women are busy canning tomatoes
in one corner of the square the shearer has finished clipping the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare chested urchins with nothing on but
then another man disinfects them by spraying them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country
the urchins laugh
the bill poster is hanging up the posters of a new film today at cinema the fifth grade exams
in the vast dining hall all the children are seated one for each desk under the watchful eyes of the teachers
salvatore boccia peppino masino and cola have taken places here and there as nervous as everybody else
the examining board member is dictating the text of the arithmetic problem
a merchant owns two stores
in the first he sells fruit and vegetables
in the second he sells nails and cement
the principal comes in interrupts the dictation
excuse me professor
here are the men taking the exam for the elementary school certificate
turning to the door come in please
all the children turn to look
a man around thirty enters ill at ease
the children recognize him and laugh mischievously
the second is the blacksmith the one who falls asleep at the movies
the third is a twenty year old boy angelo
the fourth is alfredo embarrassed and red in the face
salvatore is speechless
gives a slightly ironic laugh
there is a look of revenge in his shrewd little eyes
cut to the assignment is now being carried out
there is dead silence in the hall
teachers and the principal moue about checking to be sure there are no notes being handed around or other forms of collaboration
the four outsiders are having a hard time
it can be seen on their faces
alfredo is also in trouble doesnt know how to solve the problem the calculations are too diff cult
he looks at the desk next to him where salvatore is sitting
salvatore is about to look up at him but alfredo immediately looks away too proud to let himself be seen
the exchange of glances continues grotesque almost comical
salvatore meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly
alfredo cant stand it any longer is nervous beaded with sweat
hes sorry he ever showed up
salvatore laughs up his sleeve now he has the upper hand
alfredo tries sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something
but salvatore turns his back hiding it from sight
alfredo tries sneaking a look at somebody elses exercise book but the damn kid also covers it
it looks like a conspiracy against him
alfredo has no way out
he has to accept the idea of eating humble pie
he looks at salvatore motions him with his eyes in a conversation of glances
he asks for help but salvatore stands firm implacable
alfredo tries to put it into words in a low voice
tell me how to solve this fucking problem
silence back there
alfredo insists with his eyes
salvatore makes him understand with gestures that he could help him maybe but
on one condition
he imitates the gesture of winding the crank of the projector
alfredo gets the message
its pure blackmail
he rubs his hand over his sweating face raises his eyes to the ceiling as if he were swearing
then he surrenders accepts the condition
salvatore is serious does not flaunt his victory but you can tell he is happy
he takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared with the solution to the problem rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the teacher
passes by takes aim and flicks it to him
alfredos hand catches the precious and dearly bought message in mid air
their quarrel is over
a bright lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick blurred images as in a dance the images of alfredo teaching salvatore all the secrets of the projectionist trade
alfredo slips the reel on to the projector unrolls the trailer and hands it to salvatore
salvatore mounts the film on the sprockets
now salvatore sets the projector into motion opens the shutter and stands on tip toe to see the screen from the hole
a shot from in nome della legge
the main floor audience applauds a line spoken by massimo gironi
and from the balcony the same little man with the face of a public notary spits below
alfredo shows salvatore the running of the film
he points to a place on the projector
this is where it can easily catch fire
if it happens the first thing youve got to do is break it off here and here so the whole reel doesnt go up in fames
on the screen a shot from riso amaro
unrelenting the priest rings his bell
salvatore licks the film on one side then on the other
you understand which side the gelatins on
it tastes wonderful
a shot of amedeo nazzari in la figlia del capitano
a jump an out of rack frame
the audience whistles
wake up alfredo
salvatore tries to do a hand binding
alfredo winds the film hangs a slip on a nail in the wall
these are the shipping invoices for the film
they are always to be kept
down on the main floor a scene from dr jekyll and mr hyde
everyone screams and hides their faces when hyde looks at the camera
what a face
one young man angelo doesnt hide his face
he looks up at a young woman rosa in the balcony who turns and smiles at him
alfredo gives salvatore a wooden stool
hes had it made especially for him so he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp
salvatore climbs up on it
he laughs all excited
now you can run it by yourself
salvatore gives another smile
he is posing in a photographers studio
he is all dressed up for first communion holding a white lily
the flash goes off like lightning during a storm
now salvatore is posing next to his mother and little sister
they smile without hugging
another flash of light
the transparency of rita hayworth in her black gown from gilda
masino is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field glasses
other pupils crowd around him in excitement
in a whisper christ what a piece of ass
but there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class on the contrary a strange silence
the pupils are all standing around the teachers desk having received their end of the year report cards
peppino who shared salvatore s desk is saying goodbye to his schoolmates
boccia cola the others
they have serious sad expressions
he and salvatore kiss like grown ups
the teacher is standing among them
one of the schoolmates does not respond lo peppinos goodbye gesture
he takes a few steps back serious scared his eyes lowered
di francesco arent you saying goodbye to your schoolmate
di francesco gives his head a little shake
the teacher leans over to him
di francesco whispers almost into her ear
my father says hes a communist
another farewell scene in the square
peppino to his grandparents
his father and mother are also there saying goodbye to the old folks
there are tears
the cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the black car
the scene is watched by salvatore and alfredo up in the window of the projection booth
they look like old friends
on the sound monitor the strains of some american musical comedy tune
will they really find work in germany
its like an adventure
in a theatrical voice hope springs eternal
peppino from the distance gives one last wave at the window of the projection booth
salvatore waves back
come back sooon
the black car drives off leaving a cloud of dust that envelops the suppressed sobs of the grandparents standing there waving handkerchiefs
salvatore watches the car drive off
he mumbles good thing germanys closer than russia
alfredo rubs his hand through his hair
the lions head with the beam of light seen from the balcony
salvatores face appears in the hole beside it as he peers down at the images of the settimana incom newsreel
the audience is distracted
the snoring of a man sleeping can be heard
a pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands tip toe down the aisle
the sleeping man is the same old blacksmith with his head thrown back
a little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth
the urchins take to their heels
the blacksmith squirms wake up with a start
spits while everybody laughs
the newsreel is now about missing soldiers in russia
the defense minister has announced a new listof names of italian soldiers so far considered missing and now confirmed as dead
families concerned will be notified directly by military authorities
salvatore pays careful attention sees the black and white shots of the last war
the russian campaign
the troops in the snow
now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the corpses
documents clothing glasses photographs
one quick detail catches salvatores eye among those photographs for one instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes
he quickly sticks a slip of paper into the take up reel as when marking the kisses to be cut
the hands of an official tear off several forms and give them to maria who is sitting in front of the desk
she is dressed in black
salvatore stands beside her holding her hand
they have black bands on their arms
an empty stare in their eyes
maria is pale a cold look in her sunken eyes
her heart is bursting in her breast
and a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking
she looks at her husbands belongings identifies them a gold chain an id card and the photograph the one salvatore saw in the newsreel
maria strokes it with her fingers
salvatore comes up and looks as the official concludes unfortunately we dont know what war cemetery hes buried in
this is the form for the pension
if youd like to sign it
maria walks through the city
she holds salvatore by the hand
salvatore looks up trying to catch her eye
he sees her crying in silence
the heartbroken tears of someone who has lost the one last hope but held back so as not to be seen by the child
salvatore presses close and puts his arm around her waist
they turn the corner and walk off in the noisy city disfigured by the ruins of war
a poster for gone with the wind catches salvatores eye
winter has returned
on the screen a sequence from i pompieri di viggiu
the theatre is jam full
the sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes of toto
some people have climbed up on the window sills
the aisles are crammed an the way down to the screen where grown ups and children sit on the floor their noses in the air
some people munch crusts of bread theyve brought along from home
almost everybody is smoking
a woman laughs holding the baby she is nursing
in one corner at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people standing a girl laughs but every now and then her expression reveals a look of deep
her body moves slightly
clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat
they are making love standing there among the crowd which notices nothing and goes on laughing
in the balcony angelo is holding hands with rosa
the curtain over the entrance is open
people are also standing there seeing what they can from the distance even a corner of the screen through the forest of heads
but the line continues on outside
all the way to the entrance of the movie house out in the square
there are crowds of people shivering from the cold who protest shove risk provoking incidents
the priest father adelfio is exhausted tries to calm them down
theres no room
for heavens sake
i cant give another showing its late
father adelfio weve been here for an hour
there are people inside whove seen it twice
it has just stopped raining the bell tower rings eleven oclock
on the poster of the film a last day sticker
the priest the ticket seller the usher and two carabinieres push the crowd back close the front door
the protest grows louder
fists pound the door
the audience in the theatre hears the uproar
be quiet out there
what the hell
from the window of the projection booth alfredo and salvatore look at the crowd down below yelling and complaining
some of the people look up at them
we want to get in
tomorrow youre taking it off
alfredo spreads his arms out as if to say there s nothing he can do
why cant we show the same film tomorrow
its got to be sent to another town
and if we dont the owner of that movie house gets pissed off
the crowd sways nervously
the carabinieres give order
go home all of you
otherwise somebodys going to end up in jail
a mob doesnt think doesnt know what its doing
salvatore gives him a curious inquisitive look
spencer tracy said it in fury
mischievously whatd you say if we let these poor devils see the film toto
salvatore stares at him in amazement all excited
but how can it be done
alfredo turns away from the window
he gives a smirk imitates the tough american movie stars
you dont believe my words but youll have to believe your own eyes
and now get your ass off that damn stool boy
salvatore laughs eagerly as if he were about to see a whole new movie
he climbs off the stool
both of them move towards the projector
trying not to put his hand in front of the lens alfredo removes the frame with the glass that protects the projection
he wheels it around and motions salvatore to look
on the wall behind the projector the film picture appears gradually reflected by the glass moves as the glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over
there it disappears
salvatore can barely believe his eyes as if it were a piece of magic
he takes a quick look through the hole to see if the film is still showing on the screen
mysteriously go to the window boy and have a look
salvatore goes over to the window
the reflected beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the square
its like another screen
except the images are backwards like when you look in a mirror
and here and there are the windows of the houses
for salvatore its a wonderful spectacle like a dream ravishing
alfredo its beautiful
a voice is heard in the crowd of people jammed around the entrance to the movie house
shouting hey look there
all heeds turn to look at the house behind them
oh praise the lord
and everybody runs over to the other side of the square in front of the strange new screen
alfredo and salvatore watch with glittering eyes
salvatore lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal
good for you alfredo
a close up of toto projected on the houses and one of the windows opens
a man appears in his pajamas
dazzled by the light he shades his eyes with his hand
he sees all those people looking at him and laughing together
shut the window
shut the window
go to bed
the man is dazed
doesnt now whats going on
looks around and sees the black and white figures of the film dancing around him
he pops back inside slams the window shut almost cared
to alfredo sound
what do you say should we make them happy
smiling sure sure
alfredo takes the loudspeaker of the monitor rings it over to the window turns it around towards the square
he turns up he volume and the sound track fills the square
a chorus of approval
looking at salvatore do you want to go down there
salvatore gives a contented nod
salvatore runs on
alfredo looks wistfully towards the huge image in the square
down in the square salvatore heads for the crowd his eyes trained on the house front screen
behind him the door of the movie house opens
the priest father adelfio sees the film being projected on the house front the people standing or sitting on the ground laughing
his eyes nearly pop out of his head
then he motions over the ticket seller whispers something into his ear
the ticket seller strides over to the shivering spectators pulls the pad of tickets out of his pocket
ladies and gentlemen
you have to buy tickets
an irresistible chorus of bronx cheers washes over him
salvatore looks around highly amused
the square belongs to everybody
the village idiot peers out of the crowd all worked up
the squares mine
come on kids no joking around here
the crowd roars with laughter
salvatore laughs too as if carried away by it all
and over the general merriment looms the shadow of alfredo standing in the window of the projection booth
all at once on the house front screen the image of toto slows down for an instant a white blister appears and spreads until it fills the whole screen
the crowd gives a start of bewilderment and fear
salvatore jerks his head around to look at the booth
the film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the projector
alfredo is taken off guard
he breaks the film running into the take up reel but is unable to do it for the delivery reel
he grabs the film which is catching fire and pulls it out quickly tries to stop the flames from reaching the reel in the f reproof housing
a desperate race against the speed of the fire
the flames on the floor burn his legs
alfredo gives a jump slows down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run ahead reach the upper housing
its like an explosion
the flames leap out striking him full in the face
alfredo doesnt have time to scream struggles desperately and falls to the floor
meanwhile the flames envelop everything
the flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth
salvatore is appalled elbows his way through the moving crowd
inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard growing louder and louder
a violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lions head into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits
the crowd streaks out of the movie house enveloped in a cloud of black smoke
run for your lives
in the general panic salvatore tries in vain to get inside elbows his way towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth
the audience clashes against him knocks him to the ground almost trampling him underfoot
he is suddenly seized by a superhuman force gets up claws his way desperately ahead with people falling on top of him and to the floor
he finally succeeds starts up the stairs
the place is filled with smoke
the air is suffocating
salvatore streaks up the stairs gasping for breath
the projection booth is enveloped inflames
alfredos body on the floor burning
salvatore moves quickly throws a blanket over his shoulders drags him by the feet over to the stairs as boxes and other objects fall on him
using the same blanket he stamps out the flames that have seared alfredos clothes
with the force of desperation he drags him further down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames
alfredo doesnt move his face is burnt
salvatore looks at him and only now is panic stricken lets out a terrified shriek like a wounded colt
the plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke
the statue of the virgin mary is also in flames
and the movie screen
the fire has been put out
nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton
everything has gone up in smoke
people stand around dismayed
they gather around the priest who is at once grieved and shocked to express their solidarity and comfort
what a pity
what a terrible thing
cheer up father is there something we can do
laughing burnt up
whatll we do now
the town will have to get along without movies
whos got the money to rebuild it
ciccio spaccafico the man who won the sisal pools comes up dressed in style
he looks up at the charred cinema
it looks like a battlefield after an enemy attack
from the smoke and ashes to
the great lighted sign of the cinema paradiso
the movie house has been rebuilt
there are people moving about the entrance
it is the evening of the inauguration
the lobby is crowded with people authorities special guests
there is the mayor father adelfio and the new owner ciccio spaccafico dressed to the teeth
the mayor cuts the ribbon
cheers congratulations don ciccio
the procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre
father adelfio with a nostalgic sigh blesses the lobby then the corridor
lastly the new auditorium which resounds with toasts and cheers
to the cinema paradiso
the priest sprinkles the new seats the walls the screen with holy water
now father adelfio is blessing the brand new projection booth
he also blesses the new projectionist salvatore
he is very nervous but serious self possessed
his worried looking mother is also there for the occasion
the priest turns to spaccafico
howd you solve his being under age
i took out a license as projectionist thanks to friends down at the guild offices
but i dont know a thing about it
officially i do the job
smiling at salvatore but toto earns the money
to salvatore always be careful my boy
dont ever go to sleep
be sure another accident doesnt happen
do everything poor alfredo taught you
and may god bless you
salvatore nods his head seriously assuming a responsible expression
his mother kisses the priests hand
and now enough of this gloomy atmosphere
life goes on
i want to see you happy and smiling
the laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the inauguration film
among the spectators salvatores mother maria and his kid sister el a
up on the screen a man and a woman kiss
the first time a kiss has been seen at the cinema paradiso
the audience murmurs surprised and excited
look at that
christ thats news
an old lady sitting next to the mayor crosses herself flabbergasted
ciccio spaccafico chuckles
rubs his hands these are going to be golden times for him
father adelfio gets up and stalks out of the theatre indignant hell never set foot in the place again
the love theme gets louder and louder
the same music spreads through the booth from the monitor
salvatore is by himself
he is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough the story doesnt absorb him
alfredos absence makes him nervous he gazes at the stool he used to sit on
il has been repainted
a voice from the rear of the cabin toto
salvatore turns and at the top of the stairs sees signora anna and behind her alfredo her husband
he is wearing a pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane
he has lost his sight but not his spirit
he smiles any room for me in this cinema paradiso
salvatore runs over and embraces him
come in alfredo
to salvatore toto will you bring him home when you close down
to alfredo im glad you came
cut to alfredo is now sitting there immobile
he listens to the soundtrack of the film
salvatore studies the way he stares into empty space and the idea of darkness frightens him
there is something new in alfredos manner as if having grazed death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men and life
but now that ive got a job i probably stop going
dont do that
sooner or later youll be left empty handed
what do you mean
toto this isnt for you
for the moment the cinema paradiso needs you and you need the cinema paradiso
but it wont last
some day youll have other things to do more important things
he reaches out and touches salvatores face to feel his expression
thats right more important
i know it
now that ive lost my sight i see more
i see everything i didnt see before
as alfredo moves his hand from salvatores face we see that he is now a young man and that alfredo is older grayer
and its all thanks to you who saved my life
and ill never forget it
salvatore doesnt understand his strange words
alfredo can feel he is troubled
and dont put on that look
i havent gone off my head yet
you want proof
and he gives a joking smile
salvatore is curious expects one of his fiendish tricks
i want proof
for example at this moment the films out of focus
salvatore stands up in disbelief
he looks through the hole and indeed the film is out of focus
he puts it back into focus flabbergasted
smiling its hard to explain toto
as the bill poster attaches to the cafe door a poster of catene the coming attraction at the cinema paradiso ciccio spaccafico is speaking on the phone in the phone
he is clearly peeved
only two days
are you joking
what do i care if all the copies are reserved
catene for only two days in a place like this
why people will eat me alive
standing beside him listening is salvatore
he is carrying school books under his ann
in the cafe several curious onlookers laugh as through the cafe window they watch some unemployed peasant men dancing together at the club
spaccafico listens nervously then shrieks as if he were about to eat the phone
i know i know
but even if i start showing at eight in the morning it wouldnt be enough
this is a big town now and you people at the titanus know it perfectly well
im your sole agent and if i get pissed off ill write straight to lombardo in rome
ill give you guys a good run around
if i get my dander up i can let fly if my names spaccafico
cut to spaccafico and salvatore are now outside the cafe head towards the square
in front of the movie house the charwoman is at work
spaccafico is so nervous he lights two cigarettes without noticing it
salvatore is turning something over in his mind
don ciccio ive got an idea
you remember that old abandoned movie house where theyre supposed to build those low rent houses
so whats that got to do with it
the projectors all rusty but i could fix it in two or three days
give the place a good cleaning put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and well show catene in two houses
shrieking what the fuck you talking about
you getting into the act too toto
titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and i have to say thanks
if i ask for two the least theyll do is cut off my head and play ball with it
a shrewd look glitters in salvatore s eyes
who says we need two copies
the house is jammed with people
almost bursting at the seams
the last scenes of catene move across the screen
tears stream down the faces of the men and women
the children are unusually silent
even the blacksmith is awake indeed whispers ahead of time all the lines of nazzari and yvonne sanson knows them by heart
among the crowd in the balcony there is alfredo and his wife the mayor don vincenzo the landowner the schoolteachers
now the music is loud heart rending
the end appears on screen
the lights go on
and there is a great din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives
the race for empty seats
the carabinieres help the usher maintain order and persuade the people who want to see the film again to get up and leave
exasperate thats enough now
youve seen it ten times
i need the seats
i wish youd all get the galloping runs
through the emergency exits quick
stop the jabbering
the end of the film slips through the sprockets
salvatore switches off the motor
he is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing
and even faster in dropping it into the sack boccia is holding open for him
now get running and bring me the first reel
meanwhile ill start showing the news
boccia speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets
tied to the parcel rack is the sack containing the second part of catene
he now turns off the main street and takes a short cut down a country road
he pedals as fast as he can
until he disappears into the distance beyond the trees
boccia finally reaches the old movie house which has been more or less spruced up
here too people are lined up in front of the posters of catene
ciccio spaccafico is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase
he too is holding a sack containing the first part of the film
the bicycle pulls up in front of him
the sacks are exchanged
give it to me
heres the first part
boccia heads back to the cinema paradiso to take the first part to salvatore
spaccafico dashes up the stairs and hands the sack to a man standing in the door through which the bare projection booth can be seen and the projector which salvatore
has put back into working order
spaccafico yells in excitement
here you are
people are waiting
in fact inside the old freezing cold movie house the audience is grumbling
everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs theyve brought from home and wooden benches
the hum of the projector is heard at last
the lights go down
the grumbling subsides
the words part two appear on screen and then the images of the film
meanwhile boccia pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to the cinema paradiso
now boccia is on his way back to the old movie house
to carry out another exchange of sacks containing the reels of film
another race back to cinema paradiso
boccia starts looking tired his breath is short
and daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown
the last fading light of sundown
boccia is pedalling once more back to the old movie house
with the same sack tied to the parcel rack
he is exhausted
on his last legs
he slows down then stops
the lights are still on
in the thick blanket of smoke the crowd stirs nervously
hey whens it starting
weve got ploughing to do in the morning
toto get a move on
in the booth the projector is turned off
salvatore looks nervously out of the window
at the square
but not a sign of boccia
a carabiniere peers in through one of the holes
what are we going to do toto
the whole place here is up in arms
theyve been waiting more than a half hour
what can i do
here too the audience is up in arms
theyre waiting for part two tostart
ciccio spaccafico tears his hair with rage
wheres the fucking bastard got to
lets get one thing straight don ciccio
im waiting ten minutes more and if you havent started
youre giving me my money back
in chorus well said
we want our money back
what about my showing you the first part again
people shout whistle give bronx cheers
first part my foot
we want to see how the story ends
down in the front row pasquale the man who sells black market cigarettes stands up
ive seen the whole works
you want me to tell you how it ends
a shoe comes flying at him
shut up you jerk
salvatore has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for boccia
he pedals fast turns into the country short cut
looks around not a sign of boccia
by now it is dark
he sees a man in the window of a farmhouse calls out to him
salvatore rides on
now hes in the open country
all of a sudden he seems to hear something
pricks up his ears
its a sort of moan he cant figure out if its an animal or a man
he turns on the flashlight he has brought along
takes a closer look around
catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush
thats where the moan is coming from
he creeps over in alarm
next to the bicycle he now catches sight of the sack with the film
and the moaning gets louder
alarmed boccia whats wrong
he runs over to help his friend
behind the bush he discovers boccia humped up between the legs of teresa a prostitute
he moves with all the fury of his young years
salvatore has never seen people making love before and is speechless
damn you what are you doing
shouting oh christ its so good
and he goes on ramming it home
hey cut it out
with a confused look on his face salvatore picks up the sack and walks away looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more
boccia lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside as salvatore pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees
music and the naked body of brigitte bardot
a row of youngsters on the main floor stare at the naked actress all excited
a regular rhythmic tremor runs through them half hidden by the back of the seats
a scene from a horror film
the frightened faces of the audience
off in one corner the door of the mens toilet opens and a man with a contented look comes out followed by teresa who motions another one to come in
in the projection booth salvatore is eating the meal his mother has brought him
a gangster film
the tense faces of the audience
a gun battle
rounds of machine gunfire in the night
the shots echo through the theatre
a little boy claps his hands over his ears
alternating with the machine gunfire on screen a real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators the landowner don vincenzo who slumps down in his seat without anybody
the shooting continues up on screen
salvatores hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film before the horrified eyes of spaccafico and the usher and the puzzled expression of whatd i tell you
it doesnt catch fire
it always arrives too late
a scene from seven brides for seven brothers
the only empty seat in the theatre is the one where don vincenzo was killed
a flower has been tied to it with string
all the other seats are taken
fade to rosa and angelo are sitting next to each other
they are watching a different film
but she has a baby in her arms they have got married have set up a family
in the balcony the man with the face of a public notary spits down below with a contented look
but this time the main floor takes its revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face
in the morning the theatre is empty
all the doors are shut
light filters in through the open windows up above illuminates the posters of coming attractions and the yellowish screen
off screen a womans voice and a boys voice are heard
off screen come on
laughing dont be scared
off screen is it true that if i bleed ive got to squeeze lemon juice on it
teresas voice off screen a loud laugh lemon juice
thats a new one for you
who tells you this crap
take it easy
you see its not painful is it
slow pan along the walls of the theatre the empty aisles discovers salvatore on the floor between the seats with teresa the prostitute who has already been seen
salvatore is making love for the first time in his life
he is awkward and clumsy
there is an uncertain look in his eyes his livid face is dripping with sweat
there you are
thats right thats right
salvatore is quicker has learned the lesson
teresa goads him on
there now youre a real man
a real calf
salvatores panting slackens into a deep sigh of pleasure
the blade of a knife clutched in a hardened hand
a cry of pain
a calf falls like a dead weight to the ground
salvatore photographs the animal in the throes of death with his mm movie camera
as well as the faces of the men who now bleed and skin it quickly
in the vast slaughter house the voices of the men and animals mingle together
salvatores eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary people
his movie camera is always ready like a hunters rifle
now he is shooting
a meeting in the square the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a speaker who flails his arms around
at school the old schoolmistress sitting at her desk sunk in god knows what dreams her eyes staring off into empty space as a tear runs down her pale unhappy
face and the unknowing students carry out their assignments
at the railroad station the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the platforms
salvatore pans his camera on to two men fighting
but an arriving train comes in between
salvatore follows the train pans along the cars
the train stops
a door opens and the passengers climb out
several traders a carabintere a group of commuting students the ticket collector a distinguished looking couple and lastly a girl who stops in the middle of the viewfinder
salvatore is immediately attracted by her face
he goes on shooting without leaving it a moment
he follows her through the lens
she is very beautiful must be around sixteen a simple sweet face blue eyes
she is certainly the daughter of the distinguished looking couple who got off just before she did
the little family moves off down the platform
salvatore follows the girls movements as if hypnotized
now she passes by him turns towards him for one moment as if trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny looking gadget
salvatore smiles at her entranced
the janitor is ringing the bell
in the courtyard on the other side of the gate the students prepare to enter
salvatore is with a group of schoolmates including boccia
and they all stare wide eyed at the girl from the station
she has her books under her arm and is walking by herself
you know that one there
not bad though
salvatore has the look of somebody seeking for an idea some way of picking up a conversation with her
her father s the new bank director
loaded luxury and easy living
people who jerk off with a shirt so they wont get their hands dirty
all at once boccia and salvatore notice that the girl drops her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school
they fly off swift as arrows
its a chance not to be missed
boccia is the quicker is already in the lead
salvatore gives an angry gesture
a flash come into his eyes the same flash he had as a little boy when he finds the right way to hit home
he picks up his step trips boccia and brings him to the ground
he pounces on him and lets go with his fist
he starts running again
picks the bundle off the ground
catches up with the girl from the station nervous and inexperienced but polite
look you dropped this
and he hands her her lunch with a smile
she recognizes him
i hadnt noticed
she takes the bundle as salvatore touches her hand delicately
my names salvatore
my names elena
salvatore is very flustered
he feels as if all his blood were throbbing in his head
he tries to say something else but the words catch in his throat
the other time at the station
boccia suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away
elena is frightened puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see
salvatore has a black eye swollen shut
he is setting up a little mm projector on a stool
alfredo is sitting in one corner
he has come to keep him company
he listens to the sound track of the movie being shown
chaplins modern times
thats right modern times
ive shown it so many times i know it by heart
the first time i showed it in was the sunday my first wife died
they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house
i only found out that night after the last show
those are things you never forget
changing his tone
so toto how are these home movies going
salvatore has switched on the little projector and a square of light appears on the wall beside alfredo with the scenes shot in town
the shots of the slaughter house have appeared
whispering what is it what is it
whats the picture
its people in the slaughter house killing a calf
theres blood all over the floor like a lake
and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die
alfredo is concentrated as if salvatores description transmitted the real image to him the colours the forms
the railway station has appeared on the wall and the sequence of elena
salvatore does not move does not say a word as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera
alfredo senses something funny in the boys s ence
now what can you see
nothing theres nothing
its all out of focus
smiling is there a woman
tell me the truth
salvatore is shamed uncertain doesnt know whet to say
a tender look filters through alfredos dark glasses
he has obviously caught on and whispers there is a woman
salvatore is forced to admit it with a sigh
yes its a girl i saw at the station
whats she like
whats she like
and as other shots of elena appear on the screen salvatore describes her
as only somebody in love could
slender with long hair brunette
she had big blue eyes a simple expression and a little beauty mark on her lip but really tiny
you can only see it close up
and when she smiles
she makes you feel
only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by passion by the desire to talk about her
alfredo smiles spellbound
what a mystery
salvatore turns off the projector and heaves a deep sigh almost of liberation
alfredos sympathy does him a lot of good
its nice to be understood
he moves over closer to him
alfredo runs his hand through his hair whispers i understand you toto
the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful
whatever you do you cant make friends with them
salvatore is comforted by the way he talks
he didnt think it was possible to put into words the things he has felt since meeting elena
he nods his head
eh theres nothing to be done about it
the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints
and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a one way street
because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
salvatore is touched by his sensitivity by his intense passionate sweet way of speaking
what you say is wonderful
smiling theyre not my words
john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills
salvatore suddenly changes expression as if discovering he was being made fun of
stinking two timer
and they burst out laughing
a grey windy day
it is opening time and the shutters of the movie house are being rolled up
salvatore is about to enter through the small door of the spiral staircase when in the distance he catches sight of
elena crossing a street with her books under her arm
she is alone
salvatore doesnt stop to think twice dashes off runs through streets full of dust another square turns the corner but has lost sight of her
he looks around in all directions there she is
he starts running again
and finally catches up with her all out of breath practically speechless with emotion
why are you running
no particular reason
he is entranced by her eyes
he wants to tell her all sorts of things say all the words he has memorized a thousand times
but now he cant get them out
his knees tremble
he does his best to overcome his confusion but all that comes out is nice day huh
a gust of wind envelops them in a cloud of dust and a clap of thunder rends the air
elena laughs amused by the blunder
yes nice day
salvatore laughs too
he gazes at her long hair tossed by the wind
she turns to leave
ive got to go now
bye bye elena
elena walks away
and salvatore also turns to leave
only now is he seized by disappointment regret at not having made the best of the opportunity
he talks to himself
what an idiot
what an idiot
salvatore projects images of elena on his wall
he lies across his bed gazing at her image
you probably dont believe me but im going to become the leading man in your life
sure i dont look like marlon brando but look at me really look at me
am i really so ugly
so should i try once more
maybe itll succeed
what do you say
elena seems to be saying yes
as salvatore kisses elena her image disappears
he is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the projector
salvatore is in a phone booth
the telephone will certainly help him feel less nervous
hello can i speak to elena please
salvatore recognizes elenas voice changes his tone turns sweeter more personal
is that you elena
oh im sorry i didnt recognize your voice
this is salvatore remember
salvatore finally speaks says everything all in one breath without stopping without hesitating in order to leave no room for shyness
listen i know that every time we see each other i make a fool of myself but im not like that i swear
its just that when i see you i feel shy the right words dont come to me i dont have the courage to say that all i do is think
he has finally got it out
hes dripping with sweat but happy at having succeeded
thats right elena youre the last thing i think of when i go to sleep and the first when i wake up in the morning
and at night i always dream of you
i know its not good on the phone
but please dont get me wrong
because i love you very much
interrupting him if you dont stop phoning her im calling the police
stunned but excuse me whos speaking
at elenas house a woman who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone
im elenas mother you filthy pig
salvatore feels like dropping through the floor tries to get a word in to explain to apologize but the flood of insults overwhelms him
im sorry signora maybe theres a misunderstanding
and dont call my daughter any more
salvatore has no choice but to hang up disappointed defeated
hes so mad he starts slapping himself
alfredo comes out of his house leaning on salvatores shoulder
they go off down the street towards the church
salvatore has finished recounting his misadventure
i told you the blue eyed ones are the most difficult
there must be some way to make her understand
dont think about it toto
dont even try
with feelings theres nothing to understand
salvatore gives an angry gesture
this time alfredos words do not quiet his frenzy dont help him
he moves away from him a few steps
alfredo stands there motionless in the middle of the road
ive had enough of your sermons
you act as if you created the world
a bicycle streaks by alfredo who gives a startled jump as if it were about to run into him
he raises his voice panic stricken
dont get pissed off with me now
i dont know where the fuck i have to go
a man on a bicycle almost collides with alfredo
salvatore fumes goes over to him listlessly
alfredo puts his hand back on his shoulder and they start walking again
alfredo has calmed down but his voice is determined
and the next time be careful how you talk
not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better
but unfortunately such was not the case
laughing you see it s like i say
you always have an answer for everything
i want to make you happy toto
im going to tell you a story
and he squeezes salvatores shoulder
its the signal for taking a rest
they sit in a doorway
alfredo starts telling his story and his way of speaking is hypnotic magical
with those eyes lost in empty space its as if his thoughts and his words came in from some other dimension mysterious hidden
once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm
basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all
and he immediately fell in love with her
but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughter
one day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her
the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my
balcony then in the end ill be yours
christ the soldier ran off there and waited
one day two days ten twenty
every night she looked out of her window but he never budged
come rain wind snow never budged
the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive
after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back
he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more
the princess kept watch
and on the ninety ninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
you mean right at the end
salvatore is amazed dumbfounded that ending has made a deep impression
they start walking again
thats right toto right at the end
and dont ask me what it means
if you figure it out let me know
ill be damned before the high altar the virgin mary in tears clutches three spikes inher hand
and beside her is another statue christ descended from the cross
men and women stand in line to kiss christs wounds
many people are sitting between the pews
salvatore helps alfredo take a seat and at that moment catches sight at the far end of elena on her way to the confessional
she kneels down on one side just as father adelfio comes out of the middle booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan
salvatores eyes light up
he has had a brainstorm
he leans over and whispers something into alfredos ear
alfredo nods his head
salvatore is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek like a caress
then he hurries over to the priest
says something in a low voice gesticulates with some agitation points to the pew where alfredo is sitting
the priest tries to say he cant now but salvatore insists and wins
the priest goes over to alfredo leans over
what is it alfredo
right now of all times
in a grave voice father adelfio i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul
and youve got to help me because ive lost all peace of mind
salvatore watches from a distance
he sees the priest put on an alarmed expression and then sit down beside alfredo
he creeps over to the confessional
elena is there kneeling down waiting for the priest to arrive
in an instant without anyone noticing salvatore pops inside the confessional
he shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain
on the other side of grille only a few inches away those eyes that keep him awake all night
father i have sinned
in a low voice well talk about that later
interrupting her sssssh be quiet pretend everythings normal
elenas eyes pop in amazement
what are you doing here
meanwhile alfredo and the priest continue their unusual and animated discussion
the priest is appalled crosses himself
but alfredo what youre saying is horrifying
but take the miracle of the loaves and fishes for example
i think about it a lot
how is it possible for
in the confessional the whispered conversation between salvatore and elena continues
annoyed there was a terrible rumpus at home
my mother told my father
and how could you have mistaken my voice
salvatore is mortified on tenterhooks keeps an eye on alfredo and the priest through a crack in the curtain
forgive me elena
it was stupid of me
but i had to talk to you
she looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight
this time salvatore finds the courage to speak to her calmly with determination
that grille probably helps him allows him to see without being seen
youre so beautiful elena
thats what i wanted to tell you
when i meet you i cant put two words together because
you give me the shivers
i dont know what you do in these situations what youre supposed to say
its the first time
but i think im in love with you
elena gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes
she is bewildered by that flood of passion
at that moment an old woman kneels down on the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille
father i have sinned
salvatore turns lo her instinctively
i absolve you in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost
go in peace my daughter
and he slams the panel shut in her face
elena is barely able to control her laughter
when you laugh youre even more beautiful
she pulls herself together again and puts on a serious but tender look
salvatore its awfully sweet of you
and even though i dont know you i like you
im not in love with you
for salvatore its as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart
he sits there gazing into her eyes at the beauty mark on her lip without moving
then through the crack sees alfredo and the priest conversing nervously god knows what theyre saying
and he turns back to her
i dont care
for you to fall in love with me too
every night when i get off work ill come and wait beneath your window
when you change your mind open your window
he smiles at her
she is upset by those exaggerated words but also intrigued
the priest has meanwhile solved the problem that alfredo has made up as an excuse
exhausted you understand now
you see it clearly
hypocritically oh yes father
now everythings clear
and the next time dont go around saying such heresy
you survived the fire at the movie house
but no one can save you from the fire of hell
sweet poignant music accompanies salvatores long waits beneath the window of elenas room
a warm early summer night
the last spectators wander off into the streets
the village idiot makes his rounds of the square
salvatore is beneath her window
the shutters are open but not the windows with the curtains
elena peers at him through a dark crack
fade to a rainy night
salvatore is back there again
a dog keeps him company taking shelter under an overhanging roof
the window is shut
fade to salvatores hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on the calendar
a check a day
fade to another night
the window is still shut
salvatores eyes are the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles just to win just to conquer his loved one
she peeks at him through the crack but he cant see her
fade to the paces of the calendar are covered with checks
several months have gone by
salvatore adds a check on the last page on december
tomorrow night will be
new years eve
the streets are empty
loud merry voices can be heard coming from the houses
old discarded objects hail down from balconies
firecrackers explode here and there
salvatore is there in the same old place as usual
the shutters are open but not the windows and all is darkness inside
salvatore is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep warm
toasts are being prepared in salvatores house
maria is there with her daughter lia then alfredo with his wife anna
salvatore is the only one missing for the family to be complete
the bottle of spumante and the christmas cake are ready
the radio is on with the new years eve programme
nervously but why hasnt toto shown up
the movie house is closed at this hour
alfredo has a know all look
he tries to put her mind at rest
he had to do something for me
over the radio music and merrymaking more sounds of merrymaking coming from elenas house
salvatore listens to it sees the shadows of her parents and relatives maybe even hers ready to celebrate welcome in the new year
but further on that window remains dark and shut
salvatore gazes at it again
there is a new look in his eyes like a gleam of hope
maybe its the specialness of that night maybe its the fire crackers the festive atmosphere but something tells him thats going to be the right night
the night when shell open her window
in fact a light suddenly goes on in the room
salvatores eyes sparkle have already taken on the hue of victory
the window is pulled open and his heart starts pounding like a drum
the music reaches its climax
two hands come out
salvatore shuts his eyes for a moment to hold back the flood of feeling
he opens them again and sees
the hands reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut
the light goes out
it is midnight
an echoing voice does the countdown
six five four three two one zero
happy new year
happy new year
and a roar of voices shouts explosions fills the air
salvatore has remained standing there immobile speechless
at his house glasses are about to be raised
there is a strange tense merriment
maria is unable to conceal her concern her presentiment
she glances at the door hoping to see salvatore appear
to maria theres nothing to worry about
hes probably with his friends
to all lets toast
toasting heres to you
heres to you
happy new year
for toto too heres to you
happy new year
everybody echoes marias toast
but salvatore is not happy in these first few minutes of the new year
he feels hurt humiliated rejected
he walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying down from the terraces
that was his last night
hes not showing up beneath that balcony any more
outside there is a violent thunderstorm
the pounding of the rain and the rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound track of the film being shown
two buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof
salvatore is alone
for the first time he feels he hates the profession hes got into
he is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for elena
he tears it into a thousand pieces as if trying to wipe out the traces of his grief
he is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesnt notice that someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room
and now stands there watching him in silence
the thunder is deafening
that someone is elena
she comes up behind him realizes he is thinking about her
loud passionate music is heard on the monitor
salvatore turns and sees her as if in a dream
it is a sudden blow to the heart
the look on her face is wonderfully sweet the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and who now realizes at last that she is in love too
for salvatore it is an overwhelming almost unbearable moment
a long passionate embrace that is never ending
they are happy cling to each other never to leave each other again
they spin around end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging the first part endings and the trailers
another intense look their eyes locked
and it is their first kiss
a kiss at first timid hesitant almost clumsy and then becomes resolute poignant
amidst the film strips dangling around and touching their young faces
meanwhile the film has finished the projector turns uselessly
down below the screen is blank the audience whistles
but salvatore hears nothing neither the whistles nor the useless whirring of the reels in the projector
all he hears is her breathing an he feels is the warmth of her skin
the happiest most vivid moments salvatore and elena spend together a country outing
they eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the prickly pear for plates
a chase through an endless field of wheat
in the projection booth
a cake with seventeen lighted candles
salvatore and elena blow them out together
and then a kiss
salvatore is driving an old beaten up balilla he bought from a car wrecker
elena sits beside him having the time of her life
they roar with laughter
the car jolts moves by fits and starts jarred by the holes in the road and besides salvatore is not such a hot driver
she fondles him
ironically you have a great future as a driver
if they dont arrest you first
thats nothing to do with it its the car thats still being run in
he has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a sudden violent shudder
a sharp report
a cloud of white smoke issues from the motor
and the balilla stops dead in its tracks
elena and salvatore cannot smother their wild laughter
so now how do we get home
cut to the two of them are standing beside the empty road looking bored as they have already been waiting a long time for someone to go by a car
when all at once a car comes around the bend heading for town
salvatore and elena flag it down
the driver slows down
the back door opens a man gets out
an alarmed and startled look comes over elenas face that man is her father
she sees him stride over in a rage
he has almost reached salvatore who tries lo be polite to make the best of the situation
hello dr mendola
elena buries her face in her hands so as not to see
salvatore has a bruise on his cheek and two band aids on his face
he got himself a good thrashing and then some
the house is jammed as on the great occasions
curiosity is written all over the faces of the audience
but what theyre seeing is not a film but an instalment of double or nothing
salvatore is standing by a teleprojector which has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony
it is a machine that makes it possible to project television show on the screen
alfredo is sitting beside him
in a low voice toto are you pulling my leg or something
how is it possible to see this television without film
just so alfredo
there isnt any
and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss
sceptically could be
but i dont like this business
it smells fishy to me
elena is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents
sitting beside her father is the owner of the movie house spaccafico who thanks him
in a low voice you see what a bright idea dr mendola
but without the bank loan how could i have bought the machine
if we dont get organized around here in this day and age well meet the same end as the punch and judy shows
elena is not very interested in the tv show
she sneaks a look at salvatore
from the looks on their faces it is clear that things are not going very well
he gives her a nod as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should figure out some way
elena leans over to her mother whispers something into her ear
elenas mother stands waiting in front of the womens toilet gazing at mike bongiorno emceeing the tv show in the distance
inside the toilet elena is standing on the toilet seat whispering to salvatore who is standing on the ilet seat of the mens toilet
their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have uncovered
elena is worried
could it be your father doesnt like the work i do
that my familys too poor
is that it
she gives a nod of the head but only faintly so as no to wound his vulnerability
off screen elena
to salvatore in a whisper for the moment its impossible to see each other
as soon as school is out were going to go stay with friends in tuscany
well be there all summer
maybe if you came up we could meet in secret
crestfallen but were opening the outdoor movie theatre this summer
what will i do all this time without seeing you
ill write to you every day
i love you
the summerll be over and ill be back
they reach out to kiss each other
who knows when theyll be able to see each other again
off screen elena
elena climbs down pulls the chain and walks off leaving salvatore standing there on the toilet seat
summer has come
a bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the carters families to the beach to go swimming
salvatore helped by the usher has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry it to the outdoor movie house
the usher has hung a sign on the cinema paradiso to the effect that showings to continue at the imperia arena and now climbs into the wagon
the horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds salvatore that the summer is going to be long this year longer than ever
and he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the wheels
a cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the wagon
there are the men from the slaughter house
they recognize salvatore
well look whos here
when are you coming to shoot another film
and they laugh with their gaping toothless mouths
salvatore doesnt feel like joking not even like answering
he looks away so as not to see their leers
he wants to be by himself
the beach is almost deserted dotted here and there with groups of bathers
the carts and horses are scattered in the sand near the imperia arena where some workmen are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening
the wagon arrives and salvatore and the usher unload the projector
a sultry evening
the jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the dark horizon
the sound track of a comic film reverberates over the sea the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves breaking on the rocks
a group of little boys in a boat pulls away from shore
they join some more boats standing still in the water all of them crammed with little boys all looking in the same direction
towards the screen of the open air movie at the waters edge
there is a funny scene
all seats are sold out
free entrance and payment on the way out
and they guffaw noisily
their laughter is echoed by more laughter in the distance
the laughter of the arena audience scattered among the metal chairs
by dint of laughing the people in one of the rows of chairs tip over backwards
screams laughs whistles
the projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading down to the rocks
salvatore is sitting on the ground bare chested tired and sticky with sweat
he is reading a letter from elena
he is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his face
off screen salvatore my darling here the days never end
i find your name everywhere if i read a book do a crossword puzzle thumb through a newspaper
youre always before my eyes
today ive got some rather bad news
at the end of october were moving to the city where ill attend the university
itll be hard to see each other every day
but dont worry whenever i can get away ill always come running to you to the cinema paradiso
on the arena screen with its potted plants and palm trees a very funny scene is being shown
the audience again bursts into wild laughter
and the audience of little boys in the boats also laugh
one of them laughing himself to tears loses his balance and falls into the water
the others howl with laughter
a voice rises up out of the carousel of boats
ive caught an octopus
the august sun is blazing hot
people are forced to stay inside when the sirocco blows
the streets are empty
and there is a strange silence
nothing can be heard except far in the distance from somewhere in the country the love song of some carter
salvatore hears it too stretched out on the floor of his room his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously
the mailman comes down the street on his bicycle rides up to salvatore and hands him a letter
sitting in the shade of a white wall salvatore reads the letter
next to him the dog that kept him company at night beneath elenas window
he gazes up at him as if looking for news of her
the arena is crowded with sun burnt faces
on screen scenes from ulysses
on a shelf in the projection booth there is an enormous pack of letters
salvatore is worn out
the waiting has destroyed him
he looks like a madman
as he winds up one of the parts of the film he repeats her name obsessively under his breath
now he is sitting outside on the back steps a few yards from the sea
there is a breeze this evening the waves are rather high and the boats of gate crashers can be seen out in the water rolling fitfully but not dangerously
salvatore stretches out gazes up at the inky sky and talks to himself just like a madman whispering
when will this shitty summer be over
half shutting his eyes in a film itd already be finished
smiling fade out and cut to a nice thunderstorm
thatd be perfect
a clap of thunder explodes in the air
salvatores eyes pop open
the arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky
the gate crashers in the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of thunder
one of those storms is building up that ruins late summer nights
salvatore gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down violently suddenly
the arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth to take shelter and to go on watching the film despite the
the little boys in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their heads
but salvatore does not get up
he lets the rain fall on him goes on laughing incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had taken place
and as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up to catch more rain on his face and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of joy a mouth
comes to rest passionately on his lips it is elena
salvatore opens his eyes in utter amazement it seems like a vision another hallucination created by the rain
instead no it is really her
i got back today
you cant imagine the excuses i had to make up to be here
salvatores lips interrupt her
it is an intense a stupendous kiss
theyve probably never been so happy as they are at that moment
they cling to each other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies mingling her hair with his binding them ever closer
autumn has arrived
in the streets the peasants prepare the barrels for preserving the grape must
alfredo is sitting in front of the cinema paradiso with spaccafico and the usher
it is a quiet moment they chat while the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard through the window of the booth
the mailman stops and hands spaccafico a folded sheet of paper
don ciccio this is for toto
give it him
and he pedals off on his bicycle
what is it
spaccafico unfolds it reads it claps his hands on his head in alarm
holy blood of judas
now what am i going to do
elena is waiting near the university
she paces nervously back and forth
glances at her watch
she looks around in all directions and sees him at last
he comes running up to her
so whatd they say
the army says that as a war orphan i dont have to serve in the military but nothing can be done
its a bureaucratic error
i have to leave
day after tomorrow morning
theyre sending me to rome
but theyll discharge me ten days later
he takes her hand turns to go to a cafe
elena holds back
she has caught sight of her fathers car approaching
elena turns to look and in a faint voice reveals the reason for her nervousness
youd better go
its my father
good this way we can finally talk
ill convince him this time
he wont be convinced salvatore
he has other plans for me
the son of one of his colleagues
dont act that way
well talk about it later
wait for me thursday at the cinema paradiso
ill be coming with the five oclock bus
salvatore looks with longing as elena drives away with her father
elena gives him a meaningful look through the window
salvatore returns the look but stands there motionless with a grim expression like someone who knows how to take the treacherous blows of life
the car drives off and with it elena
their eyes hang on the same thread
the thread of hope and now of fear
the poster of il grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre
spaccafico replaces thursday with a today sticker
the charwoman is washing the floor of the lobby
spaccafico shouts up to salvatore who is in the projectionists booth
spaccaficio says that tomorrow hell be leaving and today is his last day on the job and hes sorry
toto this is no film for the common herd
one dayll be more than enough
so tonight please set up tomorrows film so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready
spaccafico understands salvatores sadness
cheer up toto
ill be here waiting for you
no ones taking your job away from you
the bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out there is no sign of elena
salvatore stands nervously up in the window of the projection booth glances at his watch
its already five thirty and she hasnt come
he checks the projector
the first part has just begun and the reel is full of film
the first part is now about to finish the reel is almost empty and elena still isnt there
salvatore is extremely nervous worried mortified by his meeting with her father
he sees elenas face pulling away in the car
thinks back over her terrible confession
he paces back and forth as if he were in a prison cell thinking up solutions
the stair light finally goes on there she is salvatore dashes over and down the stairs to meet her
he comes down the final turn of the spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with alfredo who is slowly making his way up with the help of his
salvatore freezes to the spot
alfredo senses his disappointment
you werent expecting me
nervously no alfredo i was coming to help you
smiling you were expecting her
salvatore doesnt answer
hes too worried too upset
alfredo climbs another step whispering
its a nasty business waiting by yourself
in company its better
then ill leave
as usual alfredos sweetness comforts salvatore indeed suddenly gives him a bold idea one that quiets his nervousness
he puts a hand on alfredos shoulder
alfredo i need your help
the balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city where elena s family has gone to live
salvatore drives along in a state of agitation
the idea of having to leave without seeing elena is his obsession
an obsession he refuses to accept
the second part has begun the reel is full
for the first time in many years alfredo is alone in the booth sitting in front of the projector and he feels helpless
not only because hes blind but also because there is nothing he can do for salvatore
a strange agitation comes over him as if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his toto at that moment
meanwhile the film roll on and with it time minutes
salvatore has already reached the city
he slows down at the bus terminus
looks at the people waiting but she is not there
he asks several girls in front of the university
but they havent seen her
he phones from a phone booth
but nobody answers
his self control is about to give way to desperation
on the reel there is less film
like an hourglass with the sand trickling through
salvatore comes streaking up in front of her house
he screeches to a stop dashes out like greased lightning
his nerves are tense a slight tremor runs through his whole body
he rings the bell but nobody answers
a man who lives in the building opens the front door and comes out
salvatore seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor
he pounds on the door furiously almost cracking his knuckles
but all to no avail there is nobody at home
he shrieks panic stricken
and in fact there is somebody inside elenas mother
she sits there immobile without a word
the pounding on the door reverberates in the room but she does not budge determined to ignore that desperate message
the reel spins faster
the film is almost ended
by now there is very little time
and salvatore is on his way home defeated
be drives as fast as he can
be is in a terrible state cant figure out whats happened
cant explain it
and thats what hurts
the words the end appear on the screen
and the film runs out leaving the projector turning uselessly
alfredo is alarmed
he can hear that the film is finished but doesnt know where to begin
he gropes around
like a little boy calls his mother when hes lost in a crowd so old alfredo calls totooooo
the few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the film they havent understood
christ what a piece of crap
we want out money back
others are shouting that they like the film
the balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre
salvatore darts out and runs to the stairs
salvatore turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector trying to calm down alfredo who has got to his feet frightened
but whered you go toto
take it easy
take it easy
and he folds him into his arms like calming down a little boy who has had a nightmare
be whispers still out of breath sit down sit down
alfredo quiets down as salvatore lowers him into a chair and asks him the only question upon which his last hope depends
did she come
no nobody came
and he embraces him almost as if to comfort him in his great disappointment
for salvatore its really the end shes not coming
tomorrow hell be leaving without having seen her again
salvatores hands remove the photographs of amedeo nazzari and of elena from the wall slip them into one of his pockets
now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrows film take
out the reels to set them up pick up the receipt his last before leaving and with the same mechanical gesture hang it on a nail as usual
a wild frenetic sequence set to the pace of military life
salvatore in uniform with close cropped hair answers his superior shouts radio operator di vita salvatore
third battalion ninth company sir
salvatore fires all the shots in the cartridge one after the other
a second lieutenant barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun
one two one two
salvatore sneaks out of line goes over and slips a letter into the mailbox and hurries back to his place
on one of the public phones in a square of rome salvatore is phoning elena
he slams down the receiver as the line of soldiers waits its turn
a large plastic bag full of water
salvatore wakes up with a start in a lake of ice water
he lets out a terrified shriek as the others laugh protected by the dark
in the large dormitory the sergeant is handing out the mail
he throws a pile of letters on salvatores bunk
they are his letters to elena stamped address unknown
salvatore is washing up in a sea of water and grease
he rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose
a spurt of red water splatters him in the face
a training run
another letter which salvatore drops into the mailbox
a cold rainy night
salvatore stands stiff as a poker in front of the ammunition depot
it is his first guard duty
soaked to the skin gazing wide eyed into empty space
aggressively colonel i was supposed to spend ten days here and its been about a year and i havent ever gone borne
id like a furlough at least
salvatore is in the guardhouse
a cold dark filthy cell
his nerves start to give way
he bows his head in despair
salvatore is exhausted run down
the night stand is jammed with medicines
he lies in bed without moving staring off into empty space and repeats obsessively in a low voice as if talking to himself
he has touched the extreme of suffering a young man who has been denied love and affection his rights freedom
a nurse comes up
di vita salvatore get ready your discharge has come through
salvatore registers this information with his eyes and nods absently
the bus disappears around the corner leaving salvatore standing there alone
it is a blazing hot day
the sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions
the square is empty the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces a western
salvatore puts his suitcase on the ground looks around
everything exactly the same immobile
only one new feature in the cafe theres a jukebox playing estate sung by milva
salvatore turns towards the cinema paradiso
the projectionist is at the window of the booth smoking a cigarette
who knows who he is where he came from
a hot flurry of dust
salvatore turns and sees a dog leaping around kim wagging its tail
its the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath the window
salvatore gives a start of joy drops his suitcase and leans over to stroke him
then he hugs him as if he were an old friend
salvatore goes to see alfredo
he is still in bed has just woken up
he is glad to hear his toto
he feels his forehead his eyes and cheeks as if to see him
you re thinner
you can tell youve not been treated well
as usual you cant hide anything from alfredo
salvatore senses something different in him that he cant figure out like same wild restlessness within
they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody
toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing
so its better to shut up
changing his lone its hot in here
toto take me to the beach
the sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry easier to breathe
salvatore and alfredo walk slowly along the waterfront
alfredo totters slightly holds on to salvatore who is telling him something very funny
at the christmas party the lieutenant pinches a girls ass
the girl turns around its the daughter of the commanding officer
the lieutenant is scared to death and says miss if your heart is as hard as what i have just touched im done for
and they roar with laughter
they look like two old school buddies telling each other dirty jokes
they stop beside a low wall
alfredo knows that those laughs are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are troubling salvatore
and he breaks the ice while salvatore is still laughing
seriously did you ever see her again
salvatores laughter dies away taken off guard as he is
then he lights a cigarette
and nobody knows where she is
it was probably meant to be like this
each of us has a star to follow
so now what are you thinking of doing
its a terrible question and salvatore has no answer to it
in fact would rather not even talk about it
he changes his tone as if he hadnt heard it laughs trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military service
listen to this one
the commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there
yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there
and he bursts into nervous laughter
but this time alfredo remains cold unmoved does not laugh with him
salvatore gradually falls silent
he doesnt know what to say
for the first time in his life he doesnt know what goal to aim for doesnt know what to do
the cloud of smoke wreaths his nervous face now he seems to relax whispers you remember the story of the soldier and the princess
alfredo nods his head
now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end
thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his
but she also could not have kept her promise
that would have been terrible he would have died from it
so instead for ninety nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
this time salvatore is the one to explain something to alfredo
and alfredo realizes how bitter his story is and above all that the boy standing there is no longer a boy
do like the soldier toto
this land is cursed
they are now leaning against a boat on the beach
alfredo goes on whispering his words
when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes
then you go away one year two
and when you come back everythings different
the thread has broken
you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist
isnt that the case
youve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were born
but not now its impossible
now youre blinder than i am
intense words straight from the heart and salvatore is spellbound
he whispers with a smile who said that
gary cooper james stewart henry fonda
alfredo also gives a gentle smile no toto nobody said it
i say it
lifes not like you saw it in the movies
he lays his hand on salvatores shoulder gives it a hard squeeze
go back to rome
you re young the world is yours
and im old
i dont want to hear you talk any more i want to hear talk about you
salvatore gives a shudder that runs through his very soul
the setting sun lies colorless on the horizon
the square is empty
salvatore is sitting on the church steps
his head in his hands
he has to make a decision leave or stay
what decision will he make
is the question that keeps alfredo awake in his hot dark bedroom
maria his mother also cant get to sleep
she knows senses that her son is on the verge of an important turning point
but what will he decide
what will happen
also lia his sister feels a strange heavy tension in the air
and doesnt sleep
shes probably wondering where salvatore is at that hour
hes sitting on the ground
but even if he were to go to bed he wouldnt sleep
he rubs his face with his hand
the church bell chimes four a
almost thirty years later another distant bell is chiming four a
and salvatore is once again wide awake
he is thinking with his hand on his face just like then
and the same decision to make what to do
stretched out beside a sleeping woman he goes on staring at the window
outside the storm has passed
the long memory has almost faded only the sound of a train surfaces in his mind
its the train that thirty years earlier had pulled into the station of his home town before leaving for rome
salvatore hugs his mother and sister
the moment has come to say goodbye to alfredo
the old man is deeply moved
a heart rending trembling comes into his husky voice
dont come back any more dont think about us dont turn round dont write dont give in to nostalgia
forget us all
if you cant hear it and come back dont come looking for me i wont let you into the house you understand
they clasp each other tightly as if they knew they wouldnt be meeting again
thanks for all youve done for me
whatever you do love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little
the train moves now
hands wave in the air drawing further and further away
the priest has arrived at the last moment and waves goodbye from the distance
shouting goodbye totooooooo
i got here too late
what a shame
the figure of alfredo and the others can no longer be distinguished
only a distant blur at the end of the track
thirty years later a plane flies over sicily
it lands on the runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of the dark mountains
salvatores face appears among the clouds reflected in one of the plane windows
he has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home after the adventure of life has carried him afar wandering the world where he has forgotten everything
from the plane window to another window
the window of the taxi cab driving salvatore to his home town
the scenery moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories
a lot of things have changed but the colors are still the same
the yellow running through the entire landscape is unmistakable
and all those black birds perched in a row on the guard rail are crows
the cab now approaches the outskirts of giancaldo
but if the sign hadnt been there with the name on it it could be an entirely different place
the house where salvatores mother lives is also new nearer the sea
the old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor knitting a white sweater
her hands move very swiftly almost mechanically
the hands of a woman who is waiting
the front doorbell rings twice
maria stops short
that is what she has been waiting for
she mumbles in excitement
i knew it
and she scrambles to her feet dropping her knitting in the chair one needle dangling over the edge
she hurries off forgetting that she still has the ball of white yarn in her apron pocket
and the yarn runs off the needles and the knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house goes down the stairs to the front door
there the yam stops and maria s excited voice is heard
off screen toto
salvatores voice off screen how are you mamma
the camera now moves discovering them through the parlor window hugging each other outside the front door
under the curious eyes of an old bored dog
maria is no longer wearing an apron
mother and son are sitting side by side at the kitchen table
liall be so glad to see you youll see
and you wont recognize the kids any more theyre grown up by now
smiling theyre always writing to me saying they want to come to rome
salvatore looks around its a place hes never seen before and yet its his mothers house
see how pretty the house is
we did everything over
smiling if it hadnt been for you
getting up come i have a surprise
she takes him by the hand and leads him out to the hallway
salvatore looks at her and feels a pang
she seems smaller age withers the body she is slightly stooped her hair is gathered into a knot at the back other head
you must be tired
if you want to rest theres time before the funeral
interrupting her no mamma it only takes an hour by air you know
smiling ironically you shouldnt tell me that now
after all these years
salvatore gets the message feels guilty
thinking about it it seems incredible that he has never come before
maria opens a door steps aside to let her son in whispers i put all your things in here
go in go in
salvatore lakes a few steps is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room perfectly reconstructed and preserved
it looks like a museum the museum of the past
despite the bed the clothes in the cupboard the books on the shelves it is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in
maria senses his perturbation remains standing in the doorway as if to leave him alone
salvatore goes over to the bed looks around the old mm movie camera the projector his documentaries the bicycle hanging on the wall the photographs of his favorite movie stars
but what mostly catches his eye is a tiny framed photograph salvatore as a little boy and alfredo standing smiling in front of the cinema paradiso
strange at that time alfredo was younger than he is now
its as if he were standing there before him one last time
that impressive figure his good natured bur firm look touches his heart
from alfredos smiling face to
the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever
the funeral procession winds its way down the main street
at the intersections cars stop to let the black hearse pass by
people cross themselves
the old men remove their hats
store shutters are lowered
then when the procession has passed by the cars start up again the old men put their hats back on the shutters are pulled up
salvatore is in the front row with his mother next to alfredos widow
signora anna says in a whisper her eyes fixed on the coffin
he would have been happy you came toto
he always talked about you
right to the end
he was terribly fond of you
tears come to her she is unable to say any more
salvatore gives her a hug deeply touched by her words
he left two things for you
come see me before you leave
salvatore nods his head
he gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had been like a
father to him
but why had he forgotten him
up in front leading the procession he sees a young priest with an altar boy beside him and these figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul
and bringing old feelings to light again
the procession reaches the square
the dark column stands etched in the dazzling early afternoon light
signora anna motions the driver and the procession comes to a halt
it is alfredos last farewell to the place where he had spent the best years of his life the cinema paradiso
everyone turns to look and salvatore also turns taken by surprise
it has fallen to pieces doors and windows boarded shut crumbling walls a piece of the sign dangling down weeds and mildew in the cracks and on the roof
the square has changed completely is unrecognizable
buildings stores sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a snails pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns
and the central square has turned motorcycles
salvatore turns slowly to look behind him towards the small crowd and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at once despite the many years that
have gone by the man at the box office the usher who also served as bill poster the charwoman the carabiniere sergeant and further on behind rosa and angelo the lovebirds who had met in the movie house and then got married
they all have white hair
and they too have recognized him give little hello nods and gestures
another face he seems to recognize why sure its spaccafico the owner
how old hes become
he also looks up and his eyes meet salvatores
a hello nod
salvatore makes his way over to him through the crowd
they shake hands heartily without a word both touched
the procession starts up again
under his breath how longs it been shut
six years ago this may
no one came any more
you know better than me mr
di vita the crisis television videos
by now the movie business is only a dream
the citys bought it now to make a new parking lot
next saturday theyre tearing it down
salvatore is disconcerted irritated by that mr
besides finding out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him after all its a piece of his life
and all those curious faces staring at him
but why do you call me mr
it didnt used to be that way
well its hard to call an important person by his first name
but if it really matters to you i call you
salvatore smiles at that
meanwhile the procession has reached the church
salvatore excuses himself and goes over to the hearse
old spaccafico watches him go then says almost to himself bless you toto
the coffin is unloaded
salvatore has asked to be one of the bearers into the church
as he moves off slowly with that weight on his shoulder somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk
an old woman sixty or seventy years old with a plastic bag in her hand
she crosses herself quickly
salvatore recognizes her she was the one he made love with for the first time
teresa the prostitute
the coffin is carried into the church followed by the little procession
the little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor windows are lit up
the rustling of the sea can be heard
the family is having supper
the table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been brought out
lia is also there with her husband alfio and their two children
filippo fifteen and sara thirteen
the television is on but the sound has been turned practically all the way down
salvatores presence arouses a special excitement
the children look at their uncle with a certain awe after all they dont really know him
playfully uncle the next time granny comes to rome i want to come along too
i want to see what you do when you work
but i warn you there isnt much to see
i sell much more smoke than fire
the children laugh
at the sight of them lia alfio and maria also smile
to salvatore watch out dont get too familiar with those two indicating the children theyre worse than cannibals
theyll take advantage
everybody laughs again
even maria laughs a lot
salvatore looks at her he had never seen her laugh like that amused at peace
you leaving tomorrow uncle
salvatore doesnt know what to say
he feels drunk
it has been a day of violent upheavals a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing on the one hand he d like to stay let himself
drift on the sweet tide of family life be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past on the other he wishes he had never come
he forces himself to smile again
i dont know filippo
i dont know
they go on eating but salvatore isnt very hungry
re peers at lia eating out of the comer of his eye feels deeply bound to her she has a few white hairs and light wrinkles line her face
then he looks at her husband alfio hes going bald but he tries to hide it by combing over the little hair left
who knows what their marriage is like he wonders
he looks back at lia and its as if she sensed it she looks up guesses the nature of his thoughts imagines what he is trying to figure out a
blush colors her cheeks and she smiles
salvatore returns a conniving smile
the ringing of a phone
sara starts to get up to go and answer it hut maria stops her with a glance of the eye
to salvatore it must be for you
theyve been calling all afternoon
they wanted to know if youre leaving this evening or tomorrow
everyone turns to salvatore with questioning looks making him feel even more restless and undecided
the phone goes on ringing
the traffic cops are trying to break the front door down with their shoulders
once twice and at last the door flies open with a screech kicking up a cloud of dust
salvatore enters by himself
salvatores silhouette stands out against the light in the open door
s lowly he makes his way into the empty theatre
a thick layer of dust lends everything a gray rarefied look
the light streaming in from the windows up above teems with strange mates of dust like a haze
cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling
salvatore walks down the middle aisle
the rows of seats are unhinged what was once the wooden veneer has warped from the dampness
he looks around as if he were thumbing through the album of his memories
the screen dangles from its frame
the emergency exits are boarded and nailed shut
observing the emptiness of the theatre salvatore has the feeling he can hear the howling the whistling and voices of the
audience as he remembers it
but only for one brief moment then the silence returns
a mouse creeps along one wall stops near a pile of dust
salvatore is attracted by that little gray mass
he goes over as the mouse scampers off takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lions head covered with dust
he moves it with his foot then looks up at the projection booth repeating the same gesture of bygone years
but the lions head is no longer there only the outline of it on the wall and cobwebs have covered the hales of the booth those little square openings that
had caused him such long suffering as a little boy
salvatore now climbs up the spiral staircase
each step kicks up a little cloud of dust
the little booth yellow with fumes appears before him again
now it looks like some big empty cave
the projector is no longer there nor the equipment
who knows where they junked them
the only thing left is a clump of film strips still attached to the wall trailers part one endings etc
there he had kissed elena for the first time and strips of film like those had grazed their faces
now they are caught up in the coils of cobwebs
and where the film winder once stood the nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts
of all the films shown at the cinema paradiso palace
and three more boxfuls of them are on the floor
and the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass broken
salvatore peers out of one of the cracks in the window and sees the village
which is now a city
a different world he no longer knows
the cafe in the square has been completely renovated
the cashier and barmen have young unfamiliar faces
salvatore holds out the receipt with a tip
a double whisky please
several boys are sitting at the comer tables talking about girls
others stand playing war games shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic tune
a man comes up to salvatore and asks for his autograph
then salvatore turns to the plate glass window overlooking the main street where the workers club once was
and like a flash a shudder freezes him to the spot
two steps away from him through the glass a stunning vision which casts him beyond time chills his blood there before him is elena
but she is still young young as she was then
sweet luminous alluring exactly the way he saw her the first time at the station
she is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her arm
have the passing years had no effect on her
or is she an hallucination
its a dream
or is he dead too like alfredo
salvatore doesnt know how to explain it
and he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic
his glass drops to the floor
as the girl walks off
at the age of fifty five salvatore feels no scruples about wandering the streets of his home town spying from a distance on an eighteen year old girl
theres nothing he can do about it
he stares at her with the amazement of someone who discovers that miracles exist
now he is nearer to her
how lovely she is
its her no doubt about it
exactly the same
except she has a different hair do and is wearing different clothes elena didnt wear slacks
the girl goes up to a parked motorcycle
she removes the padlock and fastens her books to the rack
salvatore is standing there a few steps away and without stopping to think moves a little closer discreetly politely
excuse me miss
she turns to look at him indifferent but friendly
he looks at her wonderful blue eyes
im so sorry i thought you were someone else
she has already started the motor of her bike
a flip of the accelerator and off she goes her hair flying in the wind
salvatore follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner
the old shots of elena getting off the train and walking away casting a curious look at the camera
salvatore is watching her again projected on the white wall of his room
he also watches the other shots of those happy long gone days the picnic
she at the beach smiling joyful
and again salvatore doesnt understand or doesnt want to understand
but these scenes could have been shot yesterday so identical to elena is the girl he saw on the street
and the wound which he thought had healed years ago starts bleeding again
the lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever knowing why and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his young mind start
slipping through his soul again like those shots slipping again through an old mm projector
through the crack of the door maria sees those images on the wall salvatore rocking his head back and forth slowly like he used to do as a boy when
she somehow feels his grief his bitterness lowers her eyes and walks away without a word as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank empty
and salvatore sits there gazing at it as if he saw other scenes which his camera never set down on film only his memory
the high school students are coming out after school
happy young faces
that girl s motorcycle can be seen in a rear view mirror
salvatore is at the wheel of the car alfio has lent him
he has obviously followed that motorcycle before
he waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost a determination to understand to get to the bottom of the matter which frightens him and at the same
time overwhelms him hopelessly
and here she comes
she unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off
salvatore starts the motor and follows her a short distance away
the girl heads for the new residential district on the outskirts
maria is setting the table
lia and her family are eating at her house today
salvatore is sitting again with a lighted cigarette gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the rolling sea
the air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a heaviness to the silence like the troubled look on his face
maria glances at him
what are you thinking toto
salvatore looks at the old womans lovely face a faint smile
on his lips
there was always something like an unspoken rule between them the rule of silence of unconfessed complicity
and now he feels that rule has to be broken
he speaks quietly as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt
i was thinking
that weve never talked mamma
when i was little i saw you as if you were already old
thats probably true with all kids
she nods then sits down before him
he strokes her old skinny heavily veined hands
but only now do i realize you were young you were beautiful had a whole life before you
sighing how could you have lived alone all that time with no one to look after you
you could have remarried
at the time i probably wouldnt have understood but i would have later
maria doesnt answer but she is not troubled
an inner peace lends her a sweet quiet expression
then she too agrees to break the rule of silence
i never had anybody
if thats what you think
i didnt want anybody
i always remained faithful
first to your father then to you to lia
with a shrug thats the way im made theres nothing i can do about it
smiling and youre like me youre too honest and too attached to the things you love
but i dont know if thats a good thing
faithfulness is a bad business
if youre faithful youre always alone
salvatore is immersed in the profound truth of those words
and he says nothing
the silence is broken by the ringing of the phone
a menacing sound which salvatore cannot bear
he knows they are calling him from rome gives a nervous gesture stands up and pulls out the plug
the silence returns the whistling of the wind
maria lowers her eyes
its my fault
it would have been better if i hadnt called you
salvatore sits down again leaning closer to her
he stubs out his cigarette in the already overflowing ashtray
its nothing to do with you
its just that i was scared of coming back
now after all these years i thought i was strong that i had forgotten lots of things
instead i find its quite the opposite as if i had never left
and yet i look at lia and feel as if i didnt know her and you mamma
i abandoned you ran away like a thief thought only of myself and never gave you an explanation
interrupting him and i never asked for one
you have nothing to explain
i always thought that what you did was right and that was that
with no beating around the bush
smiling playing it down only one thing made me suffer bolting the door shut before going to bed at night
you never used to do that
she smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told
when you used to work at the movies i could never get to sleep at night until you came home
then when you arrived i pretended to be asleep but i heard all your movements
then when you fell asleep id get up and bolt the door
then when you left every time i did it i felt as if i had left somebody outside the door far away
salvatore listens to his mothers words surprised and entranced by the poetry of her way of speaking
but you were right to leave
you succeeded in doing what you wanted to do
sighing when i call you a different woman always answers
i pretend i know them so they wont have to go through the embarrassment of introducing themselves
smiling im sure they take me for a crazy old woman
but so far ive never heard one voice that really loves you
i would have known
and yet id like to see you
fall in love
gazing into his eyes but your lifes there
here there are nothing but ghosts toto
let it go
she has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice
and salvatore realizes she has always known everything
but he doesnt answer her
they look at each other a long time without speaking
their rule of conniving silence has come back into play as before forever
it is her expression that tells him to leave to take the plane and fly away
but salvatore has not taken his mothers advice
re has not left
something holds him there still leads him to go on looking
the girls motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small house
he is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small square near a cafe
re has been there some while but is not nervous waits there with determination
several windows in the house are lit but no one can be seen through the curtains
nothing but shadows pass by every now and then
now the light in one of the windows goes out and the light on the stair goes on
the front door opens and the girl comes out with a tall sturdy looking elegantly dressed gentleman around fifty
they converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard
salvatore watches them come out the gate and climb into a car
they look like father and daughter
the car now drives off and passes right by him
a gleam of light the reflection from the headlights falls on the gentlemans face
he recognizes him at once from the birthmark on his temple
to himself boccia
his eyes flash hes afraid hes understood
and now the craze to get to the bottom of it all gnaws away at him
there is no turning back
salvatores hands rifle through a phone directory
he is in the cafe on the other side of the glass door leading to the little square
his finger runs down the column of names
mumbling his last name was lo meo vincenzo
he has already put the token into the slot and dials the number looking at the two lit upstairs windows of that house where the mystery of his life may
salvatore hears the first ring his heart in his throat
a shadow appears in one of the windows
and a voice answers
its a womans voice
salvatore shuts his eyes is about to speak but the lump in his throat silences him
he still hesitates can t get a word out as if he had lost his voice or didnt know what to say
he hangs up
the shadow at the window also hangs up then disappears
salvatore is at a loss sits down at one of the rabies near the phone in the almost empty cafe
at the far end a group of five people watching television
you want something
and he turns back to the television
salvatore lights a cigarette
he is uncertain
once again he has to lake an important decision redial the number and seek a face behind that shadow
or forget the whole thing the girl boccia the shadow and go away
yes best go away
he gets up and leaves
he can be seen through the window turning the comer
a pack of cigarettes and a lighter lie on the table he has forgotten them
and the lighted cigarette bums down in the ashtray
a few moments have gone by
footsteps and a hand picks up the lighter and the cigarettes
it is salvatore who now on a sudden urge slips another token into the slot
the shadow reappears at the window
the same voice as before
hello whos speaking
salvatore answers at last keeping his eyes shut whispering id like to speak to signora elena
who is it please
salvatore feels a terrible pang continues salvatore
silence charged with tension
then the voice continues weakly as if puzzled
he runs his hand over his forehead his eyes as if to soothe the turmoil he feels inside
salvatore di vita
do you remember
another pause chilly heavy
salvatore opens his eyes looks at the window
her shadow is motionless as if cut out of cardboard
elena im here in the bar across the street from your house
the shadow moves slowly a hand pulls aside the curtain
its a moment of heart rending emotion
and they see each other from a distance after thirty years each of them with a phone receiver to their ear
but she is somewhat in the dark against the light its impossible to make out her features
her voice gives a sudden start instantly controlled
certainly i remember
salvatores eyes glisten try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a better look but in vain
id like to see you
elena lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow
she whispers the words
its been so long
why should we meet
what good would it do
please dont say no
but her voice is firm unshakeable even if quivering with emotion
im old salvatore
and you too
its best not to meet
the shadow hangs up disappears
the light goes off
the wind is stronger now the streets and the square are empty
salvatore is at the wheel of the car driving aimlessly around the town
he has rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadnt had the courage to meet
an obsessive musical heat fraught with rage pours out of the car radio
a phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind whistling outside
in the half darkened room maria picks up the receiver
no one answers but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up
maria is alarmed
who could it be at this hour
and where is toto
salvatore stands motionless on the pier facing the storm tossed sea
he feels relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts blurs them but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes
a flashing light seems to approach behind his back
salvatore turns and is blinded by the headlights of a car parked at the beginning of the pier
the splattering waves lend the scene a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights
now the lights move towards him
and salvatore also lakes a few timid steps forward
they are close
the car has almost stopped
but it is impossible to make out the person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door
a voice can be barely heard over the raging sea
it is elenas voice
salvatore approaches accepting the invitation enters the car and shuts the door
the headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open sea and the harbor with its rocking boats
inside the car not a word
two dark figures gaze at each other unintelligible as if the night were trying to further delay that meeting
the glowing reflection of a wave higher than the others now lights up their faces
elena was right they are no longer the faces of teenagers but of people on in years who study each other searching for a truth
the howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder but elena and salvatore rear nothing sit glued to their seats fixed in the endless gaze that
he is the first to break the silence in a faint voice
howd you know id be here
elena i dont know how many years have gone by but some things about you i do remember
there werent many places you could have gone
i looked around
salvatore turns on the light of the rear view mirror
finally they can see better
they look at each other a little ill at ease making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces
salvatore carefully observes her graying hair her blue eyes lined with wrinkles the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip
youre still beautiful
dont be silly
she looks down troubled by the way he has of gazing into her eyes speaks almost mumbling her words
dont look at me like that please
and she switches off the light
but this time it is less dark things can be seen
whyd you come back
do you remember him
of course i remember him
you were terribly fond of him
a moment of silence
its hard to find something to say
i saw your daughter
who knows how many salvatores must be running after her
smiling one or two
bur therere not all that many salvatores
salvatore also smiles but a puzzled smile as if what she has said had thrown him off guard
ive got a son too
and you do you have children
and im not married
elena sits there in silence
a veil of sadness clouds her eyes
are you happy
all things considered yes
even if it wasnt what i dreamt of then
again salvatore is thrown off guard as if the round key of his enquiry had met with only square locks
you know him
with a bitter smile whats he do
hes the district representative
we met at the university in pisa
then instinctively in a shy voice salvatore asks the question that he probably wouldnt have asked a moment later
how come you never married that guy from tuscany
the white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier dashing against the car windows
the shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on the agony of their faces
elena hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but haughty smile
i didnt want to
i had to fight tooth and nail
but in the end i won
salvatore is unable to smile
its as if the void were growing and swelling within
thunder and lightning shatter the roaring of the wind and sea hut it does not rain
now her smile jades away
at that time
i was waiting for you
there is no resentment in her words
she has said them fondly
with the serenity of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of suffering no more
for salvatore its as if one of those thunderbolts had pierced his heart
he leans over gazing into her shining eyes
but ive never forgotten you elena
whispering nor have i
even though you disappeared
salvatore is staggered feels as if he were plunging into the void
what she has said strikes him as grotesque
elena strokes his hair as if to restrain his sinking heart gives a sweet smile
but whats the point of talking about it
we risk being pathetic and ridiculous
and she tries to change the subject
you still live in rome
but salvatore ignores the question
he doesnt want to change the subject
he feels that everything is crumbling inside him the alibis and excuses he had had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance
and instead now the tables seem to have completely turned
without realizing he shouts desperately staring wildly at her and shaking her by the shoulders
what do you mean you were waiting for me
what are you saying
he controls himself at once continues breathing heavily
the last time we saw each other we made a date to meet at the cinema paradiso
and you didnt come you disappeared without leaving a trace nothing
ill tell you how many years have gone by more than thirty
quiet rears stream down elenas face glisten with the reflections of the lightning and the waves
i kept that date
salvatore laughs at the absurdity of it
a nervous heartbroken laugh which slowly melts away as she goes on to say but i was late
tears continue to stream out of her blue eyes but she tells her story in a calm voice
i had a fight with my family
i tried to convince them again that they couldnt separate us
but it was futile
they had decided to leave sicily once and for all
which is what we did
i didnt know what to do any more what to say
and i said yes id do whatever they wanted
in return my father promised to let me see you one last time to say goodbye
but i hoped that by seeing each other we could take advantage of it and make a decision
i thought we would run away together
she holds back her sobs
dries her tears with the back of her hand and continues my father drove me to the movie theatre
but you werent in the projection booth
her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before
off screen and i didnt have time to wait for you to comeback
from the bottom of the spiral staircase elenas father is waiting nervously yells up at the projection booth
all right daddy
in the projection booth alfredo is sitting on a stool near the projector
seen from the rear the young elena is leaning over beside him she is excited her eyes are red and swollen with tears
off screen so i told alfredo how things stood and fiat i was leaving the same evening and i asked him to tell you everything
he was very kind he listened carefully then
alfredo answers young elena stroking her hair
sighing listen carefully to what i have to say
if you want me to tell toto what youve told me i will
but if you want my advice forget it
its better for both of you if you dont see each other
young elena gives a start of resentment listens with surprise
dear girl fire always turns into ashes
even the deepest love ends sooner or later
and after that other loves appear lots of them
toto he cant understand fiat now
if i tell him he wont believe it he d be capable of killing me
but you can understand youve got to understand
do it for him
salvatore sits there without moving pale as a sheet looks as if he had grown even older
as if the whole world has fallen in on him
for elena it was a painful but liberating story
she dries her last tears
its the first time ive had to chance to tell the story
i never mentioned it to anybody
in a daze alfredo damn him
he cast his spell on you too
i told him id take his advice
but before i went away i left you that note
salvatore gives her a quick look a questioning look
i was on my way down the stairs
her voice continues laid over the
afternoon flashback elena has already said goodbye to alfredo is on her way down the stairs but stops short
off screen i thought alfredo couldnt see me
so i snuck back up
she tip toes back without making any noise
goes over to the film winder
takes out a pen looks for a scrap of paper but doesnt see any
her eyes fall on the film receipts hanging on the nail
she tears off the top one turns it over and scribbles a message on the back
i wrote you where you could find me and that id wait for you
she hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail well in sight
she creeps out glancing at alfredo who hasnt noticed a thing
elena finishes telling her story
she heaves a jeep sigh
but you disappeared all the same
there is a haunted look in salvatores eyes he is searching his memory for something he cant find then suddenly sees as if in a dream
his hand thirty years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail over the others mechanically without even looking
and he shuts his eyes as if fearing the truth
her last words have wounded him
he shakes his head then in a faint voice oh how i looked for you elena
youll never know
i wrote telephoned nothing
nobody ever answered
but i dreamt of you for years
thats why i went away
and never came back here
and his anguish breaks free dissolving into quiet almost childish tears
elena is startled by his reaction
she caresses him passionately
they embrace and remain like that she with her face buried in his shoulder he leaning on hers with his tear filled eyes
even as the years passed in all the women i met i was only looking for you
i had success its true but there was always something missing
she is deeply moved goes on caressing him gently until he calms down
the car windows are steamed up
the sea the harbor the waves have disappeared
nothing remains but the sound of the storm
salvatore takes her face between his hands
they gaze at each other their faces practically touching
he murmurs id never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me
a crazy lunatic
she gives a faint smile
he wasnt crazy
in the beginning i was upset
i think i really hated him
but then with time i understood what he said
and your silence too
salvatore whispers one last dreadful revelation
and its as if he had got a terrible weight off his chest
but i never saw that note
he squints as if to stress the absurdity of the idea
i must have covered it with my hand without realizing it thats the only explanation
but strangely enough elena is not surprised
what difference does it make to find an explanation
thats the way it went
but alfredo didnt betray you he was the only one who really understood you
salvatore if you had chosen to be with me youd have never made your films
and that would have been a pity
because theyre wonderful ive seen them all
her eyes glitter with joy then she smiles almost ironically
but you shouldnt have gone and changed your name
you should have kept your own
tears stream down salvatores cheeks
he gives her a look of longing of desire
elena embraces him
they kiss with heartrending tenderness with the same passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces so many years ago
and they make love clasped in the cramped quarters of the car like two teenagers
passionate kisses embraces deep sighs
their hair damp with sweat their hands clasping their fingers interweaving
then the frenzy subsides into a deep tumultuous pleasure of immense loving and immense grief
as outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which seems suspended in empty space
signora annas hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round metal can on the table
these are the things he left to you
salvatore is sitting by the table
he has finished the cup of coffee signora anna has prepared for him
he picks up the stool recognizes it at once its the one alfredo had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put the reels
on the projector
when they showed your films on television he was happy
hed plop himself down there and all his ailments were forgotten
he knew all the words by heart every one and id describe what was going on
and when the papers talked about you i had to read them two or three times
salvatore examines the can wonders what it can be
he opens it inside is a reel of film wrapped in a plastic bag well preserved
those objects bring a pang to his heart and the things that anna said but he feels disappointed as if he expected to find something else
did he ever think of meeting me
one time your mother said that if he wanted youd have surely come
he got furious and said no toto mustnt come back to giancaldo never
he didnt say it to be mean
he was a decent man
who knows what he could have been thinking
towards the end hed say such strange things
and a moment before he shut his eyes he told your mother not to let you know
a cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly to the ground another handful is flung up
salvatore is in the projection booth looking through the countless yellowed receipts stuffed away in boxes
he looks at them one by one then throws them into the air
a desperate search almost a defiance of the passing of time
he continues with greater determination flings piles of receipts into the air glances at a few dates a film title tries to discover the oldest dates at the bottom
he moves swiftly his hands plunge in then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust
but to no avail
he stops short of breath
his eyes go over to the nails in the wall where other stacks of receipts are hanging
he gets up and goes to look at them thumbs it through them hastily in anger
he yanks off two or three packs which come off nail and all
only then does he notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper there are same more sheets much older almost brown
his eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of paper
he leans over picks themup and goes through them one by one delicately because they crumble in his fingers
and then all of a sudden some film titles he recognizes from that time
he goes on thumbing through them and all at once an astonished look appears on his face in his hands is a receipt that has been turned over
its the one
the message scribbled on it can still be seen
he reads it
off screen salvatore forgive me
ill explain later what happened
not finding you here was terrible
unfortunately this evening my mother and i are leaving for tuscany
were moving there
but you re the only one i love ill never be with anybody else i promise
heres the address of a girlfriend of mine where you can write to me
dont abandon me
love and kisses elena
he clasps the scrap of paper and his brimming eyes darken with regret
elena stands near the window overlooking the little square listening on the phone to salvatores voice
she can see him through the transparent curtain speaking on the phone down below in the cafe
when are you leaving
salvatore opens his eyes tosses away his cigarette
elena in the future maybe we could
elena interrupts him speaks softly tenderly
there is no future
theres only the past
even meeting last night was nothing but a dream a beautiful dream
smiling we never did it when we were kids remember
down in the cafe salvatore nods his head slowly desperately
now that its happened i dont think there could have been a better ending
salvatore glances one last time at that window
ill never agree with you
the square unusually empty
there is no one and no cars and motorcycles are parked in the middle
the stores are shut
and there is an unreal silence
the houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous pieces of gray canvas
only now does the camera discover in the distance a crowd of curious onlookers waiting in front of the movie house kept at a safe distance by firemen and policemen
old spaccafico is in the crowd
salvatore is also there
be gazes at the front of the old movie theatre
the inside of the theatre completely empty
all of a sudden a blinding flash and
a deafening roar rends the air accompanied by a surge of amazement in the crowd
and the cinema paradiso suddenly collapses folds inward and disappears for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air carried by the wind towards the
the echo of the explosion is also heard in elenas house
she is alone
and the bang distresses her as if something had burst inside her
from her face to
salvatores face stiff unmoving his eyes fixed on those falling ruins on that season of his life turning into smoke and dust
enveloped in the white cloud spaccafico stands crying in silence
mice dart out of the ruins in terror scamper nervously into the square
a group of youngsters scream amused and excited
among them elenas daughter smiling
salvatore sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys chasing the mice across the square hooting and laughing
as a white haired old tramp filthy and covered in rags makes his way through the crowd
there is an empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice the squares mine the squares mine the squares mine
salvatore recognizes him its the village idiot the one who used to close down the square at night
be watches him walk off raving with nobody even noticing
the crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once stood
the murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an airplane
from the ruins of the cinema paradiso fade to
salvatores hands giving a studio projectionist the rusty metal can left him by alfredo
please check the splices
as soon as youre ready you can start
congratulations on your film
a colleague of salvatore comes up behind him
the distributor is opening up the film earlier
the press conference is in the afternoon
the actors will also be there the producer just about everyone
an assistant comes up to them
the official notification of the award just came out but weve already received a mountain of telegrams
arent you happy
its all right
well talk about it later
salvatore walks off towards the viewing theatre
salvatore is by himself in the small viewing theatre
now the lights go down
the beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth and the screen lights up
a number trailer goes by and then salvatore sees the first shots
a start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him astounds him delights him
its the best piece of film he has ever seen
it consists of all the kisses alfredo cut out of the films and kept for him when he was a little boy
they have been spliced together one after the other at random same of them even upside down
and yet it looks like a first rate editing job
in rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses names famous and names unknown in the history of movies
greta garbo gary cooper alida valii rudolph valentino ingrid bergman clark gable anna magnani humphrey bogart marlene dietrich amedeo nazzari luisa ferida vittorio de sica rita hayworth tyrone power doris
durante massimo gironi marta abba fred astaire and ginger rogers assia noris
a whole movie season summed up in a few fragments a few seconds
a bizarre poignant melancholy parade
salvatore is overwhelmed moved to tears
it is the most profound act of love he has ever seen
he laughs as tears shine in his eyes
up on the screen another kiss the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film
and the age old words appear the end
