href b b patriot draft by robert rodat october woodlands
soaring old growth elms arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently curving deep water santee river
april upstream the swamps
hundreds of birds sing
shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu falling onto soft swaying ferns covering the high ground
the water is clear with fields of floating lily pads each with a stark white flower rising from it
a farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps
good fertile land hacked out of the wilderness
the perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley hops alfalfa and tobacco
two sturdy brothers nathan and samuel work one of the fields rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley
the house built of native brick is well constructed and well maintained
theres a barn a workshop and a forge
it is a home of substance rather than wealth
on the front porch margaret pumps a butter churn while her brother william watches
gabriel strong and handsome walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game birds over his shoulder
at his side walks thomas also carrying a musket
a perfect colonial workshop fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period
a foot powered lathe
a drop forge
a lifting saw
racks of tools planes hammers augers drills blocks all hanging in their places
all very well worn
francis marion methodically works his lathe turning a piece of hardwood shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor sharp chisel
hes in his late forties strong and weathered
his hands though big and callused handle the chisel with a surgeons precision
self educated and self sufficient he has built himself as he built his farm brick by brick from the coarse clay of the earth
a finely made rocking chair missing only the dowel on which marion is working sits on the work table
the chair is a work of art thin and light a spider web of perfectly turned wood no nails no glue
sitting on the woodpile susan a silent stone face wisp of a child watches her father
marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe carefully fits it into the chair inserts a peg and taps it into place
then he steps back and appraises his handiwork
he picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale countering with a three pound weight
the chair floats
marion blows softly on the weight which sinks
susan nods so far so good
marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it checking every angle
then the acid test
he takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat gingerly adding an ounce at a time
not a creak
he smiles and sits back with a sigh
the chair splinters under marions weight dumping him on his ass on a pile of broken wood
he picks up some of the wood about to fling it across the room but stops as susan shoots him a disapproving look
he calms himself
susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace
as she climbs back up to her perch marion steps over to his wood rack extracts a fresh dowel fits it into the lathe and starts all over again
marion leaves the workshop with susan at his side
nathan and samuel walk past exhausted from their day in the field
father i saw a post rider at the house
did you finish the upper field
we got it all cut and we bundled half of it
those swimming breaks cut into the day dont they
marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another trying to pass off the blame
gabriel and thomas walk out of the barn
father a post rider came from charleston
you have a letter inside
hows the spotted ones milk
shes near ready to calve
marion nods and motions for susan to go with gabriel and thomas to the house
she does so and marion walks on alone toward the loveliest spot on the farm
a beautiful view of the house barns river fields and hills beyond
a gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree
it reads above her name is a carving of the night sky at the center of which is the north star steady and guiding
he gives himself a moment to look at the grave then he starts picking apples speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter of fact than
and they bundled half
almost no trace of the boys you knew
a soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground
marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply
no she still hasnt spoken
margaret was her age when you
i remember the time at the river when we couldnt find catherine
you couldnt stop crying
and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time
marion pauses remembering
the crash of a plate breaking followed by the sound of an argument rises from the house below
marion shakes his head with an exasperated sigh
he heads down the hill toward the house now glowing from the lights of candles and oil lamps
pre dinner chaos
everyone talking at once
marions seven children and his two family servants abigail and aaron a middle aged black couple prepare dinner
susan silently watches from the stairs
marion walks in
i smell turnips
father samuel broke the blue plate
i did not
marion hands the apples to abigail and steps over to open his mail and dispatches
news of boston father
i hate turnips
william knocked it right out of my hands
samuel william both of you clean it up
marion hands a packet of pamphlets to gabriel and opens a letter
the assembly has been reconvened ive been called to
marions children go wild
were going to charleston
when father when
well leave tomorrow
the children erupt into cheers and thunder into the dining room
were going to charleston
marion and gabriel exchange a stone faced look
then marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply
i love turnips
marion follows his children into the dining room
the only sounds are the soft calls of a few nightbirds and the drone of cicadas
a faint light moves through the downstairs passing windows in the otherwise dark house
marion holding a candle does a fathers bedtime check
the camera follows him as he makes his rounds into the kitchen
everything is clean and put away in its proper place
the main hallway
marion checks that the doors are closed and bolted
he heads up the stairs
marion enters finding william asleep on the floor and nathan and samuel in bed
he lifts william into bed takes a slingshot from nathans hand tucks in samuel and walks out
marion steps to the doorway finding margaret and susan at the window looking up at the night sky
now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the big dipper and thats the north star thats her
susan gazes up at the north star
the girls notice marion and climb into bed
he puts a chair against susans bed and kisses her
he pulls a blanket up around margaret who whispers it helps her to know mothers there
marion nods with a thin smile kisses margaret and walks out
squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as thomas lying on the floor deploys his men
gabriel reads the new pamphlets and broadsides
marion walks in and pours a drink
gabriel hands several of the pamphlets to his father
the new york and rhode island assemblies have been dissolved
the middle colonies
rioting both sides of the bay in chestertown they burned the customs house and tar and feathered the customs agent
he died of burns
in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and two redcoats
anything about the convention in philadelphia
poor richard says theyll make a declaration of independence by july
marion shakes his head and sits down carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box
he begins reading
scott higgins joined the militia
marion hears but doesnt respond
thomas looks up from his lead soldiers
a year younger than gabriel and thomas wait for a reaction
there is none
gabriel goes back to reading and thomas resumes playing with his toy soldiers
marions eyes drift from the page to gabriel
the marion family in two tightly packed carriages drives on a beautiful road cut through the swamps
the canopy of swamp maples and weeping willows forms a tunnel of green mottled by sunlight
the two carriages pass a view of their entire valley
scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields surrounding the town of bennington
passing through rolling farmland the marions head toward the coast
they pass a large contingent of south carolina militia drilling in a field
the children particularly gabriel watch avidly
a big bustling city
marion and gabriel negotiate the carriages through the busy streets
the children watch wide eyed seeing taverns a public gallows drunkards street entertainers well dressed ladies attended by their maids food venders a man with a trained bear
marion and his children pull up
charlotte motte hurries out
shes in her mid thirties beautiful with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can
the children leap from the carriages and swarm around her embracing her smothering her with kisses
margaret william look at you
to marion theyre huge
what have you been feeding them
theyre from good stock on their mothers side
charlotte hustles the children toward the door
come come inside wait until you see what i have
what do you have
charlotte sweeps past marion who smiles and follows her into the house
marion watches as charlotte finishes handing out presents
susan plays with a new doll
william has half a dozen new spinning tops skimming around the floor
margaret holds a new dress up to herself
samuel nathan and thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers
gabriel looks through a new book
charlotte sees marion watching her rises and joins him at the doorway
you look well charlotte
as do you
suddenly thomas and samuel race through the doorway forcing marion and charlotte together their bodies close
they step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles
the moment is broken by the sound of children
marion and charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them
down the block from the motte house
a yelling crowd of sons of liberty is massed around a liberty tree from which hang dozens of glowing lanterns
most of the men in the crowd are drunk
vendors sell rum ale food and banners emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend dont tread on me
scores of on lookers including respectable people as well as street urchins whores and drunkards watch the proceedings
several sons of liberty string up effigies of king george iii and governor wilmington
they light the effigies on fire
as they begin to blaze the crowd cheers
marions children except gabriel stand on the balcony watching the mob
marion steps out onto the balcony
inside all of you
the children turn to marion with stricken expressions
the children turn back to the mob
marion joins them
they see gabriel making his way through the crowd
he sees them and waves then enters the house
a moment later charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees in the square a pair of drunk sons of liberty pull down one of the smoldering effigies cut off
its head then start hacking at its groin with a sword
appalled charlotte shoots a glare at marion and snaps at the children
all of you
the children start to protest but a glance at charlottes resolute expression makes them think better of it
they file into the house
charlotte shoots a glare at marion and shoos the children inside
gabriel steps out and joins them
the british army is barricaded in boston
harry lee is here from virginia recruiting for a continental army
is that why the assembly was convened
he seeks a levy of troops and money
and the governor
he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee hell dissolve the body
which would force our delegates in philadelphia to vote for independence
and send us to war alongside massachusetts
our governor is a bigger fool than i thought
lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist
marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of lees expectations
marion turns back to watch the mob
the capital building of south carolina
a large crowd of lower class men and women is massed in front of the assembly hall
as well dressed assemblymen walk into the building the crowd yells words of encouragement to some and berates others
in the square in front of the assembly hall a squadron of blue uniformed american continental soldiers drills
a recruiting table is being set up by a continental captain and several military clerks
marion and gabriel walk across the square toward the assembly hall
as they push their way through the crowd gabriel eyes the continentals
two dozen angry yelling men of property
among them are robinson hamill and johnson who are patriots
opposed to them are simms withington and baldridge who are loyalists loyal the the king
as marion makes his way to his seat the speaker of the assembly pounds his gavel
slowly the room quiets down
our first order of business
and out last if we vote a levy
the room erupts
simms you do not have the floor
the room settles down
our first order of business is an address by colonel harry lee of the continental army
an imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of the assembly
hes colonel harry lee about marions age and cut from the same cloth strong weathered with a powerful bearing
the room quiets down
lee sees marion and offers a familiar nod which marion returns stone faced
then lee speaks simply and clearly
you all know why i am here
i am not an orator and i will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause
i am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from philadelphia it will soon be a formal state of war
in preparation for that eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a continental army
i ask south carolina to be the ninth
colonel lee massachusetts may be at war along with new hampshire and rhode island and virginia but south carolina is not at war
massachusetts and new hampshire are not as far from south carolina as you might think and the war theyre fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies
its for the independence of a nation
and what nation is that
robinson one of the patriots stands up
an american nation
colonel lee with your permission
those of us who call ourselves patriots are not seeking to give birth to an american nation but to protect one that already exists
it was born a hundred and seventy years ago at jamestown virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested
we are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away
were i an orator those are the exact words i would have spoken
mister robinson tell me why should i trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away
laughter from the loyalists
surprise from lee and the patriots
in the gallery gabriel winces
an elected legislature can trample a mans rights just as easily as a king can
captain marion i understood you to be a patriot
its mister marion
i understood him to be a patriot as well
if you mean by a patriot am i angry at the townsend acts and the stamp act
then im a patriot
and what of the navigation act
should i be permitted to sell my tobacco to the french traders on martinique
yes and its an intrusion into my affairs that i cant
and what of the greedy self serving bastards who sit as magistrates on the admiralty court and have fined nearly every man in this room
should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to england
ill do it myself
beat and do i believe that the american colonies should stand as a separate independent nation free from the reins of king and parliament
i do and if that makes a patriot then im a patriot
marion grows more serious
but if youre asking whether im willing to go to war with england the answer is no
ive been to war and i have no desire to do so again
the room is quiet the assemblymen having been thrown off balance
gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his fathers speech
this from the same captain francis marion whose anger was so famous during the wilderness campaign
marion glares at robinson then smiles
i was intemperate in my youth
my departed wife god bless her soul dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility
robinson looks derisively at marion
temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear
marion bristles but before he can answer lee steps in
mister robinson i fought with captain marion in the french and indian war including the wilderness campaign
we served as scouts under washington and i have no doubts about captain marions courage or competence on a battlefield
theres not a man in this room or anywhere for that matter to whom i would more willingly trust my life
i stand corrected
nonetheless i would like to know mister marion how
lees oratorical skills peter out
damn it francis
how in gods name do you expect to gain independence without going to war
harry harry harry
marion and lee drop all formality and become nothing more than two old friends pissed off
my hairy arse
you live in a cave if you think well get independence without war
the speaker pounds his gavel
this is not a tavern
wasnt it a union jack we fought under
a long time ago
thats a damn long time
the speaker pounds his gavel again
marion and lee ignore the speaker
you were an englishman then
i was an american i just didnt know it yet
the astonished assemblymen and now even the speaker watch the argument avidly turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder
we dont have to go to war to gain independence
there are a thousand avenues other than war at our disposal
name five hundred
royal petition delegates to court judicial redress economic boycott bribery
thats five keep going
time royal succession regicide bribery
you said bribery twice
marion speaks slowly and firmly
we do not have to go to war to gain independence
lee says nothing for a moment then he speaks more seriously quietly grimly
francis i was at bunker hill
it was as bad as anything you and i saw on the frontier
worse than the slaughter at the ashuelot river
the british advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range
and still they advanced and they took the ground
that is the measure of their resolve
if your principles dictate independence then war is the only way
it has come to that
marion is silent for a long moment
he softens finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to
i have seven children
my wife is dead
whos to care for them if i go to war
lee is stunned by marions honesty and his show of weakness
at first lee has no answer then wars are not fought only by childless men
a man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles
thats what im doing
i will not fight and because i wont i will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead
and your principles
im a parent i dont have the luxury of principles
the other assemblymen both patriots and loyalists stare at him appalled
marion feeling weak sits down
lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment
then lee turns to robinson who addresses the chair
mister speaker i call for a vote on a levy to the continental army
the vote is taken on a roll call
gabriel watches from the gallery
in the gallery gabriel turns and walks out
the roll call continues
marion sits eyes straight ahead
the crowd waits
the doors open and a page boy dashes out and runs to the continental captain at the recruiting table
twenty eight to twelve the levy passed
the continental captain motions to an assembled squadron
they raise their muskets and fire a volley into the air
other soldiers strike up a martial air on fifes and drums
volunteers crowd around the recruiting table yelling and jostling for position
the delegates walk out
both patriots and loyalists give marion a wide berth
marion sees gabriel standing near the crowd at the recruiting table
marion walks up to him
father ive lost respect for you
i thought you were a man of principle
when you have children i hope youll understand
when i have children i hope i dont hide behind them
marion looks closely at gabriel
do you intend to enlist without my permission
they lock eyes for a moment then gabriel turns from his father and walks away joining the crush around the recruiting table
marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos
the fifes and drums continue to play
marion doesnt hear them
harry lee walks out of the assembly hall with a triumphant group of patriots who look at marion coldly
lee excuses himself and steps over next to marion
lee sees that marion is watching gabriel at the enlistment table
one of yours
i recognize him now
is he as imprudent as his father was at his age
no thank the lord
hes more like his mother
ill see to it that he serves under me
they shake hands
then lee walks over to the soldiers
marion takes a last look at gabriel then heads off through the crowded square moving against the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table
the apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with blossoms
marion plows a field
nathan leads the plowhorse
samuel follows breaking up the clods of dirt
they stop to catch their breath
a soft wind blows
marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice
he hears nothing
he snaps the reins and continues plowing
thomas steps up into the attic
he finds a trunk and opens it
lifting out some blankets he uncovers a trove of marions old military gear a worn battle coat a box of medals a military sword rusted into its scabbard
thomas puts on the coat which hangs off his narrow shoulders
he stands in front of a dusty mirror appraising himself then stops as he hears footsteps coming up the stairs
its marion tired and dirty from his plowing
thomas grimaces expecting him to be angry but sees him shake his head gently
not yet thomas
marion looks closely at his son giving him the courtesy of really thinking about the answer
but its already been two years and thats two more years
the war could be over by then
thomas considers it then nods
marion offers his hand
they shake firmly like adults
marion takes the coat off thomas and puts it back in the trunk
they walk down the stairs together
all is quiet
a dawn mist hovers close over the ground
some sparrows feed at the base of the apple tree near the gravesite
low and rolling
the birds stop feeding uneasy then fly away
at another roll of the distant thunder marion awakes
he gets out of bed and pulls on his clothes
marion steps out to his front porch and listens
he knows the sound the distant staccato booms of cannon and the one by one the children join him
thomas nathan and samuel listen analytically
margaret and susan press close against their father
william looks curiously at the cloudless sky
is it going to rain
thats not thunder
the sound becomes deeper more ominous
they all notice the change
lots of them
how far away
four five miles
just east of it
are we safe here
marion puts on a smile
we could go stay at aunt charlottes farm
shes to the west
no therell be skirmishers on the roads
were safer here
thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets
he gives one to nathan and offers the other to his father
put those away
but father they might come this way
put them away
reluctantly thomas takes the muskets back into the house
ill be in the workshop
samuel the cows
thomas attend to your studies here on the porch
nathan on the back porch
if you see anyone come get me
margaret please keep william close to you
no one is to go past the yard wall
they all nod
marion walks off toward the workshop followed by susan
the others hesitate
they head off to do as they were told
marion works the lathe
susan watches from her perch on the woodpile
the sound of a crash from inside the barn
an angry cow runs out of the barn dragging a tenacious samuel who is holding onto the cows neck
samuels grip fails and he lands in the dirt
the cow runs about thirty yards down the hill stopping on the bank of the river
samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the cow
as samuel approaches the cow he see it skittishly approaching then retreating from the water
then he sees the cause the water in the river has a pale pink hue
samuel stares at it trying to figure out what it is
behind him margaret sees her brother beyond the yard wall
he doesnt respond
margaret trailed by william walks down toward samuel
samuel get up to the house
you heard father
then she sees it too
the pale pink is turning redder and redder
and then the bodies
first one then more many more
those with wide open wounds are already drained of blood
others are still seeping leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water
samuel margaret and william stand frozen appalled and fascinated
marion steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river
he cant see what theyre looking at
irritated he walks toward them
then as he nears the river he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children
he quickens his stride speaking calmly but firmly careful not to frighten them
up to the house now
all of you come on
marion stands on the front porch looking out into the night listening hearing nothing
he glances up at the star filled sky tracking his eyes from the big dipper to the north star
behind the house a figure in the darkness carrying a musket moves from shadow to shadow
margaret and samuel and william talk their voices low
theyre going to come
were going to have to fight them off
father will do that
theyll probably kill us men and do lord knows what to you women
they all stop
something moved behind the kitchen
margaret silently eases the others out of the room through the darkened hall toward their father
william and samuel cry out
the figure moves toward them
marion on the porch hears the scream races into the house
he sees the figure moves toward it
the figure moves into the light
marion sees the bloodied face
gabriel is wounded battered and dirty
he carries a musket and a dispatch case
marion catches him and eases him to a seat
the battle were you there
margaret get bandages and water
thomas the porch eyes open
marion checks gabriels wounds which are nasty but not life threatening
have you seen any redcoats
margaret brings water and linen to marion who expertly cleans gabriels wounds and applies field dressings
it wasnt like saratoga
there we stayed in the trees but this time gates marched us straight at the redcoats
they fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw
i was given these dispatches
i saw virginia regulars surrender
as they laid down their weapons the british green dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits
killed them all over two hundred men
they had surrendered
gabriel tries to rise
i have to get these dispatches to hillsboro
youre in no condition to ride
i have no choice i
gabriel passes out
marion catches him and carries him to a day bed in the parlor
as marion lays him down they hear heavy musket fire very close
marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night the children cluster around him seeing a strange sight
then a musket fires creating a flash of light that illuminates a tableau of soldiers about three dozen redcoats and as many patriots
the strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an ensuing volley of shots in every direction
then darkness punctuated by screams of pain confused hollering and the rustling of armed men in movement
then the pattern repeats itself a musket fires illuminating a tableau of targets for another murderous margaret take william and susan down to the root cellar
thomas go to the back porch
nathan and samuel the side windows
keep out of sight
they hurry off
marion steps into the house and opens his gun cabinet
he extracts two pistols and a pair of muskets
then he steps back to the front door
he waits and watches
the morning mist lies low over the field
marion warily approaches the scene of the battle
he carries a pennsylvania rifle has another slung over his shoulder and has a pair of pistols in his belt
as marion nears the field he sees appearing out of the low mist a nightmarish vision
young redcoats and continentals are scattered on the ground dead and wounded
many have been hideously torn apart by the massive musket balls
blood is everywhere
marion hurries back toward the house
marion loads the wounded men onto a wagon helped by thomas nathan and samuel
the porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital
there are about two dozen wounded a few more patriots than redcoats
thomas nathan samuel and margaret help marion tend the soldiers
william and susan watch from inside
marion treats an arm wound retying a tourniquet stanching an ugly flow of blood
marion moves to the next of the wounded
thomas starts to help but marion shakes his head
marion moves on to another
thomas help me turn him over
they turn over a young continental and see a horrible wound on his back
a hard glare from marion strengthens his son
together they bandage the wounded man
margaret and samuel give water and food
marion kneels next to a continental sergeant and a couple of privates who are less severely wounded than the others
marion nods uncomfortable with the thanks
sergeant there are seventeen wounded men here
seven redcoats and ten patriots counting my son inside
that puts me in a difficult position
the continental sergeant knows whats coming
the privates and marions children dont
you three are the least severely wounded
i have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere
the privates are stunned at the request
the sergeant looks at marions children and nods
he struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two privates to do the same
come on boys
nathan samuel and margaret are confused
but theyre wounded
there are rules even in war
marion motions to a large old scar on his arm
after the battle of ashuelot river against the french i got this and the one on my leg
i couldnt walk
washington had to march north
he left me with other wounded men and a like number of french prisoners
nine for nine
when the french found us their surgeon gave me the best of care
well be safe this way
marions children are not convinced
the sergeant and the two privates gather themselves to leave
your best chance is in bennington seven miles east along the river road
the wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road
marion and his children watch them go
a dirt road runs along the edge of the santee swamps stretching toward green rolling hills beyond
then the ground begins to shake
a thunderous sound rises louder and louder
from around a bend a detachment of cavalry gallops british green dragoons
the finest light calvary in the world
hard strong men
their mounts are powerful muscled and perfectly cared for
the dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans marked with the blood and dirt of a recent battle
tired and vigorous
theyre armed to the teeth
each carries a flintlock carbine a brace of pistols and a sword
some carry lances as well
regimental flags flutter
they are forty of the most imposing frightening horsemen imaginable
and at their head the most imposing man of all lt
colonel banastre tarleton
a powerful horseman on the best mount of the entire troop
no temper just hard cold authority
his men struggle to keep up with him
behind them two dozen loyalist militia calvary american civilians loyal to the crown
nasty local men
riding at their head is amos gaskins grizzled lower class wearing ill fitting patricians clothing
the three wounded patriots who just left marions farm hear the horses coming stand on the side of the road raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender
the green dragoons rein in
tarleton stops in front of the three men
he motions for one of his men to lower his weapon
then he speaks calmly quietly to the wounded men
first virginia regulars under colonel hamilton
who cared for your wounds
with a lace table cloth
tarleton turns to his second in command major wilkins
tarleton rides off
wilkins and several other dragoons calmly fire their pistols killing the three patriots
the troops ride off thundering past the bodies of the three men
marion and his children tend the wounded
gabriel weak but walking helps
redcoat infantry appears out of the woods heading toward the house
three dozen men
scouts and flank units covering the main body
marion gathers his family around him stands and waits
the redcoats get to the house warily eye the wounded and marions family
a young redcoat lieutenant motions his men to check out the house and barn then looks at the wounded doing a silent count
he turns to marion
these men are of my regiment
one of the redcoats emerges from the house carrying gabriels dispatch case
rebel dispatches sir
gabriel steps up
i carried those
i was wounded these people gave me care they have nothing to do with the dispatches
the sound of horses hooves
all turn and see thundering down the road toward the house
its an impressive frightening sight
they rein in their horses stopping in the yard enveloped by their trailing cloud of dust
tarleton surveys the scene then speaks to the young redcoat lieutenant
lieutenant have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at camden crossing
use whatever horses and wagons you can find here
he hands the dispatch case to tarleton
we found this sir
tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents
who carried this
re gabriel take this one to camden hes a spy
he will be hung
marion quickly steps between tarleton and gabriel
colonel hes a dispatch rider and thats a marked dispatch case
tarleton ignores marion and continues speaking to the lieutenant
fire the house and barns
and the rebel wounded
the redcoat lieutenant and several of his men are shocked by the order
marion is also but hes more concerned with gabriel
he pushes past some redcoats and stands at tarletons mount looking up
a dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying
tarleton finally pays attention to marion
he looks down at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles
were not going to hold him were going to hang him
tarleton draws his pistol and points it at marion
gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly redcoat corporal
oh hes your son
you should have taught him about loyalty
colonel i beg you please reconsider
by the rules of war a dispatch rider with a marked case
tarleton controls his shifting mount keeping his pistol trained on marions face
would you like a lesson in the rules of war
marion doesnt answer
he looks up at tarleton coldly taking his measure waiting to see if hes going to pull the trigger
tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his aim pointing the pistol among marions children
perhaps your children would
the children are terrified
thomas is more angry than frightened
marion quickly steps between the pistol and his children and speaks quietly to tarleton
no lesson is necessary
tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of marions children
he smiles at the effect
then he holsters his pistol
marion and his children watch as one of the redcoats ties gabriels hands
thomas is beside himself
father do something
thomas grows increasingly agitated
he sees that his father is going to do nothing
he gauges the distance between gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods
then suddenly thomas springs
he runs throwing himself into the two redcoats holding gabriel knocking them down
gabriel is too shocked to take flight
a few of the redcoats including one of the ones knocked down shake their heads with sad laughter at thomas ineffectual gesture
one of them grabs thomas by the scruff of the neck and yanks him to his feet
tarleton sees the commotion
without pausing he draws his thomas is thrown to his knees by the shot
stunned confused he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in his chest
marion horrified catches thomas as he falls easing him to the ground
margaret cries out
the other children are stunned to silence
the redcoats are frozen in place
tarletons green dragoons are impassive having seen worse
marion holds his son looking at the huge incomprehensible wound
he knows that thomas is already dead though his body still moves
marions stunned agony turns to fury
he rises his eyes trained on tarleton then stops as
tarleton raises a second loaded pistol and a dozen green dragoons raise pistols and carbines aiming them at marion and his children
marion freezes torn between his fury and fear for his other children
he locks his eyes on tarleton
tarleton calmly baths in marions anger
then with a hard yank of the reins he jerks his horses head around and utters a sharp command to wilkins
tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking back
his green dragoons thunder after him
marions children begin to cry
margaret tries to revive thomas lifeless body gently caressing his cheek
thomas please thomas
the redcoats watch in silence
marion looks at gabriel and turns to the redcoat lieutenant
the lieutenant wavers but he looks after the departing tarleton and his resolve stiffens
he turns coldly to marion
i have my orders
the redcoat infantrymen scatter some to get horses and wagons from the barn others to torch the buildings
marion stands among the children all of whom look to marion with pleading eyes waiting for him to do something
papa look what they did to thomas
father theyre going to take gabriel
with stone faced fury marion watches the redcoats do their work
from the barns they hear the sounds of muskets firing and the squeals of the livestock being killed
other redcoats torch the house barn and outbuildings
the redcoats bring out marions wagons and carriages and begin loading the redcoat wounded
the redcoat lieutenant and several of his men walk among the patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet begging for mercy
the redcoats quickly open fire as if to get it over with
the wounded patriots cry out
gabriel his hands bound behind him looks to his father with a combination of resoluteness and fear
marion locks eyes with him
father you cant let them take him
watch as the redcoats form up and move out leading gabriel on a tether
gabriel looks back helplessly but a hard jerk on the rope by one of the redcoats turns him around
they disappear around a bend in the road
the instant the redcoats are out of sight marion speaks firmly to his weeping children
marion strides to his front door and enters the burning inside fire everywhere
picking a route between the flames marion walks to his gun cabinet
he opens it and pulls out weapons two pennsylvania rifles two muskets two pistols a long bladed knife and a worn tomahawk
he carries them with powder horns and ammunition pouches back toward the door
marion walks out of the burning house
without breaking stride marion throws muskets to nathan and samuel who catch them
margaret take william and susan to the river shed
if were not back by dawn go up the river to the richardsons house
theyll take you to your aunt charlottes farm
nathan samuel and i are going to get gabriel
but what about thomas
take care of william and susan
marion runs off toward the woods nathan and samuel follow
margaret hesitates then herds william and susan toward the river
the house is enveloped in flames
marion runs breathing hard keeping a punishing steady pace
nathan and samuel run behind less winded than their father
marion makes up with cold fury what he lacks in youth
marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill
crawls the last few feet
nathan and samuel just behind him
looks over the hillside
a path runs through a glen about fifty feet below
marions eyes dart absorbing the terrain looking for advantage
the boys go where theyre told
ill fire first
then nathan kill whoever is standing closest to gabriel
samuel kill the last man in the line
they stagger under the weight of the orders
marion notices but continues
after that samuel load for nathan
if something happens to me put down your weapons and run as fast as you can that way downhill
hide in the brush by the river then make your way home get the others and go to aunt charlottes farm
the boys hesitate
marion looks at them firmly
marion disappears into the underbrush
the dozen redcoats approach
leading gabriel on the rope
marion waits in the thick undergrowth
on the hillside nathan and samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened troubled look
the redcoats enter the glen
marion waits then picks his moment and fires killing the redcoat lieutenant with a shot to the chest
nathan and samuel instantly fire dropping the last redcoat in the line and the one holding gabriels rope
the redcoats stop in confusion
gabriel kneels out of the line of fire
the redcoat sergeant takes command
marion kills the sergeant with a shot to the throat
samuel finishes reloading swaps muskets with nathan who marion fires killing the corporal the last man of rank
marion ducks to the side as a volley of redcoat musket fire tears into the spot marked by marions rifle smoke
from this moment on marion never stops moving
he strides rather than runs staying just inside the brush offering only glimpses of himself
he changes his pace and direction repeatedly ducking and weaving firing and loading while moving
he never gives the redcoats a stationary target especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock
its an indian tactic and it works
the redcoats track him with their barrels about to fire
marion suddenly stops dead reverses direction several redcoats fire and miss
six redcoats left
some primed some reloading
a redcoat draws a bead on marion who drops to the ground and fires killing him
samuel weeping as he loads hands a primed musket to nathan who fires
the redcoats turn their attention to the spot marked by marion sees the redcoats aiming toward the boys
he instantly strides out into the open drawing the redcoats attention from his sons
marion fires both his pistols killing two redcoats
one redcoat finishes reloading
marion rushes him shoves aside the barrel and slams him in the face with the butt of the musket
this is a different marion a vicious savage marion killing with stunning brutality
marion drops his own expended rifle and catches the redcoats loaded musket before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another redcoats belly and fires
two redcoats left neither finished loading
marion charges drawing his tomahawk ignores a glancing bayonet wound to the neck hacks a redcoat open
splattering himself with blood
the final redcoat a cherubic face young man ducks into the woods
marion tears after him
the young redcoat blasting through the brush
the older marion panting losing ground
the redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side
marion throws his tomahawk which flies through the air and marion runs to the wounded redcoat grabs his hair yanks back his head and slits his throat
then without pausing marion wrenches the tomahawk from the redcoats body and races back toward his sons
nathan and a weeping samuel stunned at the carnage stumble down the hillside toward gabriel
marion runs up and motions for them to stop
marion checks the redcoats making sure theyre all dead
nathan untie gabriel
they quickly do so as marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush
in a moment theyre ready
marion finds his own pennsylvania rifle then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush
the house and barns smolder
thomas body lies in the yard
nearby the bodies of the patriot wounded now dead
margaret waits in the shed with william and susan
they hear a sound
margaret pulls her sister and brother to her and waits
the door opens
its marion and gabriel nathan and samuel
margaret and the little ones throw themselves into marions arms
margaret notices the blood on marion
she hesitates but her relief tightens her embrace
marion trailed by his children walks past the soldiers bodies and the remains of their house
he kneels down next to thomas body
on the ground marion sees several of thomas lead soldiers
he stares at them for a moment picks them up and puts them in his pocket
marion picks up thomas and carries him up the hill toward the apple tree and elizabeths grave
the children follow
marion digs a grave
the children watch
the only sounds are marions labored breathing the rasp of the shovel and the rustle of dead leaves blown along the ground by a soft wind
some dry leaves catch on thomas still wet blood as if trying to bandage his wound
marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave
near tears and unsure of what to do next he turns to elizabeths gravestone
the soft wind blows
he turns and sees his children looking up at him
holding in his own tears he gathers the children around him and lets them cry
hes with your mother now
he stiffens speaking formally lord we pray that you accept this child thomas marion and give him a place at your side with his mother
we ask that you embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which your mercy works
this we ask in your name
marion looks at elizabeths grave then he gently eases his children away
marion and his children stop at the overlook seeing the santee river valley spread out before them
the smoke from two dozen farms rises
the morgans the halseys williams stantons
the smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky forming what looks like stormclouds
they walk on
marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods
they see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house gabriel and charlotte
father its safe
marion hustles the children out of the woods
charlotte sits holding a sleeping susan
the other children lie awake on pallets
marion still streaked with dried blood and sweat tucks william and margaret into bed
marion moves on to nathan
i killed those men
dont blame yourself you did what i told you to do
im glad i killed them
he turns to samuel whos cried out
marion reaches out to touch him but samuel recoils from marions blood streaked hand
marion sighs and tucks him in
try to get some sleep
marion moves to take susan from charlotte who shakes her head
ill stay with them
marion nods and leaves charlotte with the children
he starts to pace but grows unsteady
he rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his mouth as he looks upstairs knowing his children are searching for the solace of sleep
he opens a cabinet pulls out a bottle of liquor pours and drinks
the sound of horsemen
gabriel walks in
how are they
marion just shakes his head
gates is at hillsboro with the continental army
ill leave in the morning to join him
marion and gabriel stand in silence for a long moment neither one finding words
then gabriel speaks softly
ill tend my horse
he leaves marion alone
marion stares at the fireplace
charlotte walks in carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing
marion is silent
charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to marion
he takes off his shirt
she begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck
how did this
how did i let this happen
you couldnt have known
i should have known
once i would have
i used to be wary
and today i watched my son killed before my eyes
your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her
thomas is dead but youve done nothing for which you should be ashamed
ive done nothing and for that i am ashamed
she looks at him closely
if you go ill care for them as if they were my own
ill leave in the morning with gabriel
he stares past her looking at the flames in the fireplace
she tends his wounds
marion and gabriel finish saddling their horses
marion embraces nathan and samuel
then he turns to margaret william and susan
when will you be back
i dont know william
margaret puts her arm around william
no not tomorrow
marion kisses them both then moves on to susan trying to coax a word out of the silent four year old goodbye
she just looks at him
just one word
thats all i want
susan shakes her head
he sighs rises and turns to charlotte
they hesitate then embrace hugging deeply but a bit awkwardly holding each other just a moment longer than one would expect
she looks up at him
he kisses her on the cheek
marion mounts up
and he and gabriel head off susan unnoticed and unheard whispers goodbye
marion and gabriel ride away
marion and gabriel ride past the signs of a small skirmish
a burning farm
marion and gabriel ride to the crest of a hill
a vista spreads out before them
they see an awesome sight a massive slash of red approaches a massive slash of blue
a battle is taking place about five miles away
gabriel starts to spur his horse but marion restrains him
no its too late
marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army
the distant slash of red stops
marion and gabriel hear only a gentle wind and some nearby songbirds
then from a black mass of the side of the red slash a sudden silent eruption of white smoke
an instant later the blue slash quivers
a moment later the sound of the cannons rumbles up the hill and rolls over marion and gabriel
the red slash stops moving
it darkens as thousands of redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position
marions eyes dart
he knows whats coming
break for the trees
break for the trees
a massive eruption of white smoke billows from the red slash
an instant later the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant patriots fall
the sound of the british muskets reaches marion and gabriel like the pattering of rain
then the smoke of ineffective scattered volleys erupts from the patriot lines
the red line holds firm
send them to cover
but the blue line of the patriots stays in the open field
from behind the redcoats fast moving green and red masses move quickly onto the battlefield
father we have to do something
the british cavalry slams into the blue line shattering it
tiny bits of blue move in every direction
its already over
marion watches appalled
at this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful
marion turns his horse and heads down the hill toward the rear of the patriot lines
screams of agony
a few hundred battered patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move out
the battle so bloodless and beautiful at a distance has in its aftermath become horrifically painful and ugly
marion and gabriel ride into camp passing nervous sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs and arms
marion sees harry lee at a make shift command post barking orders trying to pull things together
damn you sergeant dont move the wounded twice put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons
lieutenant detail men for outriders
we move out as soon as the wounded are ready
the lieutenant rushes off
lee notices marion and gabriel surprised to see them
he jerks his head for them to follow him into once out of sight of the men lee loses his command bearing
exhausted he leans on his campaign table and looks closely at marion asking with his eyes why marion is here
green dragoons came to my home killed my son thomas
it was tarleton himself
im sorry i wasnt here for this
theres nothing you could have done gates is a damned fool
i begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break cornwallis was muzzle to muzzle
he spent too many years in the british army
where is he now
last anyone saw riding hard northeast his staff a hundred yards behind trying to catch up
whos in command
i am i think
what are my orders
lee gives marion a tired smile
if you want orders ive got some for you
lee rolls out a map for marion and gabriel
were a breath away from losing this war
in the north washington is reeling from valley forge running and hiding from clinton and twelve thousand redcoats
pointing here in the south cornwallis has broken our back
he captured over five thousand of our troops when he took charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and new york
so now cornwallis will head north link up with clinton and finish off washington
and patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield
beat unless we can keep cornwallis in the south until the french arrive
a treaty was signed at versailles after our victory at saratoga
the french are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops
fall six months at the earliest
the bigger problem is where not when
the french fleet wont sail north of the chesapeake for fear of early storms
so youre going to try to keep cornwallis in the south until then
not me you
im going north with every continental regular i can find to reinforce washington or he wont last six weeks
you expect cornwallis to be held here by militia
not held just slowed down
theyre nothing but farmers and youre asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard
theyd be better off letting it move on
theyd be better off but the cause wouldnt be
how many men does cornwallis have under his command
four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry
beat including the green dragoons under tarleton
at the mention of tarleton marion nods
ill do what i can
lee quickly writes something
im giving you a field commission as a colonel
he hands it to marion
gabriel steps forward
colonel lee i request a transfer to colonel marions command
lee scribbles another order and hands it to gabriel
then he turns to marion
they duck out of the tent
marion and gabriel stand watching lee and his continental regulars move out
gabriel turns to marion
what now sir
we put out the word
well start along the south side of the santee
wed cover more ground if we split up
its safer if we stay together
gabriel steps in front of marion
colonel i didnt request this transfer because youre my father
i requested it because i believe in this cause and this is where i can do the most good
ive been doing this for two years
im the best scout in the continental army the best horseman the best shot the best scavenger and i know every deer path and swamp trail between here and charleston
is that so
beat my father taught me
marion looks at gabriel closely
did your father teach you humility
it didnt take
marion looks gabriel up and down
alright corporal you take bennington harrisville acworth and the farms along black swamp
ill take the north side of the river
well meet at snows island
they mount up
beat be careful
they ride off in different directions
marion rides into a small village passing several bodies in blue continental uniforms hanging from lampposts
marion stops in front of a tavern dismounts and enters
as marion walks in hes greeted by cold stares from half a dozen men huddles over their drinks
im looking for john billings
marion looks closely at the grim suspicious men
if he comes back from the dead tell him francis marion is looking for him
ill be sure to do that
as marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of madeira on one of the tables
a stand off
then a hulking figure appears in the shadows at the back doorway
hes john billings big coarse about marions age
billings jerks his head for marion to join him in the back room
marion and billings talk over a bottle
you expect to hold cornwallis with militia
i expect to try
trust you and harry lee
remember that damned overland you two thought up in to hit fort louis
how many men can you raise
dalton scott theyve got their reasons rev
oliver he believes in the cause some of the young bucks a few like me with nothing to lose
beat what about you
youve got a lot to lose
marion drains his glass and stands up
you coming or not
billings drains his glass
they walk out together
marion and billings ride away from the tavern passing the hanging patriot bodies
a cacophony of birds and insects
swamp maples and willows form a canopy over moss covered mounds and pools of plant choked water
gabriel leads several men riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp
they cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island joining a dozen and a half men including marion who kneels at a campfire
close shot several of thomas brightly painted lead soldiers melt in a cast iron pan
the little men fall to their knees then lose form turning into bubbling molten metal
the new arrivals dismount and greet the others
gabriel steps up behind marion and watches as he pours the lead into a bullet mold closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which hisses
father this war is about more than thomas
marion doesnt look up
if youre here only for revenge youre doing a disservice to him as well as yourself
how old are you
you know how old i am
god help us all when youre forty
marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan
gabriel shakes his head turns away and goes to tend his horse
a low thick swamp mist covers the encampment
marion sits alone by the embers of last nights campfire
the men are awake
some eat others talk
marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie
he takes the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch attached to his weapons belt
then he rises and heads over to the men
he surveys his brigade
twenty six men framers artisans mountain men none in uniform
marion walks among them nodding familiarly to several
he notices an imposing looking cherokee indian brother joseph standing a bit apart from the others
they exchange nods
he notices a stern looking man in partial clerical garb reverend
i heard about your son
marion accepts his condolences
he notes george dalton a tough looking rustic man with an ice cold distant stare
dalton doesnt respond
marion recognizes another face abner brown african american around thirty rugged
marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much as just give him their attention
you all have your own reasons for being here
i lost a son and i intend to kill the man who killed him
marion pauses and looks over at gabriel
but i dont consider that mans life adequate payment for the life of my son and killing him wont keep the sons of other men from dying
gabriel nods approvingly
cornwallis has to move north
we have to keep him right here
if hes south of the chesapeake when the french arrive if the french arrive we have a chance of winning this war
marion looks from face to face
eat get some rest we move out in two hours
marion heads back to his campsite passing gabriel without looking at him but very aware of his sons eyes on him
a massive british army field encampment
thousands of well armed veteran troops
large detachments of redcoats march through endless rows of tents
some are battle worn others are fresh troops moving out
tarleton and his green dragoons covered with dirt and sweat ride into the encampment
tarleton and wilkins peel off riding to the front of a farmhouse that has been commandeered for british headquarters
they dismount and stride in
british officers clerks and aides work
theyre in good spirits
lord cornwallis a proud man comfortable with command coldly notes one of his officers slapping another on the back
major huntington rolls out a map for cornwallis
the officers gather around the map
major this is not an adequate map
we have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from charleston
a useful place for our maps
im sorry sir it wont happen again
tarleton enters followed by wilkins
join us colonel
tarleton and wilkins join them around the map
gentlemen celebration is premature
we have a difficult campaign ahead of us
we are in predominately hostile country and we cannot rely on forage
as we move north the bulk of our supplies will reach us by sea through charleston which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line one that can only
be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown
multiple yes sir
cornwallis turns to his field officers paying particular attention to tarleton
nonetheless we must remember that this is a civil war
tarleton proudly holds cornwallis look
these colonials are our brethren and when this conflict is over we will be reestablishing commerce with them
surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults on civilians will cease
wilkins shifts uneasily
tarleton isnt cowed
i expect this war to be fought in a vigorous but civilized manner
cornwallis looks at his other officers
have i made myself clear gentlemen
multiple yes sir
cornwallis shifts his eyes back to tarleton who was not among those who spoke
tarleton pointedly pauses a moment then says yes sir
cornwallis turns his attention back to the map
his men gather around
tarleton and wilkins walk out and mount up
i believe he was speaking to us colonel
did you know that lord cornwallis father was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather
tarleton jerks his reins and rides off
wilkins laughs and follows
a british supply train of several dozen wagons a herd of horses and accompanying redcoats makes its way
on a wooded hillside gabriel lies on the ground observing the convoy
he eases back mounts up and rides off
marion and his men wait well hidden in the brush on a rise just above the bridge
gabriel rides up
less than a mile
forty one wagons a company of redcoat infantry horses at the rear
i didnt see any
marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word
gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father
the british convoy rounds the curve
when two thirds of the wagons have crossed the bridge marion fires killing the redcoat of highest rank a captain
billings and dalton heave corked bottles which break spreading their oily contents on the wooden bridge
brother joseph fires a flaming arrow igniting the oil
the bridge bursts into flames cutting off the tail of the convoy stranding a dozen wagons and the herd of horses on marions side of the river
a redcoat lieutenant takes command
across the river
marion calls to his men
kill the officers
marion and his men fire a withering volley killing all redcoats of rank two lieutenants a sergeant and several corporals
the leaderless redcoat privates take cover as marions men open up on the redcoats on their side of the river
with half of his men firing cover marion and the other half run to the wagons passing redcoat dead and wounded
dalton notices a wounded redcoat and pauses
the redcoat looks up imploringly at dalton who finishes reloading then coldly fires killing the helpless redcoat
marion gabriel and rev
oliver see dalton kill the wounded redcoat as they race toward the wagons british musketballs splintering trees all around them
the horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified bucking and rearing struggling in their traces
marion leaps into the seat of one wagon
gabriel and billings grab the reins of two more wagons
the redcoats keep up a steady fire
two of marions men fall one dead another wounded
marion gabriel and billings struggle to control the frightened horses backing them up around the curve to the cover of the woods
marions rearguard brother joseph abner dan scott and others withdraws in leapfrog firing back across the british musket balls slam into the trees and splinter the another of marions men
two of his comrades heave him onto one of the wagons
as marions men get the wagons turned and unblocked from each other they drive them off one after another
brother joseph abner and the rest of the rearguard make it to marion and leap into his wagon
marion snaps the reins and they thunder off away from the burning bridge and the firing redcoats
marions men tend their wounded and look through the british wagons taking inventory
two hundred sixty six brown bess muskets forty one casks of powder balls tamping
we have enough arms for an army
now all we need is an army
marion checks out a wagon full of tools with dan scott and rob fielding a couple of sharp eyed craftsmen
they overlap dialogue rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans
reamer boring tool
swage broach etching tool
a rolling gunsmiths shop
we can rifle those musket barrels
get another hundred yards out of em
well need a forge
weve got clay to make a chamber
oak to make charcoal
oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows
and we can yank a wagon wheel weight it rig a piston and drive shaft and well have a flywheel to power the bellows
scott and fielding exchange an impressed look
to fielding thats why hes a colonel
scott and fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work
marion hears a commotion of barking dogs and yelling men and strides over to find billings cowering before two huge great danes who stand guard at one of the wagons
shoot the damn things
dalton prepares to do so
put that pistol down
they followed us from the bridge
they wont let anyone near the wagon
marion steps forward speaking softly but firmly to the dogs
the dogs waver between obeying marion and ripping out his throat
dont you growl at me
the dogs decide to obey
marion lets them sniff his hand then firmly pats them
now lets see whats in this wagon
oliver and abner join him
billings eases past the dogs
abner opens a large case and finds it filled with bottles
rum french champagne madeira port
no wonder they were guarding it
gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs all perfectly coifed and stored on head shaped wig stands
oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers
my heavens personal correspondence of
marion grabs some papers scans them then finds matching cases on nearby wagons
these four wagons must be his
and the dogs too ill wager
i say we drink the wine shoot the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding
his journals letters maps books
abner calls from another wagon
colonel we got a wagon full of officers uniforms and more powder and muskets here
ignoring abner marion sits down on a stump with a pile of cornwallis papers and starts to read
marion sits at cornwallis ornate folding campaign desk reading cornwallis journal surrounded by cornwallis field gear which includes furniture music boxes oil paintings and an elaborate folding commode
the two great danes sit nearby eyeing marion warily
the men have divided themselves into two groups one coarse the other civilized each clustered around a separate fire
the coarse men including dalton brother joseph and randolph a grizzled black toothed mountain man drink and laugh loudly wearing cornwallis wigs askew
the civilized men including rev
oliver gabriel scott fielding and abner talk quietly
marion puts down the journal and walks over to the campfire where the rougher men are gathered
he stands just inside the firelight and speaks loudly so that all can hear today was hard earned but a good start
marion looks at dalton then turns to the other men as well
in the future wounded british soldiers will be given quarters
like they gave quarter to my family
my wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came
the redcoats locked the door and torched the house
you have my sympathy
but the order stands
and who are you to give an order like that
we all know what you did after fort wilderness
that hits home but marion remains calm
im your commanding officer
this is militia not regular army
i cant hold you here but as long as you stay youll follow my orders
marion looks from face to face
most begrudgingly nod
thats enough for marion
as he heads back to his own campfire hes intercepted by rev
oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other men except for gabriel and billings who overhear
for trying to impose some decency on that sort
dont depend on my decency
im one of that sort
marion walks on
oliver exchanges a look with gabriel then heads off
as marion joins gabriel and billings at his campfire billings grips his bottle
am i one of that sort
youre the worst of that sort
youre the sort that gives that sort a bad name
billings considers that then shrugs and takes a long drink
he hands the bottle to marion who takes an equally long drink
marion picks up his pennsylvania rifle
im going to check the watch
he disappears into the darkness leaving gabriel and billings at the campfire
he shouldnt make light
that redcoat should not have been killed
hes not making light
gabriel shoots billings a dubious look
you dont know him very well do you
hes my father
billings looks closely at gabriel
i know him well enough
dont fault him for having grown up on the frontier
it was a harder time and a harder place than you know
gabriel looks at billings then turns back to the fire
the men are beginning to stir gathering around the campfires cooking using pots pans and other gear from the stolen british wagons
marion reads cornwallis journal
he looks up stretches and walks over to a campfire where gabriel billings and rev
the dogs follow at a distance
ive just been inside the mind of a genius
lord cornwallis knows more about war than i could in a dozen lifetimes
cheerful news to greet the morn
his victories at charleston and camden were perfect strategically tactically logistically
but he has a weakness
they all turn to marion
lord cornwallis is brilliant
his weakness is that he knows it
pride is his weakness
the men consider that
personally id prefer stupidity
pride will do
begin montage series of shots as follows a volley of musket fire erupts from some thick underbrush cutting down half of a squadron of redcoats on the march
the surviving redcoats fire back into the trees at unseen targets to little effect
marion rides with about fifty men
a british supply convoy makes its way through the woods
suddenly marions men appear rising up from the ground as if by magic having been camouflaged by leaves and brush
they open fire on the convoy escort which holds for a moment then flees
marion rides with about seventy five men
cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously flings it across the room
marion rides with about one hundred men
marion and his men do an inventory of a large haul of stolen british supply wagons
the booty includes dozens of brass musical instruments some of which marions men blare in celebration
marion rides with about one hundred fifty men
marion gabriel and some of the other men watch as the flaming supports of a burning wooden bridge collapse into a river
a seething cornwallis stands at the same spot looking at the charred now cooled remains of the bridge
cornwallis angrily mounts up and rides off
his contrite staff officers mount up and follow
marion sits with his muddy feet on cornwallis campaign desk reading cornwallis journal with cornwallis great danes at his side
glittering lights shine from the camden inn a grand structure in the center of town
a line of opulent carriages discharges well dressed passengers arriving for a ball
ladies in their finery
redcoat and green dragoon officers in magnificent dress uniforms
cornwallis standing in front of a full length mirror is dressed by his valet while major halbert colonel huntington and tarleton look on
why am i here colonel halbert
for the ball sir
cornwallis holds his temper
why after six weeks are we still here to attend a ball
by now we should be attending balls in north carolina not south carolina
our supply line sir
excellent guess major
the valet puts a dress coat on cornwallis who looks at the garment with deepest disdain
and what praytell is this
i borrowed it from colonel north
i took it in at the back added wider epaulets a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs
its a horse blanket
to major halbert first my personal baggage then half the bridges and ferries between here and charleston burned a dozen convoys attacked
colonel if you cant secure our supply line against militia how do you expect to do so against colonial regulars or the french when they come
sir theyre not like regulars we cant find them and we dont know when or where theyre going to strike
and who leads these clever secretive fellows
we dont know sir
hes called the commander by some the swamp fox by others
colonel im a civilized man but im finding to difficult to remain civil
secure my supply line
cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay sighs and strides out
tarleton amused follows
at the far end of town marion gabriel billings dalton scott and several other men slip through the shadows into an alley
the lights from the ball shine from down the street and the musical strains of a minuet drift to them through the night
a block like building on the far edge of town
a pair of redcoats stand guard
a pair of drunken redcoats stagger out of a side street singing a mumbling song
the redcoat guards look at the drunk redcoats enviously
hey what you got there
the drunken redcoats look up bringing their faces into the light the drunken redcoats are billings and dalton
we got our own little party
to hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball
give us a nip here
billings and dalton walk over to the redcoats guards
as the guards reach for the bottles billings slams one of the guards back against the building
dalton draws a knife and plunges it into the second guards belly and hacks him open
dalton shoves billings out of the way slits the other guards throat
billings is taken aback by the speed and ferocity of daltons attack
marion and scott duck into the shadows of the doorway pull out hammer less carving chisels and quickly and silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of the
billings and dalton take the posts of the guards while the other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight
everything appears as it should
cornwallis speaks with a small gathering of loyalist civilians among whom is the spectacular mrs
talbot who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormous expanse of bosom
at her side stands her toady of a husband mr
the beasts took your dogs as well
fine animals a gift from his majesty
dead now for all i know
is there no decency
among the rebels
we know the answer to that
yes we have learned
marion and scott shove their chisels through the door which falls away from the hinges
they all duck inside finding barrels and casks of gunpowder boxes of weapons and hundreds of muskets
gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of the weapons as marion opens a cask and pours a trail of gunpowder across the floor
cornwallis taking the night air with mrs
talbot gazes at the moon achieving the calculated effect
you seem far away
its the weight of command and the lot of a widower memories loneliness
with a self deprecating laugh and long gazes at the moon
talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located inches above her stunning cleavage
oh you poor man
a massive explosion lights up the night as a fireball erupts from the armory
british officers including major halbert and tarleton rush out along with mr
talbot and other loyalist civilians
talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at his wife clinging to cornwallis arm
these rebels seem to lack fear as well as decency eh general
cornwallis registers the insult glances at the hapless major halbert then turns to tarleton
colonel tarleton you deal with these damned rebels
tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony
the village of pembroke lies nestled in a valley surrounded by tilled fields and small farms
forty of marions men water their horses
marion with the two great danes at his side speaks with peter green a middle aged storekeeper with a marked limp
four baskets of apples salt pork sweet potatoes jerky hard tack salt and powder
its not much but ill get you more
we cant pay for this
ill give you what i can when i can
you pay me what you can
greens daughter anne very attractive around sixteen joins them
gabriel sees her and sidles over
francis you remember my daughter anne
nice to see you again anne
gabriel clears his throat
anne looks at him coolly
i know who you are gabriel marion
the last time i saw you i was nine and you put ink in my tea
that wasnt me it was samuel
i mean nathan
it was you and it turned my teeth black for a month
green heads across the square where some townspeople are giving marions men provisions
anne and gabriel follow
marion turns to some waiting men new recruits
billings nearby reads a posted broadsheet that announces reward offered for the capture or death of the rebel known as the swamp fox
he tears it down and walks over to marion
and your terms of enlistment will be month to month
every thirty days you can re enlist or return to your families
reed the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to marion
the others nod in agreement
talk to abner and scott about provisions powder and mounts
the recruits head off
billings hands marion the wanted poster which marion glances at and crumbles up
twenty men here seventeen in new brighton a dozen along the black river
well pass three hundred by weeks end if this keeps up
gabriel and several of marions men take supplies from green anne and some other townspeople
gabriel looks at anne
if id known you were going to look like this i never would have put ink in your tea
you call that a compliment
its a start
she gives him a bit of a smile
he checks out her teeth
they look nice
as white as can be
she tries to glare but she cant help but laugh
marion and billings watch as anne gives gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air one by one catching them behind his back a cocky move executed with a
disarming smile that makes anne laugh again
marion smiles at his sons flirtation
billings smiles as well
he reminds me of you before you got old and ugly
softly no he takes after his mother
billings is taken aback by the gentleness of marions words
the younger ones barely remember her but gabriel spent more time with elizabeth
she taught him well guided him she was his north star and mine
her father was a minister in boston did you know that
gabriels already a better man than i could ever hope to be
marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from gabriel adopting a coarse joking tone
what do you mean old and ugly
you got me beat on both accounts
the hell i do
they mount up grateful to leave the sincerity behind
gabriel sees marion and his men starting to ride off
he says goodbye to anne then runs to his horse mounting with a dramatic leap
he gallops up taking his place at his fathers side
marion doesnt turn to look at him but he knows hes there
a patchwork of fields with a village visible in the distance
the rollins boys and work a field harvesting grain
hearing the sound of horses hooves they stop and listen
then they see a cloud of dust rising over the ridge line
growing excited they throw down their scythes and race down the hillside madly stumbling and falling trying to intersect the approaching sound
at the bottom of the hill they pass their father ben rollins who watches his sons plant themselves on the side of the road gazing in awe at marion and
his men thundering by
theyre an impressive sight a hundred and fifty heavily armed men on powerful mounts raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the road
marion and forty of his men including gabriel sit on their motionless horses in the middle of the road
there are a number of new faces among marions men among them ben rollins
gabriel is lost in thought
are you asleep
were low on salt
i should go to pembroke and get some
you got salt last week
beat baking powder we need baking powder
weve got plenty of baking powder
you went to pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago
they hear a sound approaching then see two british wagons round a curve with a guard of only six redcoats commanded by a redcoat sergeant
the redcoat sergeant signals stop
look alive boys
the young redcoat privates nervously unshoulder their sergeant this road is closed
those wagons now belong to the continental army
marions surprised by the sergeants order
sergeant theres no reason for you and your men to die
just leave the wagons and go
marion sighs and lets loose with a piercing whistle
the underbrush parts and more of marions men show themselves muskets leveled at the outnumbered redcoats
this is the kings highway and i advise you and your men to make way
to his men prepare to fire
marion exchanges a look with rev
oliver who like marion doesnt want to kill these men
seeing no other option marion turns to give the order then stops hearing a a moment later brother joseph hears it as well
horses hooves lots of them growing louder by the second thundering toward them from the road behind the british wagons
then the sound of more horses coming in fast on both flanks
its a trap
the canvas sides of the british wagons are thrown up and dozens of redcoats armed with muskets spill out
marions unmounted men run to their horses leaping into their saddles
then green dragoons appear galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks astonishing horsemen weaving through the trees without slacking their pace swords a thunderous volley erupts from the redcoat
infantry killing several of marions men
marions men fire back from their bucking mounts most of their shots going awry
behind the british wagons a huge detachment of green dragoons appears tarleton among them
marion and his men spur their mounts taking off down the road in the opposite direction
the flanking bodies of dragoons gallop out of the woods joining the main body riding in hard pursuit
marion and his men gallop down the road
the much larger body of green dragoons thunder after them
marion and his men ride along a raised road that drops off into black swamp on either side
they round a curve and stop reining back their horses in confusion as they see fifty green dragoons heading straight toward them
the dragoons open fire from both directions killing several more of marions men wounding others
marions men fire back as best they can caught in the chaos of bucking and falling horses and wounded and they remount doubling up with the wounded
marion sees an unaided wounded man
leaps from his horse heaves him onto his horse slaps it
marions men head off both sides of the road into the swamp struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee deep water
marion on foot with four men only three horses
a dragoon aiming his pistol thunders down on marion
marion fires killing the dragoon
marions men mount one motions to marion
marions men ride off leaving him alone
a dragoon is almost on him sword raised
marion his weapon spent sees a thick branch on the ground two feet long
the sword flashes and sinks deeply into the wood
marion yanks brings the rider off his horse grabs the reins and swings himself up into the empty saddle
marion rides down the embankment
the dragoons rein back slowed by the dead horses and men
they spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and follow marion and his men into the swamp
marion rides hard galloping along a circuitous barely visible dry trail
a moment later tarleton and green dragoons follow
marion catches up to a dozen of his men including gabriel and billings
several of the men are badly wounded barely clinging to their saddles
they ride through the shallow water get to a fork split up
as they disappear into the swamp the sounds of their horses are swallowed up in the loud buzzing of swamp insects and the cries of the swamp birds
a moment later tarleton and the vanguard of dragoons ride up
tarleton signals stop at the fork
chooses a path the one marion took
rides off the dragoons following
tarleton and his men come to a dead end blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn bushes
they rein back their horses stopping in a confused mess
tarleton calls to gaskins and the loyalist scouts
tarleton makes his own choice
the green dragoons follow the loyalists bring up the rear
tarleton and his mounted dragoons struggle through a nearly impassable morass of swamp grass reeds and swarming mosquitoes
the exhausted dragoons are wet covered with mud and bleeding from swamp briars
the horses are spent and foaming
tarleton struggles harder than any but finally even he has had enough
he reins back his horse
tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant choked water and swamp
enough of this
there are other ways to run down a fox
tarleton yanks on his reins turns his horse and starts back the way they came
his grateful men turn their horses and follow
in the undergrowth marion gabriel billings and three badly wounded men with only four horses between them calm their mounts
they can hear but not see the dragoons
then through the thick undergrowth marion catches a glimpse of gabriel tending the wounded men sees his father lock his eyes on tarleton
marion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets he made from thomas lead soldiers
walking to his horse marion loads
marion mounts scanning the terrain planning a route
as marion spurs his horse to ride after tarleton gabriel grabs the bridle
he yanks hard stopping marions horse dead
the horse bucks nearly throwing marion
marion spurs the horse which tries to respond but is jerked back again by gabriel
marion angrily turns on his son
gabriel looks up at his father never loosening his iron grip on the bridles but speaking softly almost pleadingly father please
marion looks down at gabriel
then marion looks over at billings and the three wounded men
one bleeds from an ugly neck wound
their shared mounts are nearly spent
marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing tarleton
then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded
gabriel watches his father for a moment then joins him with the wounded
marion and his battered men gather taking stock
men drift in mounted and on foot in ones and twos past wary sentries
gabriel rides up dismounts and reports to marion out of earshot of the other men
fourteen dead eleven wounded eighteen captured
i should have killed him when i had the chance
when was that
in the swamp at the expense of your men
or when he killed thomas at the expense of your family
or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause
marion is silent
there will be a time and a place for revenge but killing tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself
beat stay the course
the parental sounding formality of gabriels words brings a thin smile to marions face
stay the course
your mother used to say that to me when id get drunk or lose my temper
shed say it to me when i picked on thomas or nathan
you learned her lessons better than she got me at a more impressionable age
marion smiles nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded
a cold winter rain falls
most of marions grim men are huddled in lean tos and around campfires
green and several other pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of supplies while marion scott and fielding stow the provisions
gabriel and anne sit at a fire under the cover of a lean to taking quietly
she tries to be hopeful
next time well bring more blankets
that would be nice
maybe well be lucky this winter and have just rain no snow
that would be nice too
she takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of tea
just because the french didnt come this fall doesnt mean theyre never going to come
he nods and takes a drink of the tea
gabriel smiles back to her revealing a mouthful of ink stained black teeth
before she has time to laugh
rollins rides hard into camp
marion hurries over accompanied by the great danes
the other men gather around
theyre to be hung
but theyre prisoners of war
marion isnt as surprised as gabriel
he is however taken aback by gabriels black teeth
gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth
anne is embarrassed and regretful seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news
a redcoat sentry sees a lone figure on horseback ride out of distant woods
oliver carrying a white flag with one hand holding a dispatch case in the other
the sentry calls to the commander of the watch
a temporary hq has been set up in a commandeered farmhouse
cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor measures him and marks alterations on a partially completed uniform
general a message from the commander of the rebel militia
cornwallis reads the message
it seems our swamp fox wants to have a formal parley
are you going to meet with him
marion rides trailed by cornwallis great danes
behind him two dozen heavily armed patriots including rev
oliver who carries a white flag
a detachment of redcoat cavalry lead by major halbert waits
the redcoats fall in on either side
they ride on
redcoat sentries see the approaching patriots and redcoats and open the gates
billings and the other patriots stop a hundred yards outside the barricades
marion alone rides through the gates flanked by the british cavalry the great danes following closely behind
major halbert ushers marion in
the great danes follow sniffing curiously sensing something or someone
lord cornwallis will be with you presently
you may of course keep your weapons but i must warn you that
interrupting im familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley
yes quite but you should know that
that will be all major
ill wait for lord cornwallis
you will wait
major halbert turns and starts to stride out
one other thing
major halbert stops
the proper form of address to a superior officer even one of an opposing army is yes sir
major halbert sneers and strides from the room
marion alone except for the dogs allows himself a fleeting smile
then he looks around the room
he notes a rocking chair
curious he hefts it
he puts it down sits and rocks
the dogs walk over and lay at his feet
marion patiently sits rocking
one of the dogs has its head in his lap and marion scratches it behind the ears
a stone faced marion stands in the center of the room playing with the dogs
one of the dogs jumps up putting its front legs on marions shoulders and licks his face
just then cornwallis walks in overjoyed to see his dogs
the dogs just look at cornwallis
he holds out his arms waiting for them to rush to him
they look up at marion who nods to them
the dogs run to cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly but not enthusiastic manner
cornwallis pats them vigorously too vigorously for the moderate level of joy the dogs are showing at their reunion
you seem to have been well fed
thank you for that colonel
my pleasure sir
please forgive me for keeping you waiting
thank you colonel
im afraid i dont know your name
colonel will do
as you wish
tarleton enters with four dragoons all armed
marion and tarleton lock eyes
marion searches for some sign that tarleton recognizes him
colonel banastre tarleton
marion like ice looks tarleton up and down
then he slowly turns and looks at the four dragoons two on either side of tarleton
marion measures the odds and finds them wanting
with a supreme effort of will marion forces himself to turn from tarleton to cornwallis and the matter at hand
shall we proceed
unless you object i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and as such there are certain customary practices
perhaps i could explain them to you
im familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled
i served in his majestys army in the french and indian war
very well then
would you as the initiating party like to begin
unless you would like to claim aggrieved status
cornwallis is surprised
he exchanges a look with tarleton
you are familiar with how these things are done
in fact i would like to claim aggrieved status
very well proceed sir
first you have in your possession certain belongings of mine including clothing private papers furniture and personal effects of a non military nature which i would like to have returned
i will do so as soon as possible
cornwallis is surprised
please accept my apology for not having done so sooner
now on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements this is absolutely unacceptable
that one is a bit more difficult
certainly you must know that in civilized warfare officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention
and what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention
colonel imagine the utter chaos that would result from un led armies having at each other
there must be gentlemen in command to lead and when appropriate restrain their men
restrain them from the targeting of civilians including women and children
that is a separate issue
i consider them linked
i beg to differ
one is a command decision on your part
the other represents nothing more than the occasional over exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances
as long as your soldiers attack civilians i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement
beat and my men are excellent marksmen
very well let us move on to
you have eighteen of my men
i want them back
i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death but i hold no prisoners of war
if thats your position then eighteen of your officers will die
nineteen if you hang me with my men
marion steps to the window checks the view
a wooded hillside is visible in the distance
marion reaches into his jacket
the dragoons move on him
marion extracts not a weapon but a spyglass which he hands to cornwallis
in the clearing just down from the crest to the left of the dark pines
cornwallis looks through the spyglass
though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering haze cornwallis can just make out a row of bound redcoat officers with patriot soldiers holding muskets at their heads
cornwallis turns coldly to marion
their names ranks and posts
they refused to give me their names
their ranks are nine lieutenants five captains three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow
we picked them up here and there last night
cornwallis glares at marion
you are not a gentleman
marion cant help but laugh at the insult
if your conduct is the measure of a gentleman i take that as a compliment
coldly get my men
cornwallis turns to colonel huntington
arrange the exchange
colonel huntington leaves to do so
thank you general
im sure your officers will thank you as well
marion salutes cornwallis who doesnt return the salute
then marion turns to tarleton
he walks up to him and looks him in the eye
you dont remember me do you
tarleton examines marions face finding him familiar but unable to place him
then tarleton remembers
ah yes that boy
tarleton calmly holds marions glare
ugly business doing ones duty
yes ugly business
marion takes a step closer to tarleton then speaks very softly very slowly very clearly
if you are alive when this war is over im going to kill you
marion locks his eyes on tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says
tarleton tries to cover his reaction but its apparent that hes taken aback by marions icy words
marion turns and walks out
the two great danes start to follow but cornwallis snaps a command jupiter
the dogs freeze looking after marion who doesnt turn back
the dogs reluctantly sidle over to cornwallis side
redcoats glare at marion who sits mounted waiting
his eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and directed to waiting horses
surprised to be freed they mount up
cornwallis and tarleton step out onto the front porch of cornwallis headquarters and watch as marion and his men ride toward the gate
the two great danes watch marion from cornwallis side
cornwallis motions to the redcoat sentries to open the gates
they do so and marion and his men without hurrying ride out
then just as the gates are closing behind him marion without turning around lets loose with a piercing the two great danes instantly race after marion making it through the
gates just as theyre closing
cornwallis seeing his dogs run after marion sputters then turns and storms back into his quarters
tarleton still off balance from marions parting statement watches marion ride away
then he turns to major wilkins who stands nearby
take a detachment and go get our officers
wilkins hurries off
major wilkins and a detachment of green dragoons ride up the wooded slope toward the bound redcoat officers that cornwallis saw through the spyglass
as the dragoons ride out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead seeing that the redcoat officers are not real theyre nothing more than scarecrows in redcoat uniforms
theres no sign of marion or his men
close shot one of the redcoat officers stuffed with straw is thrown onto cornwallis desk by tarleton
cornwallis looks at the scarecrow then turns to tarleton
this fox believes himself clever
we shall see
tarleton and wilkins wait while green dragoons and loyalists search the remains of marions house and barn
gaskins filthy from the ashes walks up to tarleton
no ones been here for months
but now we have a name for our colonel
and with a name will come a family
a thick ground fog surrounds charlottes house
the soft lights of candles glow in the windows
all appears peaceful
then the shadowed figures of three dozen green dragoons appear out of the mist silently approaching the house on foot
a fire crackles in the fireplace
a curtain blows in the open window
the door bursts open
green dragoons pour into the house muskets brandished
no sign of occupants
captain morrow barks a command the dragoons thunder up the stairs
tarleton and wilkins stride in watching the search
food is cooking
the dining room
the table is set half eaten food is on the plates abandoned in mid meal
tarleton walks into the dining room touches some of the food gauging its warmth
they cant be far
check the outbuildings and the woods
the dragoons race outside
a torch burns
a dozen dragoons light torches off of it and fan out to search
the thick fog turns the torches into diffused floating balls of light turning the dragoons into ghost like apparitions
camera follows one of the torches carried by a particularly rough looking dragoon who skirts the edge of the underbrush closest to the house
as the torch moves its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the underbrush
the camera stops to reveal in the brush two faces gabriel and charlotte dark motionless watching the search
behind them marions other children nathan samuel margaret william and susan
around them several more of marions men including abner brown weapons ready
the moving lights play on their faces
at the front of the house the torches converge illuminating tarleton who gives the unheard order
the torches fan out and begin setting fire to the house barns margaret grips charlottes arm
gabriel motions and they all ease back disappearing into the brush
a compound of rude shacks built of scraps of lumber and rough hewn logs stands on the side of the magpie river
marions men wait with the children while abner charlotte and gabriel flanked by aaron and abigail marions middle aged black servants seen in the opening sequence talk with several stern
looking middle aged black the conversation which is out of the childrens earshot is testy with one of the middle aged freedmen particularly troubled
marions stone faced children look around appraising their surroundings registering the poverty of the shanty town
the discussion between the grown ups ends with a guarded exchange of handshakes
gabriel charlotte abner aaron and abigail rejoin the children and marions men
its all set
they follow aaron down an alley to a shack
the children stop in their tracks knowing this is to be their new home
charlotte sees their hesitation
she walks up to the little structure examining it with a critical eye
she looks on the doorway seeing a single room a dirt floor wax paper instead of glass in the windows a rude chimney less fire pit against the back wall
this will do fine
she turns to aaron and abigail
charlotte walks inside without looking back
the children hesitate then follow her inside
the children help aaron and abigail make beds out of armloads of hay
outside charlotte and gabriel talk quietly
so hes the one they talk about the swamp fox
i thought it might be him the bits and pieces we heard a veteran fought in the french and indian war knows the swamps
they wont stop looking for you and the children
well be alright here for now
beat how is he
gabriel searches for an honest answer
i dont know
im his son
gabriel steps over to his saddlebags opens his pack and pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to charlotte
these are for you and the children
they sense someone behind them
why didnt father come
gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his heretofore silent sister
charlotte nods smiling
speaking for months now
why didnt he come
he wanted to susan but he couldnt leave his men
he left us
i know he did and hes sorry
hell come back as soon as he can
susan says nothing
gabriel continues hopefully
there are some letters here from him
some are just to you
i dont care
i hate him
you dont hate him
yes i do
i hate him and i hope he never comes back
gabriel kneels down and embraces her
she stands coldly with her arms at her sides
an astonished marion talks to gabriel
as if she had been speaking all along
i dont believe it
and i wasnt there for it
the cloud passes quickly
tell me everything she said word for word
she loves you and misses you but she understands why you cant be there with her
she said that
oh my lord she said that
isnt that something
marion shakes his head at the thought smiling to himself
gabriel uncomfortable with the lie changes the subject
father theres something else i need to talk to you about
come with me
ill tell you when we get there
marion nods and curiously follows gabriel
the village square is deserted
marion follows gabriel into the shadow of the village church
they dismount tie up their horses and enter the back door of the church
marion walks in and stops dead
at the altar of the small sanctuary half a dozen people stand with rev
at the center of the tiny gathering is anne green flanked by her parents
father im looking for a best man
marion is stunned but recovers quickly
id be honored
they share a moment then head down the aisle
marion greets annes parents shaking hands with her father and bowing to her mother
abner at the door nods that the coast is clear
dearly beloved we are gathered here in the sight of god to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony
marion feels every word looking straight ahead but knowing that hes standing next to his son
in the shadows behind the church the bride and groom say goodbye to the wedding party
anne talks quietly with her parents
marion and gabriel talk nearby
sir id like to request a furlough
where are you going
its beautiful there
your mother and i were there once before you were born
theyre silent for a moment
she would have been pleased
gabriel nods then turns to his horse unnecessarily checking his pack ropes
anne joins them
marion embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss
im sorry we didnt give you more warning
im very happy for you
he helps her mount up
abner on guard near the road motions them on
they all watch as gabriel and anne ride off
oliver and abner ride slowly down the road
its a beautiful moonlit night
marion breaks the silence speaking as much for himself as the others
its a good measure of a woman that shell have her honeymoon under the stars
for richer for poorer in sickness and in health til death do they part
they ride on
a british packet a small fast warship lies anchored just offshore
a rowboat manned by half a dozen sailors carrying a redcoat lieutenant beaches
several redcoats wait
the lieutenant carrying a dispatch case jumps out off the boat mounts a waiting horse and rides off
cornwallis with his command staff clustered around him sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch rider waits
theyre on a hillside looking over the burned out remains of a small british fort as some redcoats pull the union jack out of a trench latrine
cornwallis motions tarleton and they ride a few yards from the other officers and speak out of earshot
from general clinton in new york
your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem
aside he underlined militia
reading you have spent over six months dealing with a six week problem
it is essential that you quell the militia
aside underlined again
insurgency particularly because of the likely move south of washington and the inevitable arrival of the french
militia as you have so often pointed out is not worth the attention of a significant army hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long
tarleton smiles slightly enjoying the show
it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your parliamentary and court patrons
only then might you share in the victory on the verge of which i now stand
beat your guardedly respectful commander general sir george clinton
cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to tarleton
if i fail you fail
and if i triumph you triumph
how can we end this madness
this is as you pointed out a civil war
cornwallis takes a moment then speaks simply
civility is a secondary virtue
it is superseded by duty
i understand sir
tarleton salutes yanks his reins turning his horse and rides off
tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a farmhouse looking out at a lovely sunset absentmindedly picking at the petals of some wildflowers
a hideous scream pierces the calm
tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream then rises passing several green dragoons who wait with their horses in front of the farmhouse
i believe they are almost ready
blood is smeared on one wall where half a dozen corpses lie in a jumbles mass on the floor
in the parlor tarleton walks past more bodies including a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over the bloody bodies of her two young children both under eight years
in the kitchen tarleton finds wilkins some green dragoons and gaskins the loyalist militia commander and some of his low life men
rob fielding one of the craftsmen in marions force is tied spread eagle to the table showing the terrible effects of protracted torture
wilkins and gaskins are nervous and apologetic as tarleton walks into the room
im sorry sir
tarleton sighs irritated
very well get one of the others
gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached woodshed where billings sits bound
they roughly grab him and drag him into the kitchen
damn your eyes
do your worst
i intend to
they tie billings to the table
a tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in the floor disappearing into a gap between two floorboards
marion dalton rev
oliver and several other men walk slowly through the farmhouse in stunned silence
marion sees the body of the mother draped over her two young children
marion turns to rev
oliver who can only stare offering no solace
they pass fieldings body then enter the kitchen and see billings dead still tied to the table
marions men dig graves
dalton steps up next to him
you still want me to give wounded redcoats quarter
marion doesnt answer
gabriel gallops up
he reins back his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting
tarleton has a list of our men most are on it
a regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list burning them killing whomever resists women and children as well
seven homes along the black river so far
rollins doesnt pause
he rushes to his horse mounts up and rides off
marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him
marion his brigade catch up to rollins and ride on with him
the small farm seen earlier surrounded by hills where the two boys rollins sons ran down the hillside to catch a glimpse of the passing marion and his brigade
the house smolders
no sign of life
gabriel abner and a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared area around the house
marion at the head of the rest of the brigade waits next to an increasingly frantic rollins
they see gabriel wave signaling all clear
marion rollins and the other men ride to the house
rollins is the first to see the bodies
horrified he reins back and dismounts almost falling
his two sons wife an older man and woman lie dead in the dirt
marions men silently watch rollins agony
weeping and confused he moves in a mad staccato manner as if he were a marionette whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer
marion and rev
oliver dismount and move toward him
rollins sees them coming
he hardens and strides to his horse pulling his flintlock pistol from his saddle holster
oliver reaches out to embrace rollins
its not time for vengeance its time to mourn and
every man freezes in place
for a long moment no one moves no one speaks
then marion pulls himself together and addresses the men five day furlough for all men
abner dan reverend spread the word
well reform at acworth
any man who doesnt come back wont be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause
attend to your families
the men mount up
marion and gabriel ride off together
marion scans the night as gabriel and anne mount up
the three of them ride off pulling a line of horses some heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty mounts
gabriel and anne wait in the shadows while marion cocks his musket checks his pistols and walks slowly toward the shack
he warily checks every shadow
no one anywhere
then a sound a squeal of laughter immediately followed by its him
i told you it was him
marions children race out of the shadows to marion
hes practically bowled over as margaret nathan samuel and william fling themselves into his arms
charlotte steps out of the shadows watching the reunion as marion covers the children with kisses trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as
if theyll never let go
marion and charlotte lock eyes over the heads of the children
then marion notices susan peeking out from behind charlottes patched and mended skirt
he kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesnt move
he smiles to her and speaks softly susan
she looks coldly at marion tightens her grip on charlottes skirt and retreats further behind her
marion looks to charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance
then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children
marion rides leading his children charlotte and anne up a steep narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded hillside
the remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm
the house is gone leaving only an overgrown cellar hole
nearby is a barely standing tobacco shed one end of which has fallen to the ground
a soft wind whistles and whispers through the gaps in the rough hewn boards of the structure
marion rides up to the edge of the clearing
a mockingbird screeches nearby startling him
he looks back at the children worried anticipating a negative reaction
margaret smiles and turns to the other children speaking for marions benefit
i told you things would get better
the children smile and dismount
the ceiling drips
marion lies awake with his children huddled against him sleeping in one of the few dry spots
theyre covered with tattered quilts
on the other side of the children charlotte is also awake
she and marion exchange a long silent look in the darkness over the heads of the sleeping children
marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with nathan and samuel
they listen carefully
the overlook up there should be where you post the watch
work out a schedule
short watches especially at night
pointing if you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms
motioning for them to follow now lets find someplace to cache extra weapons
they follow marion like soldiers
marion sits on a rock while margaret cuts his hair
she takes her time touching him on the head and shoulders extending the process
marion sits back enjoying it
he notices susan nearby watching silently
she turns away
shafts of light shine in through the holes in the roof
marion standing in the shadows senses someone coming
a figure rounds the corner
marion yells william squeals in delight then chases his father around the corner tagging him
marion covers his eyes and william dashes off to hide
marion sits on the side of the river with susan who avoids looking at him
using the knife weve seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them
he cuts a slice and offers it to her
she doesnt take it
he puts the slice between them
after a long moment she picks it up but as shes about to eat it she stops seeing something on it
she puts it back
marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it
he looks at his knife and realizes that its dried blood
off balance he turns to susan who stares straight ahead a thousand miles from marion
marion washes the knife carefully almost obsessively
anne steps up behind him
may i ask you a question
marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without explanation
yes of course
she speaks with a sly withheld smile
do you think frances with an e is too manly a name for a girl
do you think francis with an i is too womanly a name for a boy
anne smiles and walks away
marion figures out what she just told him
marion laughs at the thought
marions children swim and play with the two great danes in the pond at the base of the falls along with gabriel and anne
marion and charlotte sit on the bank watching them
charlotte turns and looks at marion for a long moment
as charlotte looks at him her smile disappears replaced by anger
she snaps at marion
im not my sister
startled marion turns to charlotte
i said im not my sister
i know that
of course i do
irritated very well then
she turns from him
marion tries to figure out what just happened
after a long moment he gets it
stunned at first his gears turn
after a very thoughtful moment he turns to charlotte and offers a tentative smile
she rolls her eyes
a full moon shines
he looks across his sleeping children and sees that charlotte isnt in her place on the other side of them
he rises and walks out into the night
marion walks into the glen
he tenses sensing someone in front of him
then he sees charlotte at the edge of the woods
neither one speaks
they walk silently to each other
they stop looking at each other closely as if seeing one another for the first time
only then do they kiss
the kiss grows more passionate
then much more passionate
marion finishes tying his gear onto his horse
the children are silent
he stands beside his horse
one after another the children walk to him and embrace him nathan samuel margaret william
he sees susan standing next to charlotte
he motions to her but she doesnt move
then he kneels down and gently hugs her
just a little goodbye
thats all i want to hear
susan remains silent standing with her arms at her sides not responding to the embrace
finally marion lets go of her
she just stares at him
marion stands and turns to charlotte
though the hug is chaste their eyes tell a different story
only anne and margaret notice but to them its as clear as a bell
they exchange a knowing look
marion and charlotte break apart self consciously
marion and gabriel mount up and start to ride away
as theyre about to round a curve and disappear susan cries papa
with halting steps then faster and faster she runs down the path toward marion
papa dont go ill say anything
marion stops turning in his saddle to see susan running after him her eyes filled with tears
please papa ill say anything you want
marion yanks his reins turning his horse
just tell me what to say
tell me what to say
marion spurs his horse straight toward her galloping toward the running crying child
please papa please dont go
charlotte anne and marions children watch as marion leans over in the saddle without slowing down
she sits astride the saddle facing him her arms wrapped around him pleading the words tumbling from her as fast as she can get them out
ill talk to you ill say anything you want just tell me what you want me to say ill say anything i promise please papa just stay
marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl holding her letting her cry fighting his own tears
he reins back the horse stopping in front of the others
he pleadingly looks to charlotte who steps up to the horse
to take susan
marion gives susan a final embrace and covers her face with kisses
ill come back
marion hands the still crying susan down to charlotte
marion in agony averts his eyes yanks his reins and spurs his horse
as he rides away the children take off after him running
susan seeing the others running after marion struggles out of charlottes arms and runs after them as well
marion rides now joined by gabriel faster and faster leaving a trail of dust
the children slow then stop one after another watching as they ride away
the most rudimentary of the encampments weve seen
some of marions men huddle under lean tos and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial protection from the cold rain
abner and scott do their best to keep a wet wood fire going
oliver tries to cook
marion and gabriel ride up and dismount
marion joins rev
how many came back
about a hundred and twenty
less than a third
he and gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean tos
the rain has stopped
the ground is still wet
the first buds are on the maple trees
a fox tentatively comes out of its winter den followed by a pair of pups
marion stands on the side of a river looking up at a chevron of canadian geese flying north
the canadian geese fly over anne who is behind her fathers store tying food and provisions to a couple of packhorses
a mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock
suddenly anne senses someone behind her and turns to see half a dozen redcoats
shes initially frightened but the redcoat sergeant speaks politely
excuse me maam everyone has been requested to gather at the church
colonel tarleton wants to address the whole village
the redcoat sergeant deferentially motions for anne to follow him and his men
she sees several other townspeople with redcoat escorts already heading down the street
she follows along
tarleton and wilkins on horseback watch as a large mixed detachment of green dragoons and redcoat infantry directs the villagers into the church
one of the redcoats walks out of the general store with a bowl of gumdrops
as he starts giving them to a few of the children their parents waver unsure of the gesture but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy
the townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of the redcoats who though carry muskets are polite and unthreatening
into the church please
colonel tarleton wishes to address all of you
tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the church
he nods to the redcoats near the door
the redcoats close the doors chaining them shut
the door is pounded on from the inside
open this door
by what right are we made prisoners
tarleton nods to gaskins who along with several rough looking loyalist militiamen disappear into the blacksmith shop
they reappear a moment later with flaming torches and approach the church
several redcoats see whats about to happen and are appalled
even some of the green dragoons including wilkins are troubled
wilkins rides over to tarleton
gaskins and the loyalist militia stop around the church torches ready waiting for the final go ahead from tarleton
the pounding and calling from inside the church grows louder
sir there is no honor in this
the honor is found in the end not the means
this will be forgotten
to gaskins proceed
the redcoats turn to the redcoat officers
the redcoat officers turn to wilkins who struggles with himself
tarleton calmly watches wilkins distress
finally wilkins accepts it
weakly steadying his horse he takes his place next to tarleton
the redcoats and dragoons follow his lead and watch as gaskins and the loyalist militiamen light the church on fire heaving their torches onto the roof through the windows and
under the raised foundation
screams are heard from inside
the door thuds with the shoulders of men trying to escape
the chains hold
as the flames rise another group of loyalist militiamen and some redcoats drag half a dozen young women out of a side street
among the women desperately pleading kicking and screaming is anne
the men drag her and the other women into the livery stable
tarleton watches them carried off stone faced
then he turns and watches the church go up in flames
a window shatters with a chair heaved from inside
some men try to climb out but waiting redcoats fire their killing three men driving the others back
the screams from inside the church grow louder
the flames and smoke rise
a dark forest of old growth trees
marion and a couple dozen of his men including gabriel rev
oliver and dalton ride warily on a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke visible over the treetops in the distance
with hand signals marion directs his men to fan out
they do so weaving through the dark forest weapons ready
marion and his men slowly ride into pembroke
the remains of the church smolder only slightly
the town is deserted no one dead or alive is visible
unsure what they have found marion and his men spread out and dismount warily checking out the buildings looking for some sign of life
oliver and a few other men head for the charred remains of the church
side stepping some still hot charred beams rev
oliver looks through the rubble
then he sees the bodies
the camera catches only a fleeting glimpse of
dozens of charred blackened bodies intertwined with the remains of the church
oliver staggers from the rubble
the other men see what he has seen
one by one marion and his men walk over and look into the remains of the church
marion see several charred hands extended through a shattered window as if grasping for escape
one of the hands is tiny a childs hand
marion is stunned
no one says a word
dalton and a few of the other men continue the search weapons ready
they step into the livery stable then walk out a moment later ashen faced
dalton speaks quietly to marion motioning toward an increasingly frantic gabriel who has just found annes packhorses
gabriel notices the gesture he watches marion walk into the livery stable
growing more nervous by the second gabriel hurries after his father
as gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable marion walks out and intercepts him
dont go in there
is it her
is anne in there
dont go in there
marion grabs him
keeping him from falling
marion holds gabriel who begins to weep
marions men led by rev
oliver tend to the dead
some dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the church
others carry out the grim task of pulling the charred bodies out of the rubble
marion sits alone
gabriel walks up behind him
father tell me what happened at fort wilderness
you know what happened
no i dont
its what made me a hero
me harry lee all of us
i got a medal
men bought me drinks
they still do sometimes
everyone knows what happened
tell me what everyone doesnt know
and what do they know
that the french and cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation
thats not enough
your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born
i was drunk and i was foolish enough to answer her
marion shakes his head to himself
thats why it was four years between you and thomas
it took me that long to regain her respect
im not my mother
i cant have the respect without the knowing
marions quiet for a moment
then he speaks it was in
it was a bad time
the french and the cherokee had raided along the blue ridge
all the english settlers took refuge at fort wilderness but the french captured it
we were sent in relief
harry lee billings sixty of us
we already had something of a reputation for being
when we got there the fort was abandoned
not a french soldier or cherokee anywhere
they had left a week earlier
what we found was
marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad
they had left the settlers there
the men had been burned alive the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes
marions silent for a moment
we buried them then we went to track
it was a cold trail and they were moving fast
we went faster
we caught up to them at kentucky ford
we took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort
it was two weeks before they were all dead all except two
we put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the french at fort ambercon
beat the eyes fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the asheulot to the cherokee
beat the french stayed east of the blue ridge after that and the cherokee broke their treaty with the french and stayed out of the fight
beat that seemed to make a difference
the war went another year things went better
and men bought us drinks
gabriel is silent
marion looks at him closely
it was a different time son
and youre a better man than that
i see do as i say not as i do
they hear horses hooves
abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church not having seen the results of the massacre
excited he dismounts
marion and gabriel just look at him
abner is confused by their reaction
then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out charred bodies
mixed gatherings of marions militia and continentals are clustered around the campfires with more continentals arriving all the time
some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired talking quietly
a couple of patriots play a melancholy tune on fife and marions tent is set up but hes nowhere to be seen
gabriel walks to marions gear
finding marions weapons belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint flecked musket balls made from thomas lead soldiers
as gabriel takes one marion steps up behind him
if this war is about more than thomas its about more than anne as well
stay the course
as you did at fort wilderness
before marion can answer they see harry lee ride up to them
he dismounts excited voluble
he strides over pleased to see marion oblivious to his and gabriels mood
look at you
i knew you could do it
lee laughs picks up a bottle and takes a big pull
we have a chance
better than a chance
cornwallis is running to the chesapeake probably to meet his fleet at yorktown
i wish i could see his face when he sees a dozen french ships floating there
and washington should be a day or two behind him
beat and on top of everything i have a son
born last month in alexandria
gabriel rises and walks away
lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over marion and the just departed gabriel
he turns to marion
his wife was killed yesterday
she was with child
im sorry i didnt know
they stand in silence
lee hands marion the bottle
he takes a drink
sentries are on duty
marions tent glows from a single candle
he blows the candle out then steps out of the tent into the night
he begins his nightly walk of the perimeter
almost immediately marion notices something amiss
dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over to marion
marion and dalton and several of the other men look down at some empty bedrolls
gabriel and at least a dozen others
they must have left right after the watch change
that means they have two hours on us
marion strides to his horse
the other men follow him
marion dalton and rev
oliver and two dozen other men ride
a moonless night
marion and his men on foot make their way along the side of the river
brother joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to marion
fifty green dragoons camped about a quarter mile from here
sentries at four points
suddenly they hear the sounds of muskets fire ahead of them in the darkness
marion takes off at a full run with his men right behind
marion and his men blast through the brush
running toward the sounds of the battle which grows louder with every step
marion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the run
the lights of the battle the strobes of the musket shots illuminate the woods ahead of them
moving fast they pass two dead british sentries without slowing down
they blast out of the woods into
the clearing seeing a tableau of total chaos half dressed green dragoons in formation fire in running men
scattered musket fire
the strobes of the muskets illuminate running men and other men in hand to hand combat
wilkins is in command
tarleton is nowhere to be seen
gabriel and abner both slightly wounded fight a desperate holding action
on the other side of the clearing a square of dragoons forms near wilkins
the dragoons fire a massed volley hitting gabriel abner and several other patriots
gabriel badly wounded falls to his knees
the dragoons pull their pistols about to fire again
marion and his men open fire
marion sees wilkins about to fire at gabriel
sees another redcoat about to fire at gabriel
marion kills him with a pistol shot
wilkins cocks his flintlock pistol aims at gabriel
marion throws the tomahawk sinking it into wilkins chest
the rest of marions men thunder into the dragoons
marion races to gabriel
throws himself onto the ground next to him
gabriel is stunned confused by the wounds
im alright i
he tries to stand
let me help you
gabriel weakens in marions arms
marion watches the life drain from gabriel
he tries to hold the blood in to no avail
dalton plants himself next to marion defending him and gabriel
marion caresses gabriel and watches as
the life drains from marion
he looks at gabriel lost in a dream an incomprehensible nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness
marions men finish laying out the bodies of their dead
the dragoons are still where they fell
the patriots are laid out in a row their faces covered by their coats
marion sits on the battlefield next to gabriels body
dalton gingerly approaches him
marion slowly stands and picks up gabriels body cradling him like a child
they head off into the brush
more continentals have arrived now outnumbering marions men three to one
the encampment is active
a few of the men drink and talk loudly
the two men playing the fife and violin play a more vibrant tune
the sounds of celebration can be heard outside the tent
marion sits on his camp chair
gabriel lies on the ground carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket
a single candle burns
oliver enters the tent
may i help you try to find solace with the word of god
colonel let us help his soul find its place with the almighty and
he looks as if hes sleeping doesnt he
yes he does
oliver pulls up a camp stool
he and marion sit in silence
the patriots continentals and militia are moving out
most of the tents have been taken down
wagons are rolling out
companies of continentals march off in good order
marions tent still stands
his men finish packing up storing their heavy gear in wagons tying their field gear onto their horses
marion still sits
a fly buzzes
gabriels face has taken on a deathly ashen look
lee enters the tent
hes silent for a moment then speaks softly to marion
you have to bury him
ill help you bury him
lee moves toward gabriels body
dont touch him
how many men have we seen die
gabriel and thomas
and there is nothing you or i can do to bring them back
but there is something you can do to help end all this
it is ended
its not over yet
two days ride yorktown virginia
washington the french cornwallis and tarleton
it will end one way or another
beat francis nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice
marion doesnt respond
lee waits for a long moment then he hears the sound of the departing troops outside the he looks at marion touches him on the shoulder and walks out
the last of the soldiers move out leaving their smoldering campfires and refuse
the only tent that remains is marions
marion sits in his tent gazing obliquely at gabriels body which has grown even more ashen
a solitary bird cries in the distance
a dark moonless night
the sky is filled with stars
a soft wind blows dead leaves along the ground
a few of the leaves are blown through the opening of marions tent
marion looks down noticing the leaves hearing the wind
he listens for a moment
then he stands and walks out of the tent
marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground
he listens to the wind
the he looks up at the night sky
the stars are bright
his eyes are drawn to the big dipper and from there to the little dipper and the
holding his eyes on the faint but steady star he gradually reorients himself
he looks around at the abandoned encampment
then he looks into the tent and sees gabriels body
the soft wind blows around him
marion nods in response
marion finishes burying gabriel putting the last shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth
he stands next to the grave looking down and says a silent prayer
the american forces are on the move all heading in the same direction
continentals and militiamen fill the road
some on horseback others in wagons most on foot
among them a mixed unit of continentals and marions brigade at the head of which ride lee dalton abner and rev
behind them a single horseman rides up
without speaking marion rides up alongside lee
they exchange nods
marion rides between dalton on one side and rev
oliver on the other
they pass a sign that reads yorktown
the road to yorktown skirts an overlook with a view of the town and the harbor
a few dozen arriving patriots have stopped to look out at the view
marion lee rev
oliver and dalton join them
the french fleet is visible in the harbor
the british encampments are on a pair of peninsulas one jutting out from land the other jutting toward the land from a large island
in a semi circle around the landward peninsula the beginnings of the patriot encirclement are visible
its a grand and impressive sight
marion and the others turn their horses and head down the road toward the american lines
an intermittent exchange of cannon fire
not a battle but pre battle pot shots
behind the american embattlements hundreds of american and french soldiers drill make camp and build secondary fortifications
marion stands behind a barricade trying to get a view of the british defenses
a runner a boy about fifteen dashes up to marion
you called for me sir
marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single walnut which he hands to the boy
take this to general washington
the boy looks at the walnut and then looks at marion as if hes joking or crazy
the boy shrugs and runs off with the walnut
french and american officers look over maps and sort out dispatches
messengers runners and dispatch riders come and go hurriedly
the flap of the central hq tent opens and george washington steps out followed by a pair of aides
washington is tall and powerfully built an imposing man worthy of respect
he looks around and sees the awe struck slightly confused messenger boy waiting nearby
washington holding the walnut in his hand motions him over
did you bring me this
washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to the boy
take this to colonel marion
the boy runs off
camera follows marion walking through the chaos of the encampment
he walks to the cluster of tents around washingtons hq
he nods to the officer in charge
colonel francis marion
washington leaning over the maps on his campaign table hears the voice and turns around
the officers nearby stop and watch curious
step up to one another looking each other in the eye
to the astonishment of washingtons officers marion reaches up and lifts off washingtons wig looking at his hair underneath
marion shakes his head
washington holds out a small bag to marion who reaches in and pulls out a walnut
i have something i want to show you
washington turns to his staff officers
washington and marion walk off with washingtons officers and aides
as washington and marion walk they both crush the walnuts shells between their thumbs and forefingers a prodigious display of strength that both men take for granted
they eat walnuts as they walk
washingtons officers who include harry lee colonel alexander hamilton lafayette general pinkney and various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of the hill and wait for washington and
marion who trail a bit behind them talking privately eating walnuts as they go
while they wait the officers look out at the view seeing the puffs of smoke of intermittent cannon fire
finish the walnuts
they stop for a moment to catch their breath
i was sorry to hear about your son
i lost another a year ago thomas
he was only fifteen
ive had no sons to lose nor daughters
beat i lose the sons of other men
they look out at the vista knowing that theyre looking at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men
life was easier when we only had ourselves to get killed
they walk on joining the others on the crest of the hill
the officers are looking out some with spyglasses at the british emplacements
gentlemen what do we see
mortars center with two lines of enfilading trenches
more along the right flank and behind the forward redoubts
a formidable defensive position
they could hold out for weeks
washington nods and turns to marion
francis tell me about general cornwallis
proud priggish and competent
a very bad combination in an adversary
for those of you who dont know we intercepted a british dispatch this morning
general clinton has sailed from new york to relieve cornwallis
that hits washingtons officers hard
how long before they arrive
less than a week
sixteen ships and over nine thousand redcoats
sooner or later that message will get through to cornwallis
and when it does hell just wait us out
and when the british ships arrive the french ships will flee
and when the french ships flee general rochambeau and the french troops will flee as well
marion speaks up
then you must let the message go through
they all turn to marion most of them looking at him as if hes insane
if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming hell simply hold tight and wait
hell fight a purely defensive battle and hell win that
no he wont
there are two things you need to know about cornwallis
first he is a very proud man he would rather risk defeat than share a victory
beat if you give him what he thinks is an out hell take it
and what is the second thing
marion pulls cornwallis journal out of his haversack and leafs through it
ill let him tell you himself
but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome
not worthy of my attention but demanding it not worthy of british blood but taking it and not worthy of a soldiers honor but sullying it
those nights of mine that are not sleepless are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers
marion closes the journal
he has no respect for citizen soldiers
thats your bait
washington nods considering it
cornwallis and his staff
major halbert strides in and gives cornwallis a dispatch
sir a dispatch from general clinton made it through the rebel lines
cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it
it staggers him
he sits down
his jaw sets with anger
he slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury
call a general staff meeting
marion stands at the american battlements looking out at the british defensive works
above him stars are visible but theyre fading in the light of the pre dawn glow from the horizon
marion scans the disappearing stars searching out the north star but in the increasingly harsh light of this day he cant find it
he turns his eyes back to the battlefield
the sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards
men move like ghosts
the camera finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist
there is no overview just separate detachments an orderly regiment of continental cavalry mounted waiting steadying their horses
two long lines of continental infantry reserves
an american command including washington lafayette and two dozen staff officers attended by riders and runners
and finally marion and his men who stand in the middle of a long line of patriot militia in the center of a long valley line depression
they stand silently unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew covered grass in front of them
theyre all grim
they know whats coming
then the sound of a single drum heard but unseen coming from over the slope
then more drums more and more a competition of drum marions men listen turning their heads trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in
front of them
marion motions for his officers dalton scott rev
oliver and several other patriot militia officers from other units
they quickly gather around
the british army believes in officers
i believe in soldiers
after we engage there will be no more orders
every man here must know what im about to tell you
they listen closely
we are the bait in a trap
cornwallis thinks were rabble nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers
and if he thinks thats what we are thats what were going to give him
they gather around closer
cornwallis surrounded by his staff officers including tarleton stands on a low hill trying with the aid of a spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the
morning mist begins to burn off
through the fog he just makes out the american lines
he turns to tarleton who also peers through a spyglass
do you see that colonel
unless im dreaming i think i see irregulars at their center
cornwallis and tarleton exchange a pleased look
marion and his men wait
a strange sound
the men turn their heads listening their eyes shifting
they hear the sound of thousands of boots on wet grass advancing
the camera watches the faces of marion and his men as they listen to an unseen army approaching
on marions face we see him hearing every sound and we see flash cuts of what he knows hes hearing the boots of the unseen soldiers
shouldered muskets clicking against pack buckles
silence at a stop
the men around marion wait
a massive wall of red appears over the rise in front of them
thousands of redcoats in perfect formation marching in lockstep straight for them
marion sees the fear on his mens faces but none of them move
the british drums grow louder and louder
its almost enough to drive a man to flight
the camera explores the faces of marions men faces that we know rev
oliver scott abner marion
all are frightened but all are motionless
closer and closer the british line approaches
the americans dont move
then the british line stops
at a flurry of commands the redcoats ready their muskets then aim
still marion and the americans dont move
then a single thin voice calls out from the british lines
in a thunderous massive volley three thousand british muskets fire simultaneously
just as the entire line of many americans are saved by the move but many many others are torn apart by the british musketballs
the amount of smoke is incredible
it obscures everything
each musket spits out a billow of think white smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of them just fired
the massive opaque white cloud quickly spreads over the entire battlefield
the astonished redcoats instantly reload
and watch as the americans rise in disorderly panic and some redcoats laugh
on a rise behind the battlefield cornwallis watches through his spyglass trying to get a sense of whats happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke obscures everything
he barks to his signalman
dispatch the green dragoons
the signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the message
marion and his men are caught in the middle of the chaotic retreat
the british line advances at a quickstep bayonets fixed
from behind them the green dragoons appear at a full gallop tarleton at their head
its an astonishing sight
a painting by hieronymous bosch
the mass of the british infantry charges after the fleeing patriot militiamen
the redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs
tarleton and the british cavalry thunders to the head of the redcoats closing in on the fleeing patriots
the cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter
stepping into view from behind a low grass covered rise a solid line of blue appears rock solid
it open up allowing the fleeing patriots to pass through it like water
then it closes again becoming a solid blue wall
stops dead turns and joins the blue american line
a flurry of orders then the blue wall erupts with a volley of musket fire that stops the disorderly british advance in its tracks
hundreds of redcoats fall instantly
hundreds of green dragoons and their horses fall with them
the effect of the volley is devastating
the american timing is perfect
again the amount of smoke is astonishing
visibility drops to less than twenty feet in most places
drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and there but it is primarily a battle of sound
men simply follow the men in front of them
the blue continentals advance in an orderly manner from both flanks onto the redcoats trapping them
the redcoats try to flee
fighting small gathered holding actions
marion fires one of his pistols
draws his sword
killing one redcoat after another
no remorse no hesitation no pity
a relentless simple battle
slashing through the redcoat infantry
his sword sinks into the stock of an upraised british musket and is pulled from his hands
marion quickly kills the redcoat with his pistol
his eyes locked on tarleton who is fighting a pitched battle making his way toward the perimeter of the field trying to escape back to the british lines
seeing nothing but tarleton marion hurriedly tears open his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made from thomas lead soldiers
as he loads the pistol his eyes still trained on tarleton dalton runs up in the chaos
marion finishes reloading
distracted he turns to dalton for an instant
marion takes a quick glance at the continental line seeing
oliver abner and a dozen more of his men in the middle of a confused battle with a larger mass of redcoats who are advancing through the broken continental line
he looks to tarleton seeing him distracted vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol
then marion looks to rev
oliver and the others
dalton cant wait
he runs off
then he takes a last look at tarleton and heads off to help the faltering patriots
tarleton sees the movement of marion and his men and sees marion himself his back exposed
marion dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time beating back the redcoats
as blue uniformed continentals reform the line firing at tarleton sees marion and fights his way toward him
marion is oblivious concentrating on holding the american line
tarleton mounts a terrified riderless horses draws his sword and gallops back toward the british lines on a path that takes him directly past marion
tarleton gets closer
raises his sword
marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of his eye
diverts the blow knocking tarleton from the mount
tarleton hits the ground
marion draws his pistol about to fire at tarleton
tarleton kicks out knocking the pistol from marions hand
tarleton grabs his sword slashes at marion who dodges the blow
marion scrambles back then rises
marion grabs a broken cavalry lance and fends off repeated blows from tarletons sword
then marion sees his pistol loaded with a bullet from thomas lead soldiers lying on the ground
marion makes his way toward the weapon
still blocking blows from tarletons sword
marion focuses on the pistol
leaving himself exposed
tarleton sees the opening
moves on marion
tarleton raises his sword about to deliver the killing blow
grabs his pistol
killing marion stunned exhausted and surprised to be alive watches tarleton fall
marion stands over tarletons body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph then he turns back to the battle at hand
marion picks up tarletons sword and runs to the american line which stiffens as dalton and rev
oliver are joined by marion and a dozen other patriots
the blue uniformed continentals reform their line
marion looks back toward tarleton but finds that his body along with the place and the moment of his death has disappeared into the smoke of the battle
marion and his men fight on
then redcoats start fleeing the field
first one redcoat at a time
then more and more
the next day
the battlefield as far as the eye can see is covered with the debris of war dead men and scattered weapons
the british have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field
the patriots regulars and militia wait behind their barricades
then a single figure appears on one of the british parapets
a drummer boy no more than ten years old
behind him a single british officer
they boy begins to beat the drum
the officer raises a white flag
in the american lines the men see the flag
some call out some cheer some laugh most among them marion simply take a deep breath
its finally over
a massive ceremony carefully orchestrated laid out on the cleaned up battlefield
thousands of men everyone in his place as if well directed actors in a grand theatrical performance
the french and american armies fifteen thousand men between them stand in perfect formation on either side of the field forming an avenue for the british army which marches out
of its fortification
at the head of the avenue washington and his staff stand waiting
a musical band of continentals thirty men strong loudly plays a tune the world turned upside down a jaunty british air with a melancholy undercurrent
cornwallis marches with his officers eyes straight ahead covering his agony as best he can
as he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the south carolina militia
marion standing with dalton rev
oliver abner scott and the rest of his surviving men sees cornwallis pass
cornwallis glances over noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them
its only a glance and he doesnt pick out marion who is just one man among the many
cornwallis reaches washington
they exchange unheard formal greetings
cornwallis draws his sword and hands it to washington
fifteen thousand men american and french raise their voices in a cheer of astonishing volume
with every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony between washington and cornwallis marion quietly and unnoticed slips out the back of the formation and walks away
the surrender ceremony continues
marion on the fringe of the field finishes saddling his horses and prepares to leave
lee walks out of the crowd and joins him
they lock eyes for a moment then marion mounts up
marion reaches down
they shake hands
and congratulations on the birth of your son
maybe all of this will buy him some peace
i hope so
as marion starts to ride off he reins back and stops speaking back to lee over his shoulder
your son what did you name him
a good name for a farmer
marion rides off
marions children and charlotte sit by the river
samuel sits on the lookout ledge with his musket
suddenly he stands looking out seeing something
charlotte and the others notice
then they see samuel throw down his musket and tear down the path running as fast as he can tumbling then regaining his feet
charlotte and the others know whos coming
the children take off running after samuel
racing toward the road
charlotte hurries after them
marion riding at a full gallop
the children cry out with tears of joy
marion see susan
he gallops toward her
without slowing he swoops her up into the saddle
she wraps herself around him
he reins back stops and dismounts just as the other children reach him
they throw themselves into his arms
charlotte hurries up behind them
she and marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs of his children
the apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with apples
marions house is partially rebuilt and habitable
the workshop is already completed
marions children nathan samuel margaret and william play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two charlotte sits on the front porch nursing an infant
marion walks out of his workshop trailed by susan
he carries a just completed rocking chair
the chair is a work of art thin and light a spider web of perfectly turned wood no nails no glue
he steps onto the porch next to charlotte and places the rocking chair next to her
two pounds fourteen ounces
he smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chairs position
then he sits down settles back and begins rocking
not a creak
marion and charlotte watch susan run out of the yard calling as she joins the other children
wait for me
as the camera cranes up marion and charlotte disappear beneath the overhang of the porch roof
suddenly the damnation
the camera continues to crane up as marion walks off the porch crosses the yard and enters his workshop
a moment later the sound of marions lathe rises
