on video jane burnham lays in bed wearing a tank top
shes sixteen with dark intense eyes
i need a father whos a role model not some horny geek boy whos gonna spray his shorts whenever i bring a girlfriend home from school
snorts what a lame o
somebody really should put him out of his misery
her mind wanders for a beat
want me to kill him for you
jane looks at us and sits up
deadpan yeah would you
were flying above suburban america descending slowly toward a tree lined street
my name is lester burnham
this is my neighborhood
this is my street
is my life
im forty two years old
in less than a year ill be dead
were looking down at a king sized bed from overhead lester burnham lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens face down wearing pajamas
an irritating alarm clock rings
lester gropes blindly to shut it off
of course i dont know that yet
he rolls over looks up at us and sighs
he doesnt seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day
and in a way im dead already
he sits up and puts on his slippers
lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower
angle from outside the shower lesters naked body is silhouetted through the fogged up glass door
it becomes apparent he is masturbating
amused look at me jerking off in the shower
then this will be the high point of my day
its all downhill from here
close on a single dewy american beauty rose
a gloved hand with clippers appears and snips the flower off
carolyn burnham tends her rose bushes in front of the burnham house
a very well put together woman of forty she wears color coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools
lester watches her through a window on the first floor peeping out through the drapes
thats my wife carolyn
see the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs
thats not an accident
in the fenced front yard of the house next door a dog barks repeatedly
a man in a conservative suit jim chastises the barking dog
what is wrong
thats our next door neighbor jim
a second man in a conservative suit jim comes out of the house
and thats his lover jim
re barking dog what in the world is wrong with her
she had a walk this morning
and a jerky treat
you spoil her
lester watches all this from the window
good morning jim
jim walks toward the fence to greet carolyn
overly friendly i just love your tie
i just love your roses
how do you get them to flourish like this
well ill tell you
egg shells and miracle grow
jim and carolyn continue to chat unaware that lester is watching them
i get exhausted just watching her
lesters pov we cant hear what jim and carolyn are saying but shes overly animated like a tv talk show host
she wasnt always like this
she used to be happy
we used to be happy
jane is seated at her desk working at her computer
my daughter jane
close on the computer monitor a personal banking software window suddenly disappears to reveal another window a plastic surgery website featuring clinical before and after photos of surgically augmented breasts
janies a pretty typical teenager
angry insecure confused
i wish i could tell her thats all going to pass
outside a car horn blares
jane stuffs items into her but i dont want to lie to her
we hear the car horn again from outside
jane studies herself in a mirror then shifts to get a good profile of her breasts
carolyn stands next to a platinum colored mercedes benz ml reaching in through the drivers window to blow the horn again
jane shuffles out of the house her backpack slung over her shoulder
are you trying to look unattractive
youve succeeded admirably
jane gets in the car
lester hurries out the front door carrying a briefcase
lester could you make me a little later please
because im not quite late enough
lesters briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill all over the driveway
he drops to his knees to gather everything
nice going dad
lester smiles sheepishly trying to lighten the moment
his pov carolyn looks down at us contemptuous but also bored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago
both my wife and daughter think im this gigantic loser and
carolyn is driving jane stares out the window
lester is asleep in the back seat
i have lost something
im not exactly sure what it is but i know i didnt always feel this
but you know what
its never too late to get it back
lester sits at his workstation a beige cubicle surrounded by identical beige cubicles
hes staring at a computer monitor and talking on a headset phone
the beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light friendly tone of his voice
hello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine im calling for mr
well were all under a deadline here uh but you see there is some basic information about the product launch that isnt even covered in your press release and i
can i ask you a question
who is tamblin
does he exist
cause he doesnt ever seem to come in
yeah okay ill leave my number
brad a dapper man in his thirties approaches and observes lester who is unaware of his presence
lester disconnects the call obviously irritated
you got a minute
lester turns around smiling perfunctorily for you brad
ive got five
brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office
im sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here
lester sits across from him looking small and isolated
times are tight and you gotta free up cash
gotta spend money to make money
brad stands ready to usher lester out
blurts like the time when mr
flournoy used the company mastercard to pay for that hooker and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the st
regis for what was it like three months
startled thats unsubstantiated gossip
thats fifty thousand dollars
thats somebodys salary
thats somebody whos gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him
nobodys getting fired yet
thats why were having everyone write out a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute
that way management can assess whos valuable and whos expendable
its just business
angry ive been writing for this magazine for fourteen years brad
youve been here how long a whole month
frank im one of the good guys les
im trying to level with you
this is your one chance to save your job
lester stares at him powerless
a moving van is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the burnhams
movers carry furniture toward the house
the mercedes benz pulls into the burnham driveway
carolyn drives lester is in the passenger seat
there is no decision you just write the damn thing
you dont think its weird and kinda fascist
but you dont want to be unemployed
oh well lets just all sell our souls and work for satan because its more convenient that way
could you be just a little bit more dramatic please huh
as they get out of the car carolyn scopes out the movers next door
so weve finally got new neighbors
you know if the lomans had let me represent them instead of heavy disdain the real estate king that house would never have sat on the market for six months
she heads into the house followed by lester
well they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore
a substantial portion of the root structure was on our property
you know that
how can you call it their sycamore
i wouldnt have the heart to just cut down something if it wasnt partially mine which of course it was
we hear easy listening music
lester carolyn and jane are eating dinner by candlelight
red roses are bunched in a vase at the center of the table
nobody makes eye contact or even seems aware of anybody elses presence until
mom do we always have to listen to this elevator music
no we dont
as soon as youve prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that im about to eat you can listen to whatever you like
a long beat
lester suddenly turns to jane
so janie how was school
suspicious it was okay
it was spec tac ular
well you want to know how things went at my job today
now she looks at him as if hes lost his mind
theyve hired this efficiency expert this really friendly guy named brad how perfect is that
and hes basically there to make it seem like theyre justified in firing somebody because they couldnt just come right out and say that could they
no no that would be too
and so theyve asked us off her look you couldnt possibly care any less could you
carolyn is watching this closely
uncomfortable well what do you expect
you cant all of a sudden be my best friend just because you had a bad day
she gets up and heads toward the kitchen
i mean hello
youve barely even spoken to me for months
lester notices carolyn looking at him critically
oh what youre mother of the year
you treat her like an employee
taken aback what
lester is quiet staring at his plate
more authority what
lester gets up and starts after jane taking his plate with him
im going to get some ice cream
carolyn watches him go irritated
jane stands at the sink rinsing off her plate
honey im sorry
jane turns and stares at him waiting for him to finish
im sorry i havent been more available i just
hes looking to her for a little help here but shes too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any
finally you know you dont always have to wait for me to come to you
so now its my fault
i didnt say that
its nobodys fault
janie what happened
you and i used to be pals
on video were looking through greenhouse windows at lester and jane in the kitchen we cant hear what theyre saying but its obvious its not going well
jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves
we follow her out the door then the camera jerks back to lester calling after her
close on the face of ricky fitts illuminated by the screen of his digicam as he videotapes
ricky is eighteen but his eyes are much older
beneath his zen like tranquility lurks something wounded
his pov on video through the kitchen window we see lester at the sink rinsing off his plate muttering to himself
his head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us as if he realizes hes being watched
lesters pov were looking out through the kitchen window at the point where ricky was just standing but hes no longer there
lester turns off the faucet dries his hands then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out where it lands next to a framed photograph of lester carolyn
and a much younger jane taken several years earlier at an amusement park
its startling how happy they look
close on a wooden sign that reads carolyn burnham the sign is planted in front of a run down home in a run down neighborhood
the mercedes is parked in front of the house
carolyn wearing a smart business suit is unloading a box of cleaning supplies and a boombox from the back of the mercedes when something across the street catches her eye
her pov in front of a different house with much more curb appeal is another sign featuring a picture of a handsome silver haired man
it reads another one sold by buddy kane the real estate king carolyn frowns and slams the back of the mercedes shut
the interior of this house is ugly oppressive and tasteless
carolyn opens the front door breathes deeply and solemnly announces i will sell this house today
she neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk then strips down to her undergarments
we see carolyn working with fierce concentration as she cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen perches on a stepladder to dust
a cheap looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean
throughout all this she keeps repeating to herself i will sell this house today
i will sell this house today
i will sell this house today
carolyn stands in front of the mirror wearing her suit once more applying lipstick
she stares at her reflection critically
i will sell this house today
she says this as if it were a threat then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off
the front door opens to reveal carolyn greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an eskimo
im carolyn burnham
smiling carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room
theyre thirtyish and theyve seen a lot of houses today
this living room is very dramatic
wait til you see the native stone fireplace
the man and woman glance around the dark room unimpressed
a simple cream would really lighten things up
you could even put in a skylight
the woman wrinkles her face skeptical
well why dont we go into the kitchen
carolyn enters followed by a different couple in their fifties
its a dream come true for any cook
just filled with positive energy
carolyn stands with a different couple african american late twenties
the woman is pregnant
and youll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs
carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish women
you know you could have some really fun backyard get togethers out here
the ad said this pool was lagoon like
theres nothing lagoon like about it
except for maybe the bugs
theres not even any plants out here
re shrub what do you call this
is this not a plant
if you have a problem with the plants i can always call my landscape architect
i mean i think lagoon i think waterfall i think tropical
this is a cement hole
i have some tiki torches in the garage
carolyn enters alone
she locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut then stops
standing very still with the blinds casting shadows across her face she starts to cry brief staccato sobs that seemingly escape against her will
suddenly she slaps herself hard
but the tears continue
she slaps herself again
she slaps herself repeatedly until she stops crying
she stands there taking deep breaths until she has everything under control then pulls the blinds shut once again all business
she walks out calmly leaving us alone in the dark empty room
we hear cheering and applause
were at a high school basketball game
teenage boys play a fast and furious game
one team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket
perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the crowd goes wild
seated in the bleachers next to the high school band is a group of about twenty teenage girls dressed in pale blue and white uniforms
among them jane sits next to angela hayes
at sixteen angela is strikingly beautiful with perfect even features blonde hair and a nubile young body shes the archetypal american dream girl
jane stands and scans the bleachers
who are you looking for
my parents are coming tonight
theyre trying to you know take an active interest in me
i hate it when my mom does that
theyre such assholes
why cant they just have their own lives
lester is slumped in the passenger seat
what makes you so sure she wants us to be there
did she ask us to come
of course not
she doesnt want us to know how important this is to her
but shes been practicing her steps for weeks
well i bet money shes going to resent it
and im missing the james bond marathon on tnt
lester this is important
im sensing a real distance growing between you and jane
she hates me
shes just willful
she hates you too
carolyn stares at him unsure of how to respond
the uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor
and now for your half time entertainment rockwell highs award winning dancing spartanettes
in the crowded stands lester and carolyn find seats
we can leave right after this right
the high school band plays on broadway
on the gym floor the girls perform
theyre well rehearsed but too young to carry off the ambitious vegas routine theyre attempting
lester watching from the stands picks out his daughter
his pov jane performs well concentrating
dancing awkwardly next to her is angela
suddenly angela looks right at us and smiles
a lazy insolent smile
lester leans forward in his seat
his pov were focused on angela now
everything starts to slow down
the music acquires an eerie echo
we zoom slowly toward lester as he watches transfixed
his pov angelas awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace and on broadway fades into dreamy hypnotic music
the light on angela grows stronger and the other girls disappear entirely
lester is suddenly alone in the stands spellbound
his pov angela looks directly at us now dancing only for lester
her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform teasing us with an expression thats both innocent and knowing then
she pulls her uniform open and a profusion of red rose petals spill forth
and we smash cut to
angela fully clothed is once again surrounded by the other girls
the high school band plays its last note the dancing spartanettes strike their final pose and the audience carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience
lester just sits there unable to take his eyes off angela
the game is long over
jane and angela come out of the gym
oh shit theyre still here
her pov lester and carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot
i really enjoyed that
she crosses reluctantly toward her parents followed by angela
congratulations honey you were great
i didnt win anything
to angela hi im lester
an awkward beat
this is my friend angela hayes
okay good to meet you
you were also good tonight
to angela nice to meet you angela
to jane honey im so proud of you
i watched you very closely and you didnt screw up once
then to lester okay we have to go
she starts toward the parking lot
lester stays behind
so what are you girls doing now
were going out for pizza
oh really do you need a ride
we can give you a ride
i have a car
you wanna come with us
but i have a car
oh you have a car
thats great because janies thinking about getting a car soon too arent you honey
you freak dad
moms waiting for you
well it was very nice meeting you angela
any uh friend of janies is a friend of mine
angela smiles aware of the power she has over him
he is mesmerized grateful even
ill be seeing you around then
lester waves awkwardly as he crosses off
could he be any more pathetic
i think its sweet
and i think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time
close on a solitary red rose petal as it falls slowly through the air
were looking down on lester and carolyn in bed
even in sleep carolyn looks determined
lester is awake and stares up at us
its the weirdest thing
the rose petal drifts into view landing on his pillow
i feel like ive been in a coma for about twenty years and im just now waking up
more rose petals fall onto the bed and he smiles up at
his pov angela naked floats above us as a deluge of rose petals falls around her
her hair fans out around her head and glows with a subtle burnished light
she looks down at us with a smile that is all things
lester smiles back and laughs as rose petals cover his face
spec tac ular
a white bmw si convertible is parked on the street outside the burnhams house
we hear girlish laughter from inside
angela is behind the wheel jane in the passenger seat
theyre passing a joint back and forth
im sorry my dad was so weird tonight
im used to guys drooling over me
it started when i was about twelve id go out to dinner with my parents
every thursday night red lobster
and every guy there would stare at me when i walked in
and i knew what they were thinking
just like i knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off
no i liked it
and i still like it
if people i dont even know look at me and want to fuck me it means i really have a shot at being a model
which is great because theres nothing worse in life than being ordinary
an awkward beat
jane stares at the floor
i really think itll happen for you
oh i know
because everything that was meant to happen does
on video jane gets out of the car still laughing and waves as angela pulls away
we zoom toward jane as she walks up the driveway
she turns suddenly sensing our presence
her pov were looking at the colonial house next door where the moving van was parked earlier
the front porch is shrouded in darkness
then a porch light abruptly reveals ricky
as usual hes dressed conservatively
there is a beeper attached to his belt and his digicam dangles loosely around his neck
irritated jane stares at him hard
he looks back at her curiously then raises his digicam and starts to videotape her
his pov on video jane angry and self conscious turns and walks quickly toward her house flipping us off as she goes
jane enters closes and locks the door
she quickly turns off the light thats been left on for her then peeks through a window
her pov theres no sign of ricky
jane turns back into the room her heart racing
close on an address book a mans hand flips to the h page and then his finger stops at the name angela hayes
lester dressed for work goes through janes address book
we hear the shower running in the adjacent bathroom
he grabs janes phone and dials then stands with the receiver to his ear nervous
over phone line hello
lester is frozen unable to speak
suddenly the shower is turned off in the next room
lester hangs up and exits quickly
a moment then the phone rings
jane emerges from the bathroom a towel wrapped around her torso drying her wet hair
she picks up the phone
angela is sprawled across her bed on the phone
whyd you call me
well my phone just rang and i answered it and somebody hung up and then i star sixty nined and it called you back
i was in the shower
then jane notices her address book open to the h page
on video were across from janes window looking in
jane picks up the address book frowning
she speaks into the phone but we cant hear her
sing song rick y
ricky stands at his window videotaping
he lowers his digicam but his eyes remain locked on jane across the way
be right there
barbara fitts stands at the stove flipping bacon strips mechanically her eyes focused elsewhere
at least ten years younger than her husband shes pretty in a june cleaver ish way
the colonel sits at a dinette reading the wall street journal
startled barbara turns to him
as she attempts to serve him bacon i dont eat bacon remember
unnerved im sorry i must have forgotten
ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan then joins his father at the table
whats new in the world dad
this country is going straight to hell
a doorbell rings
the colonel and barbara look at each other alarmed
are you expecting anyone
the colonel heads toward the living room a little puffed up
the colonel opens the front door to reveal the two jims
welcome to the neighborhood
jim holds out a basket filled with flowers vegetables and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia
just a little something from our garden
except for the pasta we got that at fallacis
its unbelievably fresh
you just drop it in the water and its done
the colonel stares at them suspicious
offers his hand jim olmeyer
two doors down
welcome to the neighborhood
shakes colonel frank fitts u
nice to meet you
and this is my partner
offers his hand jim berkley but people call me j
lets cut to the chase okay
what are you guys selling
after a beat nothing
we just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors yeah yeah yeah
but you said youre partners
so whats your business
the jims look at each other then back at the colonel
well hes a tax attorney
and hes an anesthesiologist
the colonel looks at them confused
then it dawns on him
the colonel drives staring darkly at the road ahead
in the passenger seat ricky is using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook
how come these faggots always have to rub it in your face
how can they be so shameless
thats the whole thing dad
they dont feel like its anything to be ashamed of
the colonel looks at ricky sharply
well it is
a beat as ricky continues his calculations before he realizes a response is expected from him
yeah youre right
the colonels eyes flash angrily
dont placate me like im your mother boy
ricky sighs then looks at his father
forgive me sir for speaking so bluntly but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out
the colonel is taken aback but quickly covers
me too son
case closed ricky goes back to his calculations
close on the pencil in his hands hes totaling two columns of numbers
under the column income he writes in swift bold strokes
jane and angela are standing with two other teenage girls
im serious he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out
you know like say hello to mr
it wasnt gross
it was kind of cool
so did you do it with him
of course i did
he is a really well known photographer
he shoots for elle on like a regular basis
it would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down
you are a total prostitute
thats how things really are
you just dont know because youre this pampered little suburban chick
so are you
youve only been in seventeen once and you looked fat so stop acting like youre goddamn christy turlington
the two teenage girls move away from jane and angela
calling off cunt
then i am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me
the colonels ford explorer pulls up and ricky gets out
oh my god
thats the pervert who filmed me last night
hes a total lunatic
you know him
we were on the same lunch shift when i was in ninth grade and he would always say the most random weird things and then one day he was just
and then connie cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution
what did he do
what do you mean
well they cant put you away just for saying weird things
angela stares at jane then her mouth widens into a smile
you total slut
youve got a crush on him
you were defending him
you love him
you want to have like ten thousand of his babies
jane suddenly finds ricky standing in front of her
my names ricky
i just moved next door to you
i kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night
i didnt mean to scare you
i just think youre interesting
angela shoots a wide eyed look at jane who ignores it
thanks but i really dont need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now
im not obsessing
im just curious
he looks at her intently his eyes searching hers
jane is unnerved and has to look away
ricky smiles and walks off
what a freak
and why does he dress like a bible salesman
hes like so confident
that cant be real
i dont believe him
i mean he didnt even like look at me once
close on a tv screen hogans heroes on nick at nite
the colonel and barbara are seated on a couch watching television
the colonel is smiling enjoying the show barbara just stares
the colonel chuckles at a joke and startles her
we hear a door opening elsewhere in the house and ricky enters
he sits on the couch next to his father and watches tv along with them
the colonels smile fades
out of the blue im sorry what
nobody said anything
the three of them stare at the tv like strangers in an airport
we hear music under a room full of people all talking at once as lester and carolyn enter a hotel ballroom
we follow them as they pass a sign that reads everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other
how would it look if i showed up with no one
well you always end up ignoring me and going off inside the ballroom well dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps chatting
catering waiters serve hors deouvres
now listen to me
this is an important business function
as you know my business is selling an image
and part of my job is to live that image just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda
spots someone hi shirley
to lester listen just do me a favor
act happy tonight
grins stupidly i am happy honey
carolyns jaw tightens then spots someone oh
she drags lester toward a silver haired man and his much younger wife
we recognize the man as buddy kane the real estate king
shakes buddys hand buddy
good to see you again
its so good to see you too catherine
how are you
very well thank you
to his wife hello christy
my husband lester shakes lesters hand its a pleasure
oh weve met before actually
this thing last year
or the christmas thing at the sheraton
i wouldnt remember me either
a little too loudly
carolyn quickly joins in
forced gaiety honey
dont be weird
she smiles her most winning smile at him
he knows this persona well only its never pissed him off as much as it does right now
all right honey
i wont be weird
his face close to hers ill be whatever you want me to be
and he kisses her a soft warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex then turns to the others and grins
we have a very healthy relationship
carolyns smile is frozen on her face
i dont know about you but i need a drink
he crosses off
carolyn buddy and christy watch him go
lester stands at the bar
a bartender pours him a drink
put a little more in there cowboy
the bartender complies
lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room
his pov carolyn is talking to buddy and christy
shes on smiling animated laughing too loud at their jokes
lester shakes his head
ricky approaches him wearing a waiters uniform carrying a tray of empty glasses
dont you live on robin hood trail
the house with the red door
im ricky fitts
i just moved into the house next to you
hi ricky fitts
im lester burnham
hi lester burnham
lester looks away scans the crowd then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp
ricky just stands there watching him
finally lester turns back to ricky what does this kid want
do you party
do you get high
lesters surprised but instantly intrigued
carolyn and buddy are deep in conversation
christy has wandered off
carolyn is nervous buddy seems amused
you know i probably wouldnt even tell you this if i werent a little tipsy but
i am in complete awe of you
i mean your firm is hands down the rolls royce of local real estate firms and your personal sales record is is is very intimidating
you know id love to sit down with you and just pick your brain if youd ever be willing
i suppose technically im the competition but
i mean hey i dont flatter myself that im even in the same league as you
id love to
call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch
ill do that
they look at each other for a beat then look away
this situation is loaded and they both know it
ricky and lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel smoking a joint
did you ever see that movie where the bodys walking around holding its own head
and then the head goes down on that babe
suddenly the service entrance opens and a large catering boss in a cheap suit peers out at them
ricky hides the joint
to ricky look
im not paying you to
eyes lester suspiciously do whatever it is youre doing out here
so dont pay me
so you dont have to pay me
now leave me alone
he goes back inside
lester looks at ricky who shrugs
i think you just became my personal hero
then doesnt that make you nervous just quitting your job like that
well i guess when youre all of what
then i just do these gigs as a cover
i have other sources of income
but my dad interferes less in my life when i pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job
carolyn is standing in the open service entrance
lester quickly hides the joint behind his back
what are you doing
honey this is
laughs ricky fitts
this is ricky fitts
im ricky fitts i just moved in the house next to you
i go to school with your daughter
then to lester im ready to go
ill meet you out front
and she goes back inside
im in trouble
nice meeting you ricky fitts
thanks for the uh thing
lester goes inside
calls after him lester
if you want any more you know where i live
jane and angela are watching mtv
we hear the back door open
quick lets go up to my room
jane switches off the tv
i should say hi to your dad
off janes look i dont want to be rude
she starts toward the kitchen
jane doesnt like this
lester enters and opens the refrigerator
he turns and is instantly transfixed by his pov angela leans against the counter twirling her hair
youre looking good mr
she starts toward him
last time i saw you you looked kind of wound up
spots something ooh is that root beer
she reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle
as she does she moves to place her other hand casually on lesters shoulder
he sees it coming
everything slows down and all sound fades
extreme close up on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in slow motion
we hear only the amplified brush of her fingers against the fabric of his suit and its unnatural hollow echo
back in real time she grabs the root beer and smiles at him
close on lester his eyes narrow slightly then he cups her face in his hands and kisses her
she seems shocked but doesnt resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength
he breaks the kiss looking at her in awe then he reaches up and touches his lips
his eyes widen as he pulls a rose petal from his mouth right before we smash angela is back against the counter drinking the root beer
lester stands by the refrigerator gazing at her still lost in fantasy
i love root beer dont you
jane watches from the doorway to the family room feeling incredibly awkward in her own home
carolyn enters from the dining room
lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator
mom you remember angela
her sales smile yes of course
i forgot to tell you shes spending the night
is that okay
he takes a sip of his root beer but it goes down the wrong way and he starts coughing violently
angela lays on the bed in bra and panties reading a magazine
jane in an oversized t shirt plays a video game on her computer
im sorry about my dad
i think its funny
yeah to you hes just another guy who wants to jump your bones
but to me
hes just too embarrassing to live
your moms the one whos embarrassing
what a phony
jane glances at angela irritated
your dads actually kind of cute
lester still in his suit stands outside janes room his ear up against the door
he cant believe what hes hearing
if he just worked out a little hed be hot
oh come on
like youve never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear
i bet hes got a big dick
you are so grossing me out right now
really enjoying this if he built up his chest and arms i would totally fuck him
jane covers her ears and starts singing to drown her out
lester still listening looks like hes about to implode
laughs i would
i would suck your dads big fat dick and then i would fuck him til his eyes rolled back in his head
then what was that noise
janes singing stops
i swear i heard something
panicked lester scurries down the hall
yeah it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig
we hear the sharp tap of a penny being thrown against glass
angela crosses to the window and looks out
spots something oh my god
we see angela standing at the window in her underwear looking down at us
jane joins her and is immediately unnerved by their pov in the burnhams driveway the word jane is spelled out in fire
its that psycho next door
jane what if he worships you
what if hes got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead peoples heads and stuff
i bet hes filming us right now
on video were across from janes window looking in
jane tries to shut the drapes but angela wont let her
irritated jane retreats into the room
we zoom toward her even as angela poses in the window were clearly not interested in angela
the zoom continues searching for jane who has disappeared
finally we settle on the small make up mirror where we see a reflection of jane back at her computer
then suddenly the drapes close and shes gone
ricky sits in darkness with his digicam videotaping
he lowers the camera and smiles
then something below catches his attention
he leans out the window to get a better look at rickys pov through a window on the side of the burnhams garage door we see lester still in his
suit digging through shelves against the back wall
lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves searching for something as if his very life depended on it
he yanks aside college yearbooks a racquetball racquet boxes of old hot rod magazines an unopened remote controlled model jeep kit stacks of old vinyl lps
finally his face lights up when he finds a pair of dumbbells obviously unused for many years
lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt
he glances around finding his reflection in the window as he pulls off his shirt then the t shirt underneath
he eyes himself critically angela was right hes not in bad shape
just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldnt be hard to shed
he kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants
ricky holds his digicam up and starts to videotape
rickys pov on video through a window on the side of the burnhams garage we see lester step out of his pants and briefs
then naked except for his black socks he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them watching his reflection in the window as he does
ricky stands at the window videotaping
welcome to americas weirdest home videos
suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door
moving swiftly ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light
his room is a haven of high tech
a state of the art multimedia computer crowds his desk and high end stereo and video equipment line the shelves as well as hundreds of cds
there is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room
you know i dont like locked doors in my house boy
ricky opens the door
the colonel stands outside eyeing him
im sorry i must have locked it by accident
so whats up
the colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap
i need a urine sample
its been six months already
can i give it to you in the morning
i just took a whiz
yeah i suppose
an awkward beat well
good night son
he disappears down the hall
ricky smiles shuts and locks his door
he puts the plastic cup on the shelf then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup sized tupperware container from the
freezer already filled with urine albeit frozen and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight
carolyn lies sleeping
lester is awake staring at the ceiling
after a moment he gets up taking care not to disturb carolyn and walks toward the bathroom
lester enters and switches on the light
the room is filled with steam
lester looks around confused then focuses on his pov across from us in a pedestal bathtub is angela
she smiles and beckons us and we move closer
rose petals float on the surface of the water obscuring her naked body
ive been waiting for you
lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church
youve been working out havent you
i can tell
she arches her back and looks up at him provocatively
i was hoping youd give me a bath
im very very dirty
lester gives her a hard look then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs
her eyes widen and she throws her head back
and we smash cut to close on carolyn her eyes wide listening to the rhythmic brush of lesters hand as he masturbates under the covers
she flips over and faces him
what are you doing
carolyn switches on the bedside light
you were masturbating
i was not
yes you were
he turns to her trying to look innocent then gives up
all right so shoot me
i was whacking off
carolyn gets out of bed repelled
i was choking the bishop
shaving the carrot
saying hi to my monster
well excuse me but i still have blood pumping through my veins
so do i
im the only one who seems to be doing anything about it
i refuse to live like this
this is not a marriage
this hasnt been a marriage for years
but you were happy as long as i kept my mouth shut
well guess what
and the new me whacks off when he feels horny because youre obviously not going to help me out in that department
you think youre the only one whos sexually frustrated
well then come on baby
furious do not mess with me mister or i will divorce you so fast itll make your head spin
on what grounds
im not a drunk i dont fuck other women i dont mistreat you ive never hit you or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear
just how unnecessary you consider me to be
i did support you while you got your license
and some people might think that entitles me to half of whats yours
she sinks into a chair stunned
its clear he knows where shes most vulnerable
he sees this and likes it it feels good to win for a change
he curls up under the covers contentedly
turn out the light when you come to bed okay
close on lester smiling
were flying high above the neighborhood
below us we see the two jims jogging
we approach them steadily
its a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself
makes you wonder what else you can do that youve forgotten about
were now at street level following the two jims
still running the jims turn back in perfect unison as lester runs into frame wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants
the jims slow down until he catches up then the three men run together in the early morning light
lester i didnt know you ran
panting well i just started
good for you
i figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers
i need to shape up
well are you just looking to lose weight or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well
i want to look good naked
the colonel is washing his ford explorer squatting to scrub the bumper when something catches his eye his pov lester and the jims jog down the street
the colonel stands scowling as ricky comes out of the house holding the urine sample in front of him
what is this the fucking gay pride parade
lester breaks off from the two jims and jogs up to ricky and the colonel out of breath
he grabs hold of his knees and bends over panting
re the jims my entire life is passing before my eyes and those two have barely broken a sweat
he laughs and extends his hand to the colonel
lester burnham i live next door
we havent met
shakes colonel frank fitts u
welcome to the neighborhood sir
he salutes the colonel good naturedly grinning
the colonel doesnt think its funny
an awkward beat
so ricky uh i was thinking about the uh
i was gonna
the movie we talked about
quickly re animator
you want to borrow it
before lester can answer okay its up in my room
he heads into the house
lester waves at the colonel then follows him
the colonel watches them go his eyes dark
ricky enters followed by lester
can you hold this for a sec
he gives the urine specimen to lester then locks the door
i dont think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here but you never know
ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a drawer
he takes clothing out and piles it on his bed
re urine sample what is this
i have to take a drug test every six months to make sure im clean
are you kidding
you just smoked with me last night
its not mine
one of my clients is a nurse in a pediatricians office
i cut her a deal she keeps me in clean piss
lester picks up a cd case from a shelf and examines it
you like pink floyd
i like a lot of music
man i havent listened to this album in years
he shakes his head then puts the cd case down
ricky having emptied the drawer now removes a false bottom revealing rows of marijuana tightly packed in zip loc bags
how much do you want
i dont know its been a while
how much is an ounce
indicates bag well this is totally decent and its three hundred
indicates another bag but this shit is top of the line
its called g
genetically engineered by the u
but a completely mellow high no paranoia
is that what we smoked last night
this is all i ever smoke
things have changed since
you dont have to pay now
i know youre good for it
hands him a bag theres a card in there with my beeper number call me anytime day or night
and i only accept cash
looks around room well now i know how you can afford all this equipment
when i was your age i flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track
no actually it was great
all i did was party and get laid
smiles i had my whole life ahead of me
my dad thinks i pay for all this with catering jobs
off lesters look never underestimate the power of denial
this kids cool
carolyn carrying a basket of fresh cut roses passes by the garage window
from inside the garage we hear rock music
carolyn stops and sniffs the air frowning
she peers through the window
her pov lester in a t shirt and gym shorts lies on a new weight bench doing bench presses with shiny new barbells
rock music blasts from a new boombox on the floor
the garage is in the process of becoming lesters sanctuary
an ugly but comfortable s bowl chair has been pulled out and cleaned off his old hot rod magazines strewn across it and the remote controlled model jeep kit is
spread across a card table
the shelves that lester tore through earlier have been dismantled leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a lester finishes his last rep straining then puts the weights in
their rack and sits up
as he takes a drag off a joint the garage door suddenly starts to open
lester looks up squinting at his pov the door raises to reveal carolyn silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside pointing a remote at us
uh oh moms mad
what the hell do you think youre doing
im going to wail on my pecs and then im going to do my back
i see youre smoking pot now
im so glad
i think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter
youre one to talk you bloodless money grubbing freak
you have such hostility in you
do you mind
im trying to work out here
then suggestively unless you want to spot me
you will not get away with this
you can be sure of that
and shes gone
lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights
as he lifts thats
brad is seated behind his desk reading a document
lester sits across from him smiling
my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge and at least once a day retiring to the mens room so i can jerk off while
i fantasize about a life that doesnt so closely resemble hell
looks up at lester well you obviously have no interest in saving yourself
laughs brad for fourteen years ive been a whore for the advertising industry
the only way i could save myself now is if i start firebombing
management wants you gone by the end of the day
well just what sort of severance package is management prepared to offer me
considering the information i have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money
which im sure would interest the i
since it technically constitutes fraud
and im sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well
not to mention craigs wife
what do you want
one years salary with benefits
thats not going to happen
well what do you say i throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot
brad stops laughing
can you prove you didnt offer to save my job if id let you blow me
brad leans back in his chair studying lester
you are one twisted fuck
im just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose
exhilarated lester walks down a corridor his belongings in a box on his shoulder
hes happier than hes been in years
carolyn sits at a table lost in thought
there are two menus on the table
after a moment buddy kane the real estate king joins her
carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious
carolyn smiles genuinely touched that he remembers her name
im so sorry i kept you waiting
christy left for new york this morning and
lets just say things were very hectic around the house
whats she doing in new york
shes moving there
off carolyns look yes
we are splitting up
im so sorry
bitterly yes according to her im too focused on my career
as if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw
well she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her
then laughing ah its for the best
when i saw you two at the party the other night you seemed perfectly happy
well call me crazy but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful one must project an image of success at all times
he smiles then opens his menu
carolyn picks hers up mechanically but continues to stare at him enraptured like a fervent christian whos just come face to face with jesus
ricky stands with his digicam videotaping something on the ground at his feet
on video a dead bird lays on the ground decomposing
what are you doing
on video the camera jerks up to discover jane and angela staring at us
i was filming this dead bird
because its beautiful
on video angela looks at jane trying not to laugh
i think maybe you forgot your medication today mental boy
on video she falls out of frame as we zoom toward jane
i want you to stop filming me
ricky lowers the digicam
he looks at her curious his eyes searching hers
she doesnt look away
to jane this is boring
to ricky do you need a ride
to jane are you crazy
i dont want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere
he doesnt want to go anyway
cmon lets go
angela starts off but jane doesnt follow
ricky smiles at her
she almost smiles back then calls off to angela i think im going to walk too
angela stops and stares at her
jane thats like almost a mile
carolyns mercedes is parked next to a jaguar convertible with a vanity license plate that reads r e king
carolyn and buddy are in the middle of sex
i love it
you like getting nailed by the king
i love it
fuck me your majesty
lesters toyota camry cruises through the streets
we hear lester singing along to american woman on the stereo
lester is driving smoking a joint
lester continues singing along to american woman as the camry pulls into the parking lot of a fast food restaurant
lester pulls up to the drive thru speaker box
over speaker box smile youre at mr
lester turns down the volume on the stereo
would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita just a dollar twenty nine for a limited time only
but thank you
reading menu ill have a big barn burger smiley fries and an orange soda
please drive up to the window thank you
he pulls the car around to the window where a teenage girl wearing a headset is waiting
smile youre at mr
smileys thatll be four eighty nine please
lester pays her
as she hands him his food he notices a sign in the corner of the window that reads would you like some smiley sauce
id like to fill out an application
she stares at him confused by his age and attire
theres not jobs for manager its just for counter
im looking for the least possible amount of responsibility
lester sits at a booth with the manager a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the mr
he looks over lesters application baffled
i dont think youd fit in here
i have fast food experience
yeah like twenty years ago
well im sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry but surely you have some sort of training process
it seems unfair to presume i wont be able to learn
the manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this
carolyn and buddy are in bed post sex
that was exactly what i needed
the royal treatment so to speak
i was so stressed out
know what i do when i feel like that
i fire a gun
carolyn sits up eager to learn from the master
oh yeah i go to this little firing range downtown and i just pop off a few rounds
embarrassed ive never fired a gun before
oh youve gotta try it
nothing makes you feel more powerful
smiles seductively well almost nothing
carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him ready for another round
ricky and jane walk along without speaking
he seems comfortable with the silence she doesnt
after a beat so how do you like your new house
i like it
the people who used to live there fed these stray cats so they were always around and it drove my mother nuts
and then she cut down their tree
an automobile funeral procession appears and begins to pass them slowly
have you ever known anybody who died
a beat have you
no but i did see this homeless woman who froze to death once
just laying there on the sidewalk
she looked really sad
they watch the funeral cars pass
i got that homeless woman on video
why would you film that
because it was amazing
what was amazing about it
when you see something like that its like god is looking right at you just for a second
and if youre careful you can look right back
and what do you see
barbara fitts sits at the kitchen table staring off into space as if hypnotized
behind her ricky enters followed by jane
mom i want you to meet somebody
no response mom
barbaras eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly
i want you to meet somebody
this is jane
i apologize for the way things look around here
jane glances around
the room is spotless
we hear keys turning in the lock then the door opens and ricky enters holding a ring of keys followed by jane
this is where my dad hides out
glass cases filled with guns line the walls
i take it hes got a thing for guns
ricky crosses to a built in cabinet behind the desk
you got to see this one thing
he unlocks the cabinet and opens it revealing shelves stacked with war memorabilia
my dad would kill me if he knew i was in here
did you steal his keys
one of my clients is a locksmith
he was short on cash one night so i let him pay me in trade
he reaches into the cabinet and carefully removes an oval china platter which he hands to jane
she examines it
turn it over
close on the bottom of the plate a small swastika is imprinted in the center
oh my god
its like official state china of the third reich
theres a whole subculture of people who collect this nazi shit
but my dad just has this one thing
he puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door then notices jane looking at him oddly
concerned no youre scared of me
no im not
but she is
ricky studies her
you want to see the most beautiful thing ive ever filmed
on video were in an empty parking lot on a cold gray day
something is floating across from us
its an empty wrinkled white plastic bag
we follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us sometimes whipping it about violently or without warning sending it soaring skyward then letting it float gracefully
down to the ground
jane and ricky sit on the bed watching his wide screen tv
it was one of those days when its a minute away from snowing
and theres this electricity in the air you can almost hear it right
and this bag was just
dancing with me
like a little kid begging me to play with it
for fifteen minutes
thats the day i realized that there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid
videos a poor excuse i know
but it helps me remember
i need to remember
now jane is watching him
distant sometimes theres so much beauty in the world i feel like i cant take it
and my heart is going to cave in
after a moment jane takes his hand
then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips
his eyes scan hers curious to see how she reacts to this
suddenly oh my god
what time is it
lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle
across from him carolyn picks at her food watching him with contempt
easy listening music plays on the stereo
we hear the back door slam then jane enters and quickly takes her seat at the table
sorry im late
overly cheerful no no thats quite all right dear
your father and i were just discussing his day at work
to lester why dont you tell our daughter about it honey
jane stares at both her parents apprehensive
lester looks at carolyn darkly then flashes a you asked for it grin
janie today i quit my job
and then i told my boss to fuck himself and then i blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars
pass the asparagus
your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of
and your mother seems to prefer i go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink
ashen how dare you speak to me that way in front of her
and i marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me on the same day that you lose your job
i didnt lose it
its not like oops whered my job go
someone pass me the asparagus
and i want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now i already have a job
not stopping no no dont give a second thought as to whos going to pay the mortgage
well just leave it all up to carolyn
you mean youre going to take care of everything now carolyn
i dont mind
i really dont
you mean everything
you dont mind having the sole responsibility your husband feels he can just quit his job overlapping will someone pass me the fucking asparagus
rises okay im not going to be a part of this means it sit down
jane does so surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice
lester gets up crosses to the other side of the table to get a plate of asparagus then sits again as he serves himself
im sick and tired of being treated like i dont exist
you two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and i dont complain
all i want is the same courtesy overlapping oh you dont complain
oh excuse me
i must be psychotic then if you dont complain
what is this
am i locked away in a padded cell somewhere hallucinating
thats the only explanation i can think of lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it shatters frightening carolyn and jane
casual dont interrupt me honey
he goes back to eating his meal as if nothing unusual has happened
carolyn sits in her chair shivering with rage
jane just stares at the plate in front of her
oh and another thing
from now on were going to alternate our dinner music
because frankly and i dont think im alone here im really tired of this lawrence welk shit
jane is sitting on her bed
there is a knock at the door
honey please let me in
jane rolls her eyes crosses to the door and lets carolyn in
i wish that you hadnt witnessed that awful scene tonight
but in a way im glad
why so i could see what freaks you and dad really are
she stares at jane then starts to cry
aw christ mom
tearful no im glad because youre old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life you cannot count on anyone except yourself
sighs you cannot count on anyone except yourself
its sad but true and the sooner you learn it the better
look mom i really dont feel like having a kodak moment here okay
carolyn suddenly slaps jane hard
you ungrateful little brat
just look at everything you have
when i was your age i lived in a duplex
we didnt even have our own house
embarrassed she quickly leaves
jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek then crosses to the window and looks out
janes pov were across from rickys room looking in
he stands at the window with his digicam videotaping us
on the wide screen tv behind him we see jane standing in her window as she looks across at him
ricky just keeps videotaping
a beat then she starts to take off her shirt
were behind ricky as he videotapes jane in her window
she has now removed her shirt
she stands there in her bra then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra
on video we zoom toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily
shes obviously embarrassed but shes gone this far and theres no turning back
she stands there with her breasts exposed trying to look defiant but shes achingly vulnerable
suddenly the door is thrown open and the colonel enters incensed
startled ricky turns around
as soon as his eyes meet his fathers he knows whats up
you little bastard ricky scrambles to dodge his father but the colonel is too fast he punches ricky in the face knocking him to the floor
how did you get in there
from her window jane watches pulling the drapes in front of her
janes pov in the window across from us the colonel proceeds to give ricky a serious beating punching his face
rickys lip is bleeding but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence
cmon get up
fight back you little pussy
i wont fight you
the colonel grabs him by the collar
how did you get in there
i picked the lock sir
what were you looking for
are you on dope again
i wanted to show my girlfriend your nazi plate
she lives next door
the colonel glances toward the window
his pov in the window across from us jane peeks out from behind the drape
she quickly pulls it shut
her names jane
the colonel is suddenly deeply shamed
this is for your own good boy
you have no respect for other peoples things for authority for
sir im sorry
you cant just go around doing whatever you feel like you cant there are rules in life yes sir
you need structure you need discipline simultaneous discipline
yes sir thank you for trying to teach me
dont give up on me dad
the colonel stands still breathing heavily
tenderness fills his face and he reaches out to touch rickys cheek
but something keeps him from doing it
you stay out of there
ricky gets up and goes to his bureau
he looks at his reflection in the mirror calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face
in darkness we hear repetitive gunshots
carolyn wearing protective headgear is holding a glock automatic revolver with both hands firing it directly at us
she empties a round and stands there exhilarated
an attendant approaches with a new round of ammunition
loading gun i gotta say mrs
burnham when you first came here i thought you would be hopeless
but youre a natural
well all i know is
i love shooting this gun
and she starts firing again
bobby darin sings dont rain on my parade on the radio
carolyn sings along as she drives
her face has lost its usual resolute determination shes actually enjoying herself spontaneously and the lack of her usual self consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is
angle on the glock sitting on the passenger seat amidst some cds
carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arms length admiring it as she continues to sing
the mercedes turns onto robin hood trail
carolyns pov we turn into the burnham driveway
a pontiac firebird with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage
close on carolyn she doesnt like having things in her way
lesters remote controlled model jeep is zooming across the floor of the family room expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing
lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear drinking a beer and controlling the car
his working out is beginning to produce results
the room too seems changed sloppier more lived in
carolyn enters through the kitchen flushed and angry
she just stands there staring at lester
after a moment he looks up at her
ah whose car is that out front
the car i always wanted and now i have it
wheres the camry
i traded it in
shouldnt you have consulted me first
hmm let me think
you never drove it
then have you done something different
you look great
brusque wheres jane
jane not home
we have the whole house to ourselves
he smiles at her playfully
she stares back annoyed
its the same look she had at the beginning when he dropped his briefcase but whatever power that look had is gone
lester just laughs
when did you become so
taken aback joyless
i am not joyless
there happens to be a lot about me that you dont know mister smarty man
there is plenty of joy in my life
leaning toward her whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored
and who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters
have you totally forgotten about her
because i havent
his face is close to hers and suddenly the atmosphere is charged
she pulls back automatically but its clear shes drawn to him
he smiles and moves even closer holding his beer loosely balanced
then just before their lips meet
barely audible lester
youre going to spill beer on the couch
shes immediately sorry she said it but its too late
his smile fades and the moment is gone
its just a couch
this is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in italian silk
this is not just a couch
its just a couch
he stands and gestures toward all the things in the room
this isnt life
this is just stuff
and its become more important to you than living
well honey thats just nuts
carolyn stares at him on the verge of tears then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry
calls after her im only trying to help you
on video jane lays in rickys bed wearing a tank top
she glances at us
were watching the wide screen tv in rickys room
a cord leads from the tv to rickys digicam
ricky holds the camera sitting naked in a chair
its been almost a month since his father beat him up and there are still slight scars on his face
hes aiming his camera at jane
re image on tv its weird watching myself
i dont like how i look
i cant believe you dont know how beautiful you are
im not going to sit here for that shit
she gets out of bed takes his digicam and focuses it on him
we see his image on the tv as she videotapes
how does it feel now
you dont feel naked
i am naked
you know what i mean
jane zooms in on his face which remains placid
tell me about being in the hospital
when i was fifteen my dad caught me smoking dope
he totally freaked and decided to send me to military school
i told you his whole thing about structure and discipline right
laughs well of course i got kicked out
dad and i had this huge fight and he hit me
and then the next day at school some kid made a crack about my haircut and
i just snapped
i wanted to kill him
and i would have
if they hadnt pulled me off
then thats when my dad put me in the hospital
then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years
you must really hate him
hes not a bad man
he grabs a half smoked joint from an ashtray and lights it
you better believe id hate my father if he did something like that to me
i do hate my father
he passes her the joint then takes the digicam and focuses it on her
we see her image on the tv as he videotapes
hes a total asshole and hes got this crush on my friend angela and its disgusting
youd rather he had the crush on you
but itd be nice if i was anywhere near as important to him as she is
i know you think my dads harmless but youre wrong
hes doing massive psychological damage to me
jane looks into the camera a loopy stoned grin on her face
well now i too need structure
a little fucking discipline
she lays back on the bed
im serious though
how could he not be damaging me
i need a father whos a role model not some horny geek boy whos gonna spray his shorts whenever i bring a girlfriend home from school
snorts what a lame o
somebody really should put him out of his misery
her mind wanders for a beat
want me to kill him for you
jane looks at him and sits up
yeah would you
smiles itll cost you
well ive been baby sitting since i was about ten
ive got almost three thousand dollars
course i was saving it up for a boob job
she stands and sticks out her breasts then falls back on the bed laughing
but my tits can wait huh
you know thats not a very nice thing to do hiring somebody to kill your dad
well i guess im just not a very nice girl then am i
she smiles dreamily at him
he turns the digicam off and the tv screen goes blue
he lowers the camera and looks at her intently
suddenly nervous you know im not serious right
he puts the digicam down and joins jane on the bed
a long moment where neither of them speaks
he caresses her hair gazing into her eyes
do you know how lucky we are to have found each other
were flying above robin hood trail
we see the burnhams house below us as we approach it steadily
remember those posters that said today is the first day of the rest of your life
well thats true of every day except one
a beat the day you die
were almost on top of the burnham house now as lester wearing sweatpants and running shoes bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway
were now at street level as lester runs toward us
he carries a walkman and wears earphones and we hear rock music as he runs
the endorphins have kicked in and lester grins reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body
the blender grinds as lester still in his sweatpants makes himself a high protein shake
hes in excellent shape even his posture has changed and he moves with the confident easy swagger of an athlete
jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table
lester leans against the counter drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher eyeing her
hes got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable and he knows it
carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup avoiding his eyes and starts out
jane hurry up
ive got a very important appointment mom is it okay if angela sleeps over tonight
jane looks at lester to see how he reacts
well of course shes always welcome
on her way out you know i thought maybe you two had a fight
i havent seen her around here in a while
and shes gone
jane continues staring at her father
finally he glances over at her
nervous ive been too embarrassed to bring her over
because of you and the way that you behave
what are you talking about
ive barely even spoken to her
you stare at her all the time like youre drunk
angry himself you better watch yourself janie or youre going to turn into a real bitch just like your mother
jane is stunned
she quickly rises trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying
angle on lester and the immediate regret in his eyes
under his breath fuck
were outside rickys room moving slowly toward the open door through which we can see ricky standing at his bureau mirror combing his hair
the scars on his face are almost gone now
a reverse angle reveals the colonel standing outside the door looking in watching ricky with great tenderness
then ricky looks up at him and the colonel is suddenly self conscious
brusque you ready to go
oh i dont need a ride
im going to go in with jane and her mom
ricky emerges from the house followed by the colonel who watches his son as he heads toward the burnham house
his pov carolyn waves from the mercedes flashing an insincere smile
jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us
as ricky starts to get in the car lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants
hows it going
pretty decent mr
ricky pulls his door shut but not before lester mouths call me and ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment
close on the colonels face he looks confused
as the mercedes backs out of the driveway lester glances over at him
lesters pov the colonel watches the car driving off then looks at us
his face tightens
lester studies him for a moment then grins and salutes before going inside the house
close on the colonel deeply troubled
the door swings open silently and the colonel enters
he starts going through rickys bureau
he opens the drawer in which we know ricky keeps his marijuana but he doesnt discover its false bottom
he stands and looks around his eyes finally landing on the digicam and a stack of cassettes on a shelf
the camera is still connected to the tv
the colonel turns on the tv examines the digicam and presses play
the tvs blank screen suddenly gives way to
on video barbara fitts sits at the kitchen table staring off into space
the colonel watches at first baffled then impatient
he takes the cassette out of the digicam and inserts another
on the tv screen we see
on video through the burnhams garage window we see lester step out of his pants and briefs
then naked except for his black socks he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them watching his reflection in the window as he does
the colonel sinks slowly onto rickys bed mesmerized
lester wearing a mr
smileys uniform is happily flipping burgers on a grill
hey lester i need that super smiley with cheese a
you need more than that my little hombre
lester looks up suddenly when he hears over speakers whats good here
over speakers nothing
over speakers then i guess well just have to be bad wont we
then i think ill have a double smiley sandwich and curly fries and a vanilla shake
over speakers make that two
over speakers please drive around thank you
lesters face darkens then
he puts his spatula down
the mercedes pulls around to the drive thru window
carolyn drives buddy sits beside her
i think we deserve a little junk food after the workout we had this morning
nuzzles her neck im flattered
they are too involved with each other to notice lester watching them from the drive thru window
overly cheerful smile
youre at mr
carolyn almost jumps out of her skin
lester leans out of the drive thru window grinning at her holding bags filled with fast food
the counter girl stands next to him staring blankly
would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick just a dollar ninety nine for a limited time only
carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant
re buddy we were just at a seminar
then all business buddy this is my her husband
weve met before but something tells me youre going to remember me this time
to carolyn whoa
you are so busted
flustered you know this really doesnt concern you
actually janeane is senior drive thru manager so you kind of are on her turf
to carolyn quietly so
this makes sense
miserable oh lester honey its okay
i want you to be happy
then would you like smiley sauce with that
lester just stop it
you dont get to tell me what to do
carolyn closes her eyes defeated then grabs the wheel shifts gears and drives off
the sky is filled with ominous gray clouds
wind whips garbage across the parking lot as carolyns mercedes pulls in next to buddys jaguar
carolyn grips the wheel tightly staring straight ahead
buddy looks at her unhappily
i guess we should cool it for a while
im facing a potentially very expensive divorce
i understand completely
sarcastic in order to be successful one must project an image of success
at all times
she regrets it the second its out of her mouth and turns to him
he just looks at her sadly then gets out of the car and shuts the door
she starts to cry
as before she slaps herself hard
she closes her eyes tight trying to stop the tears then suddenly screams as loud as she can
buddys jaguar speeds off leaving the mercedes alone in the parking lot
we can still hear carolyns muffled screaming
there is a sound of distant thunder
its raining outside
we hear rock music as lester pumps iron
he puts the weights down and looks at his reflection in the window his pov his arms are pumped
he reaches under the bench and grabs a cigar box
opening it he digs through marijuana paraphernalia only to pull out an empty zip loc bag
ricky and the colonel sit at the table eating in silence
barbara rinses off a pan at the sink then stares at it as if she cant quite remember what she meant to do with it
we suddenly hear a beeping noise
ricky pulls his beeper off his belt and checks it
getting up i have to run next door
jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework
he heads into the hall
the colonel watches him go uneasy
angela drives squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth
so you and psycho boy are fucking on like a regular basis now right
oh come on
you can tell me
does he have a big dick
look im not gonna talk about his dick with you okay
its not like that
not like what
doesnt he have one
then why dont you want to talk about it
i mean i tell you every single detail about every guy that i fuck
yeah and maybe you shouldnt all right
maybe i dont really want to hear all that
oh so now that you have a boyfriend youre like above it
rolls her eyes we gotta get you a real man
the colonel rinses off his plate at the sink
something outside catches his eye and he cranes his neck to get a better look at
his pov through the window over the sink we can see into the burnhams garage window
our view is blurred by the rain but we see lester his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills
and then ricky walks into view
the colonels face tightens
his pov lester drapes his arm around ricky as he gives him the money
we can only see lester from the waist up so he looks naked
ricky his hair wet from the rain puts the cash in his pocket
lesters arm remains draped around his shoulder
grins you got any papers
yeah in the cigar box right over there
laughs you know put up a fight dude
you are such a pushover
no i cant
and he slaps ricky playfully on the chest
ricky grins then squats down and reaches under the weight bench
you should learn to roll a joint
lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back his hands behind his head watching ricky roll the joint
the colonels pov lester leans back in his chair
we see only rickys back and shoulders as he rolls the joint
after a beat lesters jaw drops then he throws his head back
from our perspective it looks very much like ricky is giving lester a blow job
the colonel watches incredulous
then we hear a car approaching and the colonel glances over at his pov angelas bmw pulls into the driveway stopping behind lesters firebird
as angela and jane get out and run toward the house our focus moves back to the garage window
ricky stands looking a little panicked
lester pulls on his t shirt and both he and ricky cross out of view
lester leans nonchalantly against the counter
jane and angela enter
jane frowns when she sees him
hes trying to remain cool and doing a pretty good job
look at you
have you been working out
jane rolls her eyes and exits
angela walks over to lester
you can really tell
look at those arms
she places her hand on his arm flirtatiously looks up at him and smiles fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so
but something has changed and he isnt intimidated at all
he looks directly back at her leans in and smiles slowly
you like muscles
his voice is low and intense
she moves away suddenly insecure
i i should probably go see what janes up to
and she heads out quickly
lester watches her go baffled
ricky enters wet from the pouring rain and crosses to his bureau pulling the wad of cash out of his pocket as he goes
whered you get that
ricky turns startled
his pov the colonel steps out of the shadows
ricky takes a step back
from my job
dont lie to me
beat i saw you with him
incredulous you were watching me
what did he make you do
laughs dad you dont really think
me and mr
furious dont you laugh at me
i will not sit back and watch my only son become a cocksucker
jesus what is with you the colonel backhands ricky so hard it sends the boy sprawling
i swear to god i will throw you out of this house and never look at you again
taken aback you mean that
damn straight i do
id rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot
ricky suddenly smiles
he gets up
i suck dick for money
boy two thousand dollars
im that good
and you should see me fuck
im the best piece of ass in three states
explodes get out
i dont ever want to see you again
ricky eyes the colonel
hes finally discovered a way to break free from his father and he cant believe it was this simple
what a sad old man you are
a whisper get out
ricky grabs his backpack turns and walks out the door leaving the colonel standing there glassy eyed and breathing heavily
ricky enters to discover barbara standing in the middle of the room clutching a dish frightened
shes obviously heard his argument with his father and she looks into his eyes searching aware that something eventful is taking place
mom im leaving
okay wear a raincoat
hugs her i wish things would have been better for you
take care of dad
he kisses her cheek softly then exits out the back door leaving her standing alone still clutching her dish
the colonels pov below us ricky dashes through the rain to the burnhams front door and knocks
lester opens it and lets him in
the colonel looks coldly down at us from rickys bedroom window and then he pulls the drapes shut
the mercedes benz ml is parked in the breakdown lane its hazard lights blinking
cars zoom past in the rain
carolyn sits behind the wheel listening to a motivational tape on the stereo
disinvesting problems of their power and removing their ability to make us afraid
this is the secret to me centered living
only by taking full responsibility for your problems and their solutions will you ever be able to break free from the constant cycle of victimhood
carolyn leans over and open the glove compartment
she takes out her glock
remember you are only a victim if you choose to be a victim
angela is sprawled across the bed
jane stands across the room from her
i dont think we could be friends anymore
you are way too uptight about sex
just dont fuck my dad all right
there is a knock on the door
jane sits up alarmed
leave us alone
jane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in
to jane if i had to leave tonight would you come with me
if i had to go to new york
would you come with me
you guys cant be serious
to jane youre just a kid
and hes like a mental case
youll end up living in a box on the street
im no more a kid than you are
to ricky we can use my plastic surgery money
we wont have to
i have over forty thousand dollars
and i know people in the city who can help us get set up
what other drug dealers
jane youd be out of your mind to go with him
why do you even care
because youre my friend
shes not your friend
shes somebody you use to feel better about yourself
go fuck yourself psycho
you shut up bitch
he is a freak
well then so am i
and well always be freaks and well never be like other people
and youll never be a freak because youre just too perfect
well at least im not ugly
yes you are
and youre boring
and youre totally ordinary
and you know it
angela stares at him stunned then starts toward the door
you two deserve each other
and she exits slamming the door behind her
jane turns to ricky and he takes her in his arms
angela sits on the stairs shaken crying
were moving slowly toward the burnhams garage window through the rain
through the window we see lester wearing only his sweatpants performing bench presses
through the window we see the colonel standing outside watching
we zoom slowly in on him as he watches transfixed
his pov lester finishes his last rep then racks the weights and sits up sweaty and out of breath
he runs his free hand over his chest
and then he glances at us suddenly aware hes being watched
lester and the colonel stare at each other through the window
the rain is coming down in sheets now and there is a sharp clap of thunder
were directly outside the garage door as it slowly lifts to reveal lester smiling at us
lester pulls the colonel inside
the colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied slightly disoriented
you want me to get ricky
hes in janes room
the colonel just stands there looking at lester
his voice thick wheres your wife
i dont know
probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole
and you know what
i dont care
the colonel moves closer towards him
your wife is with another man and you dont care
nope our marriage is just for show
a commercial for how normal we are
when we are anything but
and so does the colonel
he places his hand on the colonels shoulder
the colonel closes his eyes
we really should get you out of these clothes
a whisper yes
he opens his eyes and looks at lester his face filled with an anguished vulnerability we wouldnt have thought possible from him
his eyes are brimming with tears
lester leans in concerned
hoarse softly just tell me what you need
the colonel reaches up and places his hand on lesters cheek
and then kisses him
lester is momentarily stunned and then he pushes the colonel away
the colonels face crumples in shame
whoa whoa whoa
you got the wrong idea
the colonel stares at the floor blinking and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night
carolyn is still listening to the same motivational tape
she holds the glock in her hand
i refuse to be a victim
when this becomes your mantra constantly running through your head carolyn switches the tape off and puts the gun in her purse
i refuse to be a victim
the mercedes pulls away from the shoulder
lester enters opens the refrigerator and grabs a beer
suddenly we hear music coming from the other room
lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room
his pov as we move slowly around a corner angela comes into view standing at the stereo holding a cd case
shes been crying her face is puffy and her hair mussed
she regards us apprehensively
then puts on a slightly defiant smile
i hope you dont mind if i play the stereo
lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer
not at all
then bad night
not really bad just
grins believe me
it couldnt possibly be any stranger than mine
they stand there in silence the atmosphere is charged
jane and i had a fight
after a beat it was about you
shes trying to be seductive as she says this but shes pretty bad at it
lester raises his eyebrows
shes mad at me because i said i think youre sexy
he is sexy
offering beer do you want a sip
lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily
he gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand
are you going to tell me
what you want
i dont know
you dont know
his face is very close to hers
shes unnerved this is happening too fast
what do you want
are you kidding
i want you
ive wanted you since the first moment i saw you
you are the most beautiful thing i have ever seen
angela takes a deep breath just before lester leans in to kiss her cheek her forehead her eyelids her neck
you dont think im ordinary
you couldnt be ordinary if you tried
far away i dont think theres anything worse than being ordinary
and lester kisses her on the lips
carolyn drives her face resolute
i refuse to be a victim
i refuse to be a victim
i refuse to be a victim
angry lester i have something i have to say to you
angela lays back on the couch as lester moves in over her
he pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs then moves up and caresses her face
ricky and jane fully clothed lie curled up on janes bed
are you scared
i dont get scared
my parents will try to find me
lester starts unbuttoning angelas blouse
she seems disconnected from whats happening
lester pulls her blouse open exposing her breasts
lester looks down at her grinning unable to believe hes actually about to do what hes dreamed of so many times and then
this is my first time
a whisper im sorry
lester looks down at her his grin fading
his pov angela lies beneath us embarrassed and vulnerable
this is not the mythically carnal creature of lesters fantasies this is a nervous child
i still want to do it
i just thought i should tell you
in case you wondered why i wasnt
lesters face falls
theres no way hes going to go through with this now
confused whats wrong
i thought you said i was beautiful
tenderly you are beautiful
he grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders covering her nakedness
you are so beautiful
and i would be a very lucky man
he smiles and shakes his head
humiliated angela starts to cry
i feel so stupid
he hugs her letting her put her head on his shoulder stroking her hair and rocking her gently
lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her serious
you have nothing to be sorry about
but she keeps crying
lester hugs her again
we hear a loud clap of thunder outside
smiles its okay
the mercedes pulls onto robin hood trail
close on carolyns eyes reflected in the rear view mirror
she turns her head to look out the window her pov the red door of the burnham house stands out even in the pouring rain
angela once again fully clothed sits at the kitchen counter
shes eating a turkey sandwich
i was starving
lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator
do you want me to make you another one
no no no
he turns to her and cocks an eyebrow
concerned you sure
i mean im still a little weirded out but
sincerely i feel better
a long beat as lester studies her then hows jane
what do you mean
i mean hows her life
is she happy
is she miserable
id really like to know and shed die before shed ever tell me about it
angela shifts uncomfortably
shes really happy
she thinks shes in love
angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is
quietly good for her
an awkward beat
how are you
smiles taken aback god its been a long time since anybody asked me that
thinks about it im great
they just sit there smiling at each other then suddenly ive gotta go to the bathroom
she crosses off
lester watches her go then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content
laughs im great
something at the edge of the counter catches his eye and he reaches for
close on a framed photograph as he picks it up its the photo we saw earlier of him carolyn and jane taken several years ago at an amusement park
its startling how happy they look
lester crosses to the kitchen table where he sits and studies the photo
he suddenly seems older more mature
and then he smiles the deep satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago
man oh man
softly man oh man oh man
after a beat the barrel of a gun rises up behind his head aimed at the base of his skull
angle on an arrangement of fresh cut roses in a vase on the opposite counter deep crimson against the white tile wall
then a gunshot suddenly rings out echoing unnaturally
instantly the tile is sprayed with blood the same deep crimson as the roses
ricky comes down the stairs followed by jane
ricky opens the door from the dining room then stops
jane appears behind him
their pov a pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table
ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches lesters lifeless body wide eyed but not afraid
jane follows him in shock
ricky kneels gazing at lesters unseen face
then he smiles ever so slightly
his pov lester looks back at us his eyes are lifeless but hes smiling the same slight smile
an awed whisper wow
i had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die
were flying across a white blanket of clouds
first of all that one second isnt a second at all it stretches on forever like an ocean of time
in black white eleven year old lester looks up pointing excitedly at his pov a dot of light falls across an unbelievably starry sky
for me it was lying on my back at boy scout camp watching falling stars
ricky and jane lie curled up on janes bed fully clothed
we hear a gunshot from downstairs
they look at each other alarmed
in black white maple trees in autumn
ghostly leaves flutter slowly toward pavement
and yellow leaves from the maple trees that lined my street
angela stands in front of the mirror fixing her make up
we hear the gunshot again
angela turns frightened
in black white close on an ancient womans papery hands as they button a cardigan sweater
or my grandmothers hands and the way her skin seemed like paper
carolyn walks slowly toward the red door drenched to the bone clutching her purse tightly
we hear the gunshot again
in black white a pontiac firebird in the driveway of a suburban home
the suns reflection in the windshield
and the first time i saw my cousin tonys brand new firebird
the colonel enters wet
hes wearing latex gloves
blood covers the front of his t shirt
he paces in front of one of his gun cases the glass door is open and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside
in black white jane opens her bedroom door staring at us
in black white a door opens to reveal year old jane dressed for halloween in a princess costume holding a lit sparkler aloft and smiling shyly at us
carolyn enters terrified still clutching her purse
she shuts the door and locks it then takes the glock out of her purse
she opens the closet door and shoves the gun into a hamper
then suddenly aware of lesters scent she grabs as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her burying her face in them
she sinks to her knees pulling several items of clothing down with her and she begins to cry
a younger carolyn sits across from us in one of those spinning teacup rides laughing uncontrollably as she twists the wheel in front of her making us spin even faster
with love and
on video were watching the video ricky showed jane earlier of the empty white plastic bag being blown about
the wind carries it in a circle around us sometimes whipping it about violently or without warning sending it soaring skyward then letting it float gracefully down to the ground
i guess i could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me
but its hard to stay mad when theres so much beauty in the world
sometimes i feel like im seeing it all at once and its too much my heart fills up like a balloon thats about to burst
were flying once again over robin hood trail ascending and then i remember to relax and stop trying to hold on to it and then it flows through me like
rain and i cant feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life
amused you have no idea what im talking about im sure
but dont worry
you will someday
