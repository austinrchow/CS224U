screenplay by howard franklin it says the coolest thing
id have to say its the day we launched outpost
we hear a famous seattle alternative band
quick cuts seductive angles hot air balloons rise over a vast green corporate campus
their mylar skins are imprinted with outpost logos their gondolas are dressed in outpost colored bunting
outpost employees cheer
theyre spread out over rolling lawns amid arabian tents and costumed acrobats
over the balloon dotted sky the graphic re appears the coolest thing
its the beverages
a programmer sits in his handsome office forested landscape out the window
the screen says daryl m
gary always makes sure weve got the coolest stuff to drink
jump cuts of tall refrigerators snapples cokes fruitopias zaps jolts barques sprites are lined up behind glass doors
the coolest thing
knowing your work means something
a year old korean american girl sits at the edge of a plashing post modern fountain
diana stanford knowing everywhere in the world this is the software people use
montage of world capitals remote places stockbrokers farmers news anchors students ceos eskimos boot up outpost or log on with outpost internet traveler
years ago gary had an idea thats all he had
and now the companys bigger than ibm
over the last shot a ghetto kid uses outpost word in the library the coolest thing
its the people
which is weird
a programmer sits with two colleagues drinking lattes at the edge of lake washington
mitch berkeley big companies are sposed to be impersonal
montage programmers play competitive games at an outpost picnic toddlers play on computers in an outpost day care center geeks confer at a diagram covered whiteboard employees listen dance to
the seattle band weve been hearing on stage at the outpost launch
theres this myth that doing a start up is cooler
but theres no community with a start up
one of mitchs colleagues is nodding
donny harvard it bums me out when the media say were cultish or whatever
cause we care about each other
donny didnt mean to sound so mushy
nobody knows where to look for a second
love you too bro
as they laugh the coolest thing
ill tell you whats not cool
how gary gets this superbad rap
montage of magazine covers newsweek vanity fair wired featuring gary boyd
they say eg who owns cyberspace
on a time cover hes composited by the capitol dome robber baron or visionary
outposts antitrust woes theres this prejudice against super smart people
people like gary
gary early s reads a statement before a congressional sub committee
his voice is pleasant but firm a kid working in his garage can create the next outpost the new ibm
all it takes is a great idea
a bloated senator looks hostile
thats why nobody can have a monopoly in a business built on ideas
as we watch camera pulls back from the screen on which the movie is being projected
reverse into over an audience of or so computer students we read we pick out milo connor watching keenly
hes clear eyed alive innocent
he sits with his best friend teddy chin third generation chinese american
hes like you or me
if we happened tbe insanely rich
some appreciative laughter in the auditorium
but behind milo larry lindholm squirms in his seat
he whispers can we go
starting to get nauseated
brian bissel in front of milo twists in his seat do you mind
larry gets up
two outpost recruiters redmond price gray suit and danny baylor outpost golf shirt note the walkout
danny scans headshots in a stanford yearbook
on screen behind them we see seattle night streets wet down shimmering young people entering a club young people climbing mt
finding larrys picture danny points out the name to redmond who shrugs unconcerned
did anybody mention the beverages
the double doors swing open over them a plate reads the hewlitt packard auditorium and larry comes out
alice poulson a very pretty girl of more hiply dressed than the geeks searches the hall reading the names over the doors nec communications classroom toshiba computer lab mitsubishi classroom
she spots larry
is it over
they still have to give em refreshments laced with mind altering drugs
you are a fanatic
gonna wait outside
tilting down the neo classical edifice we read the name etched over the entrance william gates computer science building
we find larry and alice sitting on the steps
you gotta make him do the start up with teddy and me
thoughtfully you know what i mean
as we hear larry speak we cut back into the lights are on
milo teddy stand by a table dressed in outpost bunting laden with refreshments giveaways mousepads t shirts caps books with the outpost logo on them a simple contour drawing of
a frontier outpost
while most students chat earnestly with recruiters milo teddy load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips
im not exactly worldly but im the secretary of state next to him
milo puts some brownies on his plate
and theyre all throwing this stuff at him
spotting a book on the table milo picks it up
im just screwed
thats not true you know what hes like
he just wants to work on stuff thats cool
you dont wanna move do you
i can paint anywhere
larry looks at her you didnt answer my question
id like to stay here yeah
and i kind of think he should be with teddy
milo and teddy discuss the book almost joyfully
we see a page of code utterly indecipherable
i mean nobody else can follow what theyre talking about half the time
under alice could be a condition variable in the locking code if it didnt seg fault first
maybe you shouldnt push it so hard
no offense you sound insane
i cant help it
i feel like theyd do anything to keep their anything
thats not even credible
if he wants to go up there
to check it out
i think you should encourage him
seeing larrys incredulity its his life
but everybodys treating him like this valuable object
youre hurting your own case
brian already wearing one of the outpost caps effuses to redmond
hes my god
i hear he actually calls recruits sometimes
or is that an urban legend
garys running the biggest software company in the world brian
hes being harassed by the justice department and hes got a new baby
across the room milo eating chips perusing code reaches for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting
it unravels in a long tp like streamer just as danny approaches peering at milos id tag
he tries to sluff the paper off his hand danny holds out a cell phone
gary would like to speak to you
milo and teddy look at each other right
but danny looks like he means it
milos grin fades
he takes the phone
im hoping you and your friend can come up here
weve made some amazing strides in digital convergence
id love to show them to you
when would we come
he waits he looks up think he hung up
danny holds out two plane tickets in st class folders
alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously
but how does he know thats what you guysre working on
larry teddy brian are at the table with alice milo
its a student hang out with loud music
all the companies know
the faculties tell em
at the target schools
in exchange for endowments
they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after em
to teddy i cant believe you refused a ticket
my parentsre already freaked out im staying here
miles from chinatown
well maybe if you told em how much money youd be making to milo youre going up there
i think you should go
amazed you do
i mean its your life
as alice predicted milo is pleased by larrys remark
larry smiles conspiratorially at alice
in a tidy playfully decorated room alice stirs in bed sees the space next to her is vacant
milo sits at a desk thinking agitated in the dim light of a pc
he looks up sees alice in the doorway
i think i kind of lost it
i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful
didnt know i even cared about that stuff
cmon how often do you talk to somebody whos been on the cover of time
three of four times
she picks her way through geek clutter motherboards code manuals coke cans sits next to him
a lot of what larry says is true
they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they then youve gotta ask him about that
he looks at her youve gotta be kidding
if hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway
are we talking about gary boyd
or your dad
he doesnt deny it she sees right through him
when i was a kid
and he was moving us all over the place
i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost
i thought gary boyd was the greatest
but hes not quite the same guy anymore
dont get your hopes too high
in the cabin everybody types on a notebook but milo
he looks out the window expectantly at the seattle skyline
milo comes off the plane
danny and redmond greet him
redmond drives his black lexus m
danny leans forward from the backseat
couldnt convince teddy to come
hes pretty tight with his family
we could move em up here
he just likes to write code
hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
who do you mean by everybody
milo almost blushes
he makes an awkward segue
so how far are we from the campus
oh were not going to the campus
beyond a rocky beach buildings are cunningly carved into a wooded hillside
glass walls are framed in rich wood
the main house is sq
then theres the guest house pool building reception hall library
redmond pulls up
a discreet guard in a mr
rogers cardigan recognizes him
the gates swing open
they pull up by a lexus suv with a baby seat
another man in a cardigan stands in the open front door
i think they call him the houseman
cause guard sounds too weird
milo just sits there eyeing the monumental residence
dont be nervous
the house is the weirdest thing about him
its like he knows everybody expects him to be this worldly colorful zillionaire
but hes just a guy who likes software
milo and the houseman cross a long room with a lake view
we hear music by satie
the craftsman furniture and lamps are custom made
a cezanne hangs on the wall
theres a craftsman crib here stuffed animals another cezanne
even the toys seem arranged
they enter an have a seat
he wont be long
milo sits on a bench
he tries not to look but his childhood hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door gary in a suit and tie has an open american face
but something goes on behind his pleasant features and self possessed mien his desire or need to solve the problem at hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed
as gary concentrates two outpost senior managers speak phil tate bald and randy grimes gray eyes
we tried the big vaporware number gary its no sale
can we buy into their ipo
or is that a justice dept
there is no public offering
the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo
wrote this just to run their web site
gary speaks with precise hand gestures settling the matter
phil and randy gather their papers and stand
they exit nodding at milo as they pass
then gary comes out
excuse the tie
i was on tv
milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands such a fam iliar face such a big figure in his young life
now new age music plays
they move back through the same room but the cezanne has been replaced by a hieronymus bosch bodies roiling in hell
milo is puzzled
the house knows the paintings i like it knows my favorite music
same for anybody else whos in the system
as they walk milo watches a cezanne original digitally re configure to a bosch brushstrokes and all
would you like a coke or something
too shy too nervous oh
he opens a glass doored refrigerator scans a shelf with rows of snapples in alphabetical order
when we started i just hired my smart friends
that was great
we got a little bigger i had to hire smart strangers
he selects a kiwi raspberry they walk on
now i dont get to hire anybody
but i know youre the guy to write skywire
an entire wall is taken up by a bosch triptych
as gary crosses to the other side of the room milo stands by a table covered in art books hundreds of them soutine chinoiserie roy lichtenstein
you know a lot about art i guess
theres a rumor going around maybe youve heard it
gary heads back carrying something spherical
theres more to life than computers
im looking into it
glancing down at the daunting display of books gary looks vaguely afflicted
he mutters once i start looking into something
looking up now and much more at ease he holds up a shiny detailed metal object model satellite
ive only shown this to three other people
i bought weve launched so far
i keep the coordinates in this room
as milo takes it carefully its left over from sdi
reagans star wars technology
they orbit miles up
low enough to relay internet traffic
he smiles exactly among other things
we know convergence is the real super highway all the pcs tvs phones etc
why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
turning the sleek object skywire
milo and gary peer at a monitor side by side
milo sips his own snapple now
gary speaks his language
the content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms
including whatever new hardware emerges
it needs a more object oriented language
this doesnt scale does it
youd have to start practically from scratch
but this is all youd be working on
no marketing meetings no product seminars
we cant waste the time
half the valleys working on convergence
sore media conglomerates cable companies phone companies
cant finish second milo
there is no second
now what would you like to ask me
milo has a deer in the headlights look
as they walk milo chides himself for his reticence
gary seems to read his mind
i know what people say and not just the justice department
we clone ideas inflict our second rate versions on the world we havent done anything original since
milos amazed by garys acuity
and his candor
do i think thats fair
id put some of our apps up against anybodys
but is there some truth to it
they have come to a stop in a windowed entryway
milo watches gary keenly
he knits his brow
when you get to a certain age you start wondering
about your legacy
i doubt you even remember outpost
i wanna feel like i did when i wrote that
but im thats in cyber years
i look at you and see the things that got me here
the furrows deepen but somehow got away
a block of floodlit tract mansions taco bell palaces of the valleys newly rich
milo alice cross a vacant lot to where the lights twinkle below
their honda civic is parked nearby
milo is excited
if my dadd leveled with me like that even once
the weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary
its his fantasy too
i think thats great milo
didnt you visit the campus
thats why you have to help me decide
you have this destiny
cmon i wouldnt have a destiny without you
my destiny would be dying at
from eating dont bring that up
like a different girlfriend woulddve let you die
shrugs you saved my life in alot of ways
she kisses him
he holds onto her
its not just gary that makes you wanna go there
cause its a big place
you might not even see him again
hed hate to think thats true
but he manages a smile
the honda is loaded with luggage and boxes some of which are tied to the roof
milo alice stow a final piece
whens brian coming for the tv
probly waiting by the phone for outpost to call
well leave it for him
as they head back in they see a toyota park at the curb
give you guys some time alone
she continues inside
he waits watches teddy cross the sidewalk to join him
you got my e mail
and your phone messages
you wanna do what you do its not a crime
is that how larry feels
a brown buick parks behind teddys car
as they speak a rumpled ish man in an off the rack suit gets out
wanted to say goodbye to him
hey we got seed money for the startup
a million five
milo grins he high fives teddy
we rented a loft in sunnyvale
he gives milo the number you know whats the bad part
we cant talk about work anymore
the venture capitalists made us sign like confidentiality forms
outpost made me sign
guess well find out what else we have to talk about
its awkward but its heartfelt
milo enters reading teddys phone number
they got their the rumpled man sits on a radiator watching cnn on a tv the last remaining piece of furniture
alice enters holding a jam jar filled water hands milo a business card
milo this is mr
barton from the justice department
gives barton the water sorry about the glass
milo reads the card lyle barton asst
prosecutor doj seattle branch office
milos a little spooked
dont worry milo
im here as a friend
or maybe a supplicant
whats that mean again
were at a disadvantage with outpost
our experts arent as smart as theirs
sometimes we cant tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly
we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights
im taking a shot in the dark here
i can offer you a year a buick
im hoping youve got a feeling its the right thing to do
fiddling with the card its just i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability
like i said shot in the dark
milo tries to give back the card
if you see something there that rubs you the wrong way
do the right thing
and he goes
that took some fun out of were not gonna let it
she kisses him
they head out
on tv a graphic says san luis obispo ca mass suicide live
emergency medical personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new mediterranean mansion
footage shows bodies including a few children on bunkbeds uniformly shod in black nikes
ingested the fatal mixture of sedatives crushed in apple sauce
according to the cults eerily professional website it was time to move on
crane past identical low steel glass buildings amid the vast lawns fir trees
past a building under construction
to find redmonds lexus cruising
milo looks out the window redmond gives the tour therere buildings i mean not counting the gyms the day care etc
the day care is a michael graves looking building with a big cartoon dog sculpture on its roof ears cocked to the sky
a teacher leads her little charges inside
garys put millions in there
and the people with kids
theyre not hotshot geeks theyre just payroll clerks or whatever
two men in suits with briefcases conspicuous amid the geeks in jeans and t shirts enter building
youll see alot of that department of justice goons snooping around
the car pulls into a lot full of miatas bmws boxters
the logo is of inlaid stone
redmond milo walk over it
milo carries a box with some personal effects including a small painting
redmond wears a photo i
so howd you like the house
his snapples were in alphabetical order
he laughs well he micro managed the company till it got too big
he opens the door guess he needs to micro manage something
at the desk a receptionist looks up stands to hang a temporary id pass around milos neck
milo im judith
redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner door a security cam is at every door he holds the door open for milo
they walk up a long carpeted hallway past open offices where geeks mostly males under sit at workstations
everybody has the same office theres no dumbass corporate hierarchy
they pass a room in which geeks play video games
just outside it a chubby programmer desi sips a diet coke
get out while you can dude
the guy who was at garys house
he bows deep with mock obeisance
milo blushes redmond laughs he snags milos elbow
they walk again passing a service hall with a civil defense sign
best bomb shelters in america accessible from every building
you gotta figure were a major target right
up the hall a young woman lisa is about to go into her office
she pauses half a second looks at milo goes in
lisa actually looked at you
as they pass her office they look in shes already at her workstation studiously avoiding their gaze
every geek heres got a thing for lisa
but thats about the biggest reaction shes had to anybody
shy changing the emphasis shes a programmer
heavy graphical background doing design interface for skywire apps
he all but winks youll be working with her
ive got a girlfriend remember
thats rare around here
you know how nuns re married to jesus
posties are married to outpost
a handsome modest office like all the others workstation whiteboard window
heres your world
pointing at the desk copy of garys book also the audio version narrated by gary
milo puts down his box picks up the book the next highway gary by a highway on its cover
as we look at it the cards encoded
tells us who came through the door and when
in an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from security cameras bob shrot head of physical security issues milo his swipe card
unauthorized entries sound like this
he drags the card through a sample slot producing an unbelievably loud piercing eeeeeeee
he shouts over it if you see a tailgater report him
kills the alarm somebody coming in on your swipe
gives milo a photo you see somebody wandering around without id its your duty to challenge him
i dont give a shit if youre a stock option billionaire
if you dont challenge ill have your butt
he seems a little tense
geeks pull his chain cause hes non tech
ex cop or something
they moon cameras or use atms as swipe cards
the camerasre our real security so hes a little demoralized
as they walk milo watches two hardhats roll a spool of fiber optic cable into the building under construction
whatre they building
way behind schedule
its top secret but everybody knows its a digital broadcast space
they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
garys not into fiber optics
hes betting everything on the satellites
you wanna survive in the software business you cover your bets
i gotta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
they approach a deux chevaux cheap but charming
your girlfriends an artist
blond wood smoked glass a room as sleek as the geeks who lunch here are nerdy
milo and redmond push trays
i phoned her at your hotel told her about our corporate housing options
she sounds neat
lisas at a table looking at milo
when their eyes meet she busies herself placing the plates back on her tray
turning away from lisa she is
lisa passes behind them smiles fleetingly at milo
at a table randy and phil note the interaction
meantime might be some friction on the domestic front
youre expected you to put in ridiculous hours
peopleve accused us of breaking up relationships to get their undivided attention
lisa moves swiftly up the hall
she looks up it and down it making sure no ones looking before ducking into she goes to the box on milos desk his personal effects starts rooting through it
redmond and milo have eaten redmond stacks their plates
your counselorll fill you in on everything else
thats who youll be working with almost daily
milo has fed the old skywire disks into his machine
he reads a complicated screen
milo looks up
milo is thrilled
just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
milos smile deepens
gary notices the small painting by alice hanging on the wall
he stares at it
think i should buy some originals
somebody said im just another philistine
youre ahead of your time
thats what i told her
milo colors as gary drags a second chair in front of the screen didnt realize he was contradicting mrs
thinks ill be less of a control freak if i have a hobby
just gives me something else to obsess about
milo smiles as gary sits down studies the screen
anything we can salvage from the old code before you start fresh
milo cant quite get over garys his counselor
uh might be one or two things
two awe struck geeks see gary through the window
hes been in there like an hour
could work with a new switch
there may be a few more things hidden
dont spend too much time searching
you ever vetted somebodys old code before
when milo shakes his head its a different skill
stay close to the surface
the best hidden secrets are in plain sight
you know the best place to hide a leaf right
when milo shakes his head in a tree
were in an old empty craftsman house
through a front window we see alice lead milo up a path
as they enter the corporate condos were as romantic as they sound
milos grinning as he takes in the house
windows give onto a garden with a small studio
milos still beaming alice is pleased
till he says you know hes never been anybodys counselor before
she gestures at what she hopes will be their home
oh its great
they start to kiss but think i should tell him i learned everything using
maybe i could show him one of my early programs
she pulls him back into the kiss
milo types intently in his office
gary sits with milo at his desk discussing code
pan to the window we see a different pair of awed geeks
milo alice read in bed
hes reading garys book
milo shows gary one of his early programs written on
its simple looking with some childish writing scrawled on it
gary seems touched
two doj agents depose gary
a video cam records his answers
two outpost lawyers sit next to him
one of the agents is reading from a document infoteks urgent need to license outpost office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation
looks up when you wrote the word tool whatd you mean by it
gary studies his copy of the e mail
he looks vexed
i dont remember
what dyou think you meant by it
am i supposed to speculate under oath
the agent shifts in his seat
we get an idea of garys negotiating skill making the other party look unreasonable while offering nothing
since you didnt have an answer to that question mr
boyd confused again didnt i
have an answer
i dont remember
the agents confer
gary sees phil looming outside the open door
one of the agents sees him too
he doesnt try to hide his annoyance did you wanna take a break mr
gary takes a manila envelope from phil opens it
your proteges moving so fast we can barely keep up with him
gary reads the page from the envelope computer code
this is good
who did it
start up not miles from here
kids on prozac
maybe we should all get on it
milo stares at his screen frustrated
hows it going
maybe im going too fast
sharply incredulous too fast
at least four companiesre on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they catching himself gary trails off
he sits down exhales
even when i had a hand in every aspect of the company i knew the one thing you can never control is somebodys creative process
gary seems sincerely contrite
he neednt be milo just wants to please him
besides milo sees hed like to stop obsessing about convergence to be a worldly zillionaire engrossed in his hobbies but after all what could be more engrossing than skywire
reaching into his pocket take a look at this
slightly different approach
reading the page gary got from phil milo knits his brow
you did this overnight
youre making me young again
pan off a tv where local news footage shows a mangled smoking bmw post wreck on a lonely nocturnal highway
a graduate of mit he was on the antidepressant prozac and had been warned not to drink and drive
lisa watches the news report knowingly
lisa heads up the hall carrying a cd rom
you know my name
you know mine
youre famous around here
winces im getting a teachers pet rep
i wouldnt worry about it
youve gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
were you an army brat or something
something like that
didnt mean to pry
i just have this theory
some of us who got to good at this
we were escaping something
this seems to jolt her
she pales a little
what a mysterious girl
but this only adds to her allure
did i say something
no i know what you mean
i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers
least they make sense
sometimes you think theyve betrayed you
like a person would
but then you see no you just missed a step
you can go back and make it all work
this strikes a deep chord with milo all of it
i used to wish that
all the time
theyre looking at each other he gets self conscious
re the cd rom whatve you got there
im sposed to coordinate with you
as she inserts the disk he finds himself looking at her
on the screen the frontier outpost we know as the logo appears
its struck by a bolt from the sky
the outpost comes alive with light music movie images through its windows a ringing phone
finally the word skywire burns into it
its neat shes really good
i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to simultaneously they reach for the mouse
their hands touch
they look at each other
sh show me the next one
she nods manipulates the mouse
he stares at the screen strenuously fighting the impulse to stare at lisa
garys secretary types as milo enters
she smiles at him
have a seat
hes with someone but i know he wants to see you
garys face is red
the two lawyers who sat in on his deposition are with him again
because we bundled it the judge is threatening to enjoin the whole im confused ted
gary has used the phrase before but the pretense of ingenuousness is gone its witheringly condescending
didnt you tell me theyd be chapter by the time they could hope to enjoin
im very confused because you said theyd be ready to settle
milo hears gary yelling behind the closed door
its indecipherable but we discern an enraged bullshit
milo flips through a copy of wired trying to ignore it
the lawyers come out passing swiftly rather grimly
go on in
when milo looks dubious hes always happy to see you
agitated gary rather compulsively lines up the papers pens etc
on his desk he barely hears the knock at the open doorframe
well you sent for me
still distracted he finds a page of code on his desk gives it to milo
once again milo marvels
you really wrote this just today
dark unsmiling whatre you implying
taken aback nothing
their eyes are locked
gary blinks sags into his chair
everything i do is under scrutiny
the questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid
knits his brow im confused
doesnt everybody in business try to get ahead
uncomfortable im sure
the purpose of this company isnt to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath
but the software business is binary youre a zero or a one
being obsessive isnt a crime
its a character trait
milo just wants to get out
he studies the code to hide his discomfort
gary watches him
it scales dont you think
for the first time it looks forced
a youthfully upscale place a converted red brick warehouse
alice looks great
the waiter pours wine
this feels fairly grown up id say
milo smiles again it looks forced raises his glass
to our new life
shes looking at him whats wrong
thats what i need to ask you
when he says nothing you know you cant keep anything from me
he gave me some new code fixes this morning
i said did you really do this just today
cause i was impressed
he said whatre you implying
she just looks at him
he grows a little defensive its the way he said it
just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie
thats how you knew you were onto something ugly
just confused what would it mean anyway
if he didnt write it
thats what im asking myself
does he have some genius stowed away
why not let him write skywire
upset not saying it makes sense
a busboy leaves a basket of rolls
glum preoccupied milo takes one without looking brings it to his lips milo
he looks at alice looks at the roll blanches
im so stupid
he throws the roll back into the basket
hes your boss
hes not your hes nodding i know i know
if you cant deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
the very idea hurts isnt that extreme
whats extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach
eat another sesame seed and thats it
we see the rolls covered in seeds
i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much youre right
its a working relationship
dont know what i was expecting
but his hearts not in it
she hates to see him suffer
she picks up her glass
lets do the toast
milo sits alone marking up pages of code as he eats
he doesnt notice lisa standing with her tray
did you wanna be alone
he indicates she should sit
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps
how fast are you going
there is no second place
plus every time i get jammed up gary has an inspiration
looks at her curious is it like that with your counselor
mines not the ceo
he barely remembers to take a shower
but does he ever just like hand you code
i re wrote it anyway
he smiles youre compulsive
mmm more like i have a little trouble
not that interesting
she smiles charmingly to cover whatever shes feeling
the more enigmatic she is the more intrigued he is
milo and lisa walk eat ice cream out of paper cups with outpost logos
we go nearer
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers
was that then
then and now
when he looks at her but not right now
she maintains eye contact
her meaning is clear
milo turns sees brian stanford classmate outpost zealot give an envelope to a guard at the door of he trots over to milo who is as flustered as another guy
might be having been found in bed with a girl
just dropped off a resume
almost got in the front door
he looks at lisa back to milo wondering why he isnt being introduced
youre living here
thought if i relocated it could help my case
im writing programs for the local public access station
where any whack job with bucks gets his own show
god does it suck
gives him a business card can you help me
sure ill see what i can do
seeing how flushed milo is brian thinks he must have blundered in on something
he starts to back away
well i parked illegally
watching brian go forgot to introduce you
a beat i have a girlfriend
i didnt know
she saved my life
the station is closed
milos car is parked empty
hows it going down there
we find him in an illuminated phone booth
ive been hacking for five nights straight im really making headway
a funky space posters on the wall a red stanford pennant rubber trees at either end of his desk
but these like white supremacists trashed my office last week
on the wall beyond teddy the word gook in blood red has been covered over with paint but still bleeds through
theyre in the neighborhood
they usually hassle vietnamese grocers
they didnt touch the machine
or my disks
probably didnt know what they were
so you a moonie yet
he waits milo
i met this girl
is it serious
i dont know
did you tell alice
i keep thinking itll go away
but theres this connection
shes been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot
plus i see her every day were working on the same program
a beautiful geek
i dont wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but whatre the chances
what dyou mean
i guess larrys got me totally suspicious of that place
what does that mean
milo geeks dont have two girlfriends
most dont have one
i didnt plan this
through a window we watch milo traverse the quad
whatd the girl say
there may be a little less trust after your outburst
we are gary turns back inside where phil reads milos new code
hasnt affected his work though
i want him to like me
phil is confused by garys sincerity so is gary
desi and another geek watch in astonishment gary walks milo to his car his arm circled over milos shoulder
he seems to be apologizing
milo comes eagerly up the path cant wait to tell alice what just happened
he enters pulls up short
alice is waiting for him
she doesnt know how to say it
teddy was killed last night
whatre you what
it was a hate crime
milo is staggered
she moves to him
im so sorry
he hangs onto her for support
establish the funky building vestiges of police tape on the door a limo and many cars parked out front
a mixture of teddys relatives and computer friends have gathered
in the bg teddys dad weeps volubly
teddys brother nelson shows milo the workspace red stanford pennant rubber trees on the desk
milo in a suit peers at the painted over epithet on the wall
they trashed his hard disk all his back ups
they caught the guys
nelson shows milo a san jose mercury mugshots of two skin headed aryan nations members in their s
its an airtight case
they found the weapon with teddys blood on it and their fingerprints
theyd been arrested twice for beating up asians
how come they werent in jail
milo unpins a picture of himself teddy from a board
he told me about the break in
he didnt seem to take it that seriously
you guys dont take anything seriously do you
thats not on a hard drive
milo is stung by this
alice appears in the doorway
your mom wants you
its time to go to scatter the ashes
milo is pinning the picture back up
the pushpin falls to the floor he kneels to retrieve it
on the floorboards he sees a thin shiny plastic filament
he picks it up
i didnt know he was working with fiber optics
but when he looks up nelsons gone
we gotta go too honey
as he heads out with alice he unthinkingly stuffs the filament in his suit pocket
a raw beautiful bluff
the sea stretches to infinity behind a smaller group of mourners
a lay minister intones the lords prayer
milo approaches larry with trepidation
larry nods its okay
they hug each other
they walk slowly back toward the cars
i know you lost all his work
maybe i could come down here and you are naive
look at your employment contract you cant work anywhere else in this field for at least few years
he smiles sadly not that i dont miss you
just thought his work should go on
he was on the verge of something too
he was gonna show us the next day
he said the answers not in the box its in the band
know what it means
its only meaningful when youve got lines of code to back it up
man could he write code
he had his own style
those really weird short lines
for a moment theyve brought teddy back to life
alice comes up from behind to fetch milo
take good care of this guy
arriving for work milo sees outpost flags at half mast
as milo comes up the hall lisa is standing there
we get the feeling shes been waiting for him
he looks at her perhaps hearing teddys words whatre the chances
he nods moves on
she watches him head up the hall
there is a rapping on the doorframe
i heard what happened
were the flags for teddy
spontaneously milo stands hugs gary
had you talked to him much lately
guess i was worried we didnt have anything to talk about since work was off limits
talk about work
i meant did you find other stuff to oh
youve been coming in early
alice said it would help
to focus on something
a little guilty dont know what id do without her
milo sits on the couch in dim light
alice comes in
sits by him holds him i miss him too
milo eats alone
through the window he sees lisa inside
shes eating alone too
gary comes trotting up
he is unclasping a manila envelope he takes pages out
you must have lines of code there
but theyre real short lines
just came out that way
seeing garys code milo knits his brow it must be sort of like teddys
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler
and it came over me its in the wrong place
an uncertain smile the wrong place
the answers not in the box
its in the band
milos smile freezes
as he stares at gary we zoom with a reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but gary remains dominant in frame
for milo it feels like the very ground is going out from under him
gary continues to explain pointing at lines of code
and milo pretends to listen
but he cant even make out the words gary speaks he hears only a jumble of echoes
milo nods mechanically he wants to scream
he perceives amid the echoes that gary is standing smiling saying see you later
and hes gone
milo touches the pages like some talisman of teddy
it strikes him she always shows up at these moments
he gathers his wits before looking up
gotta go home
think i ate something
pulling out of the lot milo seizes the car phone
he hits home on the speed dial
gets a busy signal
hes about to press re dial when he sees the outpost logo branded on the receiver
he throws it down like its contaminated
middle of the day sounds chirping birds school children
milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle
he fumbles with his keys
when he gets inside alice
he moves into the bedroom
he sees her through the window painting in the studio
he stands outside the studio
waits for her to look up
then she sees somethings wrong
he waits for her to come out here where its safe to speak
he paces agitated
she watches him
shes skeptical but doesnt want to appear unsympathetic
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death
nelson said it was an airtight case
i dont know what im saying
maybe maybe they hired those guys
i cant see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
i dont know
i just know it was teddys code
all these ideas flying in from everywhere
you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business
its like they know what every kids doing
they hack into peoples programs
nobody does work like this on line
its in your pc or in a mainframe
theyd have to be like watching people
he freezes oh jesus
milos at the closet rummaging among the clothes hanging there
alice comes up behind him
he finds his suit jacket
he digs in one pocket then another
he finds the fiber optic strand from teddys floor
shows it to her
almost silently its a camera
theyve trooped back outside
shes worried shes indulging his paranoia
it isnt a broadcast studio
its a surveillance post or something
thats why they have the dishes on top
youre scaring me
i think we should just go
you cant get away from people like this
its gary youre talking about
it really hurts you think i dont know that
why would he how should i know
solving a problem i guess
or needing to control everything
i dont know
cant think about it ive gotta get in there
even if all this were true
therere other buildings
all of them filled with computers and its the only one with dishes on the roof
the studios a front
thats why they keep postponing its opening
muttered obsessive gotta get in there
milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place
how could they hope to hide a surveillance post
as he mulls this and how can you get in there anyway
with the cameras and the swipe cards i cant just walk away
you cant just walk in either
they stop the construction work at six or seven
the parking lots mostly clear by two or three in the morning
even the early geeks dont get there before five
is it two
or is it three
have you ever really noticed
he knows what shes saying hes unqualified for this a space cadet
she tries to hold him
but he wriggles away
i cant just keep my head in the sand
thats how i got into this mess
he paces he thinks
she watches him worried
i know how to get in there
but youve gotta help me
scared reluctant whaddo i do
so you believe me
she cant lie
she shakes her head
just tell me what to do
standing at his window milo can see
workers in hardhats come out of it carrying lunchboxes
milo holds a small writing pad
he notes the time
alice parks in front of a drugstore
as she gets out of the car she looks around uneasily
alice is at the counter buying a wind up alarm clock
milo watches a car pull out of the parking lot leaving only one or two others
he writes down the time
alice is at the counter among children and mothers purchasing a chemistry set
he watches a security guard delbert go into on his rounds notes the time am
alice wearing dishwashing gloves ties the alarm clock to a small tupperware container with copper wire
milo wearing latex gloves is at the sink mixing chemicals from the toy chemistry set
alice approaches with the container affixed to the clock
as she holds it out milo pours the mixture into it
over black we hear ticking
the screen lightens to show milos alarm clock is set for
it sits amid mops and cleaning products
milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator as if searching for a soda
hes looking up the hall waiting for someone
he consults his watch
here comes a guard he nods to milo as he passes
the guard opens a door with his card
milo rushes through the door on the guards swipe tailgating
sir you gotta use your own noticing wheres your id
milo cops an attitude
hes not completely convincing
do you know who i am
its my job i gotta hes getting better the kind of stock options im sitting on
bob shrot the ex cop in charge of physical security looks up as the guard escorts milo into the room
the bomb explodes
the blast is tiny but loud glass cleaning bottles ring plastic bottles moan
milo sits watches shrot encode a new card for him finding his info on a terminal
on a monitor behind shrot milo sees programmers being ushered out of the building
every geek has to try this once to show me how smart he is another guard rushes in
there was an explosion in a y sector closet were evacuating the whole sector
shrot comes to his feet grabs a holster with gun off a shelf
milo looking flummoxed stands
un nh cant wander around without id now
just park your ass in that chair
shrot goes out with the guard
whole place reeks of fuckin ammonia
milo moves quickly to the wall reads a chart with the guards schedule runs his finger down it til he finds the name of the guard on the am shift
guards open closet doors shine their flashlights
milo has moved to shrots seat
hes encoding a fresh card with ken delberts information
panning off the civil defense sign we find shrot standing at a closet examining a piece of the alarm clock
milo is at work bringing up schematic screens diagnosing the system with his unique concentration
panning to the window we see the evacuated programmers enjoying themselves on the lawn
its a rare exciting event they jump around miming explosions
shrot and the guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the debris puts them in a tray
milo brings up the screen that controls the cameras
on the monitors he sees nothing very interesting a hallway a room under construction
he pulls down a menu
recording is highlighted
he clicks playback
the image hardly changes but a guard wanders through
he types the tape rewinds the guard moves backwards
he finds a neutral spot showing an empty hallway stops the tape
gary randy phil approach shrot gary stares at him
what is it
glorified cherry bomb
right by the civil defense sign
some geeks idea of irony
i been saying we need a camera in this hall
theres nothing in this hall
someones pulling your chain as usual
thinking aloud unless its a diversion
milos in my office
he was tailgating so i gary explodes with incredulity
try to have a clue
try to think
gary strides off
shrot feels unfairly maligned
that kids the great white hope
i could get it out of him
youre not listening
randy and phil head up the hall
shrot watches them
even if his intellectual superiors are convinced of milos innocence he isnt
he walks swiftly back toward his office
then he runs
milo reads a warning message
downloading playback stream to y n
he types y
the glitch freezes the tape we see it lock into place it shows the empty hallway
theyve let the programmers back in
they head up the hall as shrot heads down it
he pushes past them gruffly
he knows hes enhancing his neanderthal image they make cracks but hes more interested in obeying his instinct
milo immobilizes another camera in
shrot rounds the corner
his office is in view now
milo at the keyboard closes up windows one by one
shrot is back he has only to round the corner to see milo
we assume his pov as he does so milo sits in the chair where shrot left him
pan off the clock am to find milo at his desk looking at the clock with a certain dread
milo walks the path between the two buildings fiddling nervously with the dummied swipe card
hearing footfalls behind him he whirls its a geek loping to his car
milo smiles waits walks on
nearing milo looks around making sure no one else is around
his pov panning a programmer works late visible through a lighted window in
the dog sculpture with cocked ears sits atop the day care its quizzical expression seeming to wonder what milo is up to
the geek he just saw racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his james bond bmw
milo arrives at the entrance
heart pounding he brings the card to the slot
will he trigger that awful alarm
he slides the card the door clicks
he enters concrete floor unpainted walls construction lights
at the inner door he looks up at the camera
that shows us where milo stands minus milo
widen a guard packs up his stuff getting ready to go home
the new guard ken delbert enters
hows it goin
shaking out his cup big night
switched from tea to coffee
brought new meaning to my work
maybe ill start my rounds with tonight
you are a wild man
milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls bare floors unconnected wires
the only illumination is from construction lights on the concrete floor
opening doors he sees bare rooms
wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment bundles of wire hanging out
in other words the building is as advertised so far
delbert comes out with his flashlight heads across the clean swept path that leads to
milo nears a set of double doors at the end of the hall
he hears a low ominous hum from within
convinced hes found something he quickens his pace
hes about to swipe his card when a beam of light bounces along the wall
he presses himself into an alcove
through a chink in the unfinished wall he sees delbert come in the front door
his rounds consist of shining his torch up at the cameras making sure the red lights are on
he walks right past milo who doesnt breath
delbert swipes open the double doors leans in the humming gets louder
on milo pressing himself into the alcove
delbert turns around heads back down the hall
exits the building
milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall
using the card he enters a studio to be architectural touches like soffits framed in but not plaster boarded
the portentous hum comes from around a corner
he approaches convinced the answer lies here
clearing the wall he sees a squat emergency generator sitting on the floor powering construction lights
something youd buy at sears
through infra red binoculars we see milo come out looking left and right to make sure he hasnt been observed
now he knows nothin in there
we are randy turns back into the room where phil is sifting through papers spread over a coffee table
maybe hell get back to work
speaking of which
randy pulls the blinds shut joins phil
from a high angle we track milo as he walks along the path to a bench
the camera passes briefly behind a dark object in the foreground dog sculpture as we track him
milo sags onto the bench
he stares out perplexed suffering
then he knits his brow
he seems to be studying the ground
or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him the looming silhouette of the dog atop the day care
he stands up turns around
reverse on the whimsical canine
push toward its ears cocked to the sky
then toward a single ear framed by fur brown concrete but with a smooth concave inner surface of enamelled metal satellite dish
muttering in a tree
at the entrance milo applies the swipe card
he steps in on colorful carpeting amid balls tricycles
kids artwork hangs on the wall
he moves through this room into the screens glow
they hang suspended over a wide ringed table a chair at each keyboard
indeed gary has spared no expense for the toddlers theyre flat sleek digital screens
at the moment they show colorful childish contour drawings that say where i wanna work e
there are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers eg angelfish swimming
milo moves slowly around the table studying the screens
not surprisingly most of the where i wanna work drawings are of desks or tables with computers
tracking just ahead of milo we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall a rubber plant at each end of a desk
even in contour form its familiar
milo passes it
and comes back to it
staring at it he sits
he begins typing
the drawing still occupies the screen but in a window hes brought up at the bottom there is dense dos looking code
he types furiously numbers symbols backslashes
whatever hes trying to do is a challenge even to him
he deletes lines begins anew his frustration evident
as he works through the layers of code the pixels on the screen start to fill in
the contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of teddys workstation in sunnyvale eerily empty now
when all the pixels have fallen into place milo hears click click click click click from every direction as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast
all of them show variations on a theme a workstation seen by a camera over the shoulder of a programmer if he were present
the stations are of various shapes and sizes but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen keyboard
at this hour few programmers are present
one guy has fallen asleep his head on a desk
a japanese geek is hard at work its day there
phil and randy work at the coffee table
did you download corey
in san jose
have to go back over there
he stands stretches be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
you dont look anything like a three year old
milo works the keyboard
again the code gets dense and obscure as he goes deeper
he succeeds in calling up a graphical interface
among the menus he can choose from are he clicks target schools a menu shoots down berkeley cal tech etc
he clicks stanford then chin teddy
two windows open
in one there is a video stream of teddy winning an award in the gates bldg
in the other uploaded police video stenciled sunnyvale pd of the white supremacists whose mug shots we saw in the san jose mercury theyre being interrogated
in the first window teddys image dissolves into a handheld crime scene video marked sv pd of a ransacked grocery store
is painted on a wall
milo looks confused some narrative is unfolding but it remains obscure without audio
he types some more
in the bottom window he brings up convoluted text regarding the audio
about the only phrases we can understand are audio block on and hardware requirement magnetic filter type pbx r
his eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware substitute
he digs in his shirt pocket
he takes out his swipe card studies it
he casts about some more till he sees some kids safety scissors in a jar
randy whistles as he heads up the hall
arriving at the door with the civil defense sticker he swipes his card
on screen long lens footage shows a low building the aryan nations suspects come out of it
a still photo appears in the nd window a steel hasp
milos eyes are narrowed what am i seeing
meantime he is reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from the mainframe terminal exposing hardware within
he has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its magnetic strip into a metal slot
he wiggles the card
we hear an eerie fibrillation which flattens into the voice of a serene eminently sane female run this methamphetamine lab known to federal authorities per nd from which we removed
the implement fingerprints intact
crime scene video streams in now stenciled fbi by the time date
a handheld camera pans a blood spattered wall then shows a mutilated asian murder victim
all of this footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always present in streaming video and its sinister graininess
fbi footage procured by nd shows the aftermath of an aryan nations killing in denver
note the evidence of torture which is typical
milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how racial killings are done
he hears a creaking noise behind him and whirls
its the classroom hamster on his wheel
still whistling randy descends some metal stairs enters a vast bomb shelter canned foods etc
milo has tapped into his own file footage of him lecturing at stanford as an ra pointing to a whiteboard
complete immersion in code writing renders him both unobservant and suggestible click
on two occasions he went truant from classes to attend comix conventions
the audio crackles and drops out again
milos eyes narrow he sees video of alice sitting on a folding chair speaking to someone
she has a harder look pulls on a marlboro
whats he seeing
he wiggles the jerry rigged hardware almost urgently till the narration crackles back on rebecca p a connecticut art stu dent facing federal drug charges whose records were supplied to
us by he hears her voice under the narration answering an unseen interrogator sounds like phil
its a job interview
milo subtly unconsciously shakes his head as if to deny what his eyes see
the narration begins to fibrillate again armed with his personal files she was easily able to ingratiate herself with the socially maladroit milo the audio drops out as milo sees
uploaded medical files and er photos of himself marked stanford medical center hes waxen bloated gasping for breath
with a certain dread milo jams the card in deeper she planted the sesame seed both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding experience since
she would quote save his life
milo is devastated disbelieving
now he sees real time er footage an allergy victim bloated twitching gasping dying
should it be needed milos allergy is the ideal the audio crackles out
but milo doesnt have the heart to bring it back he can fill in the rest
randy traverses a well lit tunnel
numb now milo clicks randomly crime footage personal records animations it all flies by with chuck worman like speed
note that the cult members are found reclining after swallowing the click syringe marks best hidden at base of scrotum click mimics high blood alcohol click indistinguishable from kidney failure
milo closes his eyes leans back overwhelmed
suddenly he sits forward whispers almost fervently as he types please dont be one of them
camera moves slowly through stacks of pre school supplies toward a windowed door at the back of the room
randy appears in the window lit ominously from below
he applies his swipe card
milo watches footage of lisa taken by surveillance cam eras she is outside trying to peek in the door
needs to be watched due to her heightened level of suspicion in one window footage of lisa casing the hallway before going into milos office in another footage of her
eating lunch with milo
and to her possible contagion of key employees
a mans pair of mug shots appear
in the other window a grade school yearbook photo of lisa
in august lisa informed her mother of the sexual molestation by her stepfather and of his threat to kill her should she tell anyone
milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being taken from a courtroom in shackles jerky grainy
hes lost the audio but doesnt need it anymore
randy climbs up to the main floor
milo watches eerie crime scene footage a girl with her throat slashed
but then hearing nearly distant whistling he clicks on windows furiously closing them
randy rounds a corner
he enters the the screens show the childrens contour images again
randy takes a seat at the same console milo was at and begins to type
camera booms slowly down beneath table level to find milo hanging onto the underside of the table knuckles white as he clings to metal table braces
the toes of his sneakers are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower and the table bottom
randy shifts in his seat his knee rising toward milos back
milo arches it avoids a knee by mere millimeters
randy brings up a shot of a programmer at work zooms in on his screen to begin collecting his code
milo begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow and worse on his hands
theyre giving way
a printer across the room start making a hard copy of the purloined code
milo stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed on top of starts to shift threatening to disengage from its ports
he tries to lift it back up with heels of his shoes
randy knits his brow as his screen flickers
he keeps typing but starts to lower his head hes going to look under the table
milo winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels while trying to maintain his balance
randy lowering his head keeps his eyes on the screen hits keys
just as he is about to clear the level of the table the screen re illumines
he comes back up
milo having extended his legs to support the tower feels his hands slipping
randy closes up the window
milo flops to the carpet
just as randy pushes away from the table
from the floor milo watches him walk over to the printer collect his hardcopy and disappear from view
milo listens the door clicks shut the whistling recedes
milo traces randys steps
he sees the door with the civil defense sticker intuits how randy got here i
e how one moves unobserved between the day care and
he sags against the wall
wondering what to do now
milo sits in his idling car staring at his own house up the street
how can he go in there
he puts the car in gear does a u turn
the deux chevaux is parked on the street outside a government building
not many people are around yet
a janitor hoses down the sidewalk
milo slides a business card across a reception desk
its the one the rumpled prosecutor lyle barton gave him that day in palo alto
he gave me this
said i should come see him if hes not in yet
can i wait in his office
its locked dear
he looks over his shoulder then back again frightened
wait in his outer office
milo sits on a wooden bench foot tapping
hearing bartons voice he comes to his feet
barton enters with a co worker holding a container of coffee discussing the particulars of a case
do i make the call or do you
milo is relieved the second he sees bartons kindly face
barton do you remember me
its milo isnt it
i need to talk to you
give me two seconds with lacy here
unlocks his door go on in i wont be a moment
milo enters as barton finishes up with his colleague
ill make the call but i think you need to send a fax first etc
he surveys framed diplomas commendations and photos on the wall
he takes comfort in their solidity pictures of bartons teenage kids barton and wife at the grand canyon
theres a college football photo a young barton with his team
milo studies it smiles
move in on the photo till we see the number on bartons notre dame football jersey milos smile fades
it takes a moment before he even hears barton behind him
thank you for seeing me
have a seat
as milo takes the seat in front of the desk mind spinning barton moves to his own chair
what seems to be the problem
you look a little upset
i am sir
whats he gonna say
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
it was racially motivated
i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that
if theres a civil rights violation
but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
i just wanna help bring these guys to justice
theyre neo nazis
let me look into it see whats being done
frankly its not my area
he gets up just didnt know who else to talk to
circles an arm over milo and outpost
youre happy there
alice is on the phone in the front room
agitated she puffs on a pencil surrogate cigarette
we hear phil through the receiver didnt mention he was going to the justice department
not like him is it
to do a thing like that without telling you
youre not losing your hold on him are you
hell tell me when he gets home
thatll be a test wont it
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl
lisas an extremely valuable member of the skywire team
weve got our eyes on her
you keep yours on milo
as she hangs up prick
milo comes up the path
he pauses as he nears the door hes not sure he can pull this off
as milo enters alice rushes to meet him
its almost nine ive been so worried
she takes his hands what did you see in there
she watches him as he collapses onto the couch
its what they said it is
an unfinished broadcast studio
you were right
i just drove to seattle and back
remember lyle barton
she shakes her head
the justice department guy who came to the apartment when i remember
after i broke into which was insane thank god they didnt catch me
i just drove around
trying to figure out what possessed me
you know what
ive been putting my own guilt on gary
quietly if id stayed down there maybe this wouldntve happened
you know thats not true
she sits by him touches her hand to his face tenderly
he closes his eyes for a moment steels himself to her touch
then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers
but he cant stand it
he gets up looks out the window
i thought instead of indulging all these paranoid delusions risking my job alienating gary scaring you i should do something useful with my grief
help them find teddys killers
he doesnt see her smile is that all
assuming an appropriately concerned expression she moves toward him i was so worried about you
she turns him around kisses him
her eyes are closed
his remain open
hes looking at her
trying to comprehend the treachery
she touches him breathes heavily
she wants more than kisses to prove to herself how wrong phil was her professional pride insulted
or perhaps its more personal than that especially with lisa as a potential rival
through their kisses been such a long night
but she doesnt stop
she moans as she presses herself to him wants proof of his devotion
hes on top of her in the moment just after
her eyes are closed
he stares at her glares at her with what we recognize as spent anger
that was different
you didnt feel it
whats clear is she liked it
a clap of thunder takes us to its pouring
milo stands outside wearing a slicker looking in the window at someone
lisa reads a paperback at a table a slice of pizza on her plate an umbrella hooked to her chair
sensing someone standing over her she looks up
so youre not avoiding me
milo sits across from her
he doesnt know where to start
he looks around wants to make sure no ones listening
he speaks very quietly
i snuck into
why would you do a thing like you thought about it too
youve been suspicious for a while
but its not happening in there
its happening in the day care
the day care
two men with even features enter the restaurant
one has a laptop case slung over his shoulder
can we go someplace else
theyre in a bandshell
the rain falls heavily drips off the eaves
she holds the filament from teddys workspace
its easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell em
they upload medical files school records pharmacy files
theyd be happy just to steal code forever
but when a program gets close to fruition
he was almost there
but why would they
there is no second place
and whats the risk
the killingsre undetectable theyre hand tailored they make sense
i mean theyre in the information business
they have scenarios for all of us too
in case we find out too much
shes peering at him
he reads her mind
im not one of them
not trying to suss you out
she wants to believe him
they killed my best friend
im living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me
cant you trust somebody just once
i dont wanna be alone here
his plea is so ardent his humanity so transparent
but she cant quite do it
im sorry milo
she smiles sadly as she backs away
forcefully i know why youre so secretive
why you wont let anybody near you
quieter i know what he did to you
she tries to sound tough there are tears in her eyes
so thats in my file
he wants to comfort her
he takes a step toward her
she shakes her head no
is that my scenario
when he hesitates tell me
theyd frame him
horrified hes out of prison
he nods theyre already watching you
if they had to theyd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout
hed wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
she draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks
she weeps silently
he moves to her carefully slowly seeing her fear her trauma
he touches her shoulders
she tenses tries to back away
but he holds on
nobodys gonna hurt you
slowly he wraps his arms around her
she remains tense for a moment then yields pressing her face into his shoulder
the rain drums on the bandshell
after a moment milo
i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out hed run
hed think i was unclean
she clings to him tightly now the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain secrecy shame
a wide shot they hold each other alone in the storm
all his suspicions were allayed
she sits in front of leather bound books
shes at garys house
on the hot seat
phil and randy watch her
gary does too but deep in shadow behind a desk at a remove
rain falls heavily on the lake
he said it made sense that garys code was like teddys that that cliche about great minds was true
said it was all about his own guilt
she shrugs plus he has a tendency to get gary mixed up with his dad once in a while
it always passes
he wasnt acting
i dont think he knows how
phil looks convinced
from across the highway cars with morning commuters whiz by we see milo pumping gas at a self serve lisa fills up in the next lane
ostensibly they have run into each other on the way to work
they are smiling casual
only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear no connection to their words
what about the fbi
theyve got this guy in the doj maybe others
we tell the wrong person its over
who can we trust
theres always a logical answer you just have to define the question
she defines it how do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person
she pretends to need help lifting her car hood a helpless female
he comes over to help her
we dont tell anybody
shes puzzled we tell everybody
so theres no secret left to protect
when everybody knows they dont dare touch us
bob shrot is on the phone
behind him a nerdy security programmer len dietz is at the console that controls the security cameras the ones milo futzed with
into the phone no tony cant fill in for you hes not at your authorization level
scrolling len knits his brow hes found something odd
you better look at this
milo checks lisas oil for her
do we post it on the net
therere so many disinformation sites about gary already
where he has devils horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein
shrot stands over lens shoulder
could it be a glitch
something the construction workers caused
all cameras are frozen
do we call randy and phil
tell em there may have been a break in
love to bust my ass cause im not in frigging mensa
walks to the window i swear to god its that kid milo i told em so in the first place but they didnt even wanna hear about it
turns to len lets run a printout on card entries
milo shows lisa the oil stick
the mainstream media
tv or a newsmagazine
but garys tied in to a lot of media conglomerates
have to be careful who we pick
we could cross reference a data base on media ownership
but not on our own computers
not even at home
certainly not at my happy home
he slams the hood
shrot and len watch a laser printer as it spits out line after line after line of swipe card entries
a laser printer spits out code
we are milo watches new skywire code emerge from his printer
gary is in the doorway behind him watching milo scrutin izing him
sensing someone milo turns and looks
you look a little tired
its going well
have a look
gary takes the page
as he reads it over why did you move around so much
when you were a kid
my dad was a compulsive gambler
only he didnt think he was
that applied to guys who didnt have a system
losers who played games of chance
he could read people so chance had nothing to do with it
no matter how deep a hole he dug himself hed give you the whole speech
and youd better not point out the obvious
he shrugs his creditors would catch up to him
loan sharks or whatever
hed wake us in the middle of the night
off wed go again
what would you tell the kids
at your new school
you had to come up with a good story right
milo thinks hes testing me
i just went deeper into the machine
preferred being the geek to having to explain
lying wouldve been worse
cause he was a liar
and i hated him
mimicking a voice get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world
the more he mocked me the deeper i went
cause if being savvy meant being like him he shrugs guess thats why im kind of clueless even now
didnt cultivate my conniving side
not sure i even have one
dont be so hard on yourself
with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of em i bet
theres no way to read it
establish the humble building in a park
lisa and milo sit together in front of a monitor
a kid does his homework on a computer at the next table
milo shakes his head as he scrolls
hes buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives
getting ready for skywire
shes thinking what about minutes
yeah they dig stuff like this
he types then reads cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of
but still you cant say cbs wouldnt love to break something like hes shaking his head say theres just one mole working there like barton at the doj
how do we know hes not the guy weve contacted
or the guy she works for
at the next table she notices a lady reading time
types reads time warner has a per cent stake in garys set top device
that also takes out cnn
scrolling scrolling ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out
disney joins outpost abc is out
outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out
any of these places could have a mole
or all of em
still scrolling its like a a continuous loop
we can go to some alternative press place that people read get them and us killed
but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in
shes thought of something
hes watching the nerdy kid smiling sadly perhaps identifying with him
how close are you
hes got satellites up
hes got dishes on top of
hes building this gestures at the screen mega network for skywire
lets use it
move in on milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of excitement and skepticism
milo and lisa walk in the park outside the library thinking it through
we cant just assume theyre standing by to receive skywire months from launch
id have to write in an aglet
its how on line services push logos they wanna sell you
you dont ask for em they just appear
have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house
and then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats months away
but theyd still get the idea right
youd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop
maybe some audio too
to tie it all in to gary
how long would that take you
its a standard gui
once ive got a concept its maybe three days work
gary knows im close on skywire
we have to do this fast
before they kill somebody else too
a new wrinkle oh man
id have to get into garys house
to get the satellite positions
you mean break in
i dont know and what if the broadcast dishes on top of arent hot yet
you said the place isnt finished
the complications pile up
ill go look
when he looks dubious theyll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around
they come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park stop walking
looks at her why were you so careless
i thought the worst they would do is fire me
who knew they took termination so literally
what a game girl
hes nuts about her
why were you snooping in my office
she gets bashful i liked you
i was checking you out
he kisses her
there are no constraints now theres no adulterous guilt they kiss with a passion deferred
slow push in on the phone on milos desk its ringing
alice is calling him
her face hardens she hangs up
as we pan the best western decor in semi darkness think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
cause their apartments might be bugged
he lisa lie in bed
i told teddy about you
whatd he say
a beautiful geek
whatre the chances
she smiles rather bashfully
i felt guilty
cause i owed so much to alice
but even then i was starting to wonder
is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you
if you have a lucrative skill its all anybody wants from you
you grow older but you dont grow up
you turn into into gary
its painful for him losing a second father
larry used to say how the guys who wrote the first cool operating systems like the unix guys at berkeley
they just gave it away
they figured it was human knowledge it belonged to the world like shakespeare or aspirin
know what im gonna do after we broadcast the incriminating stuff
air the skywire code
then nobody can have a monopoly
alice is in bed
in the darkness milo comes in as quietly as possible
but she switches on the bedside lamp
where were you
holding his gaze you know you cant keep anything from me
i did something naughty
theres this amazing comix store in seattle
is she buying it
to tell you the truth i did it once or twice at stanford
guess i cant keep anything from you
of course she buys it its in the file
she smiles i wont turn you in
shrot and len go over the print out of the card entries
every entry was authorized
whatre we looking for
any irregularity in the pattern
morning tv is on in the kitchen
a seattle station airs a puff piece about a party at garys house people in formal clothes including gary his wife hold drinks and eat canapes on the terrace over
garys haircut is different its file footage
last years party goers pledged over million to the museum this years event promises to raise even more
lured in part by the chance to see the stunning boyd house
alice grinding coffee isnt paying attention
look at this
why doesnt he ask us to his party
hes never even met you
he has thousands of employees milo its for the museum
he knows youre a painter
if anybody should be invited milo i know you think im too attached to him but still
i am close to gary
and youre the most meaningful person in my life
he gets up im going back to the comix place why should i be killing myself
milo you but hes out the door
shes not entirely displeased by such a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her
close on a satellite dish
we pan from the base of the dish to the wiring a cable is fused to a component box
lisa is on the scaffolding having climbed it brazenly in broad daylight
she holds a small metal box with a meter and two clamps
she applies the clamps to the base of the cable
the needle on the meter dances
get down here
she was expecting to be busted
still shes scared
a catholic school on a wooded lane
schoolgirls in uniform play on the swings and hopscotch courts
milo types madly on a four year old pc
it takes him a moment to notice sister beatrice
this is a lifesaver
my pc crashed just before finals
none of us knows how to use it
im thinking of taking a course
she wants to look may i
with her we see the complex lines of code
lisa sits with bob shrot
shes unfolding a page of sketch paper
i needed tsee it up close for a graphic
the outpost with a dish on top
i climbed up there to get it right
she hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish
he looks at her at the drawing at her again
shes scared but tries to hide it
hands back the drawing next time you ask
relieved she gets up
the meter tumbles to the floor thud
she goes white
but when she looks up she sees shrot didnt see it len is standing in the inner door waving a printout
might of found something
lisa grabs up the meter as shrot joins len
as she goes out she hears delbert seems to enter twice
without leaving the first time
lets get him in here
milo looks up as his train comes into a station
lisa enters the car carrying a stack of comix
he stands they kiss he takes the comix
i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire were there
the dishes are juiced up too
shrot suspects somebody broke into
i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
confused they know i broke in
alice helped me
figuring it out shrots not one of them
hes blundering into this on his own
he doesnt know about the day care
hardly anybody does thats the beauty part
no cameras the doj doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about
you know the best place to hide a leaf
yeah thats old in a tree
what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four a
and tells them about it
they look at each other the consequences of this discovery would be deadly
a busy lunch hour
milo is eating with some other programmers including desi
theres a stir of excitement in the room
gary comes straight to milos table all conversation instantly drops out
gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation
im giving a benefit for the art museum thursday night
thought youd like to bring alice
everybody at the table is listening
as he goes sorry about the late notice
milo sits down
everybodys looking at him
sorry about the late notice
delbert is seated across from shrot and len
shrot holds the printout
why did you enter twice
shrot hands delbert the printout
delbert looks at it dense with coded entries
he stares at it
this things screwed up
shows it to them shows me going into the day care that night
i never been in the day care
shrot narrows his eyes
milo sits with lisa as she brings up the graphic interface shes designed for the skywire broadcast
its an outpost desktop with recognizable logos fonts etc
one windowll be obits i downloaded based on the scenarios you described
the other windowsll accommodate the surveillance stuff you told me about
the idea is this works with anything since we cant edit
its not necessary for us to understand what shes saying just so milo does
she holds up an audio copy of garys book the next highway
same with the excerpts im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described
something preys on his mind how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to you could always say you have to go the bathroom
thats lame isnt it
youll come up with something
he already looks nervous
we begin to hear live music
the music echoes from inside
push past a line of cars and limousines in the lit up drive milos car at the head of it
milo and alice get out
as they go inside she pulls a tag from the sleeve of his just bought dinner jacket
as milo and alice enter he sees a balthus painting re digitize to a mondrian
they called the house to ask whos your favorite painter
alice smiles milo forces a smile itll be even harder to sneak away now
they pass a doorway where a houseman stands to keep guests from entering residential rooms the ones milo must pass through to get to garys workroom
a guy in a pretentiously hip tux tries to peek in
sorry sir this part of the residence is restricted
milo looks a little more tense
the room is full of people
a long windowed wall has been opened onto a lakeside terrace where more guests drink and chat and an orchestra plays
a giant mondrian digitizes on the wall the worlds largest id card
milo sinks a little more
across the room gary his wife a blandly pretty blond and two men are grouped around a monet set on an antique easel thus clearly the real thing mrs
boyd has prevailed
gary notices the giant digital mondrian
milo takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray
he hands one to alice as gary et
alice im gary
this is my wife clarissa
milo this is barry linder whos visiting from hollywood
linder is a short tan man of
i hate being the hollywood guy
its so limiting
meet my friend ricky
ricky is years old he looks like a polo model
barrys studios gonna help fill the skywire pipeline thought you guys should meet
his mind elsewhere cool
angle the orchestra playing
angle a group of society types chatting
hes a sweetheart
he gave pcs to the library association
all of which will be signed onto his browser no doubt
and so what
waitll all the books are on line
and so what
angle milo alice gary barry linder clarissa ricky
milo looks utterly preoccupied
the merchandising implications are epic
a kids watching the movie he points and clicks at the laser blaster before the reels even over hes ordered the toy
but i mean devils advocate wont that influence the content
wont the artists complain
the directors or writers or whoever
darling the only art left in america is business
youre in picassos house
gary smiles as everyone toasts him except milo he hasnt heard any of it
wheres the bathroom
track milo as he wends his way through laughing chatting guests dread and determination on his face
he moves away from us enters the speaks to the houseman who guards the residential rooms
youll have to use one over there
he indicates an area on milos side of the door
theres like eight women waiting in line
they take forever
winces painful bladder please
he points to a door immediately behind him
as the houseman watches milo goes into the he stands there a moment breathes deeply
he cracks open the door
the houseman is turning away another guest milo makes his move
looking over his shoulder milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room silently cursing the mondrian that inevitably appears
the houseman looks over his shoulder sees the closed bathroom door assumes milos still inside
gary chats with his guests
alice looks up at the digital art now a bosch again
milo walks fast
as he passes from one room to next he sees a mondrian hes been in this room
all the austere tastefully decorated rooms are blending together
he stands in the center of the room making quarter turns
through each of four open doorways he sees a perfectly appointed den the ultimate expression of bland rich professionally decorated taste
he starts into one room backs up goes into another
the houseman looks over his shoulder again
he sees the mondrian and in the room beyond that another mondrian
he moves to the bathroom door knocks on it
he pulls a sleek walkie talkie from his jacket
milo still lost is getting frantic
he doubles back cuts toward another wing of the house
through an open doorway he sees a young chillingly calm nanny watching him
the baby fusses in her arms
milo smiles keeps moving
a second houseman follows the trail of mondrians
he sees mondrians in two different directions
he hesitates picks a direction keeps moving
the first houseman moves through the guests toward gary
milo has finally made it
sitting at garys work station he slips a cd rom into the pc
it floods with text
the music echoes from far off
the entire wall behind him is filled with a mondrian
as linder chats the first houseman sidles up to gary whispers in his ear
we see gary smile excuse himself
he and alice share a look as he moves off
we go with gary
his smiles fades instantly
he pushes through guests who thank him for hosting such a brilliant do he hardly hears them
milo writes frantically on his tiny pad copying from the pc screen longitude degrees minutes seconds east latitude degrees minutes seconds south he flips the page begins entering the fixes
for the next satellite
thinking hes heard something he looks up
the second houseman turns in several directions confused by the trail of mondrians
passing into the next room he runs into a third houseman also confused
each follows a different mondrian in a different room
unlike the housemen gary doesnt follow the paintings
he moves swiftly seems to know where milo is
milo still working
alice looks up at the digital painting still a bosch
her face sets grimly
milo clicks closing the window
concentrating he doesnt see what we see on the wall behind him the mondrian drains away
and the wall fills up with the hellish bosch triptych
after a moment milo senses something
gary stands in the doorway
milo doesnt breathe
gary crosses the room eyes locked with milos
gary comes behind milo
he reads the screen
its filled with text whatever milo loaded in when he sat down
reading the screen dear lisa
ive enjoyed working with you
id be lying if i didnt say i find you attractive
but in my heart i know that alice
he looks up you left my party to send e mail
i couldnt do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons
gary stares at milo
he looks skeptical
the party music floats in from afar as the moment stretches
you couldve handwritten it
im not much good at handwriting
oh thats right
this hangs there
gary im sorry if i was rude the second houseman sticks his head in
everything ok mr
when hes gone is there
gary i you see whats hanging on the wall
he looks over
milo looks over
among the framed commendations awards degrees we see milos childhood program written on outpost
gary has had it framed
milo absorbs it
even now he feels something for gary
i hope you know what you mean to me
not just because of what youre doing
because of who you are
i do know gary
i feel the same way
i thought i was coming here for a job
but its meant a lot more
milo smiles almost tenderly
he doesnt know if gary buys it
perhaps if he could see garys eyes
but theyre obscured by boschs writhing bodies reflected on his eyeglasses
gary moves away from milo he stands over the table with the art books vaguely looks through one
when will you have a beta version
milo wonders does he know
he picks his words carefully
im pretty close
but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer
you know what its like writing software
i do know
you focus on the big problem
but somewhere down the chain something breaks down
something gets destroyed
at first its upsetting
you feel youve lost control
gary puts down the book
something in his tone draws milo
so you have to remind yourself its just the process
somethings always lost along the way to anything worthwhile
some little bug some glitch
cant get bogged down in that youre doing something other people could never do
they lack the imagination the brain the nerve
let them fret about every unforeseen consequence
you have to solve the problem
thats who you are
is this a confession
a plea for understanding
or just a pep talk to keep milo focused on skywire
in the car milo and alice pull away from the lights and limos in icy silence
are you gonna tell me where you went
i went to see the skywire model in garys office
just to hold it again
he looks at her
she stares ahead out the windshield
are you having an affair milo
hed better have his story straight with gary and alice
i sent an e mail to somebody just now
to tell her how i feel about you
looks at her you know im clueless without you
you know i fighting tears just shut up
or is she faking it
has he lost the trust of all of them
hes afraid now
move in on the building past kids playing in the yard
we hear the childrens shouts os
short with a fingerprint kit is dusting the keyboards
len stands over him
get the backslash the colon keys kids dont use but geeks do
looking around perplexed what would milo want in here anyway
just they dont trust me with it
so well get the evidence first ask questions later
by the balustrade in the dimness milo stands with lisa
does he know you know
he suspects i know something
i think he was sort of explaining himself to me in case i do
he breathes we have to go in tonight
im two hours from a beta version
knows she wont like it but ive gotta go home for an hour
she called to apologize
i said i was pulling an all nighter
she said then come home just to say hi
which i always do when we fight its suspicious if i dont
please dont go
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
she looks at him worried then takes a disk out of her backpack
heres the interface
he takes it
she watches him go worried
as milo comes up the path he sees alice in the kitchen
he opens the front door steps in
she comes from the kitchen in an apron wiping her hands
the apron is spattered her hair is askew
im a mess
i got this hunan cookbook since were always afraid for you to eat in chinese restaurants
ive been mincing things into teeny tiny pieces all afternoon
he smiles to hide his terror
is she killing him now
or just testing his reaction
or is it a sincere overture
look at me
im gonna change
when she turns away we see the fear on his face
alice pulls into a dress
milo at the stove sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok
he grabs a a spoon examines it but its minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another
alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon
milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket reads the label on a jar the label on a can
alice applies blush on
milo goes through the spice cabinet
he stops when she comes from the bedroom
he smiles you look beautiful
give me a goodbye kiss
i know you
youre gonna run back to work right after dinner
i want my kiss now
either shes the most cold blooded woman in the world or
he takes her in his arms kisses her long and hard as if his life depended on it
when he releases her she pretends to swoon
she backs toward the kitchen
be right back
camera is positioned on the counter just behind the big bowl as alice spoons the food into it
she sprinkles on some final ingredient also minced
milos fingers drum the table top
alice picks up the dish
we dont see her face
we hold the dish out in front of us
the food shines in the light a poisonous yellow gleam
we move from kitchen to dining room slowly deliberately
milo comes into view beyond the dish wearing a forced smile
we come all the way to the table with the dish where alice sets it down
milo still vamping pours wine
he picks up his fork
stares at it
his mind churns furiously
dont we have any chopsticks
when shes gone he flips his left arm over and drags the tines of his fork against it making score marks like those used by allergists to test for sensitivity
he dabs the sauce onto the tracks wipes it clean
he stares at it
alice roots through ladles bottle openers cheese graters spatulas
at the bottom of the drawer she finds two pairs of take out chopsticks wrapped in white paper
milo looks from his watch to his arm no reaction yet
under his breath one more minute
but heres alice
she slips into her seat
here we go
he unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly
wanna savor this
its gonna get cold
youre just afraid to eat it
she smiles picks up her glass
to the artist
she sips her wine
he sips his
he wants desperately to glance at his inner arm once more
but shes watching him waiting for him to eat
he picks up the chopsticks gathers up a tiny bite
she watches keenly
he brings the food to his mouth passes it between his lips swallows
he closes his eyes ostensibly to savor the food in fact bracing for a paroxysm
she watches him expectantly either for his verdict on the food or for the first fatal spasm
his voice cracks its great
she takes a bite
the moment she looks away he turns over his arm to get a look face full of fear
the tracks are still flat theres no redness
he shovels a large bite into his mouth ecstatic to be alive
then another bite greedy with life
shrot and len are in a high tech office
on a monitor we see a blown up image of a fingerprint taken from milos keyboard milos name is printed under it
in a second window other fingerprints flash by thousands of prints lifted off keyboards in the day care
shrot waits for a match to click in
milo scrolls his skywire code concentrating intensely
till he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger
he rubs them together peers at his keys
dolly zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder
fear seizes milo
he ejects his the skywire cd it is a bright silver color with a skywire logo on it slips it in an equally distinct silver cd jewel case
milo smiles at desi as he moves up the hall
he almost bumps into garys secretary
how was the party
thanks for asking
he continues up the hall
he ducks into the service hall
shrot watches as the computer produces an alarm like buzzing
the second window locks onto the matching print
the prints flash in unison garishly confirming the match
milo races along the tunnel that leads from to the day care
shrot punches a number on the phone
you calling phil and randy
im calling gary
milo climbs the stairs fumbles with the swipecard enters the day care
len is at the console
on a security monitor he has called up video from a moment ago milo hurrying up the hall almost running into garys secretary
shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone
hes left his office we think hes gone back to the day care for some reason
can you tell me why gary
he listens whatever you say
hangs up angrily wants to consult with phil
was it phils idea to run the fingerprints
shrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out
come with me
trying to catch up where we going
milo is under the table detaching one of the the black plastic data towers that contain the primers stored surveillance material etc
phil hangs up the phone
he turns to randy who is with the two men the blond gunther the pale eyed riman
hes in the day care
milo carefully detaches a second data tower
shrot and len hurry out of the building toward the day care across the quad
len is ill at ease bob im a programmer not a cop
in his haste shrot doesnt even hear him
gunther riman randy head down the service hallway en route to the bomb shelter stairs
milo lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm wondering if he should just ditch one gets as far as the main colorfully carpeted room shrot is there gun
len stands just behind
what are you doing
youre better off not knowing
shrot thinks hes being mocked as usual
whatre you doing
milo sets down one of the towers
theyre surveilling programmers from in here
they steal their code
sometimes i know this sounds insane sometimes they kill one
shrot looks skeptical
they let me break into
cause theres nothing in there
you know theyve been keeping things from you
getting in the way when you try tdo your job
thats why you never told em your suspicions about me
shrot doesnt deny it
if you had id be dead now
milos sincerity is striking
youve been following your gut all along
please dont stop now
gunther riman and randy climb the metal stairs turn at a landing climb some more
when they get to the next landing riman opens the door
they enter hearing voices inside gunther draws a gun they move forward stealthfully
they enter the whats going on here
randy sees shrot and len
whore these guys
where is he
were too late
take a look
he shines his light under the table where the towers have been detached
whats in here worth taking anyway
milo hurries away from the day care
he has just one data tower now so he can move faster
randy starts to push past shrot he must be out there still he gets to the front room where the jettisoned data tower still sits but he doesnt see it
calling after forget about it
his cars not in the lot hes gone
shrot watches anxiously to see if hes stopped randy
milo moves low among the high priced cars lugging the tower
he gets to his deux chevaux opens the trunk hey
its desi again
wanna get a cheeseburger or something
maybe another time
as calmly as possible he stows the tower slams the trunk gets in the car
randy hangs up the phone
to shrot len fellas im gonna have to ask you to leave here now
wait a second
im the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
were all grateful for that
go out the way you came in
reluctantly shrot len head out toward the front room
milo is on the phone he drives as fast as one can in his car
meet me at the other location
tell me youre not calling on your car phone
randy riman gunther have turned the day care into a surveillance post
they hear milo lisas conversation on speakers
they know i had no choice
get out of the house now
do you have a laptop
its three years old it bring it to the other location
but you said the other he rings off
he reads something off a business card
scrambling lisa grabs her old laptop finds her keys
phils on the phone
hangs up briefs gary hes off campus hes taken some surveillance data with him
garys eyes narrow
shes bringing her laptop its wired
second she boots up were on em
milo reads the address off the business card which has a satellite dish as its logo
he holds it in front of him
when he brings down the card it reveals a real life satellite dish through the windshield
as the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building we read a sign that says knqr public access
milo rushes in lugging the tower
theres a linoleum floor framed one sheets for tacky public access shows yoga blow dried evangelist nude talk show
behind the reception desk sits a beefy rent a guard with an earring
picks up the phone who wants to see him
lisa drives fast checking her rear view mirror to make sure shes not being followed
pan to the seat next to her her laptop lies on the passenger seat
a monitor shows a green interface with yellow coordinates like an air traffic controllers screen
randy sits at the keyboard in front of it phone cradled on shoulder
into the phone nothing
they havent booted up yet
milo speaks to brian
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software
youd be my partner
you cant pre empt yoga thats our biggest show
you wanna be a big deal dont you
thats your dream in life
brian is examining the data tower
he touches the outpost logo branded into it rather reverently
lisa comes in laptop slung over her arm
will i get to work for outpost
but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this
were gonna bring down outpost
whatd they ever do for you
brians thinking it over
we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door what
to the rent a guard wanna be a part of history
digging in his pocket well would you like to pick up an extra dollars
gary is pacing
on the phone nothing yet gary
the rent a guard drags a file cabinet in front of the door where he has already dragged the couch some chairs a garbage can two lamps
three tvs of various sizes and wood veneers are turned on one to nbc er one to cbs hours one to abc toothpaste commercial
on an in house monitor a leathery woman in a leotard does yoga
lisa is cabling her laptop into the stations computer
brian boots it up it runs the satellite
milo cables the data tower into the laptop
cables go in every which direction the whole set up has a distinctly gerry rigged look
go tight on the laptop power switch
lisa toggles it on
the yellow coordinates start blinking on
randy sits at a console
into the phone weve got a fix on em
typing north jericho road
gunther and riman grab holstered guns race out
randy types some more speaks into the phone public access tv station
phil hangs up blows a sigh of relief
hes taken it to the public access station
phil sags gratefully into a chair
only to see gary plow past him
at his workstation gary types mutters thats what he was doing in here
the bosch wall screen fills up with a dark blue background longitude and latitude lines
gary throws a printed spiral notebook at him
help me change the skywire settings
add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
gary dont worry we just do what im asking
gary hits a switch
a wood panel slides into the wall revealing a bank of four tvs
gunther and riman speed toward the station
milo slips his disk in the laptop
lisa cables the video tower to the laptop
youre interfaced with our dish
to lisa gimme the coordinates
lisa reads from milos little pad
longitude degrees minutes seconds east
milo types on the laptop
latitude degrees minutes seconds south
phil reads to gary as he types
we see the earth far below
the skywire satellite orbits majestically into frame shifts five degrees to the left
milo hits enter
milo lisa brian shift their collective gaze to the three funky tv sets
er plays uninterrupted dan rather diane sawyer on abc the yoga lady the audio of all four blending in a chaotic low melange that adds to the tension particularly the
frantic medical emergency on er
is it your software
is it your dish
maybe its the satellite
he thinks lets try
longitude degrees minutes gunther and riman squeal into the station parking lot
lisa looks out the window to the parking lot below
milo is typing in coordinates
theyre already here
my laptop must be wired
typing were there
milo hits enter
gary hits enter
a second skywire satellite shifts regally away from the earth as if shunning the signal
milo lisa brian watch the tvs
er et al
gunther and riman tear through the barricade the rent a cop has erected with ruthless precision
milo cogitates while lisa reviews the satellite coordinates to brian you checked your connections
to milo yes
should you reboot
milo is scrolling the software trying to figure out which of a possible glitches is getting in the way
hes been altering the coordinates since we logged on
hes a step ahead
lets jump to
ready for number three
knows im altering the coordinates
lets jump to
just do it
the rent a guard drags furniture props lights in front of the entrance to the satellite room
gunther and riman have created an opening in the barricade
they step through it
they hear the racket the rent a guard is making upstairs
they head that way
the rent a guard is holding a lightstand as they ascend guns drawn
we wont hurt you
riman takes the lightstand from him
the rent a guard puts his hands up sidles across the hallway as they tear into the barricade
lisa reads to milo
wait a second
he knows i know
hes working backwards too
to lisa lets do number five
gunther and riman rip down the barricade reach the door
they whip it open guns drawn
they see an empty supply room
the barricade was a decoy
the rent a guard has joined milo et al in here
he tries to slide a heavy shelf in front of the door but its not yet in place
lisa has dialed
theyve got guns
os we can hear gunther and riman pounding at the door
open the door milo
to milo you there yet
typing one more second
he hits enter
the door is kicked open
gunther riman enter gunther with a gun riman still carrying the light stand
he immediately bashes the knqr computer with it
lisa looks devastated
hey hey relax relax
he holds up the computer cable to show riman it was never plugged in anyway
oh my god
to gunther should i call phil
or do you
gunther knits his brow
he notices milo still staring at the tv screens
our regular programming will not be preempted tonight
milos gaze stays fixed to the screens
riman grabs him by the shirt
but gunthers concerned by milos behavior staring at milo wait
as milo watches the screens a pixilated ghostly image begins to appear on all of them the animated skywire logo lightning strike etc
brian lurches across to the laptop ejects the cd rom
its beige colored says outpost word
when did you know
still watching the screens you shouldve called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
whos got skywire
gary and phil watch as the skywire logo gets steadily stronger on garys tvs
phil is confounded if milo didnt launch skywire who did
we hear a low steady hum
a cable plugged into a dusty wall port that doesnt even have a plate on it
panning along the cable we widen to show in dim construction light not far from the sears generator len sits on the concrete floor
the second data tower is patched into a laptop
the distinct silver jewelcase lies by the cd rom drive
shrot paces now what are we doing
i dont get any of this shit
i launched skywire
just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to garys satellite
each shows the standard outpost desktop outpost logo fonts colors
this is the all purpose interface lisa created for to milo
a window at the top shows a succession of obituaries with photos lisa has downloaded from newspapers programmer dies in highway crash programmer among cult suicides programmer victim of racial
the obituaries eight of them fade up and down in a continuous cycle
meantime lower on the screen the material from the day care data tower appears following the same succession we saw when milo brought up teddys data i
footage of a young programmer at college surveillance footage of him typing away from behind medical records that describe his vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario
between the obits and the primers cause and effect is eventually established
the crowning note is the audio gary in voice over gleaned by lisa from the audio version of his own book most of us who write software achieve our greatest
work before age
as i grow older i know how important it is to access fertile young minds
we hear sirens grow near
gunther watches the broadcast still gripping his gun
to gunther you know the scenario for this
this sounds ominous
lisa wonders what it means
milo wonders what it means
he swallows hard
last thing you wanna do is hurt us now
not at all sure right
to brian whos seeing this
with dread who isnt
move past rows rows of pcs playing surveillance footage a crash scene upload and an obituary in a college computer lab
students watch agog
we work hard to stay ahead because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of business
times square pedestrians and motorists with craned necks watch the jumbo tron now the worlds biggest desktop
in one window college video of a promising programmer in the other footage of a cult suicide
sometimes the programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit sometimes not but the connection by now becomes clear
the first rule of the software business is those who dont innovate are doomed to die
the cuts accelerate
in a network control room technicians flip switches trying to bring back scheduled programming
at the nikkei the brokers are transfixed by what comes over the big board
in a vegas casino gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed circuit horserace monitors
on a street corner a crack dealer watches on his beeper
at a stadium the stones play but tilting up the diamond vision behind them plays milos broadcast
in an electronics store a wall of tvs of them plays grisly primer footage for shoppers
a guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of outpost from his basket returns it to the shelf
in the day care computer room it plays on all the monitors as randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro magnetic hoop which he runs over each
tower wiping out data
through all the cuts we hear garys narration thats why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications
consumers dont care where new ideas come from just so long as theyre offered at competitive prices
isnt that what the free markets about
sure we like being but its pressure too
this business is binary youre a zero or a one
a group of government lawyers working late chinese takeout loosened ties watch with a dawning sense of unbelievable good luck
guess we should wake the attorney general
tight on a pc screen teddy chins recruitment file is in one window the hate crime footage is in another
ive been called aggressive but to me thats really a compliment
larry watches with his start up partners
his eyes close it hurts to see teddy again
look at all the jobs and technologies my aggression has created
open on a framed photo of barton his wife and kids
the broadcast plays os
phone for you
she comes in
the front door is wide open the tv is still on
we really are a family here at outpost
paintings are gone from the wall clothes flung around
move in on a note pinned to the pillow as the tv plays
i think thats why outsiders sometimes sees us as cultish or secretive
milo it wasnt so bad really
xx alice high wide shot sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars squeal into the sanctified parking lot
is loyalty and group spirit somehow sinister nowadays
open on garys tv monitors then pan into the room
phil has departed the outpost lawyers have taken his place
the murder stuff is all innuendo bad pr legally null
could probably be spun as urban legend
there is a case for corporate espionage but if you cop a plea youll get a slap cop a plea
im confused ted
you think i knew about this
the lawyers suppress their opinion
im running the company fighting the doj raising a family
randy and phil obviously overreacted
to this endless antitrust witchhunt
get real the governments gonna offer em a helluva deal to tie you into this
whether you knew about it or not
randy phil and whoever else knew about it
that wont be a problem
gunther riman turn off a rural road
as for pr skywirell take care of all that
onto a tarmac
a private jet sits lit up waiting
the worlds seen it now
they know its gonna dominate the convergence market even beyond how outpost dominates the desktop
continuous dolly past gunther as he takes a chivas from the stewardess lyle barton who slips on his headset alice sorting through video casettes randy phil playing gin rummy brian
eating a hamburger
meantime go after us you give foreign competitors a shot at the platform thatll hold sway for years you threaten not just our chip and pc partners like when you
came after the browser
you threaten tv networks phone companies catalog outlets publishing houses movie studios travel agents airlines stock brokerages you sabotage the whole economy
talk about undermining innovation
hes writing on a legal pad easy to spin old as the hills whats good for outpost is good for america
he hands the pad to gary
milo watches the screens anxiously
come on bob
load in the other disk
gary is reading from the lawyers pad
i had no knowledge of these activities but i have to ask myself if the competitive environment i encouraged in some small way contributed gary
gary looks up
the lawyer nods soberly at the tvs
in one window the skywire code scrolls slowly past
in the other it says heres the code for the operating system that made this braodcast possible
make the new convergence technologies as free as the web
under the windows these words scroll continuously human watching gary knits his brow he looks wounded
in the lab that began the montage move past rows of students scribbling madly as the code unfolds or saving it to their hard drives
off screen a student says well the genies out of that bottle
the board ousted gary boyd as chairman theyre assisting the doj in the breakup of outpost into divisions
the cyber pundit chats with larry king
thats gotta kill him right
outpost was his baby sure
on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites
outpost doesnt own em
we are larry lindholm sits on a couch watching tv
movers are carrying out computer equipment all around him
he tries to ignore them
conglomeratesre lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites
theyll pay him a huge premium to get on line
thatd change with a criminal indictment
theres no hard evidence he knew about this
anybody who could implicate him seems tove vanished
isnt there a stigma
bankrolling this guy
billion buys you some slack in this world
and the kid who wrote skywire then gave it away
theyre calling him the digital robin hood
surprised hes not your guest
you better believe everybodys trying to sign him up
as larry king chuckles larry lindholm looks up
milo and lisa wear backpacks
as milo sluffs his off larry lisa
larry switches off the tv as he comes to his feet
a mover passes by hauling out a monitor
larry explains your app kind of blew mine out of the water
he shrugs well come up with the next big thing
you wanna work here
got out of my other commitment
larry hugs milo
turns to lisa may i
he hugs lisa too
a mover grabs milos backpack from the floor
when the mover looks not giving everything away
the mover sets it down moves on
bring your stuff
milo grabs up his pack the three of them head away from camera
you guysll be using teddys old space is that okay
