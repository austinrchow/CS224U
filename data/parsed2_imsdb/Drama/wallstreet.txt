the most famous third of a mile in the world
towering landmark structures nearly blot out the dreary grey flannel sky
the morning rush hour crowds swarm through the dark narrow streets like mice in a maze all in pursuit of one thing money
we hear the roar of the trains pulling out of the station
blurred faces bodies suits hats attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed
one of them bud fox
the bubbling mass charges up the stairs
steam rises from a grating shapes merging into the crowd
past the homeless vets the insane bag lady with cats and shopping bags huddled in the corner of trinity church
bud the fox straggling behind in a crumpled raincoat tie askew young very young his bleary face buried in a wall street journal folded subway style as he crosses the
street against the light
why didnt you buy
a car honks swerving past
cavernous modern lobby
bodies cramming into elevators
bud stuffing the newspaper into his coat jams in
blank faces stare ahead each lost in private thoughts bud again mouthing the thought stupid schmuck his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away
paranoia in the elevator
we quickly cut into private lives
hell sue me could be for million and hell get a million the house theyll impound my paychecks
damn damn why did i sign that contract
gotta get lola in the sack man take her to the garden for the terrells jimmy give me the tickets for bucks i pull the midnight shift i could do
wow check those legs out
his eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away self conscious about her legs
the elevator stops at a floor discards only one person
the doors close a little too slowly
shifts her thoughts call hanratty
the decimal points on the code are uncalibrated
the signatures on the bank draft
boyle that bitch
shit talk to kahn
recalling thats hanratty hoskins bank boyle and kahn
h b k shoot insurance and theatre tix
h b k i t and the cleaners
catching the eyes of bud fox once again wandering to her
camera moving to bud who looks away
sorry what a fox
funny the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators never get to talk to them shy
my looks never had confidence in them
overcompensating work syndrome
prove your worth with money
cept im not making any money
pause the elevator at another floor slow wonder what all these people are thinking about
camera moving slowly again over the eyes
the silence of individual tension reigns over all
ill destroy that sonufabitch
he thinks he can break a contract with me hes got something to learn
hell kill me this time he will really kill me
oh come on elevator
why do you stop on every floor
as the elevator stops again to disgorge two people
pissed now at the elevator come on man time is money man
one floor here i could do eleven blocks
pause she looks like she forgot something goddamn elevators
people too many goddamn people in this world
the elevator finally comes to a slow stop
they wait plead beg screech with the eyes
the door at last opens
none of them acknowledging each other they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a
the elevator tension is over but the killer grind continues
credits continue to run
bud moves past the functional reception area past carolyn a cheerful young black girl
how you doing buddy
great carolyn doing any better would be a sin
he slips off his overcoat flicks some lint off his paul stuart suit and enters the main trading room
brokers mill by their desks gulping coffee scanning the papers the quotrons
the digital clock by the big board counter clicks to am four minutes until the market opens
you can smell the hunger
bud takes a deep breath tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office fuck it its a new day
moving past dan steeples a flush faced old timer a blue and white yale tie with a carnation in his lapel
whats looking good today
if i know i wouldnt be in this business
get out while youre young kid
i came here one day i sat down and look at me now
past charlie cushing on the phone a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and ivy league mannerisms
hey chuckie hows the woman slayer

bud reaches his trading desk whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print out of last nights homework

his associate marvin a manicky wise guy swivels over his chair from a nearby desk
he gives the charts a quick read

lou mannheim strolls in a dignified looking older broker in his late s wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt narrow tie very much a picture
from another era
a kind humor in his eyes
but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department
friendly you got a look in your eye mr

jesus cant make a buck in this market countrys going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around

putney drug you boys might want to have a look at it

but they got a good new drug
stick to the fundamentals thats how ibm and hilton were built
good things sometimes take time
the stentorian voice of office manager hieronymus lynch booms over the intercom
we see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office tall balding with a perpetual worried look on his face
office production is down ten percent this week
i recommend that you all go through your clients investments for any portfolio adjustments
and dont forget double commissions today on our a or better bond funds
looking in bud and marvs direction especially you rookies
also remember the sales contest ends tomorrow
bud and marvin roll their eyes
the digital clock flashes
the credits close
and theyre off and running
the room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker speakers teletype machines newsprinters dow jones and reuters phones ringing off the hook
brokers are shouting orders running for tickets dodging each other its a controlled riot

he looks up at the ticker
stock quotes whizzing by
up an eighth
how many you want
its on the floor
he writes the order up
a shot of charlie cushing yawning as he half listens to his customer resting the phone on his kneecaps
we hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker and the drone of disembodied voices blarihg market information out of squawk boxes
buds desk is now cluttered with order tickets literature crumpled notes beverage cups and a half eaten sandwich
hes on the phone and from the look on his face the caller on the other end is breaking his balls
marvin paces past making a dramatic phone pitch
beltzer has to have his information this minute
it concerns his future
bud waves marvin away answers his caller trying to keep cool worried how as he sees lynch the office manager coming over
hey howard i thought you were a gentleman

marvin points up at the clock

bud quickly composes himself
he picks up the phone dialing purposefully

natalie a classy attractive englishwoman is on the phone with bud somewhat amused by his manner
she is the personal secretary to multimillionaire wall street trader and raider gordon gekko
his windows look out on a panoramic view of the city and east river
fox ive told you before im sure youre a good broker but our traders talk to the brokers mr
gekko only deals with investment bankers
yes i shall give him your message
as theyre speaking another secretary leads two well heeled japanese businessmen past her desk
as she opens the door to the inner office and ushers them inside we catch a glimpse of a figure pacing back and forth talking animatedly on the phone by
the huge corner window
he is gordon gekko
we hear a deafening roar as we in the background a ascends into the night sky climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses
bud coat collar pulled up against the wind crosses the street entering a neighborhood bar
we see an old maroon honda behind him
dimly lit noisy blue collar airline bar
machinists and mechanics still in their overalls at the bar drinking watching espn fight night on tv
bud searches the crowd
a group of middle aged men wave him over bluestar airlines insignias on the pockets
charlie dent a rugged chain smoking ex marine sergeant and dominick amato a big strong italian greet buddy as he comes over

buddy you got that mischievous look in your eyes
you used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping just like that
buds mind racing elsewhere
a cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window
moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock d
announcing the mets latest streak
the walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs print out pages strewn across the floor
no other semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly tossed barrons and fortune magazines
a girls back is all we see sleeping naked on the bed
close on buds ibm computer his appointment calendar
bud focusing on an underlined notation g
bud stares at the clock a
he picks up a prospectus for a chemical company starts reading
bud crossing lower broadway enters a magnificent towering glass structure
natalie gekkos british secretary is completing shorthand notes as the intercom buzzes
a logo for gekko co
is behind her
off i have a delivery here for mr

frowning all right send him in
bud somewhat nervous is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art
past a huge calder mobile and a pool of some traders on phones quotron terminals and keyboards
into natalies outer office
hello natalie you recognize the voice

let me give him the gift cuban cigars davidoff his favorite and hard to get
sighs stay here ill see what i can do
she takes the gift and enters gekkos office
bud paces nervously
natalie re appears stern but a note of compromise in her voice
bud on the courtesy phone hangs up looks nervously at his watch
hes lost some two hours of business
natalie suddenly comes out without a smile
bud brightens pumping himself in the mirror muttering
to natalie well
life all comes down to a few moments and this is one of em
he follows natalie
furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer modern art ranging from black field paintings by ad reinhardt to the smashed dishes of julian schnabel
nautilus equipment hi tech gadgets are in evidence including a splendid howard miller world time clock and a world map
three of gekkos people young mbas dressed for success are scattered about the room on phones calculators coming in and out
gordon gekko aka gekko the great as the media calls him dressed in a custom english suit paces on the phone with the restlessness of a caged tiger a foot
extension cord attached to his blinking line silver plated telephone
on his ears is a headset
he is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of bankers partners and lawyers pausing to issue commands to his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
across a bank of quotron monitors carrying everything from new york exchanges to london commodities gold and currency values
a second secretary and sometimes natalie exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of paper indicating a waiting party on the phone
gekko often shakes his head no

i just saw shares move are we part of it we better be pal or im gonna eat your lunch for you

buds eyes on the framed tombstones from the wall street journal commemorating gekkos successful deals they hang like scalps from the walls
gekkos eyes drifting to bud a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally projects calm and confidence
at the center
a man who obviously loves what he does to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider

his aides continue on the phones

aiex knowing the stock sneers shares a look with gekko who looks up at bud with the first sign of interest
laughs not bad for a quant but a dog with different fleas

as he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the shredder that sits next to his desk over the waste basket
the sound it makes is soft and menacing
buddy knows its fourth down and long gekkos attention is shifting to the quotron
in frustration bud blurts it out
standing bluestar airlines
the camera moves on him now sudden more intense in a sense trapping him
rings a bell somewhere

bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence
well hope to hear from you sir
he turns and heads out the door still shaken by the revelation he has made passing susan who hurries in with a dossier
gekko glances at it
as bud leaves he overhears off ok gang looks like were going over in teldar start the lawyers on a tender offer and d we keep going after everything in

their eyes briefly on lou mannheim in his private office sitting there slumped thinking smoking as he watches the quotron
nice guy but a loser

the camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the music theme rises to ensnare him
we end close on bud

he hangs up stunned still rises from his chair unbuttons his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket
got a little action there eh buddy
marv turns triumphant i just bagged the elephant
the upper west side
the young the rich and the restless parade along the avenue jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars
bud glides along feeling a part of the crowd now past a dreadlocked derelict swigging thunderbird and shouting obscenities shaking a wooden african spear
inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which bud stops everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas
bud orders a beer surveying the room like a veteran overhearing the conversation of a young trader to two other broker types
you know marty wyndham
he netted out of that merger
years old the guys rambo
got himself a porsche turbo cabriolet about thou got a house in westhampton penthouse on second avenue gets up at in the morning hes in the office at
guy never sleeps
he blathers on as bud surveys the room noticing an elegant blonde with a striking aloof beauty very much the debutante dream grace kelly type so refined that you wonder
what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone
bud summons his courage catches his breath makes his way over
she sees him approach obviously doesnt wish to talk eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer
can i buy you a drink
im celebrating tonight
disdainful please no thanks
looking away look i know you get approached a lot by dubious men but im different i never talk to strangers all my life ive been waiting for the right

its a romantic and tragic drink
i prefer mine with a twist of fate
you know like us meeting
dont go away
maybe just maybe shes his
his eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order
as he gets the bartenders attention he turns and sees that she is joined by a man who looks as if he stepped out of the pages of gq
together they walk away
stung bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door
what do you want
i just lost it
bud and a date hes obviously just picked up are struggling to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest new club in manhattan
bud easing forward along the ropes to a large bouncer who roughly pushes one of the bridge and tunnel kids back across the rope
joe discreetly shows him but they guy says no room
humiliating him in front of his date
the bouncer shoving bud aside as gordon gekko and kate his wife and entourage alex others are shown through the ropes into the door
bud says something to gordon but it gets lost in the confusion
people pouring into the subway on the way to work
bud rifles through the financial times hes just bought at the newsstand and finds the article he was looking for bluestar exonerated in crash
he thrusts his fist in the air victoriously
bounds down the subway stairs
buds on the quotron and the phone the words spread around the office hes landed gekko and brokers drop by his desk to get the lowdown
on the phone whats it at now
the man of the day
pour some water on him to cool him off

dark mahagony wood plush banquettes a long oak bar
bud enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well cut suits move around him and a maitre d
sniffs then leads him to where gekko is parked finishing up his lunch
a half finished plate is removed to make way for bud

gekko rising to leave the maitre d hovering around

nothing ruins my day more than losses

louis take care of im

confused bud watches gekko walk out of the room pumping extended hands left and right
he holds the cashiers check up to his eyes entranced by it like a kid with his first dollar
as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him
bud is at his computer when the door bell rings
hes not expecting a visitor
when he opens the door he is knocked for a loop
a smashing looking lady in a fitted chanel suit ropes of chains short tight skirt beautiful long legs is standing there
taking in the apartment she hides her distaste
hello bud im lisa a friend of gordons
in a daze lisa
would you uh like to come in
didnt he tell you
sighs thats so like gordon
get dressed were going out
a stretch limo is parked in front neighborhood winos inspecting it
the chauffeur opens the back door as lisa steps inside buddy in tow
the winos clap howling at her
bud in the back seat next to lisa gazes out the black tinted window as they drive away then turns to her as she gives him a bottle of champagne
so where are we going
wherever you like lutece the river cafe
or maybe we can just drive around for a while
provocatively work up an appetite
she crosses her legs
buds eyes moving south
he pops the cork
lisa does a little blow offers him
he shorts gordon tells me youre a very talented broker
what do you like
feeling the rush like
i got this guy who should know tells me buy hewlitt packard but i been burned on tips

his voice cracking up a quarter
about average yield
she unzips his fly
strong balance sheets good earnings per share
removing her blouse so youre hot on this stock
nods moaning its ready to take off
id jump all over it if i were you
as she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of buddy
buddy in an obviously new mort sills suit struts past carolyn at the reception desk in high spirits
smiles morning buddy you look happy
any better and id be guilty
picking up the flow you were never that innocent sugarpie
coyly how do you know
bud on the phone gazing at the ticker concern in his eyes
clicking of the tape ticker comes up over the music
he looks at marv
research reports piling up
buds secretary trying to get his attention
buds concern growing as the green fluorescent numbers spit across the board
clicker growing louder
pan to marvin hands cupped in prayer
to dan steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head
bud watching the tape dizzying hypnotic blur of numbers
the roar of the clicker drowning out the music
a runaway freight train
buds hands clamped over his eyes
the numbers stop
he opens his eyes looks down at his desk stacked with reports and phone messages as the pool secretary gina calls out
marvin glumly coasts over in his chair
boy we sure went down the toilet on that ugly bitch
if we were japs wed have to stay with our aircraft
calls out mr
gekkos office is after you
be at the wyatt club courts at six
bud looks worried at marvin
games in progress on the four courts heavy hitting sounds
crossing to gekko and bud going at it
bud is obviously the worse for wear
amused come on sport you gotta try harder i need some exercise for chrissake
out of breath mr
gekko i dont think i can
finish out the game bud push yourself
meant paternally or sadistically its hard to tell
gekko hits the ball a big fat shot
bud returns gekka moves him around the court as if punishing him the kid exhausted but the balls never quite out of reach till bud finally cant take it anymore
and at the end of his breath smashes into the wall and collapses
bud lying there like a sad dog as gekka hauls him up
the public is out there throwing darts at a board sport
i dont throw darts at a board
i only bet sure things
read sun tzus the art of war
every battle is won before it is ever fought
think about it
he exits the squash court
gekko and bud sit alone wreathed in steam
sweating nice club mr
not bad for a city college boy
bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps
i just got on the board of the zoological society cost me a million thats the thing with wasps they like animals but they cant stand people
easing into it uh mr
gekko we took a little loss today
we got stopped out on tarafly
gekko waits about thousand
gekkos expression is frightening but cool
i guess your fathers not a union representative on that company
laughs shocked what
how do you know about my father
the most valuable commodity i know of is information
wouldnt you agree on that
exhaling deeply yes
buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower drinking a coke
gekko towelling himself down getting dressed
naked man constantly stopping by to greet him
hi fred hi barry hows the wife
still living in larchmont
yeah still commuting
yever do anything with that aetna gas deal
fishing for information for a possible drink or meeting but gekko stonewalls them all
youre not as smart as i thought you were buddy boy listen hard dont count on graham and dodd to make you a fortune everybody in the market knows the
theory ever wonder why fund managers cant beat the s p
cause theyre sheep and the sheep get slaughtered
i been in the business since
most of these high paid mbas from harvard never make it
you need a system discipline good people no deal junkies no toreadores the deal flow burns most people out by
give me pshs poor smart and hungry
and no feelings
you dont win em all you dont love em all you keep on fighting and if you need a friend get a dog its trench warfare out there sport
eyeing the surroundings and in here too
i got twenty other brokers out there analyzing charts
i dont need another one
talk to you sometime
he turns to go bud panicking
is this the kissoff
with all his conviction im not just another broker mr
if you give me another chance ill prove it to you
ill go the extra yard for you
one more chance
gekko looks back a beat walks over to bud thrusts his towel hard at his stomach
you want one more chance
then stop sending me information and start getting me some
get dressed ill show you my charts
cruising up park avenue
a panel slides open next to the bar with a portable computer on it
a television is turned on to the evening news a low hum of voices
gekko punches into the keyboard of the computer
a name appears an the screen
lawrence wildman with curriculum vitae following address phones businesses
know the name
one of the first raiders
amused cold hatred sir larry wildman
like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in
bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me
wildman the white knight
excited i remember that deal
you were involved
gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the housing his eyes taking in the low volume news
revenge is a dish best served cold
well its payback time sport
looking out suddenly see that building
i bought into it ten years ago
it was my first real estate deal
i sold it a couple of years later and made an dollar profit
it was better than sex
at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world
drinks now its a days pay
i had a mole in wildmans employ
gave me half the picture then he got fired
i dont understand
wildmans in town
he just became an american citizen
something bigs about to go down
i want to know where he goes and who he sees
i want you sport to give me the missing half of the picture
shaken its not what i do
i could lose my license
if the sec found out i could go to jail
its inside information isnt it
scratches his head wryly inside information
oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline
or someone overhears me saying im gonna buy teldar paper
or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows its time to blow out xyz
you mean that
a piercing look im afraid sport unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company you and i are gonna have a hard time doing any
bud downs the rest of his drink upset by the darkening mood
theres something very powerful and frighteninq about gekko
what about hard work
what about it
you work hard
ill bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought
and whered it get you
my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies
and he dropped dead at with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house my mom ended up working in
a dish factory

a richly dressed executive stands at the curb next to the bum with a shopping cart filled with garbage
you really think the difference tween this guy and that guy is luck
mohammed pull over
the car pulls over
gekko checks his watch pulls out the telephone
when it comes to money sport everybodys of the same religion
or should be
hope you dont mind if i let you off here im late for a meeting
good bye nice knowing you
the chauffeur lets bud out the door
bud looks back at gekko
all right mr

his eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt
gekko smiles gazes at the twilight skyline a sudden look of contentment
yeah its a beautiful night
i love this hot stinkin city
pointing up park avenue nothing else like it in the world
seven million people living on each others heads kids born millionaires dying people praying junkies whores wills lawyers deals parties sex
guys like you sport dreaming about the big score
you know the best thing about new york is everything you can do here
and the worst thing is everything you cant do here
he shuts the door
bud watches as the limo drives off
bud in a suit waits next to a motorcycle across from one of the most desirable addresses in new york
the doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a lawyer type and a female executive
the man is sir lawrence wildman and his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the door and he slides
into the back seat of the limo
buddy astride marvs kawasaki hits the streets after him
the music through the following montage should suggest a chase brio
bud shooting past the trinity church structure
wildman gets out of his limo with his people strides into the lobby
bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in after them
not a second too late
bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with wildman and crew and a couple of other early birds as the doors close
bud eyeing wildman looks away as wildman looks back at him an edge of defiance to him why are you staring at me
not the worlds most likeable personality
the doors open and wildman and co
step out into the reception area of kahn seidelman
the doors close and buddy continues upward
the street now jammed with people hurrying to work
buddy paces the curb reacting when wildman walks out saying goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with his lawyer
formal french haute cuisine
power lunches in progress
as wildman is seated with several well dressed bankers at a good table bud tries to wrangle a table next to mr
wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking maitre d who shakes his head barely concealing his attitude towards buddys youth and general demeanor
buddy waits outside bored as wildman steps out shakes hands with the bankers
bud making an entry into his notebook like any good spy
music rising to triumphant proportions
aerial shot of limo emerging from the tunnel and onto the long island expressway
camera moves in picking up buddy on the kawasaki darting through lanes staying several car lengths behind
the limo winds its way along the perimeter road past commercial airliners
it takes the turnoff for butler aviation
buddy exits the ramp shortly after them
a corporate saberliner jet its engines running idles at the end of the taxiway
the limo pulls up along the tarmac next to it and wildman steps out walking past a mechanic to the stairs of the plane
a stewardess waits for him
bud watches wondering what to do as the plane taxies down the runway
he spots the flight mechanic and the answer comes to him
he starts running towards the mechanic
bud races up to the mechanic
oh shit dont tell me mr
wildman was on board that plane
the mechanic nods my boss is gonna kill me
i was supposed to give him this
holding his notebook you know where that plane is going
walking off erie pennsylvania
into phone proudly after spending the morning at kahn seidelman on the th floor the junk bond department where shane mora works he had lunch at la cirque with a
group of well dressed heavyset bean counters
gekko voice back the adjectives are redundant sport he later stopped off at morgan
id say from all the palm pressing and sweet smiling going on that larry got some nice fat financing
alex and susan are with him
gekko playing the computer eyes lighting up on the phone
bright but not bright enough sherlock roll the dice and play a little monopoly
what box would sir lawrence land on in erie pennsylvania
bud slapping his face realizing

bud silent an intent look on his face gazing up at the digital clock
as it flicks to
tickers squawk boxes and shouting erupt
bud calls in his order an stl
and let me know how the options are opening
music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion
a clerk hands the buy order to the floor manager
he starts writing a ticket as we pull back company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines
the floor manager gives the ticket to a runner a young man wearing worn sneakers who dashes off
we follow him across the scruffy exchange floor as he weaves through a crush of traders crammed around horseshoe shaped kiosks cathode ray tubes slung above them displaying the latest
prices in bright green letters and numbers
intermittent shrieks and howls calls to buy and sell issue from the far reaches of the labyrinthian room
as in the final leg of a relay race the runner hands the ticket off to a company trader who is buying and selling at the post where anacott steel
the trader checks the ticket and turns to the specialist executing the order
the camera moves up as the anacott steel an stl quote flashes across the broad tape as the price ticks up from to
bud paces nervously at his desk looking at his quotron
an stl appears on the screen now up to

an stl has climbed to
marv stalks by shouting on the phone
bud looks away from the ticker pretending to read a report
when marv disappears bud hastily calls in at
on the tired runner dodging through the crowd and over to the trader handing him a new ticket
close on the office ticker as anacott steel hits
buddy jumps up from his chair and animatedly crosses to marv who is on the phone cold calling
ehrlich ive got important financial news

bud presses down on the phone button cutting him off

marv looks at joe and sees a look on his face that hes never seen before
nervous anacott steel right

gekkos modern sante fe structure house sits on a dune overlooking the grey atlantic
sweeten the offer throw bucks more in a convertible preferred

immense slanted ceilings a vast clean modern space filled with dozens of contemporary art objects junk sculptures floor to ceiling windows radiating light that look out on a cantilevered deck
and pool and the ocean beyond
on the phone cromwell wants to play financial chicken with me well see who swerves first
where the hells gene
gekko slumps down on a sofa exhausted watching one of several news reports he master controls with a remote
on phone you sent him to vermont to get the deposition from the ceo cromwell fired
done and done
night gang and susan no legs waving in the air tonight
i want you dreaming about teldar paper
during this rudy gordons year old son drives in in the latest electronic baby toy a porsche bodied electric car

meanwhile the kid has no intention of going anywhere and plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of the fat lady in the opera
take him will you
handing the bawling writhing mass of anger to nicole as if it were laundry she doesnt want to touch
nicole takes him screaming out of the room
gordon trying to concentrate on the tv
papers and charts are strewn around trailing down to a box of take out pizza and empty beer bottles
bud has stayed late
almost apologetic speeding on the high of the buy
i got all i could get which was shares plus march calls
average price of a share and per contract for the call
i just wish i couldve got more
dont expect to get it all sport youll burn out
first rule of business is never get emotional about stock clouds the judgment
where do we stand
in response to an inquiry from the new york stock exchange management issued a terse no comment
wildman would not return phone calls
analysts believe the company is worth per share in a transaction
john and carmen are here and the livingstons are on their way
nods listening to phone ill be right there fix them a drink
shifting the figures we have
at this point were up
million and some change
if it goes to bucks we can clean close to mill

sighs cant it wait

bud waits sir awright
come out get the directions from natalie and hurry up
as he pulls up to an austere ultra sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a stretch of dune overlooking the atlantics angry surf
several jags state of the art jeeps and a rolls are drawn up outside
bud getting out of his faded honda goes up the stairs to the door
he rings several times
a black butler opens it and looks at buddy somewhat warily
laughter and voices are heard from inside
pretentiously high english accent can i help you
got some papers for mr
gekko to sign
wait a moment please
without thinking he closes the door in joes face
he stands there harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn
a small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing fireplace
the butler waves him in from the door
bud enters as gekko approaches
he seems annoyed to be disturbed at his country home
apologetic sorry mr
takes the papers allright
about to go when his wife kate gekko comes over
a pretty dark haired woman
bud fox my wife kate
they exchange pleasantries
you came from the city
with a look to gordon long drive have a drink
gekko doesnt seem to like the idea but
yeah why not bud boy
kates walking back inside to her guests as bud sidles over to gekko
if youd rather not mr
gekko i can leave
they cross to the main living room
its okay buddy you know alex
alex and his date shake hands faintly aloof this is stone livingston
and his wife muffie
a young stuffy banker in weekend corduroys looks at bud as if he obviously doesnt belong darien taylor sam ruspoli carmen winters dick brady
all old friends
bud looking wide eyed at the beautiful calvados blonde hes been dreaming of for weeks
shes with mr
gq and doesnt recognize bud nods back they all nod back naturally suspicious of the young outsider
rudys toy robot wheels around the floor with a drink on its tray talking computer talk
charmed by it good idea gordon good help is hard to find these days but can he whip up a dry vodka martini
well he doesnt talk back or steal the silver and dicks gonna get me an exemption on him arent you
dick brady is obviously an accountant bud plucks a glass of wine from the robots tray and plunks himself down on a sofa overhearing the conversation between muffie livingston and
there i am in st
kitts in my new kamali leopard skin v cut bikini which is going to turn back the clock on our marriage five years you know what i mean and i
cant even fit into it my skins all pink and inflamed and i look like a walking social disease all because this ukranian bitch botched the wax on my bikini line
revolted oh my god how ghastly you should sue her
the korean houseboy has come over to gekko
call for you sir
sir larry wildman he says its important
bud tightens so does the whole room hearing the name of the moment
gekko smiles at buddy
to houseboy make mr
livingston a martini would you nyung and this gentleman
to bud stick around this could be fun
he goes to the alcove to take the call
so i had to sit around the beach wearing a moo moo for days my whole vacation ruined
noticing as bud laughs chokes on the wine spilling some on the couch you just spilled your wine
bud noticing the stain starts wiping it
youre just making it worse
on phone larry what a surprise
beat can it wait till tomorrow
i got some people over
dryly if you feel that way larry come over
the blonde darien taylor is examining a modern sculpture as buddy comes over with two calvados
hello again i been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks
uncomprehending excuse me
a romantic and tragic drink
oh yes i remember you
destiny took us apart but i knew it would bring us back together
poet or philosopher
as in never have so few done so little for so much
so what do you see in this
bud indicates the painting in front of them a buffalo skull in the desert by georgia okeefe
id give anything to have this in my house even for a week
few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me
looks at him quizically well i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture
sale last june
chokes you could have a great beach house for that
sure you could in wildwood new jersey
if you sold this indicates a rothko hanging near the okeefe you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth
but you wouldnt have much left over for decoration
boy i thought gordon was a tough businessman but somebodys really taking him to the cleaners here
id say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around
he has a great eye and he only buys the best
like this rug for instance a silk tabriz the finest of its kind
the day after he bought it in london a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid
it absolutely makes the room
see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa
shes really warming up to her subject now i dont know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery too dingy
and its a sacrilege having that pre columbian pot in the center of the coffee table
some dope might use it as an ashtray
i gather youre a decorator
you got it a great spender of other peoples money
well if youre that good you could probably do wonders at my place
where is it
upper west side
losing interest fast oh really
home of the exposed brick wall and the shudders houseplant
oh its just a rental
im moving to the east side soon
ive got a couple of deals brewing with gordon
shifts uncomfortably with his pretension but thats just conversation
what about real things
the two of us
bud waits staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes
what if i have a previous engagement
i guess this must be destiny alright
my first yuppie apartment and
pats him on the cheek flirtatiously my first yuppie
gives her a steely glare you may call me a yuppie
its mister yuppie to you
they both laugh
gets serious so
see you friday
you really do believe in destiny
only if i want something bad enough
her date mr
gq sammy ruspoli intersects with kate
a cultivated european air
there you go again darien talking with strange men
thats our darien elusive reclusive exclusive
to sam you know bud right
he works for gordon
sam nodding makes conversation big smile sams in banking
you staying for dinner bud
hesitant eyes darien no im afraid ive got to get some work
kate noticing the doorbell ringing
sam muttering something in dariens ear of an intimate nature
she glides away with him
to bud call me next week ill give you an estimate
an ironic promise in her eyes
bud ecstatic inside
looks over goes to the foyer
sir larry wildman walks in his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagles face
with him a lawyer
strained larry how have you been
get you a drink
slightly impatient oh fine
nothing thank you
hes right here
as gordon intersects casually tasting a spot of the dinner
excuse me sir larry great to see you again youre looking good
sniffing the guests and furnishings in the room as if they were stale air leaving to gordon i guess ill head back
spontaneously stick around
larry one of my gang bud fox
bud nervously shakes hands sensing wildman might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator
there indeed is a moment but wildmans attention blurs as
shall we go upstairs
gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints he proudly picks up something from his gun collection
rarest pistol in the world larry a
only six were ever manufactured
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel
the same interest as yours larry
i thought itd be a good investment for my kid
this time im in for the long term
this is not a liquidation gordon
im going to turn it around
youre getting a free ride on my tail mate and with the dollars youre costing me to buy back the stock i could modernize the plant
im not the only one who pays here gordon
were talking about lives and jobs three and four generations of steel workers
a strong hint of the cockney working class east and london boy whiffing through his speech and manner
the mate is tough and to the point but not insulting
has to smile you must be wearing a mask youre laughing so hard behind it larry
lets cut the sir crap
correct me if im wrong but when you took cnx electronics you laid off workers jessmon fruit about that airline
cold deliberate i could break you mate in two pieces over my knees you know it i know it i could buy you six times ever i could dump the
stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares
im announcing a tender offer at tomorrow and im expecting your commitment
bud watching this drama unfold
gekko is about to blow controls it
showdowns bore me larry neither side wins
you can have the company in fact its gonna be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it
turns to bud what do you think is a fair price for our stock bud
bud in the spotlight
the eyes all shift to him his moment
after an initial panic hes cool as a cucumber and ruthless as his mentor
the break up value is higher
but we dont want to be greedy now so lets let him have it at
his eyes to wildman who looks at him cold icy mean
youre a two bit pirate and a green mailer gekko nothing more
not only would you sell your mother to make a deal youd send her cod
bud looking sharply as gekkos eyes flare with hot white anger
my mails the same color as yours larry
or it was till the queen started calling you sir
now excuse me before i lose my temper
he rises and exits
gekko stops at the door a beat
considering you brought my mother into it
youll hear from my lawyers
he walks out with the silent lawyer
past gekko who watches
to bud hes right
i had to sell
the key to the game is your capital reserves
you dont have enough you cant pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs
mimicking gordon now all warfare is based on deception
sun tzu says if your enemy is superior evade him if angry irritate him if equally matched fight
if not split and reevaluate
youre learning sport
exhausted from the drive back bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed closing his eyes
the phone rings
with a start he wakes and answers it
the sky is still dark the first rays of light coming up over the ocean
gekko a lonely figure in a windbreaker restlessly prowls the edge of the beach waves crashing around him
hes been up all night and has an exhausted driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone
money never sleeps pal
when i came in in they traded six hours a day now the clock dont stop londons deregulated the orient is hungrier than us
just let the money circle the world sport buying and selling and if youre smart it comes back paying

that euroflash gq guy shes going withs got big bucks but hes putting her feet to sleep
exit visas are imminent
so dont lose your place in line
gazing at the surf oh jeez i wish you could see this
the lights coming up over the water
ive never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment
suddenly fatigued an old russian proverb a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar
i like you sport i ever tell you that
gordon call me gordon from now on
yeah im gonna make you rich bud fox
im gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like darien
remember power is the best aphrodisiac
this is your wake up call
go to work
he lets the phone drop to his side staring glazed eyed at the ocean
a secretary leads bud into the plush private office of a cocky young lawyer roger barnes about tho same age as bud his his feet up on the desk sleepily
waving to buddy to park his ass
the pictures an his walls and desk indicate a rich family
fox bud d
is this deja vu or has it really been a year
youre not hitting me up for nyu are you

i hear youre moving up in the world
an associate already

equally casual looks at the walls whos listening
its just one college buddy talking to another
sarcastic yeah right
relax roger everybodys doing it but you dont know you dont know
and if i did whats in it for moi
he obviously has thought about it before
bud smiles back nonchalant
more money than you ever dreamed roger
and the thing is no one gets hurt
how bout a beer
some doubt too much to do
but ill walk you out
they walk out past the cleaning crews coming in for the evening drones of the vacuum cleaners
bud looks his pov
a cleaning woman as she pulls the vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices the desk crammed with proposals bud is lost in thought
teasing get inside my uncles door buddy all the secrets of the world are yours
the life blood of companies but you gotta go to law school first
bud comes out of the building and starts walking away
as he passes the freight entrance bud abruptly notices a van marked marsala maintenence company
he looks back thinks for a moment a look in his eyes
bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one
he steps into a shabby reception area
a chain smoking old lady looks up from the switch board
i need to speak to the owner about some business
the owner a greek with bushy mustache and hardened face sits at his desk eating lunch eyeing bud suspiciously
handing him a card mr
panos ive charted the growth of new office space in the city and i think youre in the right business at the right time
thank you for telling me what i already know
im impressed with your work and i could use a tax break
this is a growing business
are you interested in some working capital and a partner
panos puts down his sandwich measuring bud
what makes you think i need a partner
bud smiles ready with his spiel
an elevator opens
a body steps out
a set of keys
boom up past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with marsala maintenance written on it up to bud dressed in janitorial clothing
we move with him to the crew supervisor who introduces three cleaning women who nervously absorb bud worried for their jobs
bud strolls from office to office looking official overseeing his crew making notations on a checklist
bud slips into the senior partners office thumbs through a calendar on the desk
sees the list of people moves to the computer punches the clients name in
the code number comes up
bud nods to a security guard down the hall and enters the file room where he looks at the cleaning lady and points to his watch
as she exits he scrambles nervously through the files finds the code number then anxiously flips the pages to the critical tender offer document with the target name investment in
rorker electronics corp
its stamped draft across the page
his face lights up
the secret to the kingdom
he puts it back exits
gekko on the phone smiling
bud obviously exhausted from his day and night roles is telling him something on the phone
bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand carried copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too large
bud and alex gekkos assistant having lunch
alex gives him the briefcase hes carrying
pan from alex to bud back to discover darien in the next scene
bud dines with darien small talk intimate looks
bud is in an office eyes panning the shelves
can i help you
buds head jerks around
a young female paralegal is burning the midnight oil
she looks at him from behind a stack of briefs
backing off uh
gekko kate bud darien and a fifth person roar over the dunes each in their own dune buggy laughing and hollering at one another
buddy driving right up precariously close on darien who screams
buddy flips over his vehicle
comes up laughing
we sense he is getting wilder now
darien rides expertly
a beautiful immaculately groomed stallion is being shown to gekko by the trainer
bud is sipping wine as he looks on with kate
proudly got him at an auction in kentucky
fondling the head close to two million
bud whistles but this sucker can go all the way to devon and the nationals
darien rides in smiling to bud
he looks like seattle slew
what about the triple crown
hes not a racehorse bud hes a jumper
how would i know
i once bet a horse
he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five
he laughs a little sloppy
darien swims in the ocean long looping athletic strokes
theyre finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where kate and son rudy play
harold salt gekkos chief lawyer thick glasses smart eyes and bags of worry that could only come from watching other peoples money looks very city like in his clothing examining
his paperwork before passing it to bud who is the picture of relaxation
you understand mr
gekko is constantly barraged with nuisance litigation and irs audits
nods of course
so its in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us
passing a document with a nd pen this gives you limited power of attorney for mr
every trade you make is at your discretion
every ticket you buy must be marked power of attorney
that means you call the shots and mr
gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks youre buying
sign here and here
buddy looks then up to gekko who smiles casual
just the beginning sport just the begining
bud smiles signs
a worrier you understand if any problems arise youre out there on your own
the trail stops with you
alls fair in love and war
the art of which is deception
spread the buy orders through different accounts and you wont get burned
i think i got some friends that wont mind making some easy money
as kate drifts over with rudy and the french au pair girl rudy viens ici dit bonjour a monsieur bud
rudy either says no
or bonjour monsieur bud
depending on the mood of the kid
gordon sweeping him up and playing with him
the kid squeals with glee
proudly already speaks a little french kid got the highest score on his iq test
to darien its so tough to get into a good nursery school now
they even visit your home to make sure your paintings and furnishings are acceptable
whats it cost these days
just for the tuition
plus the books and supplies
with a look to gordon some parents even have bodyguards
its not a bad idea
picking up rudy now thats it for you with the grown ups young man
as rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists going
kate exasperated gives the child to nicole
nicole take him for a nap please
he doesnt nap anymore madame
stung then play with him till he gets tired
were going out tonight but we like to see him at lets see six give him a bath and put that cute little black suit on him
to bud and gordon black clothes are the newest things so chic and milk stains carrot juice stains just dont show up
kids boy can they take it out of you
nicoles oui madame is lost in the wrestling match she goes through to drag him out screaming
kate walking off
harold gives buddy another piece of paper
this is a contact at one of our banks
on settlement day youll open an account there for mr
gekko under the name of geneva roth holding corp
then youll wire transfer the money to this account in the cayman islands
rising finished with lunch think about incorporating yourself there bud harold will take care of it for you
with a look to harold at a reasonable fee
youre gonna make a lot of money now bud
stakes are gonna go up no mistakes
piece of cake gordon
the camera glides off some fishermen hauling their catch off their beached boat to darien who comes tromping out of the surf water glistening off her lean athletic body
bud stands before her cool seductive eyes holding out a towel
she steps up to him and smiles inscrutably
takes the towel from him drying herself instead
gazing at the beach if i could have anything
this would almost do
looks at her stifles his thought
teasing so how did your conference go with gordon
the conference oh yeah
we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us
laughs you have modest wants
i like that in a man
and what do you want
a turner a perfect canary diaiaond
a lear jet
the best of everything
well why stop at that
has to smile youre not trouble by any chance
she looks at him tosses the towel over her shoulder and starts back toward the house
buddy watches her go
the annual teldar paper stockholders meeting is in session stockholders are there many middle aged and older one bag lady
cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky executives none of them weighing less than pounds accountants and lawyers
gekko in contrast seems like robin hood seated with alex harold bud and the other stockholders
cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on gekko in a highly sarcastic gruff manner
your company ladies and gentlemen is under siege from gordon gekko
teldar paper is now leveraged to the hilt like some piss poor south american country
instead of using our cash to build plants build our business all this man really wants is to get paid to withdraw his tender offer and that will cost us
approximately another million in greenmail which will be passed on to the consumer
gekko seething jumps up
where do you get off speaking about me like that making remarks to the press i resent these remarks i demand the right to speak
sit down sir youre out of order havent you done enough damage to teldar as it is
have you no sense of decency
to shareholders how can your management
gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various catcalls let the man speak
sit down gekko
concentrate on long term growth when were busy fighting the get rich quick short term profit slot machine mentality of wall street when we should be fighting japan
the original fundamental reason for wall street was to capitalize american business underwrite new business build companies build america
the deal has now succeeded goods and services as americas gross national product and in the process we are undermining our foundation
this cancer is called greed
greed and speculation have replaced long term investment
corporations are being taken apart like erector sets without any consideration of the public good
i strongly recommend you to see through mr
gekkos shameless intention here to strip this company and severely penalize the stockholders
i strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for managements restructuring of the stock
gekko is now at floor level with a microphone
hes calmer makes his pitch to the stockholders looking up at the management
i appreciate the chance youre giving me mr
cromwell as the single largest stockholder in teldar to speak
gets some laughter and applause loosens on the way here today i saw a bumper sticker
it said life is a bitch
then you die
gets another laugh well ladies and gentlemen were not here to indulge in fantasies but in political and economic reality
america has become a second rate power
our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions
in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power there was accountability to the shareholders
the carnegies the mellons the man who built this industrial empire made sure of it because it was their money at stake
today management has no stake in the company
altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than and where does mr
cromwell put his million dollar salary
certainly not in teldar stock he owns less than
you own teldar paper the stockholders and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches golf and hunting trips corporate jets and golden parachutes
teldar paper has different vice presidents each earning over a year
i spent two months analyzing what these guys did and i still cant figure it out
a big laugh cromwell is pissed
this is an outrage gekko
youre full of shit
one thing i do know is this paper company lost million last year and id bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the
increased laughter hes getting them the new law of evolution in corporate america seems to be survival of the unfittest
well in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated
teldar paper is doomed to fail
its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked
its crown jewels are its trees the rest is dross
through wars depressions inflations and deterioration of paper money trees have always kept their value but teldar is chopping them all down
forests are perishable forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet and all the illusory maginot lines scorched earth tactics proxy fights poison pills etc
cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying teldar paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line ladies and gentlemen as you very
well know is the only way to stay strong is to create value thats why you buy stock to have it go up
if theres any other reason ive never hear it
laughter thats all im saying
its you people who own this company not them they work for you and theyve done a lousy job of it
get rid of them fast before you all get sick and die
i may be an opportunist but if these clowns did a better job id be out of work
in the last seven deals ive been in there were
million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of billion
when i bought the ixtlan corporation it was in the exact same position teldar is today i turned three of its companies private and i sold four others and each
of these companies liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered
i am not a destroyer of companies i am a liberator of them
the point is ladies and gentlemen greed is good
greed works greed is right
greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit
greed in all its forms greed for life money love knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed mark my words will save not only teldar paper but
that other malfunctioning corporation called the usa
much applause as he sits
now a standing ovation shouts of approval
cromwell knows he has lost the day tries to continue the meeting by calling for order
bud watches impressed
brokers mill at their desks quietly
bud enters notices immediately the uneasy silence
his eyes go to lynchs office
across the windows hes talking to a very somber dan steeples
whats going on
looking in the same direction lynch is giving him the boot
hes not pulling his quota
buds soft no matched by that second tighter look
his pov closer on the glass
dan steeples pleading for his job
we know the things hes saying weve heard them before
just one more chance mr
lynch shaking his head
reminding him were all just one trade away from humility buddy
dan steeples steps out of the office obviously close to tears but trying to maintain face
buddys eyes dart away not wanting to deal with it
dan steeples walks by his as lynch on the loudspeaker starts his morning announcements
new research report on gm and a conference call on defense stocks at my office at
no rsvp required just be there
and on an inspiring note im pleased to announce the new office record for a single months gross commission goes to bud fox
who more than doubled the old mark
way to go bud
come on up here
as dan rickey passes him during this bud catches a glimpse of the older mans eyes
dan tries to look brave
heads turning to bud with awe and envy
congrats buddy buddy you just made my life twice as hard around here
bud moving toward lynch past lou mannheim
youre on a roll kiddo
enjoy it while it lasts cause it never does
cocky just kickin ass and taking names mr
bud passes charlie cushing yawning on the phone as usual
so whaddaya say pal wanna play some doubles at piping
meet the membership
i got a little blonde named mandy about nineteen avec cafe au lait boobs
shes mine but shes got a cousin who has great muffins
sounds dubious chuck but piping rock any day
chuck laughs buds in now
lynch indicates for bud to follow him into an outer glass enclosed office
come in bud
neatly furnished with a window overlooking wall street and attractive chinese secretary filing papers into a cabinet
this is yours now
your own file cabinets
your private secretary janet under his breath significantly more attractive
nice to meet you mr
she smiles at bud who heaves a sigh of relief noticing his name plate on the desk
thrilled thank you janet
thank you mr
no thank you
i knew the minute i laid eyes on you you had what it takes bud
just keep it going
he winks and leaves
charlie cushing comes in marv sticks his head in the doorway a grudging smile
so its mister fox now
a splendid four room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking central park
sylvie drimmer anchored down with jewelry and a large fur purse shows bud around
everybody tells ya they hate the upper east side and they wanna live on the west side but honey when it comes to resale time believe me the east sides
the one that always moves
what do you get on the west side
contemptuously madonna and sean
between sly and billy and christie ive shown every apartment on the upper east side
everybody lives here
mick gloria and barbara wa wa
even klaus von bulow buys his fresh fruit from the korean on madison
its so expensive and its just like the ones on eighth avenue but its an attitude is all you pay for attitude pointing to a walk in closet two walk
upstairs on the roof you lot a health club
massage sauna jacuzzi sunlights best schools in the city cute boy like you gotta think of a ladyfriend when youre finished wolfing around course im taken oak strip floor
my husband can get you a mortgage
id do it myself if we werent into four other deals already
beat i got a four oclock and a five
one of thems an all cash type monique something or other
i guarantee you this place is history tomorrow
bud looks around
the city at his feet
lost in thought
sylvie has to call him out of it honey
the meters running
sylvie tries to play it cool her expression conveying a somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the response
i think you gotta deal honey
you sure you dont wanna see somethin i got on sutton place
its a million and a half but
this is it
looking it over proud
the music is geared to speed money triumph and just plain material fun
in its first stage darien supervising
its expanse of white walls devoid of mouldings a blank plaster canvas
the city views are great the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos
several young artists are working on a neo classical mural on the long side of the living room
they are colorfully dressed listening to a talking heads tape while they work
a carpenter who looks like a member of duran duran is installing a pair of old columns from urban archaeology on either side of the entrance to the living room
while another fits a brass sink into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar
living room furniture arrives
a fantail shrimp chaise from art furnitures sushi collection arrives along with an enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of
self bows on each end several faux etruscan pots wired up as lamps a poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from pompeii and a hand painted floor cloth instead of a rug for the bleached floor with the stencilled border
darien sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled branches amused by buds reactions to the furniture
the kitchen has the latest compact computer dishwasher and compact microwave garbage compactor and sinks with infrared controls
a brief food montage gives us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its preparation darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as bud uses a
stainless steel cape cod oyster opener to work on two dozen oysters
at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette mixer the phone ringing to the tune of mozarts jupiter
picking it up yes
convert the bonds right
and check the price in tokyo at la time
as he starts his pasta sauce flame an his oreilly fat free grill with a flexible neck fire starter
a freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space saving toaster as darien works the electric pasta maker while melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave
bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from verdis rigoletto as he works the piece de la resistance the automatic sushi maker
dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table
red wine pasta sushi
it looks perfect lit by candlelight the view of the city below
isnt it perfect
lets not even eat
lets just watch it and think about it
pause bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats is carried in followed by a jean michel basquiat featuring
a skull on a rough board
darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood art deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede last saturdays auction purchase for at either end of the titanic sofa
no vestige is left of the cookie cutter space we first saw
walls have been removed mouldings and architectural found objects added imitation rare woods marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp loeil crew
the point is decorating can transform
the look of the place is evocative of ancient times yet sumptuous
darien and bud sink into the bales of down in the sofa and are dwarfed
she rests her head on a hand stencilled velvet venetian throw pillow looking like a pre raphaelite madonna
a terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis graces the coffee table
as the sun sets over the canyons of highrises bud walks around his new home totally in awe
this apartment perfect in its restrained taste with all the correct flowers and objects has nothing to do with him
perhaps he can understand the state of the art kitchen the computerized telephone stereo and light system but he needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch
on david letterman
this apartment is dariens fantasy and bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it
most importantly to her it is ready to be photographed by house and garden
dubiously looking at a rough plaster wall of fading fresco you know the elevator man couldnt believe i paid to have my walls looking like this hes got them for
free in brooklyn
ill bet hes got an opinion on the stock market too
this apartment is already ahead of its time
i call it the demolished look
theyve already heard about it at house and garden and theyre coming next week to photograph it before it gets
is that alright
id love to have it in my portfolio
but your fee
considering youre way over budget should be negotiable
as he nuzzles her neck she feels threatened stops
lets get things straight bud
im not going to take a cut
i worked hard and you cant decorate a room in new york for less than
im kidding im kidding were still young darien
so whats money anyway when everybodys making it its all relative
after all this is not the house in connecticut this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years
before we slip our two lovely kids yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise
you got it all charted out dont you like a stock projection
thats right one with high yield rich assets and no downside
as the kiss grows his hands move into her nether regions
she looks at him sober
do you think youre ready
its not me im worried about
you know darien the only reason we havent slept together is because we both know we will and not knowing when was the only surprise left
you owe me i want you what else is there
but you me the world
he folds back her palms in his right here
make love to me
more kissing stop me if im going too far
ill let you know
bud making love to darien
camara closing on them
her face from his point of view
his face looking down
covered with sweat and passion
is this real
is this really real
bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet overlooking central park
the wind stirs his hair
the east and west sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light
bud stares down at the world
he has it all now
the magic palace apartment
what more is there
because bud suddenly throws a wrenching dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself
who am i
there is no ready answer
as he finally turns and goes back inside and closes the door
darien lies curled in the bed eyes open looking at him
come to bed bud
cocktail hour in the background yuppies trying to score for the weekend
bud on the phone strained look transforming to a bright upbeat personality as the phone is answered
its your lucky day
i want to give you some stock and you dont have to put up a penny
a small cabin in the mountains
whole earth furnishings
dixon a long haired ski bum dropout listens skeptically
sure and im never gonna die either is this one of your chain letter schemes or do i gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in northern arkansas
no no dixon my client wants to buy a large large block of stock and needs to spread it around
ill park some money in your account and if it hits you get a big cut
im telling you this is the easiest money you ever made
roger listens on the phone
off and you dont have to put up a dime roger
tentatively all right bud
lets do it
a look on his face
as if he knows hes making a fatal mistake
on the phone its easy jack
on settlement day you endorse a check to blue horseshoe trading company
then i send you your cut
marv waves across the glass partition and knocks
but bud waves him off closing the blinds
thats the bottom line
and nobody gets hurt
marv now walks it exasperated
things are so bad even the liars are complaining
and youre making money
so what gives
whats the bottom line
as he tries to peak at buds quotron screen but bud flicks it off pissed
hey im tired of playing nurse to you all the time alright
do your own home work
marvin abruptly walks out asshole
bud books the order for morning star corp msc june options
the company floor manager gets buds order hands a ticket to a runner who dashes off across the exchange floor and over to a trader who starts to execute the
close on the broad tape
as buds large buy order flickers across it msc june options
a clerk sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the exchange floor trading
he runs a check on a transaction
computer screen the same numbers and letters are seen that just flickered across the broad tape
the clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches up data
a man appears behind him leaning over his shoulder and wears an id badge
the clerk vacates his seat to the man with the badge who now takes over
bud is in silk boxers on the phone number crunching on the computer foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo while his telex spews out overnight currency data
darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading vogue
into the phone buy me june euro dollar cds
twenty march gold and sell september deutsch marks
he hangs up back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes
on the computer screen we see a break up of bluestar airlines its assets and liabilities
bud hits the command key printing it out
bud i hate to tell you this but youre a genius
to darien darien
lightning has struck
the lightbulb has been invented
edison da vinci einstein are watching
grumpy are you going to trade all night again
you got to go to work in a couple of hours
you think im gonna broker the rest of my life
im going to be a giant darien an entrepreneur in the italian th century sense of the word a mover shaker
bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way
i love you baby
did i tell you that sometime in the last hours
get in bed
yever hear of the sixty hour work week
youre turning into a yuppie frankenstein you love money so much
bud grabs a bottle of ferrier off the night table and drinks
sure why not moneys the sex of the s
i never had it like you when i was growing up baby it wasnt the upper east side
youre so naive bud you dont even know
your dad took care of you
i mightve been rich when i was a kid
but my father lost all his money
in the seventies in the stock market at the track
he was a lousy gambler
teasing that changes all my plans i thought you were loaded
laughs woefully so did i till i hit and found i had all the royal habits and no throne
mom got by but i had to go to work just like you
only the skills i had were shopping and making friends
thats why i do what i do what makes you tick buddy
the fear of being poor i guess just like you darien
but thats all gonna change sweetheart
im catching the express
making love to her and youre going along for the ride
a salon interior
gekko on a couch reading with eyeglasses a stack of financial reports
alex is on the phone susan and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip
bud is excited
bluestars an unpolished gem gordon right out of the garbage
a half assed management being decimated by a price war they cant win
but the gates at laguardia alone can bail us out its worth bucks a share if its worth a dime
theyre ripe to fall
gekko the poker player hasnt seen enough cards
mixed emotions buddy like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati
men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines fuel could go up unions are killers
yeah arent you forgetting something gordon rule one capital reserves
this company has million cash in an overfunded pension
that buys us a lot of credibility
gordon looks up interested and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker
interrupting on the phone gordon the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks
tell those spineless toads well self insure if they dont write it
you fire vice presidents and nothing changes
back to bud you eating twinkies today bud or are you schtupping some stewardess
deadly serious gordon what i want and i never asked you for anything is to be your co pilot on this
i want to take this airline turn it around and make it work
its gonna make us a fortune
to susan im talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline
its gonna take me two years and headaches to turn teldar paper around what do i need this dink airline for
im up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake
gordon i worked at bluestar i know my way around i have friends there
getting the drift what does that mean
playing out his ace the three unions
its of bluestars operating budget the hourly cost of a flight crew is an hour thats the real hidden value g
if you can negotiate that out get a crew down to an hour a run this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since texas air
what makes you think you can
i can talk to these people gordon they trust me
and my father can be a big help in getting cuts
susan get buckingham on the box
i want him to look at it
and tell jock taylor at thwick jensen
smiles wickedly back to bud so sport the falcon has heard the falconer
tell me more
bud in high gear all smiles expensive armani suit opens the door
his father stands before him looking like a man on his way to the dentist
dad well come on in
we couldnt start the show without you
wide eyed carl follows bud through the foyer taking in the furnishings paintings antiques
under his breath well ill be a lousy republican
overhears him i decorate for democrats too lots of them
she extends her hand and gives him a warm smile im darien taylor
sardonically i know
youre one of the art works that go with the apartment
softens a little pretty creative
doesnt look anything like the place my son bought a few months age
listen i hope youll come here often and under less formal circumstances
halfway won over carl enters the living room where darien has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza etc
the atmosphere is strained the camps separated
gekko stands by the bar conferring with his lawyer harold salt
darien walks over to the couch with drinks for the ixtax union reps duncan wilmore alpa leader a rugged silver haired uniformed pilot toni carpenter afa rep hard looking ish
dad you know duncan wilmore pilots union and toni carpenter flight attendants
i met them before you were born
they exchange nods
and id like to introduce you to mr
gekko and his lawyer mr
a pleasure to meet you mr
carl stares at gekko sizing him up
id be proud to have a son like bud
hes got a great future ahead of him
carl looks to his fellow union representatives then to gekko
gesturing at salt i thought this was an informal meeting
whats he doing here
dismissing him harold you dont mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times do you
looks at his watch of course
salt gathers his jacket to leave as gekko and carl eye one another tentatively
please help yourselves to some food
the food is half consumed
gekko addresses the union leaders
look i have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you
i was roasted the other night and a friend of mine asked why are we honoring this man have we run out of human beings
his joke breaks the ice they laugh except for carl
its not always the most popular guy who gets the job done
you got losses of to million dollars dividends cut to zero youre getting squeezed to death by the majors
present management may not be the worst scum of the earth but theyre the ones whove put you on a kamikaze course and pretty soon everybodys going to be scrambling
for the parachutes
only there arent enough to go around
management has them
if they throw bluestar into chapter which i think they will then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the
we hear a loud crunching sound as buds father bites into a roll glaring at gekko
pilot with all due respect mr
gekko whats to prevent you from doing the same thing
cause i have a way around all this a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again
what do you say we cut to the chase
im asking for a modest twenty percent across the board wage cut
carl drops his fork on the plate
gekko goes on
and seven more hours a month
toni carpenter and duncan wilmore exchange questionable looks
what kind of time frame are we talking about here
give me a year
if were still losing money the reductions stand
if however we move into the black i return part of the givebacks salaries go back to present levels and
a beat we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock
youll own part of the airline
carpenter and wilmore react with surprise its obvious they werent expecting the profit sharing part
bud smiles at darien and looks to his father who examines a sushi roll before putting it back
are you prepared to put that in writing
ill have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days
whats your marketing strategy
how do you plan to return us to profitability
why dont i give bud an opportunity to answer that
darien and carl turn to bud who puts down his wine glass
thank you mr
first of all i want you to know my door will always be open to you cause i know from my dad its you guys that keep bluestar flying
our computer software is weak we update it we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown
you dont sell a seat to a guy for when hes willing to pay
effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by to that translates to approximately to million dollars in revenues the point is we can beat the majors at
a price war
two advertising more more and aggressive attack the majors
three expand our hubs to atlanta north carolina and dallas reorganize all our feeder schedules think big guys were going after the majors
the men are visibly shaken by buds determination
looking for reactions cards are on the table
what do you think
restrained hopeful if you mean what you say i think were in the ball park
ill take it to my people
approvingly youve sketched some broad strokes
id like to see the fine print
but so far so good
gekko looks to carl fox who putting down knife and fork breaks his silence
i guess if a man lives long enough he gets to see everything
and i mean everything
what else do you have in your bag of tricks mr
bud tenses looking at his father
gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly
frankly carl i cant see giving much more
if you have any suggestions ill be glad to listen
there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know
smiling i beg your pardon
is that a proverb
smiling no its a prophecy
the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time
the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians didnt have unions
looking at wilmore and carpenter i know what this guy is about greed hes in and out for the buck and he dont take prisoners
he dont give a damn about northstar or us
now wait a minute dad
shrugs keeping his composure sure
whats worth doing is worth doing for money
its a bad bargain where nobody gains
and if this deal goes through we all gain
carl throws down his napkin rises from the chair looks at the others
looks at bud course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader
with those qualifications why should i doubt his ability to run an airline
there is frozen silence at the table
fine if you dont want us stay with the scum in present management dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground
that scum built this company up from one plane in thirty years they made something out of nothing and if thats a scum ill take one over a rat any
carl turns and leaves
bud glances at gekko reading his piercing look
he hurries after his father
bud catches up to carl waiting for the elevator hammering him
you did a great job of embarrassing me in there not to mention yourself
save the workers of the world unite speech for next time dad i heard it too much growing up
youre gonna get axed dad no two ways about it you and the whole airline are going down the tubes you hear me just like braniff you dont have a
chance in hell and if it isnt gekko its gonna be some other killer
carl steps into the elevator bud follows
hes got your prick in his back pocket son and youre standing naked in the display window of macys
hes using you
only youre too blind to see it
no what i see is a jealous old machinist who cant stand that his sons become more successful than himself
what you see son is a man who never measured success by the size of a mans wallet
thats because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim
lamentably boy if thats what you think i mustve really screwed up my job as a father
bud and carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury lobby
as far as being axed im still here and as long as i am i have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members i represent
pleading now your responsibility dad is to present the facts not your opinions to the men
youre gonna destroy their lives dad
dont do it to em
give it a chance
let the membership decide for themselves dad
ill be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning wanting to know whats going on im going to lie to them
all my life your men have been able to count on you
why is it that youve never been there for me
they head through the doors out onto the street
bud following carl
and what if youre wrong
what if one day the sun didnt rise in the east and birds didnt fly south in winter and for once in your life your compass was off
he grabs carl by the arm stopping him
would you be willing to wreck your mens future
be practical for a change
im asking you im fucking begging you
bud lets go of carls arm
carl looks at his son seeing the desperation
sadness and confusion take hold of him
i dont sleep with no whore and i dont wake up with no whore
thats how i live with myself buddy
i dont know how you do
a beat i hope im wrong ill let them decide for themselves that much i promise you
he walks away
bud watches him go knows he has won
bud increasingly frazzled and determined dark circles under his eyes paces with the phone
his secretary mr
dixon brandt on
wearily switching over whats up dixon
stopping focusing calm down
what are you talking about
dixon the rich mans son and ski bum is yelling on the other end of the line
this guy who said he was from the security exchange commission whatever the hell that is calls and wants to ask me about that stock i bought
nervous whatd you tell him
i told him i was in the bathroom and id call him right back
what the hell was i supposed to say buddy you got me into
look dixon calm down
its not illegal to buy stock or to be right
and its not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy
tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment
what if he asks where i got the money
tell em your father gave it to you
what if they call him
thats not their jurisdiction
read the constitution its all in there
and remember you dont know anything nothing
i dont know anything
then call him back
and call me back
he hangs up a worried expression marv entering to break his concentration
hey you hear the news
i just got a job at a new firm dewey cheat em and howe
icy didnt i tell you to knock before you came in here
hey the door was open
then get out and close it behind you
pause you know what you need buddy buddy an optorectomy
thats when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum to change that shitty attitude of yours
get the hell out
marv slams the door on his way
long shot of the towering stone structure
a tall angular figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder under his arm
the man flashes his id to a security guard who buzzes him through the gate
he walks towards us and we see he is the familiar tall baby faced investigator from the s
options watch office
he gets in an elevator
he walks into the office of a chief investigator
a balding sharp featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the large file in front of
bud enters preoccupied
barnes is nervous
so whats the problem
whispers got a strange call from the sec
they asked to see my records
bud this is a heavy
shrugs relax roget french pronunciation youre m in the account numbers and im the invisible man
theyre always looking for red flags gekkos always getting checked by them they never come up with anything
were invulnerable on this
i just wanna slow down bud
no more calls for awhile no lunches
we suspend our business alright
sure roger whatever you want its cool
a young lawyer pops his head in the room
rog come on bring the cost report
exits standing to bud gekko asked us into the bluestar deal
were reviewing the timetables wanna come
surprised he never told me
youre just the president of the company what do you know
as they walk out
smoky coffee cups and food
three lawyers two investment bankers three commercial bankers sleeves rolled up ties askew
a blackboard with bluestars assets diagrammed
a combat mood in the room
bud walking in feels vaguely worried something is not quite right
you guys know the new chief of bluestar
they nod vaguely respectful but buds obviously a figure head to them takes a seat off to the side
the bull like investment banker vietnam vet in shirt and suspenders is on the attack against the stuffier commercial bankers
look guys whats the problem lets for the kill
gekkos got and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now everybody on the street knows the stocks in play overlapping voice up since the open by next
week the streets gonna own bluestar and management wont be able to do anything but poison their own pill
why are you guys dicking around
is the bank financing in place or are we gonna have more and more meetings
our firms gonna guarantee of the total debt structure in long term junk bonds now you guys either sign this piece of paper right now or were gonna pull and
head for another bank for the
older man appeasing look we have banks ready to participate in a year revolving credit line but we have to have your assurance to pay back most of the loan
in the first months and the only way
intermittently interrupting banks isnt that wonderful
you got it no problem
insistent and the only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes
can you people guarantee that
bud freezes where he sits
it all comes crashing down in a milli second on that word liquidate shock now spreading on buds face
we already got the bleezburg brothers lined up to build condos where the hangars are we can lay off the planes with mexicana who are dumb enough to buy em
and texas air is drooling at my kneecaps to get the slots and the routes
whats the problem
passing a paper to the commercial banker this is the pricetag on the s the gates the hangars the routes we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters
bud sits there numbly a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter
the lawyers voices distorting in the background
course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund
gekko gets the million in there
fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for employees and he walks away with the rest
all in hell net to million
not bad for a months work
to bud your man did his homework fox youre gonna have the shortest executive career since the pope who got poisoned
now hell really start believing hes gekko the great
bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long white marble hall
natalie is on the phone
bud marches past her desk
yes he wants to change that appointment to
cupping the receiver bud you cant go in there
hes in a meeting
he ignores her and throws open gekkos door
gekko is talking with the lawyers and bankers from the bluestar deal as bud barges in
looks up i didnt know we had a meeting schedule for this morning
im sorry this cant wait
gekko stares at him with piercing eyes
will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes
the lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room
gekko waits for them to go turns back to bud
what the hell do you want
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar
gekko is taken by surprise
last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot
know what happened he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio
you told me you were going to turn bluestar around
not upside down
you used me
youre walking around blind without a cane sport
a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place
why do you need to wreck this company
because its wreckable
i took another look and i changed my mind
if these people lose their jobs nowhere to go
my father worked at bluestar for twenty four years
i gave em my word
hard its all about bucks kid the rest is conversation
loosening bud youre still going to be president
and when the time comes youll parachute out a rich man
with the money youre going to make your father wont have to work another day in his life
tell me gordon when does it all end
how many yachts can you waterski behind
how much is enough
buddy its not a question of enough
its a zero sum game sport
somebody wins and somebody loses
money itself isnt lost or made its simply transferred from one perception to another
that painting cost years ago
i could sell it today for
the illusion has become real
and the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it
capitalism at its finest
again how much is enough gordon
the richest one percent of this country owns half the countrys wealth trillion dollars
one third of that comes from hard work two thirds of it comes from inheritance interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do stock and
real estate speculation
ninety percent of the american people have little or no net worth
i create nothing i own
we make the rules buddy the news war peace famine upheaval the cost of a paper clip
picking one up we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it
crosses to bud youre not naive enough to think were living in a democracy are you buddy
its the free market
youre one of us now
take advantage of it
you got the killer instinct kid stick with me
i got things to teach you
as he puts his arm around bud leading him to the door
believe me buddy i was gonna discuss this with you at the right time
look why dont you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight
at the door confused drained i cant make it tonight
are you with me buddy
at the door a look of unmistakable power
i want you with me
waits im with you gordon
he walks out the door the misery he is in washing his brow
to natalie be another minute natalie
as he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a phone number
this is gordon gekko
a beat with controlled rage i want zip locked mouths on bluestar or im gonna personally come down there and rip out your fucking throats
bud walks out heading up the street absent amid the scurrying mid day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside
darien approaches carrying groceries enters the building
bud is slumped on the couch a spent bottle of tequila in front of him
outside the twilight is quickening into night shadows scurrying across the unlit room
for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette
darien opens the door and freezes surveying the living room
a broken vase on the carpet a curtain ripped off a window a painting upended a chair overturned selected but not frenzied damage
whats going on
she puts down the grocery bags frightened
ive been played like a grand piano by the master gekko the great
and today was the big crash
hes gonna carve bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off
darien registering this is picking up pieces of the broken vase
i was afraid something like this could happen
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped
i handed it to him on a silver platter
i told my father and those people
buddy its not your fault and its not your decision
evenly im not gonna let it happen darien
she stops lights a cigarette growing concern
dont cross gordon
hell crush you
youve worked hard to get where you are
if gordon doesnt buy bluestar someone else will and whos to say they wont do the same thing
at least i wouldnt be pulling the trigger
comes over tries to shake some sense into him
are you mad
why are you doing this
were so close the town is going to be ours
dont throw away your future bud
i can stay with the brokerage firm
and youre doing fine
we can survive without gordon gekko
pointed im not looking to just survive
ive been doing that all my life
getting the drift what the hells that supposed to mean
darien moves out from his approximate circle wrestling with what she wants to say
until she turns and says it
that if you make an enemy of gordon gekko i wont be there to stand by you
bud is stunned
you really mean that
lashing out whatd he promise you
to take you public
i guess without gordons money and seal of approval im not such a hot investment anymore
youre just the best money can buy darien
youre not exactly pure bud you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me
look in the mirror before
glaring at her im looking
and i sure dont like what i see
she collects her things and walks to the door
but its not that simple bud
when i was down and had nothing it was gordon who helped me
he got me all my clients you among them
snaps her fingers and he can take it away like that
a beat you may find out one day that when youve had money and lost it its worse than never having had it at all
bud steps across to her in a rage
step out that door im changing the locks
she opens the door saddened
you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you
i think we couldve made a good team
but thats how it goes
get the hell out
bud stares at the closed door mute numb totally devastated
the loss is not just darien it is total
he looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror
waiting for the elevator
darien also looks at herself a beat in the hall mirror
then she steels herself and enters the elevator
the same realtor sylvie drimmer who sold him the place is back
the phone is ringing unanswered
well the markets dead hon even the rich are bitching nothings moving except termites and cockroaches and with my commission being what it is
cutting her off save the rap just sell it fast
hes in his socks unshaven smoking he looks like hes been on a bender for the weekend
the phone stops ringing
he turns and walks into the bedroom slamming the door behind him
bud walks in a different more serious look in his eye purposeful
past carolyn and janet at the outer desk
they stop what theyre doing and look up at him surprised
where you been the last two days
ignoring the tone in her voice janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps urgent
he notices her face somethings wrong
your mom just called mr
sensing it what
he had a heart attack hon but hes okay hes at the hospital
runs out oh christ
bud weaving fast through traffic
bud races past the nurses desks and down the hallway
buds mother is outside with dominick amato and another neighbor just visiting bringing candies
lighting a cigarette mom
how is he
shaken he was complaining about chest pains at work
next thing i know he collapsed
oh buddy talk to him hes so stubborn
to bud dont worry hes got another years in him
hes a tough ol nut your dad
the blinds are drawn
his dad lies there tubes down his nose hooked up to an iv unit and monitors
bud comes over
carl glassy eyed significantly frailer nods to him
its obvious that more damage was done than bud expected
mom comes into the room with him stands there
sits smiles what was it
mom talked too much or was it her spaghetti
i mean pasta
mom bringing a handkerchief to her eyes i told you never to lift a by yourself
carl smiles weakly on pain killers
bud pulls out a cigarette
he fumbles with it before putting it away trying to keep a gruff tone between them
you even got me smoking now
second one dad youre pushing your luck i guess you know that
i guess you gotta pull through this one dad
for mom for me
i guess i never told you but
i love you dad i love you more than i ever
begins to weep i didnt mean those things i said to you
youre a hero all the way dad youre a rock
the words seem to come flowing out of bud as carls eyes fill with tears
and you were right about gekko
hes one son of a bitch
through and through
carl stares at him beginning to understand
hes gonna break up bluestar
carl reacts violently in his eyes but bud soothes him
in dead earnest trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning
but i gotta plan dad it can work i can save the airline i know you got no reason to believe me but i want you to trust me
i need to talk to the unions
can i speak for you
your words not mine
weakly you speak for me son
gekko and darien are seated together in the back row
darien looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement going on around her
it is the big spring impressionist sale and all the major players or their representatives are here
gekko is bidding
look over there sunshine
im up against richard feigen
he is on a roll electric
as the price mounts and surpasses the two million dollar mark gekko rises and walks down the side aisle to the front never taking his eyes away from the auctioneer
he stands agressively arms akimbo in a nose to nose confrontation
once twice three times
sold to mr
they walk the sunny streets a jubilant gekko savoring his triumph grabs dariens arm
what do you say we go get a suite at the carlyle
celebrate just like the old times sunshine
indignantly those days are over gordon
they were over a long time ago
condescendingly but paying little attention to the rebuff cant blame me for trying
you look as beautiful as that painting i just bought
he pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion
mockingly so whats the problem sunshine
you look like black thursday
bad case of puppy love
indignant its not puppy love gordon
anyway buddy and i are splitting up
off handed sorry to hear that
i thought the kid had staying power
its over you gordon
cooly you told him about us
no are you crazy
and i dont want him ever to know
do you understand
she moves closed and takes gordons hand
i want to ask you a big favor gordon
please drop the bluestar deal
stroking her face now tell me why would i want to do that
because i dont want to see him hurt
dont worry sunshine
bud and i had a little talk
we came to an understanding
takes her hand paternally i want you to go back to him
help keep his head straight
and i wont
come on we both like buddy
but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top
it doesnt fit
maybe it does
dont patronize me gordon
you and i are the same darien
were smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running love
a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows
youre really twisted gordon
youre incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you theres a poverty that every last dollar in the world wont fill
ooh ooh tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown up package
does this mean youre ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own
because darien if youre through with me youre through with everything im a part of
dariens eyes cloud over
the look of a scared child being banished by her father
but maybe just maybe gordon im good enough so i dont need you anymore
she walks away
bud is seated at a corner table with the bluestar union reps duncan wilmore alpa leader and toni carpenter afa rep also jointed by machinists dominick amato and charley dent
sitting in for his fathers union
the stocks at and its going up
gekko figures by breaking up bluestar its worth at least a share
that means hell buy up to or and still think hes making money
how do you know that the stock is going to go up
pointedly you really dont want to know any more than that mr
lets just say i have some friends
getting his drift okay
what happens then
when the stock hits you guys go to gekko and lower the boom
once he learns he has no union concession hes going to head for the hills
hell sell everything hes got
but whos going to buy then and whats to prevent another shark from coming along and devouring us
bud duncan wilmore toni carpenter dominick and charley an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment lobby
we have an appointment to see mr
lofty windows overlooking the park an impeccably decorated apartment with coffee and rolls laid out a young aide quietly moving around
bud and the others are on sofas around the imposing figure of wildman in a chair across
sir lawrence what would you say to owning bluestar airlines with union concessions at a share
and in the process hanging gordon gekko out in the wind to twist
sir lawrence leans back in his chair equably
i might be very interested but why
why you mate howd you get mixed up with gekko
he doesnt know the difference between raiding and insider trading
the sec does
i hope you do
lets just say mr
gekko and i have a conflict of interest
i want to see this airline work
pointing to the documents in front of wildman the figures here show it can
to the others and youre prepared to take these large salary cuts
but we want a contract agreement iron clad that if you buy it you cant break it up
hands behind his head im still listening
bud hurries in past marv on the phone with an irate customer
well if thats how you feel the hell with you too
and strong letter to follow
he slams the phone down
you dont have to agree with me marv but i think ive been a bit of a schmuck lately
beat waits off the cuff i agree
go thou and sin no more
i want to make it up to you
bluestar put all your clients in it
animated grabs the phone thanks buddy buddy im back
say buddy those optorectomies do work wonders
bud intersecting lou mannheim smoking a cigarette and having a hard time walking
put all your clients in it
davls looks gravely at bud
i dont know where you get your information son but i dont like it
the only reason im gonna do it is
i need the money thats the problem with money it makes you do things you dont want to do
bud hears him walks on
into phone miss bloom marvin
you got cancer in your portfolio but i got the cure
bud on the phone checking his quotron
listen i need a favor and its a quick scalp for you
two hundred thousand at can you position it in one of your equity funds
voicebox call waiting on
switches over hushed listen blue horseshoe loves bluestar airlines
immediately goes back to the other line
the reporter who bud anonymously called on the earlier anacott steel buy hangs up
he rises from his desk and crosses the busy news floor over to his editor
bluestars in play
a runner dashes up to the bluestar airlines post where a heated crowd is gathered amidst heavy trading
he elbows his way over to a trader handing him the ticket
the trader holds up the buy order screaming making frantic hand signals in search of a seller
faces in the crowd look up at the broad tape
bluestar bst the stock quote flashing across the broad tape upticking to
marv on the phone pitching eyes glued to the office tape as bst jumps to
i love it
i do love it so
the quotron now climbs to
into phone yeah
i see it at and i dont know what to make of it
he paces on the other end of the phone real anger showing now alex and susan seen in b
the words out
your union buddies are talking
get me in at a degree angle and i mean all the way in
slash and burn buy everything you can get up to
then call me
when i get the sonofabitch who leaked this im gonna kill him
im gonna tear his eyeballs out im gonna suck his skull
as he glances at his quotron the stock ticks up another th
all the brokers have jumped into the action avidly watching bluestars stock climb on the broad tape
bud sweeps into the room and looks up at the board as the stock hits
the stocks going to pluto
tell everyone to dump
marv nods and rushes away
bud crosses past mannheims office
get out of bluestar
in background marv is spreading the word brokers frantically grabbing phones calling clients to sell
gekko looks up from his quotron and shouts to his troops on the phones
who the hells out there
what are the arbs saying
its gotta be a big hitter
they dont know whats going on
everybody and his mother is buying
natalie enters the room flustered
gekko theres a whole bach of people from bluestar airlines outside demanding to see you
what the hell do they want
id be happy to tell you
as duncan toni carpenter dominick amato charley dent and several other assorted union members march into the room
gekko is taken by surprise but stays calm
we know what youre up to gekko and let me tell you this from here hits his heart you suck eggs mister over my dead body you aint gonna break
you guys must know something nobody else knows
if those are my plans its the first ive heard of it
would you care to put that in writing
id like to remind you we already have an agreement which i expect you to honor
well in that case i hope you have your pilots license
dont worry gekko we wouldnt let the engines fall out of the plane
regretfully but the reservations systems can get awfully screwed up if were not paying attention
and a lot of baggage headed to st
petersburg could easily find its way to pittsburgh
listen you clowns theres somebody else out there trying to buy your airline if you want to be pac manned and gobbled by atilla the hun be my guest
well take our chances

wildman is off the long island sound waters in his boat lighting a cigar
two beautiful women and an aide are with him

switches lines checking his quotron

buy it lightly on the way down
emphatically when it hits buy it all
wildmans broker takes the order with a curt got it and dashes out of the cubicle over to the bluestar post where a chaotic crowd is gathered traders frantically screaming
to sell bluestar shares
he looks at the big board sees an xtr drop to
when he raises his hand to buy he is mobbed
the big board
a series of snappy dissolves accompanied by lively music shows the stock price falling to
alex ollie susan on the phones
the arbs are getting killed
whered the buyers go
worried were being devoured gordon
harold salt walking on egg shells looks to gekko who sits with the phone receiver crooked to his neck
theres got to be a way out of this gordon

bud moves the phone away from his ear at gekkos cursing and signs the ticket
urgent gordon its two minutes to close

a long beat dump it
bud hangs up and rushes off with the ticket
the television is on to the big wall street story tonight is the roller coaster ride of bluestar airlines
fueled by takeover rumors the stock soared to an all time high of
then when contradictory rumors later surfaced that the takeover was unfounded buyers went running for cover and the stock plummeted on gigantic volume to as low as before closing at
camera discovers gekko sitting grimly watching the report
rudy seen riding his toy car in background
but then tonight amidst all the scuttlebutt another rumble shook a beat according to many sources raider sir lawrence wildman has stepped in and bought a substantial block of bluestar
and is going to announce a deal tomorrow at that includes the support of the unions
camera now tracks in close on gekko as he absorbs the unexpected blow
rudy yelling and squealing
gekko leans back putting the pieces together his eyes narrowing into burning slits
he smashes the glass cocktail table with a massive paperweight as kate hears it shocked
people rushing to work
bud crosses the street his face buried in the financial times
insert sir lawrence wildman satisfied bud folds the paper and heads into his office building
he walks past carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute
smile carolyn theres justice in the world
he passes the chinese stocklady
she sees him and manages to look away
marvin exchanges a look with him but cant bring himself to talk
the whole office seems silent the other brokers stealing glances
as he passes lou mannheim with charlie cushing who ignores bud
hows it going mr
got out of bluestar in time i hope
mannheim stops winds up
bud impatient but polite
with gruff affection bud i like you just remember something
man looks in the abyss theres nothing staring back at him
at that time a man finds his character and that is what keeps him out of the abyss
a beat looks deeply i think i understand what you mean mr
but not really
as on this increasingly strange morning he moves on past janet who wants to tell his something but he cuts her off
get my father will you janet
as bud walks in the camera glides to reveal the young sec investigator who has been tracking buddy going through his files
a second man patterson is standing behind the desk using the phone as a bored looking rd man and policeman stand off to the side with hieronymus lynch who gives
bud a withering glance
into phone he just came in
ill talk to you later
on bud a struck dumb look passing to resignation as if for a long time now he has been expecting this
i guess youre not here to open an mr fox im henry patterson from the postal inspection service
this is evan morrissey with the securities and exchange investigation office
presents his id and indicates man mr
ebanhopper from the us attorneys office
fox youre under arrest for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and for violating the insider traders sanction act
the handcuffs come out
activity is winding down a few sunbathers collecting their blankets
a solitary figure stands on a hill silhouetted by the sunset
a second figure appears on a footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man
gekko waits expressionless
bud approaches him
they stand facing each other
you sandbagged me on bluestar
smiles i guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson that you can make the tail wag the dog huh
bud looks away
gekkos smile fades
well let me cue you in the ice is melting under your feet sport
without warning he grabs buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face
you think you couldve gotten this far this fast with anybody else
you think you could be out there dicking somebody like darien
no youd be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock
i took you in
i opened doors for you
i showed you how the system works
gekko slapping him harder and harder buddy staggering with the blows saying nothing not defending himself
the value of information
how you get it
anacott steel brant resources transuniversal fulham oil
and this is how you pay back you cockroach
i gave you darien i gave you your manhood
i gave you everything
he backhands bud across the face
bud lies on the ground spent as is gordon breathing hard
bud gets to his knees blood streaming from his nose his suit muddied
passersby look on wondering
gekko seems to relent the rage going into hurt remorse
he hands bud a handkerchief
bud staunches the flow of blood from his nose
softly innocently you couldve been one of the great ones bud
i look at you and see myself
bud looks at gordon torn by mixed emotions the bonds they share and the betrayal wrought
shakes his head thoughtfully i dont know
my dad once told me money is something you need in case you dont die tomortow
i guess i realized im just bud fox
and as much as i wanted to be gordon gekko ill always be bud fox
he looks at gordon as if wanting to say more but doesnt
in long shot gordon stands alone as bud walks away
the doorman looks askance
bud mud splattered suit and bloody nose walks straight past him thru the door
several well heeled diners look up from their haute cuisine at the sight of bud making his way toward the mens room
tight on bud staring at his reflection in the mirror as he unbuttons his shirt revealing adhesive tape swathed across his chest
camera paces back as he winces when
morrissey and agostini the two investigators rip the tape off his chest retrieving a small tape recorder
morrissey of the s
rewinds the cassette
we hear gekkos voice being played back on the tape the mention of their deals
you did the right thing bud
bud looks searchingly in the mirror
faint clicking noise comes up over the shot
clicking of the broad tape grows louder
shots of lou mannheim lynch marv silently looking up at the green fluorescent print out
carl dressed in a suit and tie sits at the dining table finished breakfast plates in front of him refilling his coffee cup
mom clearing off the table anxious
as bud walks in wearing a suit and tie
he looks tired beaten the eyes lifeless in a dark mood
disapproving dont wear that tie buddy it
she cuts off on buds look
another cup of coffee
no thanks im nervous enough
checks his watch i guess its time to hit the road
yeah dont want to be late for my own funeral
driving towards the federal courtrooms in lower manhattan
busy traffic all around
supportively you told the truth you gave the money back
all things considered in this cockamamie world youre shooting par
you helped save the airline and the people at the airline are gonna remember you for it
if i was you id think about that bluestar job wildmans offered you
dad im going to jail and you know it
shaking his head sober maybe thats the price bud maybe so
its gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way thats the best thing that can happen to you
stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life create dont live off the buying and selling of others
you can do it bud once you set your mind to something i believe you can do anything in the world
bud stares ahead registering it
nods then got any friends gonna be there
as he pulls the car into the curb
the federal building in approaching pov looms large before them
looks around ironic like who
who really wants to know a convicted felon
i dont even like myself
carl knows something bud doesnt
darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance
bud seeing her suddenly stunned
his pov easing along the curb
so why dont you get out here and go in with your friend ill park the car
try to be cool okay
a last look with his father
bud getting out
crossing to darien
i figure a guy whos made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl whos made some of her own
bud looking at her moves closer longing and hope and happiness have returned to his dull eyes
and forgiveness the greatest of all
bud will never know about her past nor need he
the camera leaving them on a slanting circular crane lifting past the federal building to a panorama of wall street in all its icy magisterial splendor
and thus ends our tale
