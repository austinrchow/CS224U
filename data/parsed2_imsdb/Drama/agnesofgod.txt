whispering of nuns at prayer
nuns at prayer mother miriam the superior closes the gate and locks it
the nuns walking around the courtyard in an anticlockwise direction saying the rosary
a line of nuns kneeling at prayer
closeups of various individuals
a single shot of the building
sister marguerite is locking up for the night shutting doors turning off lights finally walks off down the corridor
suddenly a terrified scream is heard the voice of a young woman
lights in the windows flick on
the nuns are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps calling urgently in french
they reach the door of sister agnes room and try the door
it is blocked
pushing harder they see the blood stained figure of sister agnes
much alarm and crying
an ambulance comes tearing down the road siren blaring
it cuts the siren and stops outside the convent gates
the nuns open the gate and the ambulance drives inside
two paramedics urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the unconscious figure of sister agnes
the mother superior desperately wipes and kisses her face
im just going to put something here to stop the bleeding
excuse me sister
shell be fine
they lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall
the mother superior looks around worriedly and goes into
she kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and starts to pull them out
then she freezes makes the sign of the cross and starts to weep
an aerial shot of the great cross of montreal
superimposed over this are the words a normal busy day
a car pulls up with a woman and a man driving
the woman is martha livingston
she kisses the man larry gets out of the car runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of the courthouse
there a group of reporters there and a sudden bustle of interest
here they are now
martha watches intently as nuns the mother superior sister marguerite and sister agnes dressed in a white novices habit and their lawyer come out of the court escorted by police
the reporters leap on them taking photographs asking questions in english and french
suddenly sister agnes looks right at martha then she is quickly bustled past
martha goes on into the courthouse
inside eve lyon and justice leveau are sitting
martha is standing by the window smoking furiously
martha its you
what about roger
they want a woman
all you have to do is meet with her once or twice
then tell the court shes insane
are you dictating my position to me
were getting into some sticky legal territories here
martha all were saying is no one wants this to come to trial not the church not the crown
least of all me
eve she strangled a baby
nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison
were not telling you what to decide martha
were not even telling you to take this
is there any reason why you feel you shouldnt take it
martha pauses for a long moment at the window then turns
todays my birthday
i always make bad decisions on my birthday
the judge eve and lyon all chuckle
the judge throws the file down on his desk towards her
martha unlocks the door and comes in
she plays her answerphone and moves over to her cat
the answerphone whirs
hi its helen calling to tell you that mrs davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine oclock tomorrow okay
some whirs and clicks
hi martha its roger
can you call me at the hospital
id like your opinion on a case
oh bye the way happy birthday
hi marty its helen again
i cancelled your wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother
in french martha picks up a news paper with a photo of sister agnes on the front
martha pulls up in her bmw outside the convent walls and gets out cigarette in hand
a sign tangled over with creeper reads les petites soeurs de marie madeleine
martha jangles a bell
after a wait she presses a buzzer
a peephole in the door slams open and sister marguerite looks out
bonjour im doctor martha livingston i
the peephole slams shut but the door does open
sister marguerite glares at her
im doctor martha living
martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the trouble and hastily grinds it underfoot
sister marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt
martha awkwardly tries to kick it away
the court appointed psychiatrist
sister marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and motions for her to come in
i believe your mother superiors expecting me
martha and the sister walk up the drive to the convent
martha follows sister marguerite into a grilled waiting room
sister moves off leaving martha looking around curiously
then the mother miriam arrives from behind the grilled door sees martha sighs exasperatedly and enters giving martha a slight start
beaming at her own little joke doctor livingston i presume
im mother miriam ruth
you neednt call mother if you dont wish
shaking hands most people find it uncomfortable
carrying right on im afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age
you can call me sister
you must have tons of questions
you may smoke if you want to
just dont tell any of the sisters
martha sits mother miriam gets her a box of matches
mother miriam cont
they wouldnt understand especially sister marguerite
shed scare the pants off queen elizabeth
she lights marthas cigarette besides i miss them
you were a smoker
two packs a day
i can beat that
martha inclines her head impressed
mother miriam sits down next to her
mother miriam cont
well you have questions
checks her watch fire away
who knew about agnes pregnancy
how did she hide it from the other nuns
she undressed alone
she bathed alone
is that normal
how did she hide it during the day
indicating her habit she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
didnt she have any physical examinations in this time
were examined once a year
her pregnancy fell in between the doctors visits
who was the father
i havent a clue
what man had access to her
none as far as i know
was there a priest
yes but i
whats his name
father martineau but i dont see him as a candidate
could there have been anyone else
a pause obviously there was
and you didnt try to find out who
standing believe me ive done everything possible short of asking agnes
why havent you asked her
mother miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and brings it back to use as an ashtray
sitting again she cant even remember the birth
do you think shed admit to the conception
look someone gave her the baby
yes but that was some ten months ago
i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial
why do you think that
dont ask me those questions dear im not the patient
well im the doctor
im the one whos going to decide what is or is not important here
look doctor i dont know how to tell you this politely but i dont approve of you
not you personally
the science of psychiatry
i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible
she wont hold up under any sort of cross examination
also standing i am not with the inquisition
and i am not from the middle ages
i know what you are
i dont want that mind cut open
then mother miriam walks out
a little later martha is sitting alone smoking
sister anne enters and indicates that martha should follow her
they exit out of the grilled room and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs
faintly the voice of a single young woman can be heard singing in latin
martha follows sister anne down the hall towards the singing
they stop outside agnes room
martha looks to see
agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily looking out the window
then agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly
she turns to see martha standing in the doorway
im doctor livingston
ive been asked to talk to you
martha moves further in the room
an elderly nun hovers outside the door
you have a lovely voice
no i dont
i just heard you
that wasnt me
was it sister marguerite
agnes laughs and martha closes the door shutting out the old nun
youre very pretty agnes
no im not
hasnt anyone ever told you that before
lets talk about something else
what would you like to talk about
i dont know
may i sit down
they both sit
first thing that comes to your mind
but theres nothing to say about god
second thing that comes to your mind
have you ever loved anyone
well who in particular
i love you
a pause agnes have you ever loved another man
other than jesus christ
chuckles oh there are so many
well do you love
do you love father martineau
do you think he loves you
oh i know he does
hes told you
when i look into his eyes i can tell
youve been alone together
at least once a week
and you like that
where do you meet
obviously in the confessional
a slightly awkward pause
agnes do ever see father martineau outside the
agnes suddenly looks exasperated
you want to talk about the baby dont you
would you like to talk about it
i never saw any baby
i think they made it up
why should they
i dont know
do you remember the night they said it came
i was sick
how were you sick
something i ate
did it hurt
and what did you do
i went to my room
and what happened
i got sicker
and then what
i fell asleep
in the middle of all the pain
where did the baby come from
the baby they made up
from their heads
is that where they say it came from
no they say it came from the waste paper basket
whered it come from before that
before the waste paper basket
i dont understand
agnes how are babies born
dont you know
yes i do but i want you to
very agitated i dont understand what youre talking about
you want to talk about the baby
everybody wants to talk about the baby but
i never saw the baby so i cant talk about the baby because
i dont believe in the baby
then lets talk about something else
no im tired of talking ive been talking for weeks nobody believes me when i tell them anything
nobody listens to me
also standing agnes
opens the door no
no i dont want to answer any more questions
would you like to ask them
pausing in the doorway what do you mean
you ask and ill answer
the elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where martha and agnes are walking then pulls the curtain across
martha and agnes are walking together
martha is smoking
whats your real name
martha louise livingston
are you married
would you like to be
not at the moment no
do you have any children
would you like some
i cant have them any more
a pause ive stopped menstruating why do you smoke
does it bother you
smoking is an obsession with me
maybe one day ill become obsessed with something else then ill stop smoking
do you have any more questions
they both halt
where do you think babies come from
from their mothers and fathers of course
before that i
i dont know
well i think they come from
angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear
that makes good babies start to grow
and bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there and they start to grow grow till they come out down there
i dont know where good babies come out
and you cant tell the difference
except bad babies cry a lot
and they make their fathers go away
and their mothers get very ill
agnes sits down on a bench and martha follows her
mummy wasnt very happy when she died and i think she went to hell because every time i see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot
shower and i
im never sure if its her or the lady who tells me things
they fight over me all the time
staring into space the lady
i saw when i was ten
i was lying on the grass looking at the sun and the sun became a cloud and the cloud became a lady
and she told me she would talk to me
her feet began to bleed and i saw there
there were holes in her hands and in her side
and i tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky but i couldnt see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in
front of them
and she tells me things like like
right now shes crying marie
but i dont know what that means
martha stands up disturbed
agnes is slightly delirious with happiness
she uses me to sing its as if shes throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up and
i cant move because mommys holding my feet and all i can do is sing in her voice
its the ladys voice god loves you
and her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the bell tower
to martha god loves you
do you know a marie
why should i
i dont know
mother miriam is standing checking some papers when martha enters
mother miriam seems to have entirely regained her good humour
what do you think
is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre
or maybe shes perfectly sane and just a very good liar
whats your opinion
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns
laughs yes i
from other people
moving across the room i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth
because shes an innocent
shes a slate thats hasnt been touched except by god
lights a cigarette thats ridiculous
moves to her desk starts writing in her case it isnt
shes had very little schooling
her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us
shes never been out there doctor
shes never seen a movie or a television show
shes never even read a book
if shes so innocent how come she murdered a child
this is manslaughter not murder
she didnt consciously kill that baby
shed lost a lot of blood
she was unconscious by the time we got to her
so someone else could have done it
not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes
ive already told you what i thought
that she was unconscious yes
so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
you dont really believe something like that happened do you
its possible isnt it
one of the other nuns found out about the baby and
and wanted to avoid a scandal
mother miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and bangs it down in front of martha to act as an ashtray
that possibility never occurred to you
no one knew about agnes pregnancy
not even agnes
marthas car exits out of the convent and heads up the road
the car radio is playing light band music
you have been listening to mostly music from montreal
this is cbc radio
and again in french martha flicks the radio off and stops the car
she thinks for moment then
she turns the car around and heads back in the direction she came
martha drives in through an entrance and pulls up outside the presbytery
from inside the house martha can be seen knocking on the glass fronted door
presently a huge fat housekeeper answers
is father martineau in please
in french answers in french the housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back inside
halting briefly wipe your feet
they move into the next room
the housekeeper goes further calling
in french martha stands uncertainly at the doorway
the sound of thumping is heard and then the figure of a very old priest father martineau appears walking with a stick
father martineau and martha are having tea
he pours a slug of whisky from a flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his own
french accent they arise at five in the morning
and theyre in bed by nine at night
even if a man could get to them he would probably find them praying
thats why i see that the real question is not only how he got in but when
and youre the only man to see them
i promise you doctor even if i had the inclination how could i possibly catch her
she would have to be a very slow and patient nun
they both laugh ah no
theyre a very special and rare people those sisters
only a few of them left in this modern world consecrated to the praise of god
an elderly woman is sitting watching spiderman on tv cackling with laughter
she is physically alright but quite senile
martha enters goes over to her and kisses her
hello mama pulls up a chair brought you something
shut up im trying to watch this
its your favourite
who are you
its martha mama
hands over a tub of icecream there you go
marie brings me icecream too you know
i thought cherry vanilla was your favourite
not any more
now i like chocolate
stroking her hair did you have a good week mama
are they treating you all right
you know martha never comes to see me
you watch it shes going straight to hell
after all the things she said to me
then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman
has an abortion
i knew that one wouldnt work out
not like you marie
you got married to god
lighting up maries dead mama
i remember when you was a little girl marie
you come back from the movies and youd say mama that ending was so sad
and id tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood
chuckles and you believed me
mama that wasnt marie that was me
a long pause who are you
im martha mama
it is raining
distant thunder in the background
martha is standing under an umbrella talking to sister anne who is feeding the chickens
the convent was built for over fifty
not many of us left
just us and the chickens
how do you survive
oh we own the land around here
but we rent it out
we keep a few acres for ourselves indicating some wheat corn some vegetables
well thats a lot of land
you must have help
do you have field hands that help you
we work the land alone
no one but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public
sister anne which was agnes room
sister anne points up to a window on the corner of the convent
oh that one there in the corner
the one up on the third floor
mother miriam unlocks a padlock on the door opens it for martha
they both enter the room which is totally plain stripped of everything
this convent is locked solid
the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldnt let christ in after dark
well its been known to happen in the day too
maybe agnes went to him
oh come on youve talked to her
she doesnt even know how babies are born let alone made
when did you first learn about her
innocence the way she thinks
shortly after she came to us
and you werent shocked
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened
she stopped eating completely
in flashback agnes all in white is lying face down in the sign of the cross in front of the altar
mother miriam enters
this was before her pregnancy
about two years before
mother miriam stops in front of agnes
agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating
why is this
not looking up ive been commanded by god
sighs he talked to you himself
through someone else
i cant say
shed punish me
one of the other sisters
mother miriam glances up at an older nun who has been in the chapel watching all along
she takes the hint and hobbles out
mother miriam cont
why would she tell you to do this
agnes look at me
looking up because im getting fat
oh for heavens sake
i am theres too much flesh on me
im a blimp
why does it matter whether youre fat or not
you neednt worry about being attractive here
i do i have to be attractive to god
he loves you the way you are
no he doesnt
he hates fat people
who told you this
its a sin to be fat
look at the statues theyre thin
thats because theyre suffering
suffering is beautiful i want to be beautiful
who tells you these things
christ said it in the bible he said suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child
genuinely distressed thats not what he meant
i am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon i
i wont be able to fit in i
i wont be able to squeeze into heaven
agnes dear heaven is not a place where
agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts
i mean look at these
ive got to lose weight im a blimp
oh my dear child
standing god blew up the hindenburg
hell blow me up thats what she said
mommy ill get bigger and bigger every day and then ill pop but
but if i stay little it wont happen
your mother tells you this
agnes your mother is dead
but she watches
nonsense im your mother now and i want you to eat
im not hungry
youve got to eat something agnes
no i dont
the host is enough
my dear i dont think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything
smiles yes of god
then mother miriam looks down and is shocked to see agnes white habit is spotted with blood and more blood is dripping onto the floor
she pulls out agnes hand from her habit and gasps with shock there is a bleeding hole in the middle of her palm
im being punished
i dont know
she quickly leads agnes out of the chapel
it started this morning and i cant get it to stop
back in the present as before
why didnt you take her to a doctor
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
she had a
a hole in the palm of her hand
she could have bled to death
but she didnt
if anyone had seen what id seen shed be public property
newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule
she doesnt deserve that
she has it now
i know what youre thinking shes a hysteric pure and simple
not simple no
i saw it
clean through the palm of her hand
do you think hysteria could do that
its being doing it for centuries
shes not unique shes just another victim
thats her innocence
she belongs to god
and i intend to take her away from him
thats what youre afraid of isnt it
martha walks out
mother miriam yanks the padlock out of the door
you bet i am
all the sisters are present
mother miriam leads the chant in latin and the rest of the nuns respond at intervals
agnes is very happy
their singing continues over until the end of scene
martha and larry are at the top of steps
he hands her an envelope
here you are
dont let anyone know where you got them
kissing him thanks
agnes is happily swinging on a long swing attached to a tree
the sisters go about their tasks
then all together they move to a corner of the room which is laid out with burning candles and make their devotions
agnes is confessing to a rather disinterested father martineau
last tuesday i didnt eat all of my lima beans
hid them under my spoon
very quietly i thought
speak up i can hardly hear you
very loudly i thought ugly thoughts about sister marguerite
martha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of the sheets and the waste paper basket
she puts the photos aside and puffs thoughtfully on a cigarette
agnes is milking the cow
she pours the milk into a large churn
the singing finishes at this point
the same four are in a meeting
this time they are all sitting except for lyon who is standing by the window
would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here
martha your job is to diagnose not to heal and play detective
who do you think you are
i know my job
dont tell me my job lyon
my duty as a doctor is to
martha you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law
no excuse me eve
as quickly as i see fit
the longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us
the bishop is breathing down our necks
and the sooner she goes to prison the better off shell be
in french i dont believe this
i dont bloody believe this
well the bishop will be very upset about this
im fighting for this womans life not some bloody bishop
it is a strange place all the crosses are identical and very simple
martha is standing
agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked with the name soeur marie paul and the dates she was born consecrated and died
agnes places some winter flowers on the grave
you liked sister paul
she was kind to me
she told me i was beautiful
crouching down what else did she tell you
she said all of gods angels would want to sleep beside me if they could
i liked that
agnes makes the sign of the cross they both stand and start to move off
she lived here for almost seventy years
every day shed ring the bell wake us up call us to god
she took me to my secret place
i promise i wont tell would you take me
so agnes takes her
martha and agnes enter the bell tower
agnes leads the way up the steep wooden steps
martha becomes breathless almost immediately
sister paul was in her eighties
did she climb up here often
no only when she felt like it
she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
halting out of breath no wonder
agnes how do you feel about babies
oh they frighten me im afraid ill drop them
they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid
i was dropped on my head thats why i dont understand things
climbing again numbers
you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
following her i dont understand them either
do you suppose i was dropped on my head
i hope not
its a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
oh ive got to give up smoking
agnes wait a minute
agnes slow down
agnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform
she said you could see the whole world from up here
but it looks much better far away than it looks close up
martha arrives exhausted
agnes lies down under the bell
and sometimes i get under here
it makes a wonderful sound
she starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings in the bell
what happens if the bell rings and youre under there
oh its even more wonderful then
agnes sings a little more
its like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl
where did you go
oh no place as wonderful as this
have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else
there is nothing else
just being here at night helps me sleep
you have trouble sleeping
i get headaches
mommy did too
oh but she wasnt stupid
she knew things that nobody else knew
she knew what was going to happen to me
thats why she hid me away
how did she know that
somebody told her
i dont know
i promise i wont laugh
who told her
an angel when she was having one of her headaches
did your mother see angels often
do you believe she really saw them
sitting up no but i can never tell her that
no answer mmm
shed get angry
martha moves round close to agnes
agnes did you love your mother
did you ever want to be a mother yourself
i could never be a mother
well i dont think im old enough and besides i dont want to have a baby
because i dont want one
if you did want one howd you go about getting one
from someone who didnt want to have a baby
suddenly frustrated no not like me
how would that person get one if they didnt want one
jumping to her feet a mistake
agnes how did your mother get you
it was a mistake
is that what she said
very upset if youre trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didnt want me but thats not true she was a
good woman a saint
distorted agnes i dont believe you know nothing about sex
i cant help it if im stupid
that you dont remember getting pregnant
not my fault
and that you dont believe you carried a child
i was a mistake
what the child
i dont have children
martha puts her arm out to agnes who slaps it away
dont touch me like that
you dont touch me like that i know what you want from me you want to take god away
you should be ashamed they should lock you up people like you
agnes disappears down through the trapdoor
martha throws her cigarette away
mother miriam is comforting a tearful agnes
she sees martha coming across the courtyard and pushes agnes gently away
you hate us dont you
you hate nuns
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
i havent said anything against the the catholic church
catholicism is not on trial here
i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else
how dare you tell me to run my affairs
mother miriam starts to walk away martha angrily follows her
its my affair too
how dare you think im in a position to be pressured
im only interested
or bullied or what ever youre doing
who the hell do you think you are
you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child
martha and mother miriam are climbing the stairs
they pause briefly
she is not a child
and she has a right to know that theres a world out there filled with people who dont believe in god
mother miriams walks on and arent any worse off than you mother
people whove gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody
and people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy
she has a right to know that
but you and your
your order and your church have kept her ignorant
they reach mother miriams study
distorted distorted virginity right mother
poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by
i am not a virgin doctor
i was married for twenty three years two daughters
i even have grandchildren
it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother
my children wont even see me any more thats their revenge
i think they tell their friends that ive passed on
and dont tell me im making up for past mistakes doctor freud
she sits then help her
no youre shielding her
let her face the world
what good would it do
no matter what you decide its either the
the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin
theres another choice
i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court
a long pause
the tension between them dissolves
all right what do you need
martha holds her hand
same place but a little later
martha is smoking
when would agnes have conceived the child
oh some time in january
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time
visitors to the convent
do you have a
a diary or a day book
take at look at it
mother miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book
theres nothing here
was the child full term
reads through the book oh dear god
what is it
oh dear god i should have guessed
in flashback the sisters are sitting around the table at dinner
sister genevieve the other novice is serving them
mother miriam folds up a linen towel
i should have suspected something
in flashback mother miriam addresses agnes
sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister
is that true
in the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins
sister marguerite gives a snort of derision
mother miriam glances sharply at her then turns back to agnes
were not in the middle ages sister
it made them holy
it made them uncomfortable
and if they didnt sleep well im certain the next day they were cranky as mules
sister where are your sheets
no answer do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin
then tell me
where are your sheets
i burnt them
a long pause they were stained
how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed
agnes and genevieve it is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of
the two girls start to repeat it but agnes starts to cry and genevieve falters into silence
mother miriam goes on more kindly
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children
not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility
its not that
its not that
what do you mean
its not my time of month
should you see a doctor
i dont know
i dont know what happened mother i woke up
there was blood on the sheets but i dont know what happened
starts to weep i dont know what i did wrong i dont know and i should be punished
i dont know
i dont know
that was the beginning the night of the conception
thats why she burnt the sheets
still in flashback mother miriam enters the room where paul lies dying
father martineau is there and many of the other nuns singing hymns
when was that
the twenty third of january
on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
i dont remember where agnes was
i was needed in the sick room
father martineau annoints the old woman
then agnes quietly slips in unobserved
sister paul rallies for a moment tries to say a single silent word to her
the smile slips from agnes face
then sister paul lies back and dies
martha and the monsignor are walking through the church talking
he is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner
beginning missed no
well youre probably right about that
it certainly cant help sister agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time
why do you call it an investigation
i never have
your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her
what does this have to do with
and you had a sister who died in the convent
who told you this
do you still go to church
what business is it of yours
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
look father ah
just because i dont subscribe to the

but it does make all the difference to agnes
i dont understand

well somones got to suffer for this doctor
youve got to be merciful and quick
martha stares at him as he walks away
a single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower
the bell is ringing
mother miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a considerable effort
agnes has a wheelbarrow full of straw and manure
she dumps it on a pile
martha is watching agnes milking a cow
agnes im here because i want to help you
im not sick
but youre troubled
thats because you keep reminding me
if you go away then ill forget
and youre unhappy
everyones unhappy youre unhappy arent you
you never answer me
only you think youre lucky because you didnt have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe werent always nice but that was because
of me because i was bad not her
agnes carries the milk pail round to the churn
what did you do
im always bad
what did you do
agnes falls to her knees
martha moves round and kneels in front of her
what did your mother do to you

she makes fun of me
she tells you youre ugly

that youre a mistake
she says my whole bodys a mistake
because she says if i dont watch out ill have a baby

agnes is half shouting half crying
martha holds on to her
oh agnes oh agnes its alright its alright its alright its alright i love you
do you really love me or are you just saying that
i really love you
as much as mother miriam does
as much as god loves you
martha is in there by herself smoking
the elderly nun appears at the door
ive been watching
we were fine till she came
she brought the devil here
makes the sign of the cross there was blood on her hand that night
the nun shakes her head who
in french what
look into the convent records
but the nun has gone walking quickly away down the corridor
enters to find martha going through a cabinet
slightly guiltily oh good afternoon sister i
im looking for some biographical data on sister agnes and mother said i might find it here
the sister smiles goes to another cabinet extracts a file and hands it to her
the sister nods and without a word leaves the room
martha waits until she has gone then opens the cabinet and pulls out another file
glancing at the door she compares the two files
they both have the same surname burchetti
the the door opens and mother miriam is standing there
you lied to me about what
brandishing the files your niece
i didnt tell you because i didnt think it was important
no it just makes you doubly responsible doesnt it
i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent
my sister ran away from home
we lost touch with her
and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened
and agnes father
mother miriam turns out of the room
martha goes after her
it could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me
continuing just outside the record room
mother miriam cont
she was afraid that agnes would follow in her footsteps
she did everything she could to prevent it
like keeping her home from school
listening to angels
she drank too much
thats what killed her
do you know what she did to her
i dont think i care to know
she molested her
oh dear god
there is more here than meets the eye isnt there
lots of dirty little secrets
crying oh god if only id known
why didnt you
you knew she was keeping her home from school
you knew she was an alcoholic
i knew that after the fact
why didnt you do anything to stop her
because i didnt know
she leaves oh god
larry is interviewing a young prostitute in french
martha appears at the door
marty what are you doing here
larry theres got to be something missing
i gave you the pictures marty what else do you want
that they overlooked
you think that the girl is innocent
i dont know
you got to be crazy
larry pulls out a pack of cigarettes gives one to martha and to the prostitute
whats the matter with you youve seen the reports
its a cut and dried case
maybe theres something thats not in the report that should be
youre too involved marty
lights her cigarette jesus look at you
why dont you turn this case over to someone else
larry lights his own cigarette and comes over to martha
ill ask around see what i come up with
in the meantime you go home and get some sleep
she leaves calling after her if i find anything ill call you
martha takes off her coat moves across the room turning on lights
she flicks the answerphone on
her cat meows
hi marty its helen
mrs davenport called and was very upset that youd missed her appointment
she wants you to call her at home oh and a couple of reporters have been trying to get a hold of you about sister agnes
they seem persistent and they may try to reach you at home
i didnt give them number
some whirs and beeps
martha goes into the bathroom
french accent hallo doctor livingston
my name is
im doing a sunday article on sister agnes for the gazette
i would appreciate it if you would give me a phone call on
more beeps and whirs
martha starts to undress
hi marty its me
listen i just talked with detective crawley who was at the convent
she said that there was one thing that bothered her that didnt make it into the report
the waste paper basket
the one in agnes room
martha freezes in the middle of lighting up none of the other nuns had one
martha rushes over to the answerphone and rewinds it
her that didnt make it into the report
the waste paper basket
the one in agnes room
none of the other nuns had one
martha looks thoughtful and flicks off the desk lamp
father martineau is saying mass
all the sisters are there singing together
father martineau places the host in the sconce incences it and raises it up
close on individual nuns at prayer including agnes
mother miriam is kneeling in the doorway of the barn praying when martha enters
mother miriam pauses
ive gotten the courts permission to hypnotise her
mother miriam makes the sign of the cross and stands up
and my permission
id like yours too
mother miriam grabs a bucket and moves across the barn
martha follows her
well see about that
dont deny it
i havent decided yet
the womans health is at stake
her spiritual health
i dont give a damn about her spiritual health
i know you dont
mother miriam starts shovelling grain into the bucket
sentence her and be done with it thats what youre saying and i
i am saying distorted a beautifully simple woman
an unhappy woman
shes happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh
why didnt you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it
because i am a moral person
catholic church doesnt have a corner on morality
who said anything about the catholic church
you just said
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you
what have we done to hurt you
and dont deny it i can smell an ex catholic a mile away
what did we do
burn a few heretics sell some indulgences
that was in the days when the church was a ruling body
we let governments do those things today
so what did we do to you eh
you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldnt because it was a sin
this time it is martha who walks away and mother miriam who follows her
mother miriam cont
so instead of questioning that one rule
halting it wasnt sex
it was a lot of things but it wasnt sex
you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said
she died because she hadnt said her morning prayers
and thats all
she was a beautiful little girl
and what has that to do with it
she was the pretty one
she died why not me
i never said my morning prayers
and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me
so you left the church because you had freckles
no because i
yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles
they both cannot help laughing at this absurdity
a couple of nuns walk across the courtyard
another is meditating alone
on a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away
it is out the back of the convent near the belltower
mother miriam and martha are sitting there talking
martha is smoking
when i was a child i used to hear my guardian angel
she sang to me till i was six years old
thats when i stopped listening
but i remember the voice
a few years ago i looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing
not even of heaven
not even of god
and then one evening i saw agnes standing by her window singing
and all my doubts about myself and god were gone in that one moment
i recognized the voice
please dont take it away from me again doctor livingston
those years after six were very bleak
my sister died in a convent
and its her voice i hear
a long pause does my smoking bother you
no it reminds me
would you like one
id love one
martha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her
mother miriam coughs a lot
martha pats her on the back
im out of prac
cough all right
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then
not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more
chuckles long thin and filtered
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet
they roar with laughter and of course distorted hand rolled
even christ would partake socially
imitating oh youve come a long way baby
and saint john would chew tobacco
more laughter then the moment because more serious
a pause what do you suppose todays saints are smoking
there are no saints today
good people yes but extraordinarily good people
those im afraid we are sorely lacking
do you think they ever existed
yes i do
do you want to become one
one is born a saint
well you can try cant you to be good
yes but goodness has very little to do with it
not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy
they were still attached to god
agnes has that birth
she stands no more
were born we live we die
no room for miracles
martha gets up too oh my dear how i miss the miracles
they start walking back to the convent
do you think agnes is still attached to god
listen to her singing
a pause id like to begin
do you still disapprove
would it stop you if i did
they both halt
may i be present
then lets begin
the room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply sloping ceiling
agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed already under hypnosis
martha and mother miriam are facing her
youre listening to a chorus of angels
the music surrounds you like a
warm and comfortable pool of water
and while youre sleeping youre going to be able to recall all the things that we want you to remember
and when i count to three and clap my hands youll no longer be hypnotised
can you hear me
who am i
and why am i here
to help me
would you like to tell me why youre here
because im in trouble
what kind of trouble
no answer what kind of trouble agnes
martha starts to walk around behind agnes
of telling you
but its easy
its just a breath with sound
what kind of trouble
a pause i had a baby
both martha and mother miriam react with some degree of relief
how did you have a baby
it came out of me
did you know what was going to come out
did you want it to come out
because i was afraid
why were you afraid
because i wasnt worthy
to be a mother
may i open my eyes now
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet
how did the baby get into you
what made it grow
do you know
would you like to tell me
did anyone else know about the baby
i cant tell you that
will she be angry
she made me promise not to
who made you promise
no answer its alright agnes
a pause lets go to your room
its the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick
oh dont be im here
i want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed
what did you have for dinner
distastefully brussel sprouts
you dont like brussel sprouts
i hate them
martha and mother miriam cant help smiling
and then what happened
we went to chapel for vespers
i left early because i wasnt feeling very well
suddenly agnes leaps up from her chair
what is it
someones following me
sister marguerite i think
was it sister marguerite who knew about the baby
no answer alright agnes i want you to see your room as you saw it on that night
open your eyes
she opens them what do you see
above the bed
what do you you see something different
what is it
puzzled a wastepaper basket
do you know who put it there
what do you think its there for
for me to get sick in
are you ill
what do you feel
i feel as if ive eaten glass
what do you do
i have to throw up
and she falls to her knees retching horribly
one of the sisters has fed me glass
i dont know which one distorted of what
assumes the birth position and looks between her legs water
its all water
why isnt anyone coming
trying to wipe up the water they cant hear me thats why
in terrible pain oh god
i dont wanna
to martha stop her
then agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of something
what is it
please get away from me
go away i dont want you here
is someone in the room with you
dont hit me please
stop this shell hurt herself stepping forward im not going to allow this
hauling her away no
i said leave her alone
still screaming youre trying to take my baby
trying to take my baby
then quietly it wasnt my fault mommy
it was a mistake mommy
one two three
claps her hands agnes comes to its alright
its me doctor livingston its alright alright
thankyou agnes thankyou
how do you feel
do you remember what just happened
a long pause yes
do you feel well enough to stand
martha helps her to her feet
agnes clings to her
there you go
its alright its alright its all over
its alright agnes thats right thats right
martha approaches the building and enters it
the camera tracks through shelves of ancient records and maps
martha off ah excuse me
im looking for some ah
ground plans for the ah
saint marie madeleine convent in distorted
man off answers in french martha and a middle aged official come into view
he stops at a long set of drawers and starts looking through it
in french replies in french oh
very interesting i guess
he pulls out a folder of plans excuse me
he sets the folder down on a table and starts going through it
they both look at the plans
this has everything
even the secret entrance
they all had that
usually to get from building to building in the snow
he indicates on the plan like that one
murmurs thats how he got in
or she got out
oh excuse me what did you say
may i take some notes
oh yes distorted martha starts drawing a rough plan
the crypt is deserted but candles are burning in front of a statue of saint michael
martha walks over to it lights a candle and goes behind it and finds a stairway there leading underground
she goes down into
martha walks through the dimly lit passage
she stops for a moment to look at a cross carved on the stone floor then continues
finally she reaches more steps and goes up into the
martha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is full of doves
it begins to make sense for her
various closeups of famous statues
a bell is tolling
two nuns come out of a building down streets across the road as though traffic did not exist and into another building
the nuns are sister anne and mother miriam
in the lift an checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls
the lift stops and the sisters get off
they walk down the modern carpeted corridor into
mother miriam addresses the secretary helen
is the doctor in her office
ah who shall i say is calling
grimly general macarthur
she heads onto marthas office
helen jumps up after her
just a minute please you cant go in there
mother miriam pushes the door open to reveal martha
its alright helen just close the door
mother miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto marthas desk
ive just met with the bishop
were taking you off the case
picking up the papers youre what
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes
well find our own thank you
starts to leave one that will ask the questions you want asked
halting one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
for the church
you think shes a saint
shes been touched by god yes
she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously
is that supposed to convince me she shouldnt be touched
give me a miracle
who is he
why must he be anybody
laughs and sits down my god youre as crazy as
stop laughing i dont say its the truth im saying
dont be ridiculous
well give me a reasonable explanation a miracle is an event without an explanation
if shes capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldnt she split a cell in her womb
this is insane
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out
youre saying god did it
no thats as much as saying father martineau did it
im saying god permitted it
but how did it happen
youll never find the answer for everything god did
i thought you didnt believe in miracles today mother
but i want the opportunity to believe
i want the choice to believe
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wont face the fact that she was raped
or that she did the seducing
she is an innocent
but she is not an enigma mother
everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry
one two three right down the line
thats what you believe she is
the sum of her psychological parts
thats what i have to believe
then why are you so obsessed with her
youre losing sleep over her
martha gets up disturbed youre thinking about her all the time
youre bent on saving her
martha has no answer
mother miriam cont
calmer im not accusing
theres a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn
did you know about that
theres an answer mother
thats how she got out
how could she find out about it
somebody told her
that tunnel hasnt been used in fifty years
oh would you stop lying mother
why would i lie
because its murder were talking about
arent you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room
im concerned about her health
who was that person mother
was it you
if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me
and definitely not agnes
she goes out and slams the door
after a couple of establishing shots of the convent the nuns are shown ice skating on the frozen pond
they are quite uninhibited like little children
their singing off from the chapel continues until the end of scene
sister genevieve the other novice is being consecrated
she approaches the altar all dressed in white carrying a single candle and kneels down
martha and justice leveau come up the steps and into the corridor
all i want is one more week
continues in french then
youve done nothing to show any progress
yes thats because im getting to her
youre getting to all of us martha lets face it
ill have a decision by next week
its gone on long enough
joe she didnt kill the baby
halting you have proof
ill have it
walking on no no no
i can get you new evidence next week
tomorrow ill get it by tomorrow
they reach the door of leveaus office
the scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one another
sister genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop genevieve praying on her knees her family watching from behind the grilled gate
genevieves hair being cut her joy at the habit being fitted to her running out to join her family a jolly old singalong on the piano this time the nuns
singing along from behind the gate
martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow covered grounds to the convent
mother miriam is working away at her desk when a nun interrupts
singing from the party can faintly be heard
nun off excuse me mother doctor livingston is here
mother miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet martha at he door
martha hands her a court order
mother miriam reads it briefly and hands it back
this is permission to take her apart
where is she
hasnt she had enough
i have a few more questions to ask her
my god but youre determined
they move back into the room
who knew she was pregnant
why do you insist upon pressing
was it you
is it because shes a nun
did you know she was pregnant
and you didnt send her to a doctor
i didnt guess until it was too late
oh dont be ridiculous
too late for what
i dont know
too late to stop it
you went to the room to help with the birth
she didnt want any help
you wanted that child out of the way
thats a lie
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room
i didnt hide it
i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
and the baby
you tied the cord around its neck
i wanted her to have it when no one else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such
a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked
before or after you killed the child
i left it with her and i went for help
i doubt thats what shed say
then shes a liar
it is the same as before except that this time martha and mother miriam are standing
agnes can you hear me
i want you to remember if you can a night last january
the night sister paul died
do you remember
there is a flash cut to sister paul being annointed
agnes stirs slightly
whats the matter
there is another flash cut this time of sister paul saying that mysterious word that we could not previously understand
she said michael
what did she mean
there is a third flash cut of the shrine of saint michael in the crypt
she had shown it to me the day before
and the passage to the barn
so i could go to him
how did she know about him
shed seen him too
from the belltower the day she before she died
so she sent you
in flashback agnes is walking alone through the tunnel carrying an oil lamp
agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into
still in flashback agnes emerges into the barn
the doves flap about as agnes moves nervously through the barn
back to the present are you frightened
in flashback the doves continue to make flapping and bumping sounds as they fly around the barn
in the present where are you
in flashback is it you
then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see nothing except the doves
yes yes i do
wait i want to see you
what do you see
in the present halos
in flashback agnes is still in the barn but now she is lying on her back
still all we can see are doves flashing in the light
dividing and dividing feathers and starts falling falling into the iris of gods eye
its so lovely
blood wings brown blood
and she lifts up her hands
in the present as she lifts up her hands agnes is horrified to see two holes in her palms weeping blood
martha and mother miriam are equally shocked
agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her white habit
mother miriam rushes after her
my god it wont stop i cant get it to stop
to mother miriam let go of me i wish you were dead
trying to hold her agnes
agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it too with blood
martha follows her
stay away from me
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god
he did a terrible thing to you do you understand
he frightened you and he hurt you
its not your fault
its his fault
tell us who he is so we can find him
stop him from doing this to other women
not your fault
agnes who did you see
i hate him
of course you do
who was it
i hate him for what he did to me
for what he made me go through
i hate him
agnes who did this to you
agnes flings her arms back against the wall
it was god
sinks to her knees and now ill burn in hell because i hate him
agnes you wont burn in hell
its alright to hate him
agnes what happened to the baby
shouting she cant remember
what happened to the baby
it was dead
it was alive wasnt it
i dont remember
screaming oh dont do this
somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat
mother miriam is looking utterly resigned
mother miriam was with you wasnt she
she took the baby in her arms
you saw it all didnt you
what did she do
no answer agnes what did she do
left me alone with that little thing and i looked at it and i thought this is a mistake
but its my mistake not mommys
i thought i
i can save her
she raises her hands i can give her back to god
what did you do
i put her to sleep
i tied the cord around her neck
wrapped her in the bloody sheets
and stuffed her in the trash can
mother miriam gives a shuddering sigh makes the sign of the cross and prays
martha claps her hands lightly together once
a shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the city
angle on the courthouse
all the main characters are present eve lyon martha agnes sister marguerite and mother miriam
justice leveau is summing up
in view of the situation as it now stands and the testimony given here this morning it seems quite clear that the defendant was in no manner responsible for her
it is therefore the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of marie madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision by a
both martha and mother miriam show relief at this
justice leveau continues to sum up in french when suddenly agnes stands up
do you have something to say
a long pause i stood in the window of my room every night for a week
and one night i heard the most beautiful voice imaginable
and when i looked i saw the moon shining down on him
for six nights he sang to me songs id never heard
and on the seventh night he opened his wings and lay on top of me
all the while he sang sings charlie sweet
please remove her from the court
martha and mother miriam step forward uncertainly
would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom
continues in french the nuns lead agnes still singing past martha and out of the court
it is full winter many shots of the convent and surroundings dissolving into one another
i dont know the meaning behind the song she sang
perhaps it was a song of seduction
and the father was a fieldhand
perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago
and the father was hope and
and love and desire
and a belief in miracles
the nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to the convent over which agnes singing can be heard
i want to believe that she was blessed
and i do miss her and i hope that shes left something some little part of herself with me
that would be miracle enough wouldnt it
where agnes is singing her song among the doves
she stops singing and the music fades in on the same key
agnes gently takes on of the doves and lets it fly away across the snowy landscape
