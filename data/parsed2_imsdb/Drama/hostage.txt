hostage by robert crais based on his novel march the sky is overlaid with the slow whup whup whup of an lapd helicopter flashing through the frame here and gone
lapd radio transmissions crackle like static electricity around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the puckered asshole of eagle rock
a mans terrified voice screams invisibly from the house im gonna kill this dog
you make my wife talk to me or im gonna shoot this fuckin dog
a five member swat tactical team appears out of nowhere full black assault gear m s gloved and masked hustling into position on either side of the front door
only now do we get the full picture helicopters overhead radio cars surrounding the house an army of cops itching the pull the trigger when the tac team is good
to go the team leader gives a thumbs up to talley and leifitz are hunkered behind the lapd command and control van
leifitz is the crisis response team swat commander talley the primary negotiator
its so hot out here that talley has stripped down to a tee shirt and vest
theyre good to go talley
your word and were in the house
no ones going anywhere l t
we can talk this guy down
talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone thats been hardlined into the house his tone reasonable and friendly into the phone hey george
george dont kill the dog okay
we dont want to hear a gun go off in there
a phone crashes through the window and lands in the front yard screaming from the house fuck you
i dont think he wants to talk
frustrated talley slumps back against the van as the swat intelligence officer lloyd keith scuttles up to them wheres the guys wife
she didnt take the kid to her sisters
the neighbors were wrong
goddamnit you said we had her
i told him we had her
we got bad information talley
i cant pull her out of my ass
up at the house george edward malik steps into the window
malik is a forty year old freaked out loser who has turned the corner on insanity shouting at talley you said my wife was gonna talk to me you lying
im gonna kill her dog then shoot myself
i mean it
talley stares at malik thinking then abruptly grabs keith by the collar to keith pull the dogs name out of your ass
get the dogs name
talley steps out from behind the command van so that malik can see him
alarmed by talleys move talley
youre in the line of fire
talley ignores leifitz he is totally focused on malik and on defusing the situation i didnt lie to you george
you scared your wife pretty good last night
were having a hard time finding her
she better talk to me
im gonna kill her goddamned dog
you and i have been talking for what sixteen hours
is that your dog too
malik steps away from the window i dont know whose dog it is
she lied about everything else so she probably lied about the dog
i know youre hurting
you lose your job you find out your wifes fucking another guy
but dont give up
well have her talk to you
then why wont she open her mouth
why doesnt the bitch say something
something about maliks statement bothers talley
the wording is odd suspicious george
come back to the window
talley grows even more concerned
was malik talking to him
leave the dog alone and come to the window
talley sees keith rejoin leifitz to leifitz whats the dogs name
the neighbors say he doesnt have a dog
the pieces fall into place for talley the wife that no one can find the dog that doesnt exist
in a single terrible moment talley realizes that malik is not talking to him hes talking to his wife murray
theyre in the house
his wifes in the house
even as talley screams a gunshot echoes from the house freezing the moment
a second shot follows the first as the tactical team breaches the front door talley sprints forward running as hard as he can in nightmare slow motion talley shoulders inside
on the heels of the tactical team through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight
swat cops are cuffing malik even though hes already dead of a self inflicted gunshot wound maliks wife is sprawled on the couch where she has been dead for fourteen
hours two tac officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that sprays from the neck of maliks nine year old son even as one of them screams for the paramedics talley is numb its all too much too heavy too horrible
he kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boys hand
he stares into the boys eyes and the boy stares back
the childs face grows pale as he drains of blood
we hear his heart beating
we hear it slow
we hear it stop
talley stares at the dead boy
the dead boys lifeless eyes stare at nothing
another hyperblue sky but now were in an upscale bedroom community in the sun scorched high desert north of la a legend appears one year later
a rotted out toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the minimart white boy hip hop booming on the radio which dies with the engine dennis rooney is driving twenty
three years old working class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding good looks
in the middle kevin rooney nineteen scared shitless at what theyre about to do
riding shotgun mars krupchek twenty four a large pasty guy with a shaved head and faraway eyes
cmon dennis this is stupid
i thought we were gonna go to the movies
grins past kevin to mars mars

mars slides out of the truck
he has a tattoo on the back of his tattoo that says burn it

dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine
thirty seconds well be down the road
then well go to the movies
mars returns and nods his approval its perfect
thats all it takes
junior kim jr
is short squat and forty two years old
hes reading a magazine behind the counter when dennis and mars enter dennis trying to disarm him with a smile as dennis reaches the counter he lifts his tee shirt
to reveal the butt of his pistol a pack of marlboros for my friend and all your cash you gook motherfucker
but junior kim is ready
he lurches to his feet bringing up a pistol of his own hes got a gun
dennis lunges across the counter grabbing kims gun and the two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death struggle for possession of the weapon mars help me dennis and
kim bounce from the counter to the slurpy machine the glock locked between them pointing first one way then the other their eyes meeting as bam the gun goes off
junior kims eyes widen
dennis and junior both look down at the red blossom that grows on junior kims chest screaming in the background dennis
dennis someones coming
kim falls into the slurpy machine then slides to the floor
dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door
but mars hesitates
instead of running he picks up kims gun then leans over the counter to look at kims body
we cannot see his face a forty something soccer mom named margaret hammond is about to enter the minimart when dennis and kevin burst out knocking her on her ass
mars follows a moment later margaret watches their red pickup lurch away then rushes into the store dennis power shifts into gear clashing tortured metal as he pushes the toyota
as hard as it will go
no one is talking theyre screaming theres fuckin blood all over you
i didnt know he would have a gun
it just went off
dennis sees himself in the rearview mirror
his face is splattered with red dew the sight of it freaking him out jesus
fuckin jesus its on my face
the trunk careens crazily off the road
mars calmly runs a hand over denniss face relax
its only blood
dennis upshifts hard again the truck lurching as the tranny howls fuck you mars
i got it all over me
whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud bang and the truck loses power motherfucking piece of shit
flanders road is lined with trees hedges and the exclusive housing developments that dot the countryside around bristo camino
the toyota jerks to a stop well off the road and dennis mars and kevin pile out stuffing pistols and bullets into their pockets that womans gonna call the cops
shut up goddamnit

dennis grabs him by the throat mars steps between them people are looking
dennis sees that mars is right people in passing cars are looking
he releases his brother thats why we gotta keep going
im not gonna go in for murder

dennis and mars take off for the wall kevin reluctantly following the camera reveals a two story california mediterranean home in the exclusive housing development known as york estates
you cant get in the door for less than one point five and this house costs more eight thousand square feet of used brick and custom tile set on a
lushly landscaped acre you can pick them up whenever you want
walter smith is at his computer behind his desk
hes forty and fit casually dressed with thinning hair and glasses currently leaning back as he talks on his phone into the phone i have his corporate and personal on
two disks labeled marlon and al
as smith talks he ejects a zip disk from his computer attaches a label reading al then places it in a palm sized case beside the first disk marlon what

walter allows his son to pull him around the desk to a boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as walters sixteen year old daughter jennifer stretches out in cutoff
shorts and a bikini top working on her tan
walter and thomas appear in the french doors that open from the back of the house calling jen
come feed your brother

jen cmon chop chop
ive got to finish my work
jennifer rolls her eyes rises from the chaise longue and pads to the house
as she clears the frame the camera swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property
dennis silenty drops into the bushes a sky blue bristo camino patrol car cruises along flanders road welch is a young officer with an innocence to his eyes that you
dont find in urban cops
he keeps a photo of his wife and toddler son taped to the dash
you there mike
welch picks up the radio microphone four
im gonna hit the krispy kreme
you want a dozen
armed robbery kims minimart on flanders road shots fired with a man down
this is so unexpected that welch waits for the punchline are you kidding me
ah suspects are three white males driving a red pickup last seen eastbound on flanders
welch turns on his lights just as he sees the red toyota pickup abandoned on the side of the road and stands on his brakes the smiths home sports an
open floor plan with the kitchen centrally located between a large family room a hall that leads to the front of the house and the french doors that open onto the pool area
jennifer is putting the finishing touches on three tuna sandwiches as she calls to her brother tell daddy that lunch is ready
no answer thomas dont be a turd
she turns to find herself face to face with dennis who clamps a hand over her mouth quietly im not going to hurt you
mars is holding thomas
kevin is by the french doors stop fighting
relax and ill let go
jennifer struggles until she sees that mars is holding a pistol to thomass head thats better
be cool and well be outta here in five minutes
jennifer nods and dennis removes his hand
he has her pinned to the counter his body pressed into hers she is suddenly very aware that she is almost naked who else is here
dennis grabs her hair and pulls her away it happens fast dennis shoves jennifer into the room and mars and kevin follow with thomas walter is feeding a computer print
out into a paper shredder as they burst through the door get your ass in the chair
dennis shoves jennifer to the floor and stalks directly across the room his gun trained on walter
walter freezes hands motionless letting the paper feed into the shredder
strangely he has little outward reaction quietly jen
are you all right
shell be dead if you dont put your ass in that chair
walter carefully sits
he is amazingly calm in the face of this invasion
dont stand there asshole close the windows
mars keep him covered dude
mars pushes thomas down beside jennifer then aims his gun at walter
kevin closes the shutters as dennis rips the electric cord from a lamp who sent you
dont go rambo and youll tellm about this on the back nine
im gonna tie you up then were gonna take your car
walter glances toward the shredder the final page of paper emerges as spaghetti and then the shredder stops the car
all you want is the car
am i talkin raghead
i want your car
gimme the goddamned keys
a strange smile flickers at the corner of walters mouth as if theres a joke within all this then the keys are on the wall by the garage
the tanks almost full
dennis rushes to the window mike welch climbs out of the patrol car and keys his shoulder mike as he appraises the house into his radio mike they had to
go through the yard at castle way
im going to approach
welch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door dennis shoves jennifer to the door open it
you remember im right here
welch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and jennifer clearly terrified peers out
welch hesitates into his mike teenage female opened the front door
to jennifer miss i found an abandoned vehicle on the other side of your wall
did three young men run through the area
jennifer doesnt answer
her eyes fill until two huge tears roll down her cheeks
welch grows uneasy
something is wrong but he doesnt know what
he stays where he is miss
welch stares into jennifers eyes pointedly shifting his gaze to ask the silent question are they here
are peering out the shutters when mars suddenly shouts hes going for his gun
mars opens fire shooting through the window as kicks the door closed and fires through the door jennifer screaming as tumbles backward struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood
bubbles in his mouth
he tries to rise but cant into his radio officer down
jesus ive been shot
mike what did you say
mike welch blinks at the sky but cannot answer its the kind of small town police facility you might expect a general room with desks and computers a coffee machine
and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers egging a house
the camera establishes the low key atmosphere during which it finds a glass door labeled j
talley chief of police jeff talley is behind the desk his voice muted because he is locked in a painful phone conversation into phone its really hard jane
this isnt the way i want it
jane talley is an attractive woman in her mid thirties
she has the efficient manner of a registered nurse which she is and right now shes using all of her professional detachment to keep herself together into phone no
then whose idea was it for you take a job in the middle of nowhere
intercut talley who considers the photographs that decorate his wall shots of talley in happier times with jane and their teenaged daughter amanda talley as a young swat officer the
framed headline from the bristo weekly standard proclaiming ex swat cop new bristo chief
i need to work out some stuff
youre hiding jeffrey
youre hiding from the job and youre hiding from me
i still see that boys eyes
jane softens she knows that a part of him is in terrible pain
but shes in pain too that happened a year ago
youve been gone for almost six months
how long do you have to punish yourself for something that wasnt your fault
talley studies the picture of his wife and daughter
he focuses on amanda is amanda there
jane cups the phone and calls to her daughter
amanda enters and goes to the refrigerator
shes fifteen and carrying the weight of a seriously bad attitude to amanda its dad
he wants to speak with you
doesnt even glance over im gonna see him later
back to talley she has to go to the bathroom
jane turns away and lowers her voice not wanting amanda to hear youre not only punishing yourself jeff
amanda and i are in this too
talley knows and he hurts like hell because of it can we talk some more when you get here
well see you in a couple of hours
jane hangs up without waiting for a response then closes her eyes trying hard to keep herself together
i dont wanna go up there
i want to stay here with my friends
pack your things
jane stalks away without a glance back and amanda angrily flips off her mother he is clearly shaken by the call but his thoughts are interrupted when his assistant an
older woman named louise vance bursts in mikes been shot
someone shot junior kim too talley comes around his desk what are you talking about shot
three white males shot junior
mike followed them to york estates where are they
four five five castle way
anders and jorgenson are on the way
talley charges out talley wheels into a wide spacious cul de sac lined with expensive estate homes and pulls up behind another radio car
anders and jorgenson are crouched in the street bullets snap into talleys windshield starring the glass sonofabitch
talley scrambles out of his car talley takes cover behind his front wheel
anders and jorgenson are young guys theyve never worked a high crime area theyve never made a felony arrest and right now theyre scared shitless
mike welch lies on the smiths front lawn forty feet away welch is down
they shot him
we think its the three guys who robbed kims
are civilians inside
he said something about a girl holster your guns
another shot cracks from the house as we hear the faint wail of approaching sirens
talley edges around his car trying to see welch calling mike
mike can you hear me
i think hes dead
dont shout larry
im three feet away
talley considers the situation and comes up with a plan we have to cordon off the streets then evacuate these houses
what are we going to do about mike
keep your head down
talley scrambles back into his car
he backs up then powers the car up the drive and onto the front lawn talley roars to a stop between welch and the house using the car as a
more shots ping off his car as talley climbs out how you doing buddy
you still alive
his shirt is soaked with blood where the bullets caught him beneath his vest
talley cant waste time
the siren is closer now jesus
you hang on
talley hoists welch into the backseat then dives behind the wheel
he fishtails off the lawn and up the street the ambulance waits as talley powers to a stop hes in the backseat
paramedics pull mike welch from the car as talley gets out
he can see into the cul de sac from here where anders and jorgenson still hunker behind their car
talley keys his radio this is talley
his radio crackles with overlapping voices one at a time
clear the air
as they settle louise

what do we have
junior kim was doa at the hospital
frantic voices once more overlap what about mike

i want radio discipline
as they quiet mikes hanging in

i pulled mickey and dreyer off the minimart
jesus christ louise we cant leave a crime scene like that
put a unit out there
we only have eight officers on duty chief
more sirens are approaching but their help seems too little too late
talley stares up the cul de sac at the smiths house as if this was a terrible nightmare to himself thats not enough
whats that chief
get everyone out here
then call the sheriffs
tell them we have a possible hostage situation
gunsmoke fills the air
kevin is freaking
he throws a magazine at mars we couldve gone out the back
you didnt have to shoot
they found the truck kev
theyre already behind us
we should give up
all were doing is making it worse
get out of our house
her voice cuts through the din
jennifer and thomas are huddled with their father on the floor jennifers arms crossed to cover herself softly quiet jen
why dont they go
why dont they leave us alone and go
dennis charges up to her screaming and waving his gun shut up
shut the fuck up
walter smith slowly stands none of you will get out of this
dennis spins toward walter leveling his gun stay down
stay down goddamnit
im going to my desk
youre not goin anywhere
get on the fuckin floor
dennis raises the gun to walters face
walter is in complete command of himself and nowhere near scared but jennifer grabs his legs daddy dont
casually to dennis take it easy son
im only going to my desk
walter eases past dennis who doesnt know what to do get on the floor
i have contacts in los angeles
lawyers and judges who can help you
walter slips open the center drawer
dennis thinks that walter might go for a gun
he screams louder and aims between walters eyes ill fuckin kill you
walter checks that the computer disks are in the disk case
we can see their names clearly marlon and al
he drops the case into the drawer then lifts out a thick booklet this is every criminal lawyer in california
if you give up now right now ill buy you the best lawyer in the state
dennis slaps the book aside even more angry we just killed a cop
we killed a fat chinaman
well get the death penalty
dennis suddenly screams at mars and kevin mars watch the cops
watch the back of the house
you wont die if you let me help
but if you stay in this house i can promise you this shouting over him shut up
shut up and get on the floor
you cant imagine the fucking youre going to get
he swings the gun hard and smashes walter on the temple
walter drops like a rock
leave him alone
jennifer rushes to her fathers side but walters out cold talley is at his car with anders and two other officers leigh metzger a woman in her early thirties and
cliff campbell a slender guy who looks like a retired security cop
talley is getting information reports both in person and over the radio referring to notes the house belongs to walter and pamela smith
theyve got two kids a girl about fifteen and a boy younger jennifer and thomas
that would be the girl who opened the door
are the others inside
the mother is in florida visiting her sister
the father works at home so hes probably inside
talley keys his mike into his mike louise
get a phone number for the smiths
from the radio chief mikkelson
the truck is registered to dennis james rooney white male twenty two
he has an agua dulce address
contact the landlord
i want to know employment friends family anything we can find out about this guy
a news helicopter swoops overhead in a tight turn
the cops look up what in hell is that
grimly news hawks
therell be more
they monitor our frequencies
talley realizes that his officers are staring at the helicopter as if theyve never seen one these people have never dealt with a crime this large and have probably never
even seen a felon
talley keys the mike again everyone be cool
thats our job right now stabilize the situation and dont let things get out of hand
all we have to do is hang on until the sheriffs take over
thats all we have to do
no one looks particularly convinced how do we do that
thats my job metzger
thats why i get the big bucks
talley puts away his mike jennifer and thomas are bent over their father wanting to help but not knowing how
walters eyes flicker as if hes dreaming and the lump on his head is bleeding hes not waking up
he should be awake
jennifer abruptly stands and faces dennis he needs a doctor
shut up and sit down
you think someones gonna make a house call
jennifer is scared really really scared but she doesnt sit down
both dennis and mars are staring at her
she feels naked and vulnerable
she crosses her arms again at least let me get some ice for his head
dennis finally relents and shrugs at mars make sure kevin isnt fucking off back there
jennifer hurries out as mars follows jennifer goes to the counter
kevin is at the french doors nervous and scared mars is a dark shadow behind her she kneels to a low cabinet when mars kicks it shut i thought you
mars towers over her his groin inches from her face im getting a wash cloth for the ice
mars gazes down at her enjoying his size and power
he steps closer bringing his groin closer to his face
jennifer stands holding her arms across her breasts please get away from me
from the background mars
what are you doing
kevins intrusion shatters the moment
jennifer quickly snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet then takes an ice tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter as jennifer puts ice in the
wash cloth she sees the paring knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by paper towels she glances at kevin but cannot see mars hes at the refrigerator behind her
jennifer slowly reaches for the knife hey
jennifer freezes terrified
she pushes the knife behind the cuisinart to hide it then turns
mars is offering her a beer
i dont drink beer
mommy wont know
you can do anything you want right now
mommy wont know
what i want is to help my father
jennifer hurries past him and disappears down the hall
even as she leaves the phone starts ringing the phone seems to ring louder here
dennis stands over it watching the phone as if its alive
the phone rings again and again
finally he answers hello
talley is once more behind his car
hes on his cell phone with jorgenson nearby into his phone my name is jeff talley

intercut dennis on the phone in walters office you with the cops
the bristo police department

dennis shoots a guilty glance at walter then lies were cool
let me speak to mr

talley cups the phone to tell jorgenson all three subjects are confirmed inside

the phone clicks in talleys ear as dennis slams down the phone dennis is livid with fear and rage
he paces through the office like a trapped cat that fuckin chinaman is dead
thats murder one dude
thats the needle
kevin appears in the entry drawn by denniss raving get back where you belong asshole
mars keep and eye on the cops i gotta find a way out of here dennis shoves kevin out of the office and stalks after him kevin dogs along beside
dennis speaking softly so that mars doesnt overhear i have to tell you something we gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do
its about mars they reach the master bedroom suite a huge room with sliding glass doors that overlook the pool that cop didnt pull his gun
he just started shooting
why would mars do that
i was there dennis
its like he wanted to shoot that cop
youre being stupid
check out the bathroom
maybe we can sneak out a window dennis shoves kevin toward the bathroom then steps into one side is filled with racks of clothes but the opposite side is an
industrial bank of video monitors showing a dozen views of the house both inside and out dennis sees this stuff and stops in his tracks awed kev
kevin steps in beside him
what is this
are you totally stupid
what does it look like
one monitor shows mars and the smiths in the office another the kitchen another jennifers room another the front of the house the rear the sides every room and most
of the exterior can be seen look thats the master bedroom out here
dennis goes out into the master looking for the camera and appears on the bedroom monitor i can see you
dennis steps back into the closet and this time he examines the door
he closes it enough to reveal thick throw bolts dude this is solid steel
they gotta be hiding something
dennis glances over to his brother and finds kevin on his knees with two black travel bags beneath the clothes dennis kevin pushes the clothes aside to reveal an open
its filled with hundred dollar bills
dennis kneels beside his brother and opens the second bag
its filled with hundred dollar bills too go get mars
were watching a grainy black and white security tape of junior kims robbery homicide
it shows kim behind the counter as dennis and mars enter one in front is dennis james rooney
talley mikkelson dreyer and anders are watching the tape which is currently being played in the home of mrs
estelle pena who lives two blocks from the smiths
mikkelson is a tall strong woman dreyer is her opposite a short dumpy man dennis has a younger brother kevin paul thats him entering now the third guy
has dennis done time
just pulled thirty days for misdemeanor burglary
he shows car theft shoplifting and dui
talley steps closer to the television and taps mars whos this
we dont know
have still prints made from the tape
show the landlord
maybe we can get a fast id
talley looks closer
with the way mars is positioned we can see part of the tattoo on his head here on his head
is that a tattoo
i cant make it out
on the tape kim slumps to the floor
dennis vaults across the counter and runs to the door
mars however calmly picks up kims gun and leans across the counter
we couldnt see this before but now we see a strange smile play over his face whats he doing
hes watching kim die
talley watches mars and knows that this guy is seriously disturbed
he is still watching the tape when leigh metzger calls from the door chief
metzger is with amanda and jane talley jane and amanda are walking to the street
amanda is excited she thinks this is cool are men with guns really barricaded in a house
just around the corner and up that street
see the helicopters
five news choppers now hover high over the house
the crime scene is only two blocks away
wait by the car mandy
give me a minute with dad
they wait until amanda is gone then apologizing i shouldve called
this thing broke right after we spoke then everything happened so fast dont worry about it
how are you doing
the sheriffs will take over when they get here
but theyre not here yet

jane touches his arm jesus youre shaking
self conscious talley moves away so that hes out of reach why dont you guys grab some dinner at the thai place
ill meet you there as soon as i can
i dont know how long ill be stuck here
im in no rush
maybe later we can talk
talley gives her a gentle nod then watches her walk away until jane
she turns back her eyes asking what
im scared shitless
i love you anyway
talley and jane share the moment and then she walks away
a news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main entrance of york estates
the entrance has been blocked and cars are being turned away so traffic is backed up both ways along the street glen howell is a nice looking man in his
early forties sport coat gold rolex deep tan
he hammers the horn of his mercedes s sedan but it does no good traffic is frozen a news van trying to work up the line pulls alongside then gets
jammed by the crunch like everyone else
howell rolls down the window hey you guys know whats going on
an attractive asian american reporter leans from her window to answer three men took a family hostage
jesus no shit
my client lives in there
the reporter checks her notes its a family named smith walter and pamela smith
do you know them
howell stares at her emptily then shakes his head no
no i dont know them
thanks for your time
howell pulls a u turn to get out of traffic
he flips open his cell phone and presses the speed dial into his phone we have a problem out here
were in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking palm springs
on the cut sonny benza phil tuzee and charlie fischer are watching tv news coverage of the situation in bristo camino worst case its a bloodbath
the detectives come out with smiths computer and we go directly to jail do not pass go
maybe glen already picked up the disks
i took the call from glen personally
theyre still in smiths house
fischer tries being positive maybe were getting too dramatic
its three kids
theyll give up the cops will arrest them and thats that
why would they search the house
you think we should take that chance
on the spot i guess not
i guess not too
how much information is in the house
smith was cooking the books for the irs
that means he has it all the cash flow where it comes from how we launder it our split with the east
its on two computer disks he calls marlon and al
what hes cute
thats his idea of humor
if the feds get those disks the east coast is gonna take a hit too
you should let them know
i tell them that old man is gonna handle this from back there
you should warn them sonny
now get your head in the game phil we have to handle this
benza turns back to the television put our people on the scene
smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids
he knows better than that
bullshit a man will do anything to save his family
whos running the show up there
they have a chief of police a guy named talley
i saw him being interviewed
the television suddenly shows talley making a statement
he looks tired and haggard pointing hey thats him

howell tears talleys address off the yellow pad
this meeting is over what if it goes south
what do you mean
if things get wet were going to need someone who can handle that end
you worry about your end
i got my side covered
howell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door
the sun has set
the donut shop glows greasily at the end of a strip mall
it is empty except for the overweight woman behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth the man in the booth is named marion clewes
hes an average looking guy more or less except for the strange cant to his right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white j
his jacket doesnt fit quite right but not so much as youd notice
marion could disappear into a crowd just by being so ordinary
thats the point
a fat black desert fly heavy with juice and thorny with coarse hair buzzes past marion watches it only his eyes moving the fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar
on the table marion watches it then suddenly with no warning his hand flashes out slamming down on the table
he holds his hand in place feeling for movement then slowly peeks under his hand the fly oozes sideways legs kicking trying to walk
one wing beats furiously the other is broken marion examines his hand
a smear of fly goo and a single black leg streaks his third finger
marion touches his tongue to the smear the woman behind the counter watches this her eyes widening with disgust marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger
and uses his right to break away another leg
he eats this leg too the woman disappears into the rear headlights flash across the glass and marion swivels around to see howells mercedes pull up marion carefully pushes the
still alive fly aside as glen howell takes a seat across from him
howell puts the yellow slip with talleys address on the table talley lives here
i dont know if the place has security or not
it wont be a problem
he has a wife and kid
thats how well get to him
we have to own this guy marion
we dont want him dead we need to use him
marion puts talleys address into his pocket
can we make him dead after we use him
glen howell slides out of the booth without answering
marion creeps him out whatever you want
page me when youre done
howell starts away then turns back donuts here any good
i dont eat junk food
howell frowns like he mightve known then walks away
marion turns back to the fly it lays there still until marion prods it
the remaining wing flutters marion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that too
talley and leigh metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports pacbell shows six lines into the house
they blocked all six like you wanted
i have the only number that can call into the house
theyll only accept calls from your cell
way to go
they arrive at larry anders who is waiting at his car with a slim nervous cement contractor named brad dill chief this is brad dill
dennis and kevin work for him
i didnt know anything about this
i didnt know what they were gonna do
dill these pricks didnt know what they were going to do until they did it
i want you to take a look at something
metzger holds out a still picture that was made from junior kims security tape can you identify this man
that would be mars krupchek
jesus he works for me too
to metzger have louise run the name mars krupchek through dmv and ncic
tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier
metzger hurries away as talley turns back to dill is krupchek an aggressive guy
anything like that
keeps to himself more like
you have his address
pretty sure i do
yeah here we go dill pulls out a tattered address book
talley hands the book to anders who copies the address to anders call the palmdale city attorney for a telephonic search warrant
when you get the warrant have mikkelson and dreyer search his house
anders turns away as metzger calls from mrs
penas door chief
the sheriffs are ten minutes out
talley has wanted to hear that but now his sense of relief is tempered by something he did not expect loss
talley keys his shoulder mike into his radio louise
call jane for me
shes at the little thai place
i know the one
tell her im almost home
dennis is on the floor with the money touching it feeling it smelling it
mars is standing over him profoundly unmoved theres gotta be a million bucks here
maybe two million
mars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and the door its a safety room
if anyone breaks into your house you can hide
who gives a shit mars
check out the cash
were trapped in a house
mars walks away dennis and mars are returning to the front of the house dennis irritated at marss lack of enthusiasm we can take it with us
you cant run with suitcases
dennis grabs mars by the arm stopping him then well stuff it up our asses
this is the payoff
this is every dream you ever had all in those two bags
mars continues on without responding dennis angrily following kevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as mars and dennis enter
a female anchor is reporting on the events at york estates with denniss booking photo cut into the picture from the tube thought to be dennis james rooney
rooney was recently released from the antelope valley correctional institute where he served time for robbery
dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big smile thrilled check me out
i look like fuckin jon bon jovi
kevin is anything but thrilled everyone knows what we look like dennis
we wont be able to hide
jesus first mars now you
you two need anti depressants
across the room walter smith shudders and moans his face is swollen and covered with clammy sweat jennifer is sick with worry and cant stand seeing her father like this
my father needs a doctor
hey ive got a situation here in case you havent noticed
all youre doing is watching yourself on tv
look at him
use more ice
im getting a doctor
jennifer lurches to her feet and runs toward the front door
dennis catches her in two steps and backhands her exactly the way his old man used to smack his old lady knocking her to the floor jen
thomas charges into dennis like an angry midget
kevin jumps between them stop it
stop it dennis
mars steps forward and jerks thomas into the air
mars physical presence is suddenly so imposing that everyone stops fighting quietly we should tie them
we can put them upstairs out of the way
it takes dennis a moment to come up to speed with that but then he nods thats right
thats a good idea mars
to kevin find something extension cords rope wire well have to tie them tight
find something kevin
dont just stand there
waves at walter and tie this bastard too
i dont want him waking up and goin rambo on us
mars nods his approval
subtly there is the beginning of a shift in power mars pushes jennifer inside
kevin follows her with duct tape and a couple of extension cords
mars holding thomas pauses in the hall tie her to the chair
ill take care of the windows when i finish with the boy
mars disappears with thomas down the hall
jennifer stands by the chair arms once more crossed over her breasts
kevin can see that shes scared
he takes a t shirt from where shes left it on the floor and hands it to her here
put this on
she pulls it over her head you gotta pee
i dont see why you cant just lock me in
its not like i can go anywhere
either im going to tie you or mars will tie you
which do you want
kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the chair
as he ties her jennifer decides that if any of them can be reached its kevin thanks for the shirt
kevin my father needs a doctor
hes just knocked out
ive been knocked out
if my father dies theyll charge you with his murder
cant you make dennis see that
kevin leans back
he knows shes right but he doesnt believe he can do anything about it i cant make dennis see anything
a shadow moves behind kevin
its mars standing in the door
he holds up a wicked claw hammer look what i found
he enters and tests at jennifers binds you tied her like a pussy
make it tight
as kevin reties the bindings mars rips the phone from the wall
he smashes the phone jack with the hammer crushing it
then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into the sill nailing the window closed mars returns to jennifer and once more checks her binds better
he tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her mouth make sure she can breathe
mars rubs his fingers hard over the tape covering her mouth
he massages the tape into her skin slow sensual go downstairs kevin
jennifer looks at kevin her eyes pleading that he not leave but kevin is cowed he leaves jennifer looks back at mars mars leans close to her
she is terrified that he is going to kiss her but instead he sniffs smelling her i want to show you something
mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to expose his chest
a large tattoo in flowing script is lined across his body a mothers son
it cost two hundred forty dollars but i was happy to spend it
i love my mom
you see these
mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if he were diseased
he fingers the lumps sensuously as if touching them excites him my mom burned me with cigarettes
jennifer is both disgusted and terrified
mars stares at her emptily for another moment then lowers his shirt and leaves without another word
the room is dark
thomas is tied firmly to the bed
the cords cut into thomass wrists and thomas cant reach the knots but mars made one mistake he tied thomas to the headboard posts and one of the newels has
been loose for years thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel then twists it back and forth
he works it harder and harder until the newel slides off its pin and suddenly his hand is free though still tied to the newel thomas peels the tape from
his mouth then unties the remaining binds and frees himself from the newel
he slips off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet a service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built into the wall beneath thomass clothes
thomas prys open the hatch then reaches inside for a small flashlight
he flicks it on then climbs into the eaves of the roof the crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the edge of the roof
it was built for plumbers and air conditioning technicians but thomas has taken the space for his own witness the stack of penthouse pictures of sports heroes tacked to the
rafters and old soda cans strewn between the joists thomas scurries quietly through the tunnel heading for thomas pushes through a hatch identical to the one in his own closet then creeps to the door whispers jen
jennifer twists around to see him mumbling through the tape sit still
if theyre in the security room they can see you on the monitors
thomas slips out of the closet and creeps toward her along the wall i figured out what these cameras can see last year when mom and dad went to lake
it cant see me over here but its looking at you so dont move
thomas reaches up from behind jennifer and jerks the tape off her mouth ow
thomas is hiding behind jennifer so that the camera cannot see him no ones coming
that big asshole nailed my windows
we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs
then we can run for it
im not going to leave daddy with them
thomas thinks about that and decides that he cant leave their father either we cant carry him
you go thomas
you get out and ill stay with daddy
im not gonna leave you
if you get out maybe you can help the police
thomas suddenly realizes what he has to do well all go jennifer
all of us or none of us
i know where daddy keeps a gun
jennifer jerks so hard that she almost tips over the chair loud you leave that gun alone
shh theyll hear you
louder better than you getting killed
dont touch that gun
daddy says thomas slaps the tape back over her mouth
jennifer struggles helplessly as thomas slips back into the closet and is gone the sheriffs crisis response team rolls through the streets like an invading army a brown sedan leads
a huge van known as the mobile command post which is followed by a sheriffs swat support vehicle two swat suburbans and four radio units
pools of light from the helicopters follow their progress talley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy stops
up and down the row uniformed sheriffs pile out of their vehicles and off load their gear two people climb out of the lead car will maddox a bespectacled african
american sheriffs swat negotiator and captain laura martin the crt commander im talley
whos in charge
this is will maddox the primary negotiator is the perimeter around the house secure
ive got fourteen officers on my department including me
were as secure as we can be
to martin permission to deploy the line
to maddox dont crowd the house
the alphas a kid named rooney
hes amped up and volatile
maddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike sounds like you know the job
ive done it once or twice
i blocked their phones to incoming calls so youll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him
over her shoulder maddox
you got that
doing it now
back to talley id like you to brief my supervisors before we take over the scene
whatever you want
talley and martin hurry toward her troops the garage is dark lit only by the light that comes from the kitchens open door as dennis mars and a reluctant kevin
enter someone should stay with mr
what if he wakes up
annoyed thats why we tied him dumbass
now come here and see this dennis shows them a small casement window and pushes open the window to reveal a thick hedge excited these bushes follow the wall into
the neighbors yard
all we need is some kind of diversion and were home free
thats crazy dennis
the cops will see us
not if theyre looking at something else
lets burn the house
mars says it so simply that the moment is frozen
mars is holding the big claw hammer kneading it as if it was a living thing
his face is masked by shadows but his eyes both glow as if already reflecting flame we see dennis kevin and mars through a slit overhead as they emerge from
the garage and move back into the house thomas is watching them
he has cracked open the service hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way is clear the room is dark
when dennis and the others are gone the ceiling hatch lifts and thomas lets himself down
he slides onto the washing machine and then to the floor thomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on
he lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see
the beam cuts across a door to the garage car keys on key hooks and jennifers purse hanging from one of the hooks this is a small room off the
end of the laundry with a work bench a stool and shelves above the bench for walters hobby supplies thomas shines the light over the shelves spotting the hard plastic pistol case on the highest shelf
thats the target thats the goal thomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench dennis is in the doorway to the security closet handing out one of the money
bags to kevin we cant carry all this
its too heavy
ive been carrying you our whole fuckin lives
kevin drops the bag and tries to reason with his brother everything were doing is making it worse
you cant let him burn this house
dennis abruptly grabs kevin by the throat his face hard with fury nothings worse than listening to you
im warning you kevin stop holding me back
now you pick up that fuckin money and get ready to go
dennis glares at kevin another moment then lets go and steps back into the closet dennis lifts the second bag of cash when the monitors catch his eye the sheriffs
swat unit can be seen moving into position
dennis totally freaks theyre coming
kev mars theyre coming
dennis drops the cash and bolts out of the closet mars is placing two buckets of gasoline in the hall as dennis and kevin pound down the hall the cops
i got the gasoline we dont have time
dennis runs to the french doors
he sees lights at the rear of the property and shoots through the glass get the kids
theyre our only chance
dennis fires again and runs for the stairs thomas is straining to reach the pistol which is a fraction of an inch beyond his grasp when he hears dennis shouting
thomas glances helplessly at the gun case so near yet so far then scrambles off the bench and thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when he once more sees jennifers purse hanging on a key hook thomas jumps from the washer grabs the purse then scrambles into the ceiling as gunshots echo through the house martin maddox and her supervisors are gathered around talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood startled whos that shooting
martin whats going on
radio transmissions crackle over martins radio shots fired
we are taking fire on the back wall
talley immediately knows whats happening and he knows why theyre too close
i told you not to crowd him
pull back your people do not breach that house
talley sprints toward the cul de sac thomas races through the narrow black tunnel
he slips off the rafters and almost falls through the ceiling
hes losing precious time dennis and mars pound up the stairs getting closer to his room thomas pushes his way into his closet dennis and mars reach the second floor
thomas scrambles into bed just before dennis jerks open the door
dennis drags him off the bed and carries him out of the room talley martin and maddox run into position behind a sheriffs unit where a deputy has set up
the dedicated crisis phone talley grabs up the phone to the deputy this thing good
talley doesnt wait for the confused deputy to answer he presses the button in the handle that dials the phone what in hell are you doing
hes shooting at my men
the phone rings in talleys ear to maddox then get your men off the wall
to martin you breach that house were gonna have a bloodbath
i know this guy captain i can talk to him
to maddox order your men to stand down
the phone is still ringing
talley pulls the mike from the deputys car and speaks over the public address over the p
look out the window dennis
we are not entering the house
were pulling back
dennis is holding thomas around the neck using the boy as a shield
kevin is cowering on the floor and mars is holding jennifer
dennis snatches up the phone screaming into the phone you fuck
i got a fuckin gun to this kids head
ill killm you fuck
intercut talley outside its over now dennis

still screaming well burn this fuckin place down
i got gasoline all over in here
talley takes a deep breath he forces himself to speak quietly calmly no ones coming in
a couple of guys out here got carried away
dennis peers out the front
talleys careful manner is calming him goddamned right they got carried away
it looks like an army out there
talley mutes the phone to speak to martin to martin its over
hes cooling off
talley glances at maddox
maddox nods his expression saying that talley was right talley
back into the phone im here
i want a helicopter to take us to mexico

i gotta piss real bad
dennis cant help himself he laughs youre a funny guy talley
im going to put on an officer named will maddox

talley hands the phone to maddox who moves past talley for a better view of the house
talley looks grimly at martin he says he has gasoline set to burn the place
he mustve siphoned it from the cars
if you go in you cant use tear gas or flashbangs
the whole place would go up
not without humor looks like youre bailing out at the right time
returns her smile thats why you get the big bucks captain
talley is moving away when his radio pops chief base
keying his shoulder mike go
i couldnt find jane
she wasnt at the restaurant
you have her cell number
she didnt answer
they might be at the house
keep trying and let me know
im going to be here a little while longer
talley closes his phone and continues away dennis and kevin are at the television watching an aerial view of the sheriffs deploying around the house
jennifer and thomas are huddled by their father were surrounded
theyre all over the neighborhood
mars enters carrying candles and flashlights
he lights a candle and place it on a table what the fuck is that
theyll cut the power
mars tosses a flashlight to dennis what about my father
aw jesus not more of this
look at him
i think hes dying
to kevin and mars takem back upstairs but dont tiem like before
that little fuck untied himself anyway
dennis returns to the shutters as mars and kevin take the kids mars shoves thomas into the room then lifts the claw hammer
for an instant we think hes going to hit the boy but he smashes off the door knob instead
mars glares at thomas then pulls the door closed
the knob on thomass side is gone theres no way for thomas to open the door
but thats okay by thomas
he waits until hes sure that mars is gone and then he hurries back to his closet thomas pulls open the hatch fishes out his flashlight then dumps the contents
of jennifers purse on the floor
he picks up her cell phone
talley closes his eyes with a blissful expression as a familiar sound fills the bathroom hes taking a piss
his radio crackles chief base
talley finishes his business and keys his mike did you find jane and mandy
could you call me back on your phone
whats wrong with the radio
hesitantly other people can hear us
now talley is worried
he pulls out his phone and punches the speed dial
it rings only once intercut louise at her desk outside talleys office is something wrong with jane
we have a boy on the line
he says hes thomas smith and hes calling from the house
its a crank louise
cmon dont waste my time with that
his cell number belongs to the smiths
i think its real chief
i think this boy is inside that house
talley worries it only for a moment put him on
talley pushes out of the bathroom into he flags leigh metzger as he cups the phone to metzger get martin
as metzger hurries away we intercut thomas hiding in the shadows on his bed whispering so as not to be overheard into the phone this is chief talley
tell me your name son
im in the house thats on tv
dennis hit my dad and now he wont wake up
you gotta help him
talley can tell by the tremor in the boys voice this is for real slow down thomas
take it easy and talk to me
was your father shot
dennis hit him
his heads all big and he wont wake up
im really scared
how about you and your sister
where are you right now
in my room
talley hurries to a large sketch of the smiths floor plan laid out on the dining room table thats on the second floor
could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you
they nailed the windows
i cant getm open
martin enters with leigh metzger
talley cups the phone to give her the headline to martin ive got the boy on the phone
hes using a cell phone
back to thomas what was that son
i didnt hear you
if i try to climb out theyll see me on the security cameras
they would see you outside too thomas hears someone outside his door theyre coming
thomas hangs up jamming his phone behind the bed thomas
talley lowers the phone he says that his fathers hurt
if we have a man dying in there well have to go in
they have security cameras
rooney would see you coming
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger
he said that his fathers unconscious he didnt say he was dying
then i think we should wait
do you agree
talley finally nods you want me to stick around i could youve been here all day chief
take a break
see your family
if i need you ill call
talley looks like the most tired guy in the world
he nods his good night then turns away talley slides into his car outside mrs
hes got a lot on his mind and not all of it centers around castle way
he punches a number into his cell phone he listens to ringing and then his own voice answers this is jeff talley
leave your name and number after the beep
we hear the beep then into his phone jane
if youre there pick up okay
no one answers
talley closes his phone his apprehension increasing the bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside and wave talley through the assembled television microwave vans radio newsvans and reporters
are parked together in an empty lot one block from the front gate
ken seymore steps into the street speaking into a cell phone as he watches talley drive away into his phone hes leaving now
a traffic light on the outskirts of town deserted until talleys car pulls to a stop suddenly two masked men point guns at his head one from the drivers side
one from the passengers
theyre wearing jackets black ski masks and gloves
the man on the passenger side sports a big gold rolex so well call him the watchman meaning the gun do you see the fuckin gun
look at it
hes been blindsided by this insane shit but he knows better than to move take it easy
the man on the drivers side gets into the backseat then the watchman gets into the passenger side
the man behind talley hooks an arm around talleys throat while the watchman searches for talleys gun wheres your gun
im the chief
i dont carry it
the watchman nods at the backseater who releases talley
a dark green mustang roars up ahead of talleys car
a second car tucks in tight on talleys rear who are you
follow the mustang
we wont go far
the mustang pulls out and talley follows
the three cars turn into the alley
they stop the first and last cars bumper to bumper with talleys
the cars are so close to talley that his own vehicle is pinned he couldnt drive away now even if he wanted the watchman puts talleys car in park turns
off the ignition and takes the key
i know youre scared but unless you do something stupid were not going to hurt you
two more masked men approach from the other cars one coming to talleys window the other getting into the back seat behind the watchman
dont just fuckin sit there dumbass
do you understand
what do you want
these guys are going to take hold of you
dont freak out
its for your own good
the three men take hold of talley the man behind again looping his arm around talleys neck the other two each twisting talleys arms what is this
the watchman holds a distinctive white cell phone to talleys ear say hello
is that you
talley goes berserk
he bucks and tries to pull away but the three men hold tight the watchman closes the phone trying to calm talley i know i know shes all right
your kids all right too
cmon now relax
from this point on you control what happens to them
talley can barely breathe theyre holding him so tight can we let go
you past your shock and all that we can turn you loose and you wont do something stupid
you can let go
the watchman glances at the men they let go heres the deal walter smith has two computer disks like this in his house
theyre labeled marlon and al
the watchman holds up a thick black zip disk
talleys expression tells us that this is the weirdest shit hes ever heard marlon and al
we want them
you will not let anyone go into that house or anything come out until my people recover these disks
i cant control what happens
the sheriffs are running the scene
you will re assume command
in two hours a group of my people will arrive at york estates
you will tell the sheriffs that they are an fbi tactical team
the watchman puts the white cell phone into talleys hand when this phone rings you answer
it will be me
ill tell you what to do
when i have what i want you get your family
marlon and al
i have people in york estates right under your nose
if you do anything except what im telling you youll get jane and amanda back in the mail
we clear on that
where are they
smith will know
the watchman and the others get out of talleys car
the doors slam shut
the watchman leans in when it rings answer
the watchman tosses the keys into talleys lap
we hear car doors open and close the cars front and back roar to life and speed away talley focuses on the mustangs license plate frantically scratching down the number
the place is deserted except for louise currently at her desk to monitor radio communications
talley enters looking as if hes stricken
louise cant help herself but to react you look terrible
chief are you all right
talley barely glances at her going directly to his office talley steps inside and peels off his uniform shirt
he takes a bullet resistant vest and a black sweatshirt from his closet
he straps on the vest then pulls on the sweatshirt
talley sits at his desk and lifts out a ballistic nylon pistol case from the lower drawer
he takes out his old swat combat piece this isnt a pussy mm its a finely tuned
caliber colt model
one shot one kill
talley ejects the empty magazine then loads it with a deadly efficiency
he slams home the magazine talley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt
hes ready to rock
the camera finds the photograph of talley during his days as a swat tactical officer he was one bad motherfucker
talley heads for the front door im going back to york
have larry meet me at the front gate
talley exits without a backward glance the helicopters orbit in the distance the empty lot with the news vans is in the background
talley turns into the development then stops at the side of the street where larry anders is waiting anders slides into the passenger seat
he sees a different talley now focused and grim whats up chief
talley stares at anders trying to decide can i trust him
will he rat me out to the watchman and cost the lives of my wife and child
did i do something wrong
talley gives him a slip of paper i want you to run this license plate and phone number
then i want you to find out everything you can about walter smith
the guy in the house
go back to the office
run his name through the fbi and the nlets database
i think hes involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are
anders glances at the slip again then tucks it away wow
sure right away chief
dont tell anyone what youre doing not louise not the other guys not the sheriffs
you understand me larry
i guess so
you keep your mouth shut
i will chief
get to work
anders climbs out and talley rockets away talley pulls up behind the sheriffs command van
martin surprised to see talley steps from the van im re assuming command of the scene
martin is surprised and angry excuse me
you requested our help
you turned over command and now im taking it back
were getting smith out of the house
talley heads for the cul de sac jennifer is on her bed in the darkness groggy with fear and fatigue
she hears someone outside in the hall thomas
the door knob rattles
jennifer slides out of bed and goes to the door thomas is that you
the door suddenly opens and mars is framed in the dim light
jennifer jumps back terrified what do you want
we cant make the microwave work
that seems so outlandish that jennifer is confused what
youre going to cook
mars grabs her hair and pushes her out the door mars shoves jennifer into the kitchen
two frozen pizzas are waiting on the counter make the pizza
i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine
under her breath how about dog shit
mars takes a carton of eggs and a package of hot dogs from the refrigerator with hot sauce and butter
jennifer takes a bowl from the cupboard
when she sets down the bowl she sees the handle of the paring knife by the food processor
jennifer breaks eggs into the bowl i need a frying pan
would you get one
over there under the range
as soon as mars turns away jennifer palms the knife and pushes it into the waist of her shorts talley joins maddox behind the car what put a wild hair
up your ass
i changed my mind
thats all you need to know
talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone thats been cut into the smiths telephone line
he lifts the receiver and presses a button
the phone inside the house rings intercut dennis inside smiths office
he answers that you talley
the one and only
we got a little problem out here dennis
you oughta try on the problem i got in here
i need you to let me talk to mr
dennis shoots a nervous glance at walter whos twitching and shuddering on the couch we been through that
we cant forget it
the sheriffs think you wont let me talk to smith because hes dead
they think you murdered him
maddox cant believe that talley is saying this low so that dennis cant hear what in hell are you doing
the guys right here
pressing dennis harder if you dont let me talk to him theyre going to attack the house
maddox grabs talleys arm his voice a low hiss youre gonna set him off goddamnit
screaming they better not
talley pushes maddox away and amps the pressure on dennis help me keep them out
let me speak to smith dennis
let me speak to him right now
dennis is freaking
he believes that the sheriffs are about to crash through the doors now talley throttles back he senses that dennis is at the breaking point and wants to coax him
back from the edge calmer coaxing talk to me dennis
help me help you
why cant you put smith on the phone
dennis finally makes the admission quietly he got knocked out
its like hes sleeping
he just lays there
talley gives a thumbs up to maddox who sits back in awe
this crazy shit is working to dennis now i understand
i can make them understand that
let me come get him
you bastards will jump me
if you wont let me come in then put him outside
youll cap my ass as soon as i step out the door
youve already helped yourself once dennis be smart again

dennis is at the edge hes looking straight down into his deepest fears
he finally relents fuck you talley fuck you
you and one other guy but thats it
i want you stripped
i gotta know you dont have guns
dennis slams down the phone talley lowers the crisis phone then looks at maddox bring up the ambulance
mobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the house
the ambulance waits behind the lights tactical officers with m s and m s hunker in position in case the program goes south talley and a paramedic named bigelow emerge
between the lights wearing only shorts and shoes
bigelow is carrying a collapsable stretcher they stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the front door
talley lifts his cell phone into the phone okay dennis we wont approach the house until youve closed the door
the front door opens a crack at first then wider
the line of officers behind the lights shifts over his shoulder easy
kevin and mars waddle out with walter smith between them
they put him down about six feet from the front door then return to the house to bigelow lets do it
talley and bigelow move forward
when they reach walter bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame
he peels back walters eyelids and flashes a penlight hows he look
hes got a concussion for sure
im going to brace him
as bigelow sets a cervical neck brace talley gets the creepy feeling that hes being watched
he turns toward the shutters and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own
talley stares at mars and mars stares back
its as if theyre locked in a contest of wills until lets get him on the stretcher
talley turns away to help bigelow ill support his head and shoulders
you lift his hips and knees
as they carry walter away talley glances back at the eyes
mars is still watching him are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows behind the lights
another paramedic takes the stretcher from talley
maddox is waiting with talleys clothes you ready to tell me whats going on
talley pulls on his pants no
talley stalks straight to the ambulance pulling on his sweatshirt as he goes a young physician named klaus is examining walter as talley steps up into the ambulance im the
chief of police here
i have to talk to him
aint gonna happen
weve got unequal pupilation
he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both
talley ignores the doctor and shakes walter by the face smith
what are you doing
walters eyes flutter one more open than the other
talley leans closer to smith wake up goddamnit
who are you
klaus tries to shove talley away but its like pushing a wall this man needs a hospital
talley grabs klaus by the arm trying to make him see use smelling salts give him a shot whatever
i just need a minute
bigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance
talley pounds on the wall shouting stop the fuckin engine
klaus and bigelow are both staring at talley
sheriffs and talleys own officers have gathered at the open rear of the ambulance to see what all the shouting is about klaus pointedly looks at talleys hand gripping his
he speaks slowly trying to make talley understand im not going to wake him
i dont even know that i can
just one question
talley stares at walter smith
so damned close
walter knows about the disks
walter might even know who has jane and amanda
but now walter cant talk talley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance as talley emerges from the van he pulls metzger aside i want you waiting in smiths
i want to know the second and i mean the second that he wakes up
as metzger hurries after the ambulance a phone in talleys pocket rings
hes startled and scared it might be the watchman
talley takes out the watchmans white phone but its not ringing
he answers his other phone into phone talley
its me chief
can you talk
talley notices that martin maddox and the others are staring at him
he turns away into his phone whatd you find out
the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills
the phone company shows no unusual cutting him off dead end its a clone
what about the mustang
it was stolen
talley lowers the phone in frustration then you get anything on smith
its like none of this exists
talley pockets his phone
he watches the ambulance pull away then strides back through the banks of lights to the nearest patrol car
he grabs the dash mike and keys the public address through the p
if youre safe call me
talleys voice echoes across the neighborhood
every cop in the cul de sac stares at him
he has addressed the house for apparently no reason
dennis shouts from his window ill be safe when im outta here you asshole
im not talking any more
talley drops the mike without a word and walks away howell is on the phone with ken seymore watching the televised news coverage with increasing alarm was smith talking
intercut seymore who is reporting from the york front gate as the ambulance roars away siren wailing i heard hes fucked up
theyre taking him to the hospital
goddamnit tell me what you know
did the cops go in
did smith have the disks
i dont know
talley talked those punks into letting smith out
hes fucking us over glen
that guy is fucking us over
howell slams down the phone
he breathes deeply taking a moment to center himself
he lifts the phone and punches a number i have another job for you
talley is by himself pacing at the curb well away from the other officers
he is holding his cell phone
finally it rings
talley answers listens then put him on
intercut thomas phoning talley in his room is my daddy okay
the doctors are taking care of him right now
are you safe
can you talk
i think so
i need your help with something
but if you think those guys could catch you then i dont want you to do it okay
im serious thomas i dont want you to get hurt
what do you want me to do
your dad has two computer disks
they have funny names marlon and al
he has lots of disks
i think he was working on them today so theyre probably in his office
could you find them and see who they belong to
dennis wont let me go to the desk
he makes me sit on the floor
talley absorbs the bad news like his last best hope of saving his family is circling the drain but i might be able to sneak into the office if theyre
then i could open the disks here in my room
i thought they locked you in your room
i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house
can you get into the office
i can get into the den
the office is right across the hall
talley thinks about what the boy is saying and what hell have to do to get marlon and al if i get rooney into the back of the house can
you find the disks without being caught
talley glances toward the swat command van as he comes up with a plan martin maddox and several of her supervisors are gathered outside the van as talley approaches martin
sees him coming and steps away to meet him
shes pissed off and she wants answers i want to know what in hell youre doing
im looking for you
i need your tactical unit
im not stupid
you cant get out of here fast enough then you take back command you agree to wait on smith then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him
out interrupting dont question me captain
this is my crime scene
shouting over him then when you get him you damn near assault the man in the ambulance
what is going on
talley glares at her half a heartbeat from going off and then he throttles back simply im a negotiator captain
thats all you need to know
now are you going to help me or not
martin weighs the determination in his eyes
shes angry shes resentful and she wants to knock talley onto his ass but instead she glances back to her van maddox
lets give the man a hand
dennis steps through the double doors that open from the entry and admires the room rich paneled walls soft leather couches and chairs and a lush beaten copper bar
walter smiths office is directly across the hall
dennis saunters behind the bar letting his fingers play over the copper then pours a stiff ketel one on the rocks
kevin appears behind him watching as dennis takes a seat on one of the leather bar stools then peels a hundred off a thick roll and drops it on the
bar to an imaginary bartender keep the change mman
dennis takes a deep drink of the vodka as kevin approaches were fucked
were fucked until we think of a way out then were rich
there is no way out
for chrissake please
help me celebrate
i figured it out
going to prison
dennis enjoys another stiff belt no dumbass talley
talleys the guy who keeps us in here and talleys the guy who can let us out
dennis grins as if hes discovered the wisdom of the ages cops want to be rich like everyone else
all we have to do is share
leans closer and lowers his voice and if he wants someone to swing for the chinaman well givem mars
mars is standing in the doors large and ominous
for an insane moment dennis thinks that mars has heard but then the foods ready
dennis grins then shoves kevin out of the room ahead of him the three of them disappearing toward the kitchen as the camera drifts up to an air vent in
the ceiling through the slats in the grate to thomas watches them leave through a hole in the air duct
when hes confident that they are gone he continues along the crawlspace to a service hatch that opens down into the wine cellar is a climate controlled closet behind the
bar fitted with floor to ceiling wine racks
the ceiling hatch lifts and thomas climbs down the racks to the floor
he eases open the door and peeks out behind the bar
the den is bright with light and empty thomas lifts his cell phone whispers into the phone its me chief
im in the den
talley maddox and several tactical officers are lined along the rear wall watching the house
talley with a phone to his ear is looking through a night vision scope he can see into the kitchen through the french doors
mars and jennifer are inside and as we watch dennis and kevin enter into his phone okay bud here we go
talley hands the scope to maddox then keys his radio mike into his mike captain
kill the lights
dennis and kevin are digging into plates of pizza and eggs when the house goes dark shit
its the cops
the backyard erupts explosions from starflash grenades jump and careen over the swimming pool like new year fireworks
it sounds like world war iii dennis throws himself behind the kitchen counter the house now dark thomas scurries to the double doors
he peeks around the corner to see if the coast is clear then darts across the hall to the office is lit only by the flickering candles
thomas checks his fathers computer no disks
he searches through the papers scattered over the desk but finds nothing then he opens the drawer the disk case that his father put there earlier is waiting
thomas opens the case marlon
he found them
the starflash grenades burn out as talleys amplified voice echoes into the house its time to talk face to face dennis
come out just you and well talk
whats he doing
whats going on
theyre trying to blindside us
check the front
mars lurches to his feet and hurries to the office thomas is heading for the door when he hears footsteps coming fast toward the office thomas reverses course and ducks
under the desk
he pulls himself into a ball and tries not to breathe mars is in the room
the desk is a great oak monster big as a boat
it sits on curvy legs that leave a gap between the desk and the floor
thomas can see feet the feet go to the windows whats going on out front
the feet turn toward the desk
thomas tries to squeeze himself smaller mars
what the fuck are they doin
the feet come to the desk mars
get back here
the feet hesitate then finally walk away thomas scrambles from under the desk and darts across the hall talley approaches the house
he can see flashlights moving in the kitchen come on dennis
talk to me
dennis doesnt answer so talley moves closer
he spreads his hands wide im unarmed
im looking at you
get out here and lets talk
dennis comes to the french doors
he stuffs his pistol into his pants and opens the doors you got a sniper out there gonna shoot me
only if you try to grab me
we couldve shot you from the wall
dennis considers that and accepts it
he steps out of the house and walks over to talley youve been in there a long time
whatre you waiting for
would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life
id be trying to get the best deal that i could
maybe thats what im doing
can i reach in my pocket show you something
dennis rooney steps closer because he doesnt want anyone else to see the wad of money he pulls out thats fifty hundred dollar bills
they got money in this house talley more than youve ever seen
dennis pushes the money back into his pocket
how much would it be worth to you getting me out of here
so thats what keeps dennis in the house money
this is the first that talley has heard of the money you picked a bad house to hole up in son
two hundred thousand cash right in your pocket no one needs to know
theres a million dollars in there maybe two million
ill give you half
talley stares at dennis wondering how much to tell him and whether or not it will do any good the man you sent to the hospital is a criminal
he has partners
this is their house and their money and they want it back
these simple facts settle on dennis like a funeral shroud everything that smith said earlier now makes a horrible sense you cant imagine the fucking youre going to get
denniss eyes fill with defeat and helplessness it aint been a good day chief
give up dennis
let these people go
at least youll have your life
dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed the darkness in the house swallowing him like dirty water
the power is turned on
the house comes to life as talley turns away his phone once more rings thomas is hunkered with his computer behind his bed so that the camera cant see him
intercut talley now back in the cul de sac can you open them
i opened marlon
i think its somebodys taxes
look for names
does it say whose taxes they are
thomas scrolls through a spread sheet i dont see any people names
its all businesses
see if you can open al
thomas changes disks and opens al yeah
heres a name
this is somebodys personal tax who is it
then noise in the hall theyre coming
thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in talleys ear
talley recognizes the name as easily as an east coast cop would recognize john gotti and realizes the stunning import of smith possessing sonny benzas financial records sonny benza
talley sprints across the cul de sac to his nearest officer jorgenson and keys jorgensons shoulder mike into the mike leigh
metzger answer me
im at the hospital
put a guard on smith
i want you with smith until i get there
whats going on
get in the car
talley drops the mike and shoves jorgenson toward the car marion clewes is stepping from his car as talleys police unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights marion
watches talley and jorgenson rush into the er then he frowns and punches the speed dial on his phone into his phone were too late
the police are here
talley and jorgenson huddle in the hall with klaus and the er supervisor dr
metzger is outside walters room in the background im posting a guard outside his room but well need help from hospital security
is my staff in danger
not with my officers here no maam
metzger steps into walters room then reappears hey
hes waking up
talley and klaus press for the room walters eyes flutter open
his voice is slurred but understandable where am i
klaus peels open walters eyes passing his penlight over one then the other canyon country hospital
do you remember your name
it takes walter a few moments to answer walter smith
all of walters memories come flooding back and he tries to sit up
klaus forces him down where are my children
theyre still in the house
walter looks at talley
he has never seen talley and has no idea who he is im jeff talley the bristo chief of police
so far as we know your children are okay
chief talley is the one who got you out
to klaus i need to talk to him
this time klaus is hard pressed to refuse
he nods then steps away talley turns back to walter smith and lowers his voice sonny benza has my wife and daughter
he wants the disks marlon and al
he took my family to make me help
talleys eyes fill
his tears drip on the sheets
walter looks away i dont know what youre talking about
hes going to kill you
dont you know that
he cant take the chance that youll talk
klaus returns and places a hand on talleys shoulder thats enough
please but when he looks back at walter he realizes that another minute will do no good walters eyes are once more closed
talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot
he pounds the hood cursing awash in rage and frustration and then a phone rings
talley takes out the phones
the white phone is ringing
the watchmans phone talley answers furiously the two of them instantaneously screaming at each other you dumb fuckwad cop you fucked up bad
do you think im going to let you murder someone
you want a blowtorch on your daughters pretty face
ill go in that fuckin house right now
ill give those disks to the real fbi you cocksuckingmotherfucker
and ive got smith
ive got smith
a profound silence fills the parking lot both men now purged
when the watchman speaks again his voice is measured i guess we each have something the other wants
i guess we do
my people are good to go
you know who i mean
your phony fbi assholes
were almost home you and me
keep your shit together
this isnt l
what do you mean by that
you dont want another dead child on your conscience
the line goes dead dennis is pouring another stiff glass of ketel one i shouldnt have told him about the money
now talley is gonna keep it for himself
kevin joins him at the bar
mars is by the doors he said that
dennis downs a big hit of vodka then moves to the couch if we dont escape we gotta get the word out about the cash
thats how well stay alive
what are you talking about
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it
hes gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights
hes probably planning it right now
hes not going to kill us
kevin youre so fuckin stupid
kevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him dennis has clearly lost his mind and kevin has reached the end of his rope its over
we have to give up
fuck its over
that moneys mine
that moneys fucked up your brain
talleys going to get tired of waiting for us to give up and well all be fuckin killed
dennis tips his glass like a toast then we might as well die rich
im not going to die for this
kevin slaps the glass away
dennis boils up from the couch
he grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee table dennis hammering kevin in a furious rage until he runs out of gas youre my fuckin
anchor kevin the fuckin lead around my life that ive been draggin like a cripple leg
dennis gets up and steps back get this into your stupid head kevin
were not leaving without the money
beaten and whimpering kevin crawls away
dennis watches him crawl out of the room then looks at mars you got something to say
i like it here dennis
im never going to leave
dennis returns to the bar
when he looks around again mars is gone melted into the darkness
jennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves
she reaches pulls the knife from her shorts keeping it hidden as she backs away kevin steps inside leaving the door ajar what do you want
keep your voice down
im taking you and your brother out of here
jennifer now sees the marks and cuts on his face what happened
do you want to go or not
im offering you a way out of here
i cant go without thomas
all three of us will go but we have to move fast
mars and dennis dont know im doing this
how can we get out
dennis and mars are in the den
ill get your brother then come back for you
well go down the stairs and out the front door you understand
kevin goes back to the door then considers her
maybe he wants to apologize for all this but the best he can manage is put on some shoes
kevin slips out and pulls the door closed
as kevin emerges from the room he comes face to face with mars
mars is a great black shadow in the dark only inches away
kevin steps back you scared the shit out of me
i was looking for you
dennis wants you to watch the monitors
i heard you with the girl
kevin takes another step back but mars follows him staying uncomfortably close its over mars
if we stay the cops will kill us
dont you get that
mars seems thoughtful steps aside i get it
if you want to go go
kevin expected mars to stop him but mars is letting him go
kevin turns away and hurries down the hall talley is returning to the hospital
as he turns into york estates hes stopped by one of his officers dale cooper
talley rolls down his window to see what cooper wants come fbi guys showed up chief
they said you were expecting them
they here now
youll seem up the street
talley nods and continues through the gate two gray econoline vans are parked at the curb beneath a street light four men in the lead van two in the rear
talley pulls up behind them then gets out of his car
he walks up the middle of the street to the lead van eyeballing the men in the vans they all have short haircuts and are wearing black tactical fatigues
some of them wear ball caps that say fbi
the man in the passenger seat mr
jones gets out
he looks the part of fbi swat black tac fatigues jump boots buzzed hair
a pistol hangs under his left arm in a ballistic holster let me see some id
something with a picture
i dont give a shit about your badge
talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo id
jones does the same in return okay heres mine
my name is special agent jones
are all of you named jones
dont be funny chief
you cant afford it
jones slaps the side of the van
doors open and the remaining five men climb out
they strap into vests with fbi emblazoned on the back then pass out load bearing gear knit masks and flash bang grenades
in a few minutes the white phone is going to ring
so lets get our shit straight before that happens
you used to be a cop
all of you used to be cops
i can tell by the way you move
dont worry about what we used to be
how do you people expect this to work
the sheriffs have a crisis response team here
whats my name
i asked you my name
you just saw my commission slip
whats my fucking name
special agent jones
think of me that way and you wont fuck up
ill handle the sheriffs
the men at the second van are now passing out mp s car s and loaded magazines what are you people going to do
you and i are gonna straighten this out with the sheriffs and then well wait for the man to call
when he gives the word we move
what does he have on you
i know why im doing this but what does he have on you
one of the other men hands an mp to mr
jones jacks the bolt to chamber a round
he slings his gun without answering lets go chief
time to get real
jones walks away and all talley can do is follow were at the end of a gravel road in the low foothills of pearblossom a farm community of fruit orchards
in the low foothills
a bristo camino police car pulls up outside a thirty foot caravan trailer and mikkelson and dreyer get out
mikkelson lights up the trailer with the radio cars spotlight krupchek lives in a shithole
the trailer is dark and silent
they walk to the door carrying their maglites
mikkelson tries the knob i guess we could jimmy it
i dont want to pay for breaking it
mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open
both officers cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at them christ that stinks
mikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside
dreyer sees it first mickey
look at this shit
mikkelson joins dreyer in the trailers tiny kitchen where teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and sink and floor
hundreds and hundreds of captain crunch and count chocula boxes all neatly folded and stacked hes burned them
dreyer shows her a box
the nose of each character has been burned with a cigarette he burned their noses
okay this is creeping me out
mikkelson opens the oven
she opens a cupboard
its filled with large glass jars
she opens another cupboard
shapes float in the jars suspended in yellow fluid
mikkelson and dreyer examine the shapes what are those rats
mikkelson opens the fridge then slams it looking like she wants to puke ohmigod
we gotta call talley
dreyer sees the expression on her face then looks at the fridge wondering talley jones and joness phony fbi team are moving down the cul de sac toward the house
with martin at their heels walter smith is in the federal witness protection program
when washington learned about the situation here they asked chief talley for his cooperation
this is bullshit
i shouldve been notified
im sure you will be captain but its after midnight
now if youll pull your people off the perimeter i want to get my people in position
martin looks like she wants to spit bullets let it go captain
goddamned small town bullshit
martin relents and stalks away just as talleys phone rings
both talley and jones tense at the ring thinking it might be the white phone but its not its mine
into his phone talley
chief its mikkelson
both mikkelson and dreyer are leaning against their car
they look shellshocked
mikkelson is making the call chief we just found krupcheks trailer
we just went in there
she trails off and looks at dreyer for help how do i say this
dreyer at a loss looks away he has human body parts in his refrigerator
he has five human heads
mikkelson cant handle it any more
she lowers the phone the shock that mikkelson is feeling sweeps over talley as well
he takes a moment to get his head around this into his phone mickey
call the state homicide bureau
dont touch anything just sit back and wait
talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house wondering what sort of monster is in there with thomas and jennifer
his gaze shifts to mr
jones who is watching him were getting those kids out of there
dennis is sprawled on the couch sucking the last few drops of ketel one from the bottle
he frowns at the empty bottle then lumbers to his feet calling kev
key kevin cmon back
im sorry i hit you
dennis weaves through the door carrying the empty bottle like his dearest friend dennis staggers into the kitchen cmon kev dont fuckin pout
its time to call it a game
he didnt want to be here anymore
the voice from the other side of the kitchen startles him
mars steps out of the shadows you mean he left as in went out the front door
i overheard him with the girl
even when i want to turn myself in he screws it up
did he take the kids with him
i dont know
jesus get upstairs and find out
if he took those kids were fucked
mars cross the kitchen and goes for the stairs without another word kevin
dennis throws the bottle across the room thomas is scared by all the shouting but he waits in the darkness until dennis quiets and then we notice that he is
no longer in his room hes in the hobby room once more trying to reach the gun thomas stacks two phone books on the bench then uses the phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf he can finally reach the gun case
he puts it on the bench then climbs down and opens the case
thomas is bouyant with confidence now he can protect himself and his sister
thomas shoves the gun into his pants and creeps back into thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when his foot slips and he bangs his head its so dark
in ehre that thomas cant see what made him slip but he tests the floor
his shoe makes a tacky sound
thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before and turns it on
a dark liquid like oil is spreading on the floor
thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet
he lets out more light and sees that the oil is red
thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door but he is drawn to it
he reaches out kevins lifeless body topples out collapsing in a heap at thomass feet
his neck is cut so deeply that his head is almost severed his eyes are open
jennifer is anxiously waiting for kevin
when she hears someone in the hall she thinks that its kevin but when the door opens its mars
he steps inside tall wide and massive as a bear
hes carrying the claw hammer
jennifer backs away kevin left without you
i dont know what youre talking about
mars turns off the lights
dont do that
turn on the lights
jennifer grows even more frightened
mars follows her across the room until she backs into the window youd better get out of here
kevins coming back
kevins gone your daddys gone everybodys gone
when mars reaches her he touches the hammer to the chest pressing to make it hurt now we can do whatever we want
mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as jennifer finds the knife in her shorts
she jerks free the blade and stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest but mars doesnt even step back he grips the handle moaning hideously as he pulls
out the knife
a red flower blossoms from the wound
jennifer tries to get past him but he grabs her throat and pins her to the wall youre going to enjoy this
he raises the knife to her face the scream from the laundry room having scared the shit out of dennis he has his gun out whos that
goddamnit whos there
dennis turns on his flashlight and sweeps the beam across the kitchen kev
is that you
dennis weaves across the kitchen pushing the gun ahead of him kevin if thats you say something
mars said you left
dennis steps through the door into dennis shines the light on the floor and sees the red ooze
he follows the blood to kevins body but even then doesnt realize what hes seeing kevin what the fuck
dennis steps closer and now he sees the open neck the grotesque white bone within the flesh only one other person in the house could have done this dennis hears
jennifer screaming upstairs dennis rushes from the room dennis slams through the door so heard that the door crashes into the wall
mars is across the room still holding jennifer by the neck dennis aims his gun youre dead you fuck
mars calmly pulls the girl in front of him blocking denniss aim
whats wrong dennis
whyre you so pissed off
its weird the way mars is acting so calm and all
but dennis can see the feat in jennifers face and her swollen eyes
she manages one word please
dennis tries to aim past her this fuck killed kevin
theres blood everywhere down there jennifer sobs
and when she does mars charges across the room holding jennifer like a shield
dennis hesitates only a heartbeat and then its too late jennifer crashes into him the full force of marss weight behind her knocking dennis backward into the hall they fall
through the door into a tangle on the floor
mars raises the hammer then brings it down smashing dennis over and over thomas emerges from the closet to see the carnage in the hall mars over dennis grunting like
a pig as he turns dennis into pulp and jennifer crawling away splattered with blood thomas pulls the gun from his pants and darts past mars into the hall thomas grabs jennifers arm and pulls her toward the stairs cmon jen
mars heaves to his feet and turns after them thomas jerks up the pistol with both hands ill shoot you
mars stops blood dripping from his face and hands and the hammer
jennifer pulls her brother keep going
they back toward the stairs thomas trying to hold the gun steady
mars follows spreading his arms wide as if to embrace them everyones gone
we can do whatever we want
we can do anything
ill shoot you
im not kidding you better stay away
mars keeps coming thomas pulls the trigger
mars stops frozen by the sharp sound thomas pulls again
click click click no bullets
thomas and jennifer sprint for the stairs jennifer and thomas crash down the stairs and spill into the entry
thomas goes to the front door but jennifer pulls him away no
they have everything nailed
they race away down the hall just as mars reaches the bottom of the stairs mars is closing
jennifer and thomas scramble through the bedroom only paces ahead of him
they run straight into jennifer and thomas slam the door and throw the bolts just as mars crashes into the door jennifer and thomas have made it
they are shaking and scared but they are safe
he cant reach us in here
mars pounds on the door with the hammer
they can see him on the monitors
slow rhythmic pounding
then he walks away whats he doing
they can see him on the monitors moving through the hall going into the entry
mars picks up a bucket of gasoline
he splashes gas on the walls and floor all the way back to the bedroom and then he empties the bucket on the security rooms door mars looks up at
the camera again and takes out a match
he flicks it with his thumbnail and it flares ohmigod hes going to burn us
mars tosses the match and the room erupts into flame talley is arguing with jones trying to convince the man that they need to move into the house now weve
got to get those kids out of there
not until the man calls
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath
he kills people
theyve been in there all day
talleys phone rings
again they both think that its the white phone but instead its talleys personal phone into his phone talley
his voice cuts in and out broken by static mars killed kevin and dennis
were in the security room
hes burning the house thomas phone cuts out
talley turns toward the house and sees a growing column of smoke
he looks back at jones you do what you have to do im getting those kids
talley hurries away
jones stares after him then comes to his own agonized decision
he catches up talley
well secure the house but then we get the disks
talley accepts that they move toward the house the banks of floodlights abruptly shut off plunging the house and grounds into darkness the fire is spreading following the gasoline trail
through the hall and the rest of the house a thick layer of smoke covers the ceiling mars sees that the outside lights have been turned off and senses that the cops are making their move
thats all right with mars hes been waiting to die for most of his life mars checks the load in his pistol then melts away into the dark a moment
later throbbing music pounds the house talley and jones slip up to a side window at the front of the house
both are carrying fire extinguishers
they peer inside then jones uses a pry bar to lift the window talley enters first followed by jones
the air is thick with smoke and the music is confusing the hall outside the room is filled with flames talley points toward the bedroom then uses hand signals to
countdown the launch three
one jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike go they blast the flames with their fire extinguishers then plunge into the hall the sliding glass doors shatter as
one of joness men breaches the door
as he rolls to his feet mars shoots him from the flames a second man rolls through the door and mars shoots again laughing as the man writhes in flames
fight back the flames with their fire extinguishers working their way into its an inferno as talley and jones come through the door
they spot the two men on the floor just as mars rears up behind the flames
he is shirtless and glistening screaming maniacally is he fires his gun talley and jones fire in unison pounding mars with bullets and knocking him into the fire
mars thrashes and screams burning alive talley hears pounding inside the safe room jennifer and thomas
he fights his way to the security door which is covered with flames the kids are in here
wheres the office
help me goddamnit we can get the disks later
talley expects that jones will help but jones is aiming his gun we dont need you any more chief
we can get the disks on our own
but before jones can kill talley mars heaves himself up from the flames firing wildly
he hits jones in the head talley fires reflexively his powerful
kicking mars across the room and out the glass doors
talley turns back to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire extinguisher thomas
thomas its me
thomas and jennifer jerk open the door but shrink from the heat
talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher then pulls them into his arms stay close
were going to move fast talley shepherds jennifer and thomas past the flames they reach the entry and talley uses his pry bar to break open the door a wall
of cops are out on the street waiting to thomas are the disks still in your room
theyre right here thomas pulls marlon and al from his pocket talley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a spontaneous hug
they run out the door as we walter is resting comfortably when talley steps up beside his bed
talley is a mess smokey dirty greased with sweat quietly smith
walter opens his eyes then talley steps away
jennifer and thomas are standing behind him
they rush to their father daddy
are you guys all right
youre not hurt
our house is on fire
we almost burned
both children burst into tears and walter hugs them
he looks up at talley then gently eases his kids away to jennifer and thomas you guys step out for a second
i have to talk to the chief
walter waits until his children are gone and then did you find the disks
then you have everything
you can put them away
touches his wrist a man has my family
gold watch here
that would be glen howell
he was on his way for the disks
how do i reach him
talley is alone in his car his phone to his ear listening to the ring at the other end of the line
a familiar voice answers hello
two words glen howell
intercut howell in his motel room
he is thrown by getting this call how did you get this number

howell thinks about it
its a tough call because talley might be setting him up but theyre playing even hands talley still has the disks fuck the mall

talley tosses his phone aside then drives away a graphic identifies our location new york city
victor castellano is the old man that benzas people have mentioned
he is not a happy man in the best of circumstances and is even less happy now castellanos assistant jamie beldone is briefing him on events in the west the
house is in flames benzas accountant is with the cops and theyre stacking the bodies like cordwood
jesus christ its a clusterfuck
you wanted to let sonny handle it
i wouldve moved in when we first found out
castellano scowls at the younger man and by doing so he wouldve known we have spies in his organization
embarrassed yes sir
but what about the disks
if the cops end up with the disks were gonna see a whole lot of heat
i hate that mickey mouse bastard
i hated his father and i hate sonny too
always with the tan

people in the right place
sonnys a fuckup
if he pulls this off fine life goes on
but if the cops end up with those disks we cut our losses
i want a message sent no fuckups allowed
ill make the call
vic castellano watches beldone depart as he considers what is about to come the motel floats like an island of light in the middle of nowhere
a few cars are scattered throughout the quiet parking lot is hiding in weeds across from the motel keeping an eye on the road for talleys approaching vehicle
a radio transmission crackles quietly you see anything
ruiz keys the mike not yet
talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to mike ruizs ear buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot standing watch outside the pool of light
in the shadows gravel crunches behind him buster turns and talley cracks him across the face with his
he edges along the perimeter of the parking lot working as close as he can to a fat man who is leaning against the green mustang the door to a
ground floor room opens and glen howell steps out
talley recognizes howell from the big gold watch to the fat man keep your eyes open
he shouldve been here
howell returns to the room
the fat man steps away from the mustang and talley slams into his blindside using the
as a club
the fat man staggers and talley wraps an arm around his neck in a choke hold running him at the door talley rams the fat man into the door knocking
it open and shoving the fat man through talley explodes through the door with the fat man in front of him like a shield screaming police
glen howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed
duane manelli rolls out of a chair aiming from the floor in a two handed grip dont shoot
dont shoot him
talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men
he has his back to the wall and the fat man in front of him wheres my family
wheres my family you fuck
all three men are sucking air like freight engines
no one is shooting but if one person fires everyone will fire
everybody has something the other guy wants
thats the only thing holding them back take it easy
just take it easy
were here to do business
you said they would be here goddamnit
where are they
howell releases his grip on the gun and lets it swing free on his finger
hes trying to cool talley theyre close
let me make a call
you can see theyre okay
you said they would be here
howell takes out his phone and presses a number
talley shifts his aim from howell to the fat man to manelli into the phone put on the woman
howell offers the phone but talley is wary he cant let go of the fat man and he wont put down his pistol
howell carefully holds the phone to talleys ear into the phone jane
jeff were howell backs away with the phone you have the disks
talley takes out a single disk
its the one labeled marlon
he tosses it onto the bed you get the other one when i have my girls
not talk to them have them
where is it
howell considers the disk
if talley has the second disk in his pocket howell could just shoot him
but howell cant be sure i have to see if its real
howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the corner
he inserts the disk and waits for it to read
hes satisfied with what he sees all right
now the second one
first my girls
i get my girls you get the other disk
howell stares at talley again then picks up his phone into the phone bring them
stop the car outside the room but dont get out
the car pulls up directly outside the door
it was only seconds away
marion clewes is driving jane and amanda are wedged into the front seat beside him jane next to marion amanda on the far side
they are bound tight with their mouths taped immobile and helpless their eyes wide with fear into his phone aim your gun at the womans head
if he doesnt give me the disk kill her
marion presses a gun to janes temple talley jerks his gun toward howell ill kill you
you wont get the other disk
if you shoot me hell kill your daughter
do you want to lose both of them
talley aims at the man in the car he aims at howell
he tried so hard to save his family and now howell has him boxed the negotiation is over talley
now give me the disk or hell put her brain on the glass
talley looks at jane and amanda and his eyes fill
he mouths the words i love you
hes saying good bye
talley drops his gun and releases the fat man who stumbles away
talley tosses a second disk onto the bed
manelli scoops it up and tosses it to howell as mation appears in the door i gave the other one to the sheriffs and theyre giving it to the real
this ones a fake
youd better be kidding
howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top im a cop you asshole
what did you expect me to do
pretend all this never happened
howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man reading his own death sentence
there is nothing on this disk
i just want to take my family home
howell stands like a mechanical man incredulous are you out of your mind
quietly you fucked up glen
howell looks over as if seeing marion for the first time and gives him the order kill them
marion aims his gun directly between talleys eyes then points it at howell no fuckups allowed
marion shoots howell in the head then the fat man then manelli bambambam one shot one kill
he lowers his gun considers talley
talley doesnt move
its like a storm isnt it
this raging force that you cant control does whatever it wants and the best you can do is survive
a winner survives
the question being why arent i dead
why arent you killing me
what good would it do to kill you
the police already have the disk
marion considers talley another moment your wife is a very nice lady
marion goes to his car
he helps out jane and amanda then gets into his car and drives away
talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family
he scoops up jane and amanda hugging them tightly as the camera pulls up and away rising leaving this reunited family as marion clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead the
credits roll to black then the garage door slides up
benza backs out in his mercedes then roars to the front door
he pops the trunk then gets out and hurries to the front door
he sticks his head inside and calls to his wife the fucking jets waiting
would you get your shit out here
he picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to the car benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags
when he steps back around again a nondescript sedan is waiting in the drive no fuckups allowed
gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above palm springs
