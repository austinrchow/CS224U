written by bernardo bertolucci franco arcalli paul s stands on the street under a raised train bridge
he covers his ears in utter disgust at the unbearable noise a train makes as it roars overhead
he bellows to the heavens
as the train moves on he walks slowly despondent
lost in a private world of pain
behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking gaining on him
this is jeanne s
as she passes paul she turns to glance at him
we read a hint of empathy on her face
he is oblivious to her or anything else for that matter
she walks on dodging street sweepers as she covers the long walkway trying to forget the sad man she saw
we see her walk toward a story apartment building
paul with tears streaming down his face comes to reality as he also notices the building
he regards it
jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at rue jules verne
she reads a for rent sign on the door frame
she hesitates but then rings the bell
she checks her watch
she smiles to herself then descends the nearby stairs
she goes into a bar
jeanne comes in and speaks to the bartender
a phone token please
at the end on the left
jeanne goes to the telephone washroom
the telephone booth is occupied
as she waits she watches in disgust as an old lady cleans her dentures with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her mouth
jeanne studies her own face in the mirror puffing her cheeks up in judgement
as she does paul exits the phone booth still lost in anguish
after watching him leave jeanne uses the pay phone
she speaks to her mom
yes its jeanne
ive found a flat to rent in passy
im going to see it
she puts her foot up on the seat
we see her long boots as her short skirt hikes up
then ive got to go to the station to met tom
i promised him
ok see you later
jeanne talks to the crazy concierge through a small window who is smoking and has rollers in her hair
ive come to see the flat
i saw the sign
the concierge joins jeanne at the window
its always the same
nobody ever tells me anything
id like to see it
you want to rent it
i dont know yet
they rent they leave and im the last to know
do you think thats right
she sits at her desk and puts out her cigarette
if you want to go up alone she looks through her keys
im afraid of spiders
the key is missing
strange things happen
one of the apt
guests puts an empty wine bottle outside their door
they both take notice
they drink six bottles a day
jeanne thinks the place is like a funny farm
as the concierge trills out figaro she gives up and walks away
there must be a duplicate
she looks for it
here it is
jeanne against her better judgement goes back to the desk
she holds out her hand
the concierge puts the key in her you must be very young
she grabs and holds on to jeannes hand way too long laughing crazy hysterical
jeanne has to forcefully break away from her grasp
let go of me
she gets free of her and heads to the elevator rubbing her hand
the elevator arrives and she gets on
we watch her ascend and jeanne comes in the dark room and heads straight for the window
she opens it and the storm shutter
light streams in revealing paul sitting on the radiator
jeanne is startled when she sees him
who are you
you gave me a fright
how did you get in
he replies without looking at her
through the door
oh yes i left it open
i didnt hear you come in
i was already here
oh it was you who took it
i had to bribe the concierge
these old houses are fascinating
she walks up to the fireplace
an armchair by the fireplace would look good
the armchair should go in front of the window
are you american
youve got an american accent
he gets off the radiator and wanders into the next room for but she has followed him
she opens those windows also
he is forced into another room
as he studies a wicker chaise lounge she calls from the other room
are you going to take it
i dont know
she continues to look around
her curiosity of paul gets the best of her
she peeks around the corner and watches him sit
what are you doing
she thinks he is very odd as he plays with a lamp shade
she heads to the as the phone rings she pulls up her skirt and sits on the toilet for a pee
she looks around
she finishes and flushes the toilet as the phone rings on incessantly
the phone rings on
oh la la
should i answer it or not
they pick up the phone at the same time
paul eaves drops hello
hello to the caller hello hello
theres no one here
theres no one
i dont know
he puts the small lamp shade back
he hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise
jeanne continues to listen on her end unaware
paul sneaks around the corner
jeanne is startled
she hangs up the phone
so youre going to take it
i had already decided
but im not sure now
do you like it
i dont know
i shall have to think about it
he walks off
jeanne picks her hat off the floor lost in confusion
the front door slams
she walks toward the door
but paul didnt really leave
he walks slowly toward her
i thought youd left
he studies her for a moment
he takes her hat and drops it on the ground
he picks her up in his arms and carries to the window
he puts her down on the window sill
they start making out ferociously
he rips her panty hose undoes his zipper and penetrates her
they are lost in animalistic sex as she wraps her legs around him
they kiss savagely and hit the floor as they climax together
totally spent they roll away from each other
her skirt hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose
we can see her ample bush through the sheer fabric
they writhe on the floor trying to catch their breath
paul comes out the front door
he puts on his trench coat
jeanne lags behind trying to fix herself also
paul takes the for rent sign off the door frame as jeanne heads off still stupefied
he watches her descend the stairs and throws the crumpled up sign on the sidewalk
they go their separate ways
jeanne crosses the street while paul takes the raised walkway
jeanne runs through the crowd in a panic dodging people
she finds who she is looking for her boyfriend tom s
she runs into his arms like long lost lovers
all of the sudden a film crew appears filming their every moment
they kiss passionately
tom tries to untangle her from the cords
have they taken us for someone else
were in a film
he walks her and explains
were in a film
if i kiss you
he kisses her
it might be cinema
if i stroke your hair it might be cinema
they walk on as the sound engineer pokes a microphone in their faces
whats going on
do you know them
its a long story
in short portrait of a girl
its been accepted for television
and the girl is you
you might have asked me first
yeah but i wanted
jeanne smacks the microphone out of their faces
i wanted to start with shots of jeanne at the station meeting her fiance
yes i know them
theyre my crew
so you kissed me and you knew it was being filmed
youre a bastard
no youll see
it will be a love story
tell me jeanne darling
what did you do while i was away
i thought of you day and night and i cried
darling i cant live without you
that was perfect
he is thrilled
he tries to kiss her but she wont let him
she is still miffed
but she finally gives in
they have a catherine cleans the bathroom of excessive blood
paul sits on the other side of the privacy screen reflecting in a glum fog listening
she wrings out a washcloth frequently as she speaks
the excessive blood and water falling into a bucket
id have finished by now but the police wouldnt let me touch anything
they didnt believe it was suicide
she wipes a mirror
there was so much blood everywhere
they had fun making me do a reconstruction
she went there
she wipes another glass surface
she came through here
she opens the curtain to the shower tub
its inundated with she opened the curtain
she stares at the blood
its so much
she uses the shower head to rinse the blood off the tub
i copied all her actions
the guests were awake all night
the hotel was crawling with cops
they enjoy playing around with blood
she rinses the blood from her hands and arms
they were all spies
asking if she was sad if she was happy if you fought how long youd been married why you didnt have any children
disgusted and exhausted she sits on the edge of the tub
we switch to pauls side of the privacy screen
we see he is deeply disturbed by this situation
they got familiar right away
they said your boss is a bit unstable
do you know that he was a boxer
it didnt work out so he became an actor
bongo player revolutionary in south america journalist in japan
she begins to clean blood from the straight razor pauls wife used to kill herself with
one day he lands in tahiti hangs around learns french
then he comes to paris
he meets a woman with money marries her and
since then what has your boss done
paul pulls the curtains aside from the window
he looks out
he spies a black couple one a sax player in an adjacent building
she is attempting oral sex on him
i say can i clean up now
dont touch anything
do you really think she killed herself
he pushed me into a corner and tried to paw me
when the couple are spotted they stop
he starts playing his paul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning
turn the tap off now
theyll be doing the autopsy right now
paul walks to her side
why wont you turn the tap off
they told me to give you your razor back
she hands him the straight razor
he studies it
its not mine
they said they dont need it any more
the investigation is over
he grabs her hands violently and studies them
yes she had cuts there
he tilts her head back forcefully
and on the neck too
he pulls her out of the way and turns off the water
he pulls the shower curtain closed
he storms out of the bathroom leaving catherine there
when he is gone she opens the curtain and turns the water back on out of spite
formerly known as the passy viaduct
we see a great shot of the double decker road and rail bridge and pauls new the front door opens and jeannes hand comes in holding the the rest of
her peeks in
she spies a cat
she decides to make crazy noises at the animal crawling on the floor making it run for the hills
just then movers pop in carrying furniture catching jeanne off guard
excuse me where shall i put this
you could have rung the bell
the door was open
ill put it there
he puts the chair down in the middle of the room
she moves it to in front of the fireplace instead
in front of the fireplace
she heads to the front door but is stopped by
with and armfull of chairs
she tries to leave again but then runs into
what about the table
with a table
how do i know
jeanne regards the room
this is a king size
it wont fit
well your husband has no idea
all this in an hour
its not long
she leans against a wall and looks around flabbergasted
what a mess
we see paul in the doorway paying the movers
he comes in
jeanne is sitting in the chair in front of the fire place
the armchair goes in front of the window
he drags the chair and her to the window instead
but i only came to return the key
to return it to you
i dont care about the key
take your coat off
he takes his coat off and hangs it on a door handle
take your coat off and help me
get those chairs and bring them here
he grabs the table and brings it to the dining room
he places the table
she follows with the chairs
put them on the other side
take that too
you didnt waste any time
but he has wandered off to another room
ive got to go
ive got to go
she walks across the mattresses with her boots on
paul leans against the wall studying the room
the bed is too big for the room
i dont know what to call you
i dont have a name
do you want to know mine
i dont want to know your name
he covers her mouth and backs her up agianst a wall
you dont have a name and i dont have a name either
not one name
she throws his hand off and puts some space between them
she leans against the adjacent wall
maybe i am but i dont want to know anything about you
i dont wanna know where you live or where you come from
i wanna know nothing nothing nothing
you scare me
back to the other wall
you and i are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here
he indicates outside the window
because we dont need names here
dont you see
were gonna forget
everything that we knew
all the people
all that we do
wherever we live
were going to forget that everything everything
but i cant
i dont know
are you scared
she walks to the bed inviting him with her eyes
rosas mother roots through paul and rosas belongings
searching for answers
and maybe some tokens of her paul waits listening in the hallway
he loathes the upcoming reunion
annoyed by all the rattling while she searches he bites the bullet and goes in
he catches her in the armoire
she stops her rooting
i thought youd be here
i expected you later
i took the first train
we notice the irony of the sign on the door it reads privy oh paul
how awful paul
she walks timidly up to paul
after a moment they embrace each other in a grief stricken hug
paul grows bored of the reunion he taps his fingers on the closet he leans against studying the accessories of the decor and her silly hat
she sits spilling her grief on paul as if it is a therapy papa is in bed with asthma
the doctor wouldnt let him come
its better like that
she starts rummaging again this time through rosas empty purses spilling them out one at a time on the bed behind what are you looking for
something that would explain
a letter a clue
i told you theres nothing nothing at all
he takes the purses and puts them back
she sits on the bed in despair
my little rosa wouldnt have
nothing for her mother
not a word
its useless to keep on searching
not even for you her husband
he closes the armoire
you need to rest
i think room is free
he gathers her belongings and leads her up the stairs
they pass some guests coming down
rosas mother stops on the stairway reflecting painfully
with a razor
paul goes on ignoring her
paul comes in and puts her belongings on the bed
what time did it happen
i dont know
in the evening
i already told you on the phone
when i found her i called the ambulance
paul goes out to the hallway to gather himself
after you called papa and i stayed up all night talking about rosa and you
papa kept whispering as if it had happened in our house
rosas mother thinks he left
paul is broken out of his trance
the sudden yelling has he peers angrily at her in room
where did it happen
in one of the rooms
did she suffer
ask the doctors
theyre doing the autopsy
he goes into the
he turns off the annoying running water
he looks at himself in the mirror
she unpacks her suitcases on her bed
he rejoins her
she takes out some cards
i already had some announcement cards
ive seen a lot of death
i think of everything
ill prepare her a beautiful room with flowers
the cards clothes relatives flowers
youve got everything in that suitcase
you didnt forget anything
but i dont want any priests here
we have to
funerals must be religious
paul explodes she jumps a foot back
he dares her with his eyes enraged
rosa didnt believe
nobody believes in the fucking god here
he throws her suitcase against the wall
paul dont shout
dont talk like that
he snatches the paper from her hands
the priest doesnt want any suicides
the church doesnt want any suicides do they
theyll give her absolution
he raises his hand threatening to hit her
scared she pushes on
absolution and a nice mass
thats all i ask paul
rosa is my little girl do you understand
why did she kill herself
she starts weeping
why did she commit suicide
he pummels the door with his fists
you dont know
you dont know
he closes her door
some of the other guests pop their heads out to see what the commotion is
he gently closes their doors in a mind your own business sort of way
there is always the miss know it all busybody type though
she sheepishly reopens her door
paul walks calmly back to it and slams it in her face jeanne enters the already open door
she looks around the still sparsely furnished living room
paul has decided his bed fits better in here
the bottom mattress is on the floor in the middle of the room
he leans against the wall and top mattress waiting for jeanne
he knew shed be there
she takes a seat on the bottom mattress and takes off her boots
he watches her and does the same with his shoes
kicking them off and catching them in the air playfully
paul and jeanne sit nude entwined wrapped around each ooh
lets just look at each other
its beautiful without knowing anything
they regard each other for seconds
maybe we can come without touching
come without touching
he leans his head back and closes his eyes
screwing up his face
she copies him
are you concentrating
did you come yet
i didnt either yet
youre not trying hard enough
they stop the silliness
she wraps her arms around his neck
i shall have to invent a name for you
oh jesus christ
oh god ive been called by a million names all my life
i dont want a name
im better off with a grunt or a groan for a name
do you wanna hear my name
paul does some playful animal sounds
ape sounding grunts and such
he contorts his face and looks silly
its so masculine
listen to mine
she mimics his idea and makes her own playful animal sounds
i didnt get the last name
she redoes the sounds for him
he joins her
their animal tom and his film crew record the ducks for b
sound clips while they wait for jeanne
this includes roosters pigeons and annoyed nail filing by one of the crew
finally jeanne opens the gate door sheepishly
she is late and has a different hair style
tom is miffed for continuity sake
you shouldnt have done that to me
she is much more excited about the new perm
its not a wig its my hair
she closes the gate
doesnt it suit me
tell me dont you like it
of course i like it
listen you know
i dont know
you have changed and yet you havent
i can see the shot now
he twirls around setting up the shot between his hands and his minds eye
the camera is up high
it descends slowly and follows you
you come forward and it moves in on you
theres music too
it gets closer and closer to you
im in a hurry
she moseys off
cant we talk a little first
tonight we improvise
jeanne kneels in front of a head stone that reads mustapha
he was my childhood friend
he used to watch me for hours and hours
i think he understood me
a voice from behind jeanne pipes in
dogs are worth more than people
jeanne smiles familiar
meet olympia my nanny
mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich
if someone well dressed came in he never stirred
but if someone scruffy came in you should have seen him
what a dog
the colonel trained him to recognise arabs by their scent
olympia open the front door
give me a kiss
jeanne stands and kisses her on the cheek through the gate
go and open it
olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues
faithful admiring and racist
we watch olympia walk to the manor house as jeanne waxes nostalgic
slowly the rest of the property is revealed to us
after papa died we moved back to the family home for a while
my childhood was made up of smells
musty smells the smell of walls and rooms
a group of kids runs into the yard
children used to come and play in my jungle all day long
growing old is a crime
jeanne holds up a picture
she points to people as she describes them
thats me there
and thats mademoiselle sauvage the teacher
she was very strict
and very religious
olympia chimes in again from behind the camera crew
she was too good
she spoilt you
the camera crew turns the camera on her
jeanne has a different picture pointing again
they turn back to jeanne
my best friend
she married the pharmacist and has two children
its like a village here
we all know each other
olympia chimes in again from behind in an open door
i couldnt live in paris
the camera turns on her then back to jeanne
were safe here
its odd looking at the past
he walks to her
why is it odd
its fantastic its your childhood
its everything i was looking for
he turns on his camera crew who is under his heels shewing them out
what are you up to
to the lead crewman who are these zombies who are always following you around
to all of them scoot
the door the door
he starts opening all the doors in the manor
im opening the door
im opening all the doors
what are you doing
setting up my shot
there it is
ive found it
olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in
imagine her nerve in her own house
tom is the typical rude french diva director
what are you doing there
he turns his attention back to jeanne the subject of his thats it
do you see
like a car you go into reverse gear
close your eyes
she closes her eyes
he guides her backwards by the shoulders through the manor
close your eyes
thats it come on
come on backwards
go back to your childhood
jeanne backs to a row of pictures
she touches each and recalls the subject
take off and return to your childhood
in full uniform
dont be afraid
overcome the obstacles
papa in algeria
he starts a countdown of ages as if he is hypnotizing her
jeanne backs into a desk
jeanne kneels down in front of the desk
my favorite route when i was eight
she crawls under a table
she finds a notebook in a secret my old notebook
she reads from it
theme the countryside
exposition the countryside is cow country
the cow is all dressed in leather
the cow has four sides the front the back the top and the bottom
isnt that good
she reads on
here are my cultural sources
le grand larousse
i just copied from it
physiological function comprising the discharge of menses
male copulation organ measuring five to forty centimeters
thats le petit robert
she shows him a picture she has found that she drew as a tom
my first love
my cousin paul
my first love
but his eyes are closed
his eyes are closed
he played the piano divinely
thats how i remember him
jeanne and tom walk bundled together as jeanne reminisces
sitting at the piano
his fingers would skim the keys
the film crew follow them filming
olympia stumbles behind watching
he played for hours and hours
at the bottom of the garden there were two big trees
a plane tree and a chestnut tree
after mass on sundays we used to sit there each under our own tree
it was wonderful
we sat gazing into each others eyes
all wander the garden
arent my trees beautiful
they were my jungle
they come upon the crowd of kids again
one kid is squatting behind some thatch doing his business
what are you doing
having a shit
the boy pooping stops and pulls up his pants
no were doing a poo
jeanne scolds them
shame on you doing it in my jungle
run for it
they scatter towards the stone wall with olympia and crew oh these dirty little arabs
go and shit in your own country
the kids climb the wall for escape from the crazy adults
dont stop whatever you do
tom wanders back over to jeanne while olympia and the crew continue to scare off the kids in the b
did you get it
olympia was great
itll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of paris
its a real jungle here
so tell me about your father
i thought wed finished
im meeting someone for work
but the colonel
but jeanne is off
we are back at pauls new place
jeanne wanders the room topless but covering her breasts with a pillow
she continues to wax nostalgic about her father
the colonel had green eyes and shiny boots
i worshipped him
he was so handsome in his uniform
what a steaming pile of horseshit
pissed she throws the pillow she was covering her ample breast with at paul
we now see paul is lounging on his mattress pant legs rolled up past his knees toying with a harmonica and drinking from a wooden cup
all uniforms are bullshit
everything outside this place is bullshit
besides i dont want to hear about your stories about your past and all that
he died in algeria in
or or or
and dont joke about things like that
listen why dont you stop talking about things that dont matter here
what the hells the difference
she huffs over to the other side of the room crossing her arms pouting
so what do i have to say
what do i have to do
he turns on to his back to evince his crotch
come on the good ship
he plays a tune on his harmonica
she sneaks onto the bed in why dont you go back in america
he stops playing the tune
i dont know
bad memories i guess
my father was a
whore fucker bar fighter
and he was tough
my mother was very
and also a drunk
one of my memories when i was a kid was of her being arrested nude
we lived in this small town
we lived on a farm
and id come home after school and shed be gone
i used to
i used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and i liked that
an irish country jig plays over the monologue
one time i was all dressed up to go out and take this girl to a basketball game
and i started to go out and my father said you have to milk the cow
i said would you please milk it for me
and he said no get your ass out there
so i went out and i was in a hurry and didnt have time to change my shoes
and i had cow shit all over my shoes
and on the way to the basketball game it smelled in the car
i dont know
i i cant remember very many good things
there was a farmer a very nice guy
old guy very poor and worked real hard
i used to work in a ditch draining land for farming
and he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe
half the time he wouldnt put tobacco in it
and i hated the work
it was hot and dirty and
it broke my back
all day long id watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe
and i used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off
and i always lost
i never saw it fall off
id just look around and itd be gone and then the new one would be there
and then we had a beautiful
my mother taught me to love nature
i guess that was the most she could do
in front of our house we had this big field
it was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named dutchy
and she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldnt see them
so shed have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were
and it was
and she never caught the rabbits
jeanne looks up from the bed mischievously
you have been had
i dont wanna know anything about your past baby
you think i was telling you the truth
jeanne flaps her arms
paul twills his eyebrows in response
jeanne climbs on the bed with the top sheet like a lioness stalking her prey
im a red riding hood and youre the wolf
she covers him up with the sheet
then she uncovers his arm
what strong arms you have
she sniffs his arm
paul plays along
the better to squeeze a fart out of you
she plays with his hands
what long nails you have
the better to scratch your ass with
she reaches under the sleeve of his shirt to his chest
oh what a lot of fur you have
the better to let your crabs hide in
she lifts the sheet from his face moves his harmonica and looks in his mouth
ooh what a long tongue you have
he talks funny as jeanne holds on to his tounge
the better to
to stick in your rear my dear
she makes her way down to his crotch uncovering the sheet as she goes
she regards his private area
whats this for
thats your happiness and my
my ha penis
jeanne smiles on as paul reels off a list of foreign names for the male genitalia
jeanne gets a kick out of this
its like playing grown ups when youre little
i feel like a child again here
did you have fun as a kid
its the most beautiful thing
its beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy
i wasnt like that
i was writing poems
i was drawing castles
big castles with tower
a lot of tower
did you ever think about sex
paul mocks her
he gives her a love smack on the head
you were probably in love with your teacher
my teacher was a woman
and she was a lesbian
how did you know
my first love was my cousin paul
im gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names
i dont mind if you tell the truth but dont give me the names
well go on
tell the truth
he was dark very thin
i can see him
a big romance
i fell in love with him when i heard him playing piano
you mean when he first got into your knickers
he was a child prodigy
he was playing with both hands
ill bet he was
probably getting his kicks
we were dying of heat
in the afternoon when the grown ups were napping
you started grabbing his joint
well he touched you
i never let him
liar liar pants on fire nose as long as a telephone wire
no im not
look me straight in the face and say he didnt touch me once
he touched me but the way he did it
the way he did it
ok what did he do
behind the house there were two trees
a plane tree and a chestnut
i sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut
and one two three
we each began to masturbate
the first who came
paul is suddenly lost in his thoughts
he wanders to the wall leans on it and studies his harmonica
why arent you listening to me
when did you first come
how old were you
the first time
i was really late for school
i started running and it was downhill
all of a sudden i felt a strong sensation here
so i ran and ran and i came as i ran
the faster i ran the better it was and the more i came
a couple of days later i tried to do it again but no luck
paul climbs a tripod that is leaning against the wall
why arent you listening to me
he takes the pin out and it comes apart
he falls back
why do i feel like im talking to a brick wall when i talk to you
your solitude weighs on me
it isnt indulgent
it isnt generous
you are selfish
he finally looks at her
i can be by myself too you know
he smiles twirls a drum stick puts his harmonica on her head and goes into the next room
she throws the harmonica on the floor in disgust
as he fiddle farts around the apartment jeanne masturbates
paul is reunited with his small lamp shade
he puts it over his face and cries into it
jeanne has cum
she rolls off the mattresses onto the floor she rocks back and forth on her haunches
a siren screams outside
she hugs the wall
paul is lost in grief crying harder
sax music plays from a room in the hotel
its soothing and nice
nevertheless rosas mother roams the room sleepless a crochet blanket wrapped around her
paul sleeps on the couch
she covers him with a the blanket he throws it on the floor
i cant sleep with this music
i came to this hotel a long time ago to spend one night
and i stayed for five years
when papa and i had the hotel people came here to sleep
now theres all sorts
they can hide take drugs play music
rosas mother reaches out and strokes pauls arm
take your hand away
she continues stroking
youre not alone paul
he sits up calmly taking her hand in his own then
bites she pulls her hand back in obvious pain
im starting to understand
do you want me to make them shut up
ill make them shut up
paul gets up and turns off the master light switch
rosas mother stands scared
what are you doing paul
paul stalks toward her in the dark
whats the matter mother
are you upset
theres nothing to be upset about
it takes so little to make them afraid
ill tell you what theyre afraid of
he leads her by the arm to the stairs
theyre afraid of the dark
come on mother
meet my friends
put the light on
they look up the stairs to all the guests that are out of their rooms
you should meet a few clients of the hotel
id like you to say hello to mom
mom this is mr juicehead junky here
mr saxophone hes
hes our connection mom
he gives us some hard stuff once in a while
and right here is the beautiful miss blowjob of
she still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out
the light paul

this is mom
you afraid of the dark mom
shes afraid of the dark
oh poor thing
all right sweetheart
ill take care of you
ill give you a little light
ill give you a little light
dont you worry about a thing
paul turns the lights back on
the guests who are gathered on the stairs scurry back to their rooms
rosas mother stares on as the commotion clears
a guest comes in the front door carrying newspapers
this is marcel s rosas lover
he takes off his hat for her
good evening madame
paul saunters into the room
he surveys the ironic scene
good evening marcel
marcel picks up on the awkward energy
he heads up the stairs to his room
paul hands him a key on the way up
do you like him
he was rosas lover
jeanne naked roots through pauls coat pockets
she finds his razor but scoots to the sink when she hears him coming
she starts applying makeup and singing
paul enters the bathroom
he takes his shaving accoutrements razor strop brush etc
out of his coat pockets
jeanne watches him intently in the mirror
he joins her at the large basin sink
she pretends to have been putting on her make up all along
she resumes her song
what am i doing in this apartment with you
paul starts putting his shaving cream on with a shaving brush
lets say were just taking a flying
a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut
so you think im a wore
he mocks her obvious mispronunciation of whore
i think youre a what
you mean whore
yes a whore
no youre just a good old fashioned girl
trying to get along
i prefer to be a whore
she applies more makeup
why were you going through my pockets
to find out ooh you are
he mocks her mispronunciation of who this time
to find out ooh you are
well if you look real close youll see me hiding behind my zipper
well we know that he buys clothes in some big store
thats not much
but its a beginning
thats not a beginning thats a finish
lets forget it
how old are you
ill be this weekend
oh you dont look it
have you been in college
i went to
the university of congo
studied whale fucking
he sharpens his razor on the strop
barbers dont usually go to university
are you telling me that i look like a barber
no but thats a razors barber
he corrects her again
thats a barbers razor
barbers razors yes
or a madmans
he starts shaving his neck with the straight razor
so you want to cut me up
that would be like writing my name on your face
like they do to slaves
slaves are branded on the ass and i want you free
im not free
you want to know why
why you dont want to know anything about me
because you hate women
what the hell have they ever done to you
either they always pretend to know who i am or they pretend i dont know who they are and thats very boring
im not afraid to say who i am
i am years old
where is your brain
halts maul schweinehund
she stands pouting
i know its tough but youre gonna have to bear it
she hits the sink and turns to us we see her ample bush
she crosses her arms and continues to pout like a child
you know these sinks are really beautiful
theyre very rare you dont find them any more
i think its these sinks that let you stay together
he has finished shaving
dont you think
he finally notices her pouting
whats all this
he throws her over his shoulder
he spins her around
she screams but goes with it
she loves it
he puts her down on the sink
she is laughing
i think im happy with you
he leaves the bathroom
she slaps the sink top childlike
do it again
paul is all dressed
he is ready to leave
we hear jeanne from the bathroom
she comes around the corner
shall we leave together
just in time for paul to slam the door in her face
hes a git
not even goodbye
she throws her purse at the door
a train enters the station
tom gets off
he searches for jeanne
when the train leaves we see her sitting on a bench on the adjacent track
she notices him first
what are you doing there
he starts running to the exit
ive got to talk to you
why didnt you speak on the phone
you must find someone else
for your film
he frames her with his fingers
because youre taking advantage of me
because you make me do things ive never done
because youre taking up my time
you make me do whatever you want
the film is over
a train roars into the station between them
jeanne is im tired of being raped
the train is gone but there is no one there
tom is gone
jeanne walks toward the exit
tom appears on her side of the platform
they stalk each other like animals
he slaps her hard in the head
she slaps him back
they fight until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms
marcel is in his red plaid bathrobe
he sits at his desk clipping coupons from a newspaper
paul comes in
he is in a matching red plaid bathrobe
you wanted to talk to me
go on then
you know i havent come to cry with you
do you mind if i carry on working
he does while paul roots around
it helps me a lot after what has happened
he takes notice of pauls robe
rosa wanted them identical
you cant tell me anything i dont already know
same colour same pattern
yes yes yes
paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from marcels desk
ive always wondered why you save newspaper clippings
is it work
or a hobby
i dont like that word
lets say its some extra cash
i do it for an agency
oh so its serious
its a job that makes you read
you didnt know we had the same bathrobes
paul finds this very amusing
he sits on marcels bed
weve got a lot of things in common
marcello i know everything
he flicks the light on and off as he talks
no rosa often talked to me about you
i dont think there are many marriages like that
he heads to the door
would you like a shot of bourbon
marcel stops him
heres the bourbon
he takes a bottle of bourbon from a hiding place
paul joins him
he pours a glass for paul
was that a present from rosa too
he pours a glass for himself
i dont really like bourbon but rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room
he sits back down
i was asking myself this question
if with these little things unimportant things we could go back over things and understand together
its almost a year that rosa and i
not passionately but regularly
i thought i knew her as much as you can know
for example a while ago something happened that i still dont understand
do you see there on the wall
he points to a spot on the wall above them
she had climbed onto the bed and she was trying to tear at the walls with her hands
i stopped her because she was breaking her nails
she had a strange
violence about her
id never seen her like that
our room is painted white
rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel
marcel takes some lips salve from his bathrobe pocket
to make it look like
a more normal home
it had to be changed here too
i think she started with the wall
paul takes notice of the lip salve operation
a cold sore
i dont know
paul regards him for a second
youre lucky huh
you must have been very handsome years ago
not as much as you
youve still got all your hair
i have to have it trimmed often
and wash it
i wash it nearly every day
dont you have massages
he massages his own temples
yes i do
youre in good shape
he paws at marcels stomach
what do you do for
thats my problem
he gazes across the room
i have a secret
he gets up and heads across the room
he takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a door frame
are you leaving us
i saw your suitcase was packed
why was she unfaithful to you
you cant believe that rosa
its hard for me to
while paul has a moment of reflection marcel shows him his pull up leg kick combo on his pull up bar
this is my secret
thirty times every morning
paul leaves disgusted
really marcello i wonder what she ever saw in you
jeanne comes in carrying her fur collared coat purse and a are you in
she looks around the place
is anyone here
she kicks the door shut with her foot
she wanders to the
she throws her coat and purse on the table
she puts a portable record player in the bassinet
is something wrong
from the other room we hear paul
theres butter in the kitchen
we see that paul is laying on the floor eating bread
so youre here
why didnt you answer
go get the butter
i have to hurry
i have a cab waiting
go get the butter
she storms into the kitchen
paul continues eating
she comes out and throws the butter on the floor in front of him
it makes me crazy
she sits on the floor and opens a mirrored door on a cabinet
we see pauls refection in it
that youre so damned sure that im coming back here
he laughs at her
she sits on her haunches then her ass
do you really think that an american sitting on the floor in an empty flat eating cheese and drinking water is interesting
he nods yes
she knocks on the floor near her
theres something under here
can you hear it
can you hear it
thats a hiding place
he crawls toward her
we see jeannes reflection in a mirror behind him
he reaches toward the hollow spot
she slaps his dont open it
i dont know
dont open it
he points to her crotch
what about that
can i open that
he reaches for it but she moves away
wait a minute
maybe theres jewels in it
he starts to undo her pants
maybe theres gold
he pulls the butter over with his foot
are you afraid
he yanks her by the legs closer to him
youre always afraid
he flips her on her stomach violently
she is not in the no but
maybe there is some family secrets inside
he rips her pants down to her ankles
ill tell you about family secrets
he gets a hand full of butter
what are you doing
im gonna tell you about the family
he yanks her pants down enough to put his hand full of butter in her ass
that holy institution meant to breed virtue in savages
he spreads the butter in her ass as she struggles
i want you to repeat it after me
he mounts her opening his zipper
she struggles more
no and no
say holy family
come on say it
he grabs her arms stopping her from struggling as he go on
church of good citizens
she is weeping
she cries out in pain as he enters her
he smacks her savagely on the back of her head
the children are tortured until they tell their first lie
her muffled cries
where the will is broken by repression
where the will
tears stream down her face
freedom is assassinated by egotism
he drives it home till he comes
he collapses on her spent as she continues to weep
a train roars by on the train bridge
paul is sleeping on the floor amidst the bread and butter
another couple of trains go by
paul sleeps more
on his stomach now with his foot on a piece of furniture
jeanne puts a record on the record player she brought with her
she goes to plug it into the floor plug but gets an shit
she looks at him sleeping
he looks at her upside down
ive got a surprise for you
he looks at himself in a small mirror
ive got a surprise for you
i like surprises
he flips himself over backwards onto his feet
he walks over to her and the record player
he stares down at her
what is it
but i dont know how to work it
he sits on the floor next to her
he plugs in the record player
he jumps as he gets an electrical shock
jeanne is secretly amused
do you enjoy that
he gets the record playing
its some s hippy music
jeanne sways to it while paul reads the jacket cover
tom and jeanne sit romantically entwined on a sea wall while his film crew films in the b
they sit face to face he holds her shoulders and stares into her eyes
do you know why i sent the others away
because youre angry or you want to be alone with me
and why do i want to be alone with you
you have something really serious to tell me
he plays with her hair
i have something really very serious to tell you
is it happy or sad
its a secret
so its happy
what sort of secret
as his film crew dolly around them in the b
his sound person yells at them
i cant hear anything
between a man and a woman
is it dirty or is it about love
but thats not all
a secret about love but which isnt love
what is it
he puts a life preserver over her
that in a week im marrying you
im marrying you
im marrying you
youre marrying me
were getting married
yes were getting married
are we getting married or not
i dont know
so yes then
yes or no
she take the life preserver off and throws it in the water
together they watch it sink
jeannes mother beats the dirt off her late husbands military of course ill send everything to the country
what do you think jeanne
jeanne tries on another of her fathers military uniforms complete with hat
olympia will be happy
i went there yesterday with tom
her mother joins her inside
she carries the fathers boots
shes preparing a family museum
of course im not sending the boots
im keeping them with me
i get strange shivers when i touch them
jeanne goes into an adjoining room while her mom continues reflecting ironing the jacket
all these military things never age
she looks up just in time to see that jeanne has found her fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction
when i was little it seemed really heavy when papa taught me how to shoot
im keeping that here
in a respectable household its useful to have a weapon
you dont even know how to use it
the important thing is to have one
it makes an impression
you really kept everything of papas
she shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her fathers wallet of a topless negro female
a fine example of a berber
a strong race
i tried to employ them as servants but it was disastrous
m glad i decided to send everything to the country
all his things were piling up and piling up
youll soon have all the space you want
what does that mean
she takes off the hat and jacket and throws them on the sofa
she heads to the front door with mom following on pins and needles
madame the colonels lady i announce
mom runs in
on this solemn day
she goes out the door
what solemn day
she runs after her daughter
jeanne is on the elevator
she sticks her head out
im getting married in a week
she shuts the door and heads down
what did you say
mom follows her down step for step
in a week
in a week
what are you doing in a week
tom and his film crew film jeanne trying on wedding dresses
he counts down to the shot
he does the clapper with his hands
jeanne and her host of dressers is lost in her fittings
move into shot
they move into the center of the shop
we get another look at jeannes left breast as it slips out of the dress being fitted
tom fires off questions for film purposes
how do you see marriage
jeanne gives her upbeat extistential responses as her fitting continues
i see it everywhere
all the time
what do you mean everywhere
walls and buildings
yes on advertising hoardings
what are they selling
theyre all about young couples
before marriage no children
then the same couple married with children
in short marriage
the perfect ideal successful marriage
its no longer the preserve of the church
the husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged
now weddings in advertising smile
on posters of course
but why t take poster marriage seriously
tom comes out from under a dress
thats the formula
for pop youth pop marriage
what if the pop marriage doesnt work
then you have to fix it like you would a car
the spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it
and in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage
in that case there are three or four workers
what about love
is love pop
love isnt pop
love isnt pop
so what is it
the workers retire to a secret flat take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love
the fussing on the dress is finished
jeanne slowly puts on her gloves relishing them
she struts slowly for all to stare and lavish her in her dress
tom is captivated
its the dress that makes the bride
youre better than rita hayworth
he wanders out into the street
it is raining heavily
better than joan crawford
better than kim novak
better than lauren bacall
better than ava gardner when she was mickey rooneys lover
hes film crew scatters for cover
what are you doing
stop but keep filming
why arent you filming in the rain
they huddle underneath the door of the film truck
tom has lost jeanne in all the hubub
he is disgusted with his crew
youre all fired
he goes back to the shop
she must have run off
ln the rain
he runs down the street in the rain looking for her
paul comes poinding in from the rain
he stomps the water off his shoes
he breaks into an impromptu soft shoe
he opens the gate to the elevator and gets on
he pushes the button
the elevator starts up
please forgive me
paul stops the elevator
he sends it back down
we see jeanne has been waiting on the adjacent stairs for paul
she is still in her wedding dress
she implores paul from outside the elevator
i wanted to leave you and i couldnt
i wanted to leave you and i couldnt
i cant leave you do you understand
she stands pleading at the elevator
do you still want me
paul does the eyebrow trill
he opens the elevator so she can get on
as it ascends jeanne slowly raises her dress revealing no underwear and her ample bush to paul
the door flies open
paul comes in carrying jeanne in his arms
he starts doing a jig and song
all the way to the oh there once was a man and he had an old sow ow
hi diddle dow
he puts her on the bed
she is giggling
paul pats her stomach and leaves the room
paul opens the curtains
jeannes screams come from the other room
he goes to investigate
what the hell
jeanne screams bloody murder and points to a dead rat on the
only a rat
he picks it up by the tail
she stumbles over herself to get away
there are more rats in paris than people
yum yum yum
he holds it out offering it to her
she runs to the other side of the room
i want to go
he brings it to her
she continues to back peddle
dont you want a bite first
you dont want to run and eat
this is the end
he points to the ass of the rat
no this is the end
then points to the head
but i like to start with the head
thats the best part
are you sure you wont have any
he dangles it over his mouth flitting his tounge pretending to eat it
she is gonna hurl
whats the matter
you dont dig rat
i wanna go
i cant make love in this bed any more
well well fuck on the radiator or standing on the mantel
he holds up the rat again
listen i gotta get some mayonnaise for this
because it really is good with mayonnaise
he heads out then stops and looks back at her
ill save the asshole for you
he really leaves this time
rats asshole with mayonnaise
he laughs at himself
jeanne is a basket case
she sits on her haunches muttering
i want to get out of here
i want to go
i cant stand it here any more
she gets up gets her purse and goes to the door
we see her ass through the sheer fabric of her wedding dress
im not coming back
she gets to the
paul is there waiting nonchalant
quo vadis baby
i forgot to tell you something
i fell in love with somebody
oh isnt that wonderful
you know youre going to have to get out of these wet duds
he pats her ass
im going to make love with him
she opens the door but he closes it
she stomps into the well first you have to take a hot bath
cos if you dont
he walks toward her
youre gonna get pneumonia right
she stomps a few more steps toward the bathroom
and then you know what happens
you get pneumonia then you know what happens
and then you know what happens when you die
i get to fuck the dead rat
he throws her over his shoulder and carries her kicking and screaming into the
jeanne is in the bathtub
paul sits on the bidet behind her with a washcloth
give me the soap
im in love
youre in love
he shoves her head under the water
she comes up angry
im in love
im in love you understand
he smacks her with the washcloth on the head
im in love im in love
he shoves her under again
im in love
he hits her on the head with her own shoe
she just gets more you know youre old
youre getting fat
fat is it
half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white
he smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth she smiles
in ten years youll be playing soccer with your tits
he starts washing her back
what do you think of that
you know what im gonna be doing
you will be on a
but you know
ill be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity
but please before you go wash my feet
she holds up a foot
he sits on the edge of the tub and grabs her foot
he takes a sniff
she pulls it away
you know he and i we make love
he washes her foot
is he a good fucker
he puts up the other foot to was he obliges again
you know youre a jerk
cos the best fucking youre gonna get is right here in this apartment
he washes her ass
he is full of mysteries
give me the soap
listen you dumb dodo
all the mysteries that youre ever gonna know in life are right here
he washes her stomach
he is like everybody but
at the same time hes different
you mean like everybody
even he fright me
even he frightens me
what is he your local pimp
he could be
he looks it
you know why im in love with him
i cant wait
because he know
he know how to make me fall in love with him
she gets out
he covers her with a big red towel
you want this man you love to protect and take care of you
you want this golden shining powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in
so you dont have to ever
you dont ever have to be afraid
you dont have to feel lonely or empty
thats what you want isnt it
well youll never find it
but i find this man
then it wont be long until hell want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile
and the way you smell
and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick
but i find this man
they lean against seperate walls
no youre alone
youre all alone
you wont be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face
i mean that sounds like bullshit some romantic crap until you go right up into the ass of death
right up in his ass
till you find the womb of fear
maybe then youll be able to find him
but i find this man
you are that man
paul doesnt like that comment
he needs to teach her another lesson
he bites a hangnail
get me the scissors
get me the fingernail scissors
she stomps past him to get them hands them to him
i want you to cut the fingernails on your right hand these two
he stands facing the wall and pulls his pants down
i want you to put your fingers up my ass
put your fingers up my ass are you deaf
im gonna get a pig
im gonna have the pig fuck you
i want the pig to vomit in your face and i want you to swallow the vomit
are you gonna do that for me
i want the pig to die while
while youre fucking him
then youll have to go behind him
i want you to smell the dying farts of the pig
are you gonna do all of that for me
yes and more than that
and worse than before
rosas mother has set up a room in the hotel as a viewing room for her daughter
she is as promised surrounded by tons of flowers
paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to rosa
he turns on the light
you look ridiculous in that make up
like the caricature of a whore
a little touch of mommy in the night
fake ophelia drowned in the bathtub
i wish you could see yourself
youd really laugh
youre your mothers masterpiece
he pulls the chair closer to her
there are too many fucking flowers in this place
i cant breathe
you know on the top of the closet
the cardboard box i found all your
i found all your little goodies
pens keychains foreign money french ticklers the whole shot
even a clergymans collar
i didnt know you collected all those little knick knacks left behind
even if the husband lives fucking years hes never going to be able to discover his wifes real nature
i mean i
i might be able to comprehend the universe but
ll never discover the truth bout you
i mean who the hell were you
remember that day the first day i was there
i knew that i couldnt get into your pants unless i said
what did i say
may i have my bill please
i have to leave
i ripped off the lights on your mother
and the whole joint went bananas
as you used to call them
well i guess that includes me doesnt it
it does include me doesnt it
for five years i was more a guest in this fucking flophouse than a husband
with privileges of course
and then to help me understand you you let me inherit marcel
the husbands double whose room was the double of ours
and you know what
i didnt even have the guts to ask him
didnt have the guts to ask him if the same numbers you and i did were the same numbers you did with him
our marriage was nothing more than a foxhole for you
and all it took for you to get out was a cent razor and a tub full of water
you cheap goddamn fucking godforsaken whore
i hope you rot in hell
youre worse than the dirtiest street pig anybody could find and you know why
you know why
because you lied
you lied to me and i trusted you
you knew you were lying
go on tell me you didnt lie
havent you got anything to say about that
you can think up something cant you
go on tell me something
smile you cunt
he starts to weep
go on tell me
tell me something sweet
smile at me and say i just misunderstood
go on tell me
you pig fucker
you goddamn fucking pig fucking liar
rosa im sorry
i just cant
i cant stand it
to see these goddamn things on your face
you never wore make up

he collapses on her sobbing
i dont know why you did it
id do it too if i knew how
i just dont know how
i have to
i have to find a way
oc we hear a voice
is anyone there
there was a noise in there
all right im
back to rosa i have to go
i have to go sweetheart baby
somebodys calling me
he starts to the door
is anyone there
outside the front door the source of the voice a worn out and old prostitute
she is with her john
here he is
its four in the morning
i need room four for a while
half an hour
yes thatll do
yes half an hour
she knocks on the door incesantly
thats not true
when youre full you put a sign outside
i know the hotel
im sick of arguing out on the street
call the owner
what are you waiting for
the owner has never made a fuss
rosa and i are old friends
paul opens up
dont make any trouble or ill tell your boss
come in its all sorted
but the man has left
hes taken off
im very sorry
he cant be far away
she pushes him out to the street
make him come back
tell him he cant just walk off
she shoves him out the door and down the street
paul chases the man on foot for blocks and blocks
he finally catches up to him in a the john figures he has gotten away
he reverses his trench coat to the appropriate side
paul comes around the corner
the john doesnt see any hostility coming
but it does
please dont tell her you found me
i dont fancy it any more
did you see her face
once my wife satisfied me
but now shes got a skin disease
its like snakeskin
put yourself in my place
paul grabs him by the tie and drags him
come with me
the man fights back
let go of me
paul doesnt like that
he roughs him up throwing him from youre crazy
let go of me
he ends up on the ground minus his coat
paul kicks him in the ass like a dog
get the fuck out of here
the man runs off
paul heads back up the alley as the man continues off in the f
paul lays down on his twin bed with his robe on over his clothes
we see that his bags are packed
we see that the mattress is gone
only a pile of sheets and pillows remain in the room
jeanne is on the floor on her knees doubled over in sick no
she wanders through the apt
grief stricken from room to room
we see only a few belongings left around
shoes the cat where was it for the rat problem
jeanne rips the sheet off the piece of furniture that has been covered up all along
we all wondered what was underneath that was so precious
its nothing special
she collapses in grief again the furniture falling on her she kicks it off
jeanne talks to the crazy concierge from before
her head stuck through the little window while the crazy woman puffs a cig
try and remember
the man from the fourth floor
he moved in a few days ago
i told you i dont know anyone
they come and go
the man on the fourth the woman on the first
what do i know
she gives a crazy cackle
where did they take the furniture too
where do you send his mail
give me his address
i dont have it
i dont know these people
not even his name
jeanne storms out
jeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before
she speaks to tom
still despondent tears stream down her face
ive found a flat for us
rue jules verne
youll come now
do you know where it is
ill wait for you
she struggles to hang up the phone through her grief
she breaks down closing the door for privacy
we can see her through the door as she leans on it
the front doorbell rings
come in its open
tom comes in
jeanne stares out the window
she is bathed in sunlight
tom looks around in b
do you like our flat
its very light
theres a tiny room too
its too small for a double bed
it would be fine for a child
thats a nice name for a boy
fidel as in castro
but id like a girl too
as in rosa luxemburg
less famous but i like it
you know i wanted to film you every day
in the morning when you wake up in the evening when you sleep
when you first smile and i didnt film any of that
he hands her flowers
she regards them
he circles to her front
today is the last day of shooting
the film is finished
i dont like things that finish things that end
you have to start something else right away
they embrace and kiss
tom looks around the place
this flat is huge
jeanne has made her way to the dining room
where are you
they continue shouting across the apt
its too big
well get lost
how did you find this flat
well change everything
jeanne holds her arms out like a bird
well change chance to destiny
go on jeanne
music rises as jeanne pretends to fly around the apt
from room to room making airplane noises as tom directs her
fly away youre in heaven
youre soaring youre in heaven
come down take a nose dive come down
make three turns come down
jeanne whats happening
theres an air pocket
tom gets suddenly serious
the patches of turbulence are over
we cant play like children any more jeanne
this stops jeanne in her tracks
they face each other
what do adults do
i dont know
well have to invent the gestures and the words
for example adults
he walks slowly toward her
they embrace passionately
he breaks away again serious
but theres one thing i do know
adults are calm
he walks backward as jeanne stalks him
serious logical measured level headed
they face up to problems
he stops abruptly
you see jeanne this flat wont work for us
this flat it wont work for us jeanne
where are you going
to look for a flat
he walks out to a shocked jeanne
what kind of flat
but he comes back
a flat we can live in
we can live here
it makes me sick
are you coming with me
ive got to close the windows and return the key
theres a lot to do
they meet in the middle of the room again
they share a bye
tom leaves jeanne to it
she opens the large window
we can hear the train below
she says goodbye to the apt
emotionally closing the shutter then finally the window
we watch jeanne come out of the apartment building
she climbs the stairs to the raised walkway
she is back where it all started
we watch her a bit
jeanne walks in her own world
a somewhat more content world now
back to herself
we suddenly see paul
he watches her for a moment before trailing her
he is more dressed up then we have seen him previously
as she walks he runs up behind her and playfully taps her on her shoulder
she turns surprised
its me again
she stops and stares at him disgusted by his gall and over him
he doesnt get the hint
he doesnt care what she says
he presses on playfully
its over then it begins again
what begins again
i dont understand anything any more
theres nothing to understand
we left the apartment
now we begin again with love and all the rest of it
he puts his arm around her as they stroll
im a widower
ive got a little hotel a kind of a dump
but its not completely a flophouse
i used to live on my luck and i got married
my wife killed herself
as paul waxes on we watch a tango contest in progress
he wanders rudely between the dancers on the dance floor invading their space and lighting a cigarette
but you know what the hell
i picked up a nail when i was in cuba in and now i got a prostate like an idaho potato
but im still a good stick man even if i cant have any children
i dont have any stomping grounds
i dont have any friends
i suppose if i hadnt met you id probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid
anyway to make a long dull story even duller i come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a
young chick like you and
and call her a bimbo
he reaches the other side of the dance floor where jeanne waits for him
she is able to smile now at his shenanigans
he has a real joie de vivre about him now that he lacked she sits down at a guest table on the outskirts of the dance he approaches her table
and feigns a gentleman persona
im awfully sorry to intrude but i was so struck with your beauty that i thought i could offer you a glass of champagne
is this seat taken
if youd like to
he sits down with her
he claps his hands
a waiter comes over
you know the tango is a is a rite
do you understand rite
and you must watch the legs of the dancers
the waiter comes over he turns to chat with him
we watch one of the dance couples dance the tango
we focus on their legs and feet
we make it back to paul and jeanne and champagne
you havent drunk your champagne because it was warm
and then i ordered you a scotch and you havent drunk your scotch
we watch a different couple dance
paul tries to butter up pardon the pun jeanne
just a sip for daddy
she takes a sip from the glass he offers her
now if you love me youll drink all of it
ok i love you
she slams it back
tell me about your wife
lets talk about us
but this place is so pitiful
yes but im here arent i
he kisses her on the cheek
monsieur maitre dhotel
thats rather nasty
anyway you dummy i love you
and i want to live with you
in your flophouse
in my flophouse
what the hell does that mean
what the hell difference does it make if i have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle
i love you
what the fuck difference does it make
she peeks out a smile
he may just be winning her back over
we watch a couple as the music stops
all the patrons clap as the dance floor clears
the president of the tango contest speaks at a microphone
the jury has chosen the following ten best couples number
and now ladies and gentlemen good luck for the last tango
more clapping patrons
we get back to paul and jeanne
she sits tables over pouting while he struggles to light his cig
she holds up her glass to him
give me some more whisky
oh i thought you werent drinking
but im thirsty now and i want some more drink
i think thats a good idea
he starts to bring the bottle to her then stops gets his drink and brings it too
wait a minute
because youre really beautiful
wait a minute
im terribly sorry
i didnt mean to spill my drink
he pours her some
she holds her glass up
lets have a toast to our life in the hotel
fuck all that
lets drink a toast to our life in the country
youre a nature lover
you didnt tell me that
oh for chr
im a nature boy
cant you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me
to the house of the cows
she holds her glass up again
i will be your cow too
i get to milk you twice a day
how about that
she lays her head on the table
i hate the country
what do you mean you hate the country
i hate it
i prefer to go to the hotel
come on lets go
dont you wanna dance
we can start again
he crouches down
she climbs on his back for a ride
he pulls her on her back onto the dance floor through the tango contest
the jury is in an uproar
the tango president freaks out
thats the limit
what are you doing
they lie on the floor
they get back up and feign some the president comes out on the floor now to them
she grabs paul who had dipped jeanne over the jury table
youll have to leave sir
she starts scurrying them off the dance floor
tis ever love
she continues to shew them away
and she can hold her own against pauls smart ass mouth
go to the circus if you want to see love
get out of here
youll have to leave
paul now grabs her and starts spinning and dancing with her
he sweeps her up into his arms
she struggles and paul puts her down
she continues to shew oh my god ive never
he pulls his pants down and moons her
kiss me sweetheart
she is appalled and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the door jeanne following
farewell you sweet peach blossom
as they get to the door he spins one last time
i could dance for ever
oh my hemorrhoid
he loses his balance and slips
jeanne has to catch him
beauty of mine sit before me
let me peruse you and remember you always like this
they sit in some tables in a closed darkened section
jeanne puts her head down on the table in exhaustion
he claps loudly till she wakes up
he puts on his english
if music be the food of love play on
jeanne looks over it all
whats the matter with you
she collapses on the table again
he kisses her head
whats the matter with you
hes oblivious to her seriousness again
were never going to see each other again
she shakes her head no
its not a joke
oh you dirty rat
look when somethings finished it begins again
im getting married
im going away
she starts undoing his pants
she starts to pleasure him
listen thats not a subway strap thats me cock
she masturbates him to climax
she gets up wiping her hands then forehead and leaves
when he recovers and sees her leaving
wait a minute
you dumb bimbo
she doesnt stop
wait a minute
she leaves the salon
he follows her out
he slides down the banister
she turns to see him coming
she starts running now
he still thinks shes joking
im gonna get you
he slides accross the floor
she continues running
she is freaked out now
she is running on the sidewalk past crowds of people the office of tourism and stores
he is in hot pursuit
she stops and turns to have a emphatic silent chat with him
he still finds this to be very humorous
she grows more and more serious and scared
she starts running again
but she tires out in a
she tries to get through to him
he still doesnt get it
he tries to embrace her
hey cool it
she throws him off
he still tries to grab her purse
she is adamant
he keeps trying to grab her purse
he feigns giving up as she walks on
i cant win
give me a break
she jets off again and we round a corner
he keeps his distance on the opposite side of the street but still doesnt get that she is serious
she tries to explain it to him
ill call the police
he blows it off
i smell the henhouse
she needs to go where he is
she starts toward him timidly
well shit im not in your way
he feigns a grand gesture ushering her free travel
after you mademoiselle
she tentatively walks on as he pretends to also
so long sister
besides youre a crummy looking broad
i dont give a damn if i never see you again
she makes a bee line to her mothers apartment building
he takes off after her
he gets himself buzzed in somehow
she is shocked she backs up to the elevator
oh fuck the police
she is becoming hysterical now
she makes her way to the listen i want to talk to you for christ sake
she gets on the old fashioned lift and slams the door in his face
she begins to ascend
he follows every floor up the stairs
she is calling to anyone that can hear as he stalks her
one floor after another
he trips and stumbles up the stairs after her
finally at the top he has to rest against the wall
she makes a dash for her moms apartment
but he follows
he grabs her as she tries to unlock the door
she runs across to the neighbors door and bangs on it
he tries to reason with her
this is getting ridiculous
she sees her chance to get back in her moms
she dashes over and unlocks the door and flies inside trying to slam the door shut
its no use he forces his way in
she hustles to the drawer with her fathers gun
paul is still at the front door
its the title shot baby
were going all the way
he shuts the door and wanders in
jeanne stands with her back turned staring down into the gun he looks around the place assessing it
its a little old but full of memories huh
she stares down still hitting her head on the cabinets to help her make a decision
paul finds her fathers military hat
he puts it on
he salutes her and clicks his heels together playing a role
she is incensed that he has dared touch her fathers precious he plays on
how do you like your hero
over easy or sunny side up
he removes the hat and puts it down
you ran through africa and asia and indonesia
he walks lovingly toward her
and now ive found you
and i love you
he romances her runs his fingers through her hair
i wanna know your name
she stares into his eyes
as she tells him her name
the color drains from his face his eyes get woozy
he can only mutter
he staggers away from her
he staggers toward the porch door as jeanne watches
he opens the french doors and staggers onto the porch
he looks out upon the city and up to the sky
he takes his gum out of his mouth and sticks it under the railing
his eyes register his bewilderment as he stares out into the we see that he is dead curled in a fetal position
jeanne stands in shock with pauls corpse in the b
she mutters to herself the alibi for the police
i dont know who he is
he followed me in the street
he tried to rape me
hes a lunatic
i dont know what hes called
i dont know his name
i dont know who he is
he tried to rape me
i dont know
i dont know him
i dont know who he is
hes a lunatic
i dont know his name
