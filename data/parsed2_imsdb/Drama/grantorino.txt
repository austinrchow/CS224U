written by nick schenk were at the funeral of dorothy kowalski
in attendance are mostly old folks their offspring and several bored teenagers
walt kowalski stands towards the front of the church
he speaks to an older man in a bulky out of date suit
im real sorry about dorothy walt
she was a real peach
thanks for coming al
walt kowalski looks young for his age
he has slate blue eyes physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in
walt is also a perfectionist
nothing escapes his hawklike eyes eyes that pierce and judge
walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wifes funeral
his eyes narrow at his granddaughters belly button ring
walts two sons mitch and steve watch their father from across the pews
look at the old man glaring at ashley
he cant even tone it down at moms funeral
what do you expect
dads still living in the s
he expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly
yeah well your kids wearing a timberwolves jersey
im sure dad appreciates that
my point is that theres nothing anyone can do that wont disappoint the old man
thats why we stopped doing thanksgivings the deal with the boat motor the broken bird bath its always something
what are we going to do with him
dont you think hell get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood
why dont you have him move in with you
the choir sings the beatitudes
walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner an old guy dozes and his granddaughter ashley applies nail polish
father janovich the very young parish priest steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for walts wife
walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin weak unconvincing words of father janovich
is often a bittersweet occasion to us catholics
bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families
sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them
and some may ask what is death
is it the end
or is it the beginning
and what is life
what is this thing we call life
he takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips
he looks down and notices a speck of blood on the white cloth
the house is crammed with people following the service
walt doesnt know what to do with himself
he has to keep busy
steve steps over to his father
a lot of people showed up after the service
yeah well i spose they knew thered be plenty of ham
i think ill go downstairs and get some more chairs
ill do it dad
naw we need them now not next week
grandsons josh daniel and david look through boxes in the cellar
a box of old korea war photos are pawed through
josh holds up a black and white photo a young walt looks utterly exhausted behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground
is that dad
no its grandpa walt
josh turns the photo over and reads it
third platoon e company march second korea
hell if i know
david holds up a medal
cool i found a medal
they hear someone coming downstairs
by the time walt descends the staircase the boys sit on the couch pretending to be doing nothing
walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs
people eat and chat
ashley marches over to her parents karen and mitch
how long do we have to stay this ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and im bored
walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs he overheard his granddaughter
mitch and karen are embarrassed
why dont you help grandpa walt with the chairs
grandpa walt can i help you with the chairs
ill take care of it you just painted your nails
walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window
walt puts on his coat he almost looks relieved to get out of the house
id better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a hip
walt taps the floor with his boot and daisy his very very very old dog follows him outside
walt carefully shovels his sidewalk
he deliberately stops at the boundary of his property
the reason for this is that walts neighbors are now mostly asians who moved into the house that once belonged to polish families
next door to walts house some sort of party is going on
walt can see through the window that the living room is jammed with at least forty people all asians all hmong
and this is a problem for walt because walt is a full blown unrepentant racist
walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog daisy
jesus christ how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room
walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage
walt steps inside and catches ashley sneaking a cigarette
she has pulled back the canvas tarp that covers his pride and joy his beloved gran torino
the gran torino is in mint condition
it has been babied since the day it rolled off the line
ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees grandpa walt
wow grandpa whend you get the vintage car
walt looks at her for a second then steps on her still burning cigarette before answering
i never knew you had a cool old car
its only been in here since before you were born
so what are you like going to do with it like when
walt lights up a smoke jesus joseph and mary
walt pulls the cover back over the gran torino
then what about that super cool retro couch in the den im going to state next year and i dont have like any furniture
walt walks out without commenting
the doorbell rings and walt opens the door
standing there is tao a sixteen year old hmong boy
tao is slight he has long hair long lashes but is very good looking like an asian johnny depp
who the hell are you
very quietly im tao i live next door
speak up boy get the shit out of your mouth
what do you want
do you have jumper cables
my uncles car is old and
and have some goddamned respect zipper head were mourning over here
walt slams the door in taos face
walt turns and is suddenly cornered by father janovich
walt hates situations like this
how you holding up walt
kowalski not walt
your wife and i became quite close these last few months
she asked that i watch over you when she passed on
i told her i watch out for my entire flock but she made me promise id keep an extra sharp eye on you
i appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that youve spoken your piece why dont you move on to the next sheep
walt starts to step away but father janovich blocks him
dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession
she said she couldnt remember the last time you went
is that so
walt drains his lowball glass
well i confess i never much liked church and only went because of the wife
and i confess i have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary
people are leaving walts house
a mass of shuffling stiff jointed old pollacks
right next door walking the opposite direction are more hmong going up the sidewalk
they laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit
they are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting walts home
the hmong are going to a birth ceremony
a three day old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn
walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral
he hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery
mitch karen ashley and josh pull up next to walt in a brand new toyota land cruiser
mitch opens the window
id really like to help dad but we have to get the kids home theyre getting restless
walt just looks at the toyota emblem on the land cruiser and then gives mitch a disgusted glance
ill call in a few see how youre doing
walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off
kill you to buy american
did you see him look at the truck
its always rice burner this or jap buggy that
even at moms funeral he cant let it go
at least he didnt say anything this time
he didnt have to
well what do you expect
the man worked at a ford plant for twenty eight years
and i suppose thats my goddamned fault
walt gets his guests engine running
as they drive off walt hears faint singing
walt looks into his neighbors backyard and cant believe his eyes
the hmong all sing and chant as three chickens have their heads sliced off right there in the yard
the chickens are held up and everyone chants louder
its a sacrifice
walt spits in the snow and says to daisy
the house is a buzz of activity
the older hmong speak their native language the younger generation speaks both english and hmong
note hmong is subtitled when necessary
taos grandmother phong complains to a man
theres no man in this house thats why my daughter should remarry
being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household
its not our way
what about tao
what about him
hes the man in the house
taos not a man
look at him in the kitchen washing dishes like a woman
even his sister gives him orders and he obeys
the camera pans to the kitchen where tao washes a pile of dishes
an older relative drops dishes in the sink without acknowledging taos presence
its clearly an insult
in the living room the hmong soul calling ceremony starts its next phase
an elder the family shaman is present and begins the ritual
as the entire hmong family gathers to watch
tao slips on his coat and goes out the back door
tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow
tao passes walts garage and is startled as walt appears from a shadow jumper cables in his hands
they make eye contact as tao passes
walt spits in the snow and looks down at daisy
i thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers
christ i had my own car when i was his age
tao exits the store gets on his bike and rides off
a few blocks away tao rides past a snowbank when wham
a hockey stick is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel
tao flies over the handlebars into the snow
a chorus of laughter is heard
three latinos stand around the stunned prone tao
whatta you gonna do gook
you gonna kung fu us
tao just lies there as latino picks up his bike
surprised it aint a girls bike
the latinos laugh
tao remains on the ground
you gonna get up or what
tao doesnt move
tell you what ill let you take the first swing
you drop me and you can have your bike back
tao smiles he cant help it
what the fuck you smiling at gook
he grabs tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet
you better get the fuck outta here bitch
he pushes tao backwards
tao falls back into the snow
this time tao crab walks back away from the latinos
the latinos stroll away with taos bike
walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning
walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors houses
walts property is perfectly kept whereas his neighbors houses are rundown
walts eyes linger on every defect gutter hangs ripped screen doors peeling paint
one neighbor has installed a chicken coop
walt looks down at daisy damn chinks let their yards go to hell
polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn
tao walks past
walt watches him pass
i dont know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block
this used to be a nice neighborhood
tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair
phong nods back to tao then turns her evil eye back on walt whom shes been seething at all morning
why doesnt that stupid hairy white man move
he must be too dumb to realize hes not welcome here
all the mee khah left in the neighborhood should just move away
look at him strut like a rooster
she sees walt glance at her and spit
phong glares back and spits beetle juice which has turned her teeth black
daisy snoozes next to the front door
the doorbell rings daisy doesnt even move
walt walks to the front door holding a roll of duct tape
the doorbell rings again
walt looks down at daisy
jesus christ dog have you gone totally deaf
walt opens the door
standing on his front step is father janovich
hi there walt
listen son youre not my barber youre not a friend so why in the hell do you think you can call me walt
so what are you peddling now
thought id drop by and see how you were doing
havent seen you in church in awhile
youve done your good deed now why dont you run along
id really like to talk mr
i dont think so kid
do you have a problem with me mr
you dont want to know
no i do
the problem is i think youre an overeducated year old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity
walt shuts the front door in father janovichs face
tao walks down the street his head in a book
he finally realizes theres a blue chevy following slowly behind him
the blue chevy is now parallel with tao and keeps pace with his step
tao looks over to the occupants of the chevy
its two latinos
tao quickens his pace but the chevy easily keeps up with tao
is you a boy or a girl i cant tell
what you reading gook jackass and the rice stalk
tao laughs but keeps walking
thats right you keep walking
fucking slopes everywhere you look man
why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood
down the street is a suped up honda civic with a big spoiler on the back
inside are five hmong gangbangers
the hmong gangbangers notice tao being followed by the latinos
spider the driver squints and then points at tao
dude thats my little cousin tao
you sure about that spider
do we do something
smokie is the gang leader
he looks at tao for a second
your cousin tight with anyone
no he flies solo smokie
lets go help out our little cousin
smokie nods to spider they roar up and stop right across from tao and the latinos car
you better not be giving my bro here a hard time or youre gonna wish you never been born
oh goody more rice niggers
the latino driver smiles and flashes a pistol
a hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub machine gun
the latinos are way out gunned
fucking viet cong swamp rats
go back to your fucking rice paddy
the latinos screech their tires and are gone
the hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves
tao simply keeps walking down the street
where the fuck does he think hes going
turn us around and go after that cousin of yours
they swing a u turn and pull up to tao keeping pace with him as he walks
hey cuz slow down where you going
you should really think about hanging with us man
if we all stick together shit like that wont happen with those spicks
tao nods as he walks but doesnt answer
you cant be such a little girl
you join up with us well keep you out of trouble cuz
tao looks at the sub machine gun cradled by the hmong gangbanger in the back seat
smokie takes this all in
he looks down the street and sees that in a half block tao will have to pass a group of latino gangbanger types
you think about it and well see you tomorrow
tao digs in the garden
taos younger sister sue sits and reads jane magazine on the porch
the tricked out honda with blue neon lights pulls up
spider smokie and two other hmong gangbangers get out
what do you want
came to talk to my cousin tao
smokie looks over to sue
spider whos the other cousin
sue laughs at the name spider
sue is seventeen has long straight hair with red highlights
is that what he just called you fong
this is my little cousin sue
smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at sue
how old are you girl
mentally im way too old for you
im going inside
thats right go inside while the men talk
yeah thats exactly what im doing fong
sue rolls her eyes and goes inside
smokie stares at tao
you think about what we talked about
smokie watches tao carefully offers him a cigarette
tao shakes his head no and looks at the ground
thats exactly the point tao
spider told me how everyone thinks youre a pushover how everybody walks all over you and shit
i mean look at you out here working in the garden like a woman
tao nods silently but still looks at the ground
it aint no big thing
you just need a little guidance
tao looks up at smokie
tao looks a little skeptical
its true man
shit i used to be kind of a quiet little punk like you everybody fucking with me
but finally i said no more
you youre lucky tao we got your back
i didnt have nobody
had to mold my own tribe
were family right
you with us or what
i swear brother were the best friends youll ever have
and anyone fucks with you theyre fucked
come on man
tao clears his throat and speaks for the first time
what do i have to do
smokie points to walts open garage
spider mentioned that neighbor of yours
zoom in there it sits with the tarp rolled back walts gorgeous shining gran torino
now thats a car
gran torino fastback
cobra jet engine
next to the garage walt is bent over planting tomatoes
walt notices the hmong punks looking at him
walt sits at the bar in the vfw veterans of foreign wars drinking with the old buddies and cracking off color jokes
i got one
a mexican a jew and a colored guy walk into a bar the bartender looks up at them and says get the fuck out
the gang laughs until they see father janovich step up to the bar
he smiles as he recognizes several faces
so heres where my flock congregates when theyre not in church
hiya father j
hey there darrel
walt says nothing
he just sips his beer
what brings you in here father
the meat raffle
i came down to talk to walt if thats okay
mel and darrel look at walt
it puts him on the spot
i have to hand it to you padre
you are persistent
i promised your wife
walt looks over at mel and darrel and then back at father janovich
oh jesus christ lets grab a booth
the waitress comes over
ill have a pabst and a shot
what are you having father
ill have a diet coke
bullshit this is a bar what do you want to drink
ill have a gin and tonic
the waitress leaves
so what do you want
i promised your wife id get you to go to confession
jesus christ whyd you do that
she was very insistent
she made me
you sure are fond of promising people stuff you cant deliver on
lets talk about something else
life and death
what would you know about it
id like to think i know a lot
im a priest
you stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school
everything you say sounds like its out of the rookie preachers handbook
i dont know about that
walt waves his hand and cuts him off
death is bittersweet
bitter in the pain sweet in the salvation
thats what you know of life and death
good god its pathetic
what do you know mr
i lived with death for three years in korea
we shot people we stabbed them with bayonets we hacked seventeen year old kids to death with shovels for christs sake
i did things that wont leave me till the day i die horrible things things i have to live with
and what about life
walt has to think for a second
he struggles with his answer
i survived the war
and raised a family
sounds like you know more about death than you do living
walt downs a shot
walt hears a sound and wakes up
hes very groggy he had plenty to drink at the vfw
the dog sleeps in her bed in the corner
walt looks at the clock its am
walt looks out his bedroom window
he sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage
son of a bitch
walt pulls on his robe opens the closet and pulls out the big m garand rifle he took home from korea
walt slides a magazine into the top of the m and chambers a round with a loud snap
the light flips on and before he can blink tao is face to face with the barrel of walts m rifle
walt is silent he has one eye closed so he can better aim at taos forehead which is nine inches away
tao drops the tool he was holding it bounces with a loud metallic clang
tao backs away his eyes wide with terror
as tao backs up walt advances step for step
tao trips over a garden hose which causes walt to trip
they both start to fall
the lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth
as walt hits the garage floor he accidentally fires the rifle
the bullet goes through a big metal hamms beer sign on the wall
tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over walt
tao runs out of the garage and into the night
walt lies on the floor for a second stunned
sweat runs down his forehead
he coughs up blood
the lightbulb still swings casting odd shadows in the garage
tao scrambles down the alley
parked off to the side is spiders honda
spider opens the door
get in get in
tao runs right past him
spider guns the motor and pulls in front of tao
smokie spider and another gangbanger get out
get in tao
no fucking way
leave me alone
smokie spider and the other gangbanger grab tao
i vouched for you tao because youre family and youre with us now
he shot at me
tao squirms out of smokies grasp
smokie yells at tao as he runs away
dont fool yourself tao
you dont join us and bail
should we go after him
naw hes got nowhere to go
lets get out of here
walt drills heavy gauge screen mesh over the windows on the garage
the phone rings and walt answers
morning dad its your number one son mitch
its one in the afternoon
the camera now intercuts between walt and mitch in the kitchen of his huge modern suburban house
right good afternoon then
so what do you want
what would i want
i dont know
your wife already went through all of your mothers jewelry
i was just wondering how you are whats going on anything new in the old neighborhood
walt looks at the bullet hole in his hamms beer sign
smooth sailing then
theres a very painful pause in the conversation
do you still know that guy from the plant who has viking season tickets
walt has parked the gran torino at an angle across his driveway
walt mutters as he rubs turtle wax on his car
walt fishes out a soft pack of cigarettes and lights one
he exhales as he looks at his car
it absolutely sparkles
the chrome shines the tires look new and the paint is waxed and polished
walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood in defiance
a couple of hmong teenagers look at the car
thats right aint she pretty
walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops open a can of pabst
dusk is falling
walt finally gets up folds up his lawn chair and walks stiffly back into the garage
walt flips on the outdoor light highlighting the gran torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway
the whole scene looks like a mid sixties car ad in popular mechanics
walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen light comes on
the gran torino remains in the driveway
its a challenge an invitation
walt is daring the thief to come back
and walts ready this time
the tricked out honda drives up but doesnt stop at walts
it pulls up in front of taos house
tao and sue exchange looks out on the front step
smokie spider and two others get out walking confidently up the sidewalk towards them
they grin theyre cocky
what are you doing here
weve got good news
were giving you another shot
i dont think so
you blew it the first time
weve got another little inauguration planned for you
this time therell be no mistakes
another big tough gangbanger with little man complex
smokie leers at sue
it makes her uncomfortable
i got my eye on you too little girl
come on tao
tao says nothing
he looks at the ground
he said lets go
come on man
nobodys gonna get hurt
well take care of you
dont go tao
you mind your own business girl
two hmong gangbangers grab tao by the arms
the front door swings open and there stands a glaring phong
leave my grandson alone
i know what you are
go away and dont come back
that old womans got bigger balls than you
you always let little girls and old ladies fight for you
tao tries to squirm away
smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the pistol in his belt
im not gonna say it again
tao is shoved towards the car
suddenly sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground
tao breaks free
run tao run
sue is slapped to the ground
tao is tackled by smokie and punched in the face
taos mother comes out the front door
smokie and spider pull tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep mom grandma and sue at bay
a middle aged hmong man from across the street comes into the yard
all the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols
the middle aged hmong man gets in spiders face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel
tao back pedals away from spider and smokie
it becomes a pushing rolling surging melee
this mess boils over and spills into walts front yard
the gangbangers tao his mother grandmother and sue all struggle on walts painstakingly maintained lawn
a ceramic lawn gnome is knocked over and breaks
and before anyone can blink walt has the muzzle of his big m garand rifle pointing at smokies face
get off my lawn
listen old man you dont want
i said get off my lawn
walts calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers
the guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle walt holds
are you fucking crazy
go back in your house old man
get off my lawn
im not fucking around gramps
walt spits out the side of his mouth
dont think for a second i wont blow a big hole in your face and it wont bother me a bit not any more than if i shot a deer
now get off my goddamned lawn
two of the hmong gangbangers take a step back
walt senses their fear
only smokie holds his ground
believe me kid ill blow your damn head off go back to bed and sleep like a baby
i couldnt care less
im not gonna warn you again
youre nothing to me
in korea we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags
complete silence theres no sound anywhere in the neighborhood
all eyes are on walt
walt clicks off the safety on the m garand rifle
smokie and the gangbangers give walt fierce looks but melt back towards their car
as they get into the car smokie has to say something
you better watch yourself old man
the honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street
walt looks at tao sue mom and grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front yard
finally sue speaks up
walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground
i said get off my lawn
we hear a sound outside
walt grabs his rifle swings open the front door and leads with the barrel
walt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle
his front porch is covered with flowers and fruit and gifts of food
there must be a dozen different gifts piled there
daisy comes out and stretches on the porch before putting her nose in a food basket
bad deaf dumb blind dog
walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash
he dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the hmongs
his garbage is overflowing
coming down the alley is another hmong couple they smile carrying a basket filled with asian vegetables
walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop
the hmong couple nod say something with a smile and turn around
tao his mother and sue argue in the yard
they gesture towards walts house
the women buzz around tao all speaking in his ear at the same time
phong yells at them from the porch but they ignore her
walt watches as the mother and sue march tao towards his house
tao looks like a whipped dog
why wont these people leave me alone
walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands indicating theyve come far enough
sue holds up a plant
we brought you some shallots to plant in your garden
i dont want them
theyre perennials they come back every year
you keep them
why do you people keep giving me all this garbage
sue is a little taken aback
because you saved tao
no i didnt
all i did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn
well youre a hero to the neighborhood
no im not
too bad they think you are and thats why theyre bringing you the gifts
just take your plant and leave me alone
walt turns and starts to walk away
taos mother speaks rapidly in hmong to sue
they look at tao and then to walt
theres another thing
this is my mother vu im sue and this is my brother tao
we live next door
tao is here to apologize
sue shoots a hard look at tao who shifts uncomfortably
for trying to steal your car
walts eyes go wide in recognition
he turns white with rage
get this straight i see you on my property again youre done
walt turns on his heels and storms into his house
the doorbell rings
walt opens it to find father janovich standing on his front step
good afternoon walt
walts eyes narrow
i mean mr
i already told you im not going to confession
why didnt you just call the police
i do work with some of the hmong gangs and i heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood
why didnt you call the police
oh i prayed for them to show up but guess what
what were you thinking
someone could have been killed
were talking life and death here
not that its any of your goddamned business but when things happen quickly like that you have to react
in korea we never called the police when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines
were not in korea mr
walt says nothing
ive been thinking about our discussion on life and death
about what you said
about how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do
horrible things that wont leave you
it seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden
things done during war are terrible being ordered to kill killing to save others killing to save yourself
youre right those are things i dont know anything about
but i do know about forgiveness
and ive seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them
stronger men than you
men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace
father janovich threw a bulls eye
you came with your guns loaded for once
you have balls father
and what you said youre right
im sure stronger men than me have found their salvation
but theres one thing youre way wrong about
whats that mr
the thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasnt ordered to do
the old balding barber finishes cutting walts hair
there you look like a human being again
you shouldnt wait so long between haircuts you cheap bastard
im just amazed that youre still alive
i keep hoping youll die and theyll get someone good in here but you just hang in there you dumb italian wop dago you
thatll be ten dollars walt
jesus christ martin you keep raising the price
you sure youre not part jew
martin the barber laughs at walt
its been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it you thick skulled old pollack son of a bitch
heres ten keep the change
see you in three weeks you prick
if you live that long dipshit
walt and martin shake hands and walt walks out
walt gets in his old ford pickup and drives off
this is a very bad rundown neighborhood
sue walks with her ridiculous wigger urban white kid boyfriend trey
trey wears big baggy pants a sports jersey and an oakland raiders visor upside down and backwards
they walk past three black guys leaning against a building
the tall black guy spots sue and smiles
hey girl you come over here and talk to me
come on baby dont be shy
trey and sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can to avoid the black guys
they try to ignore them
come on sweetie dont be like that
you talk to me dont be all stuck up and shit
walt waits at a stoplight
he watches sue and trey and the three black guys who block their path
one black guy flips treys visor onto the ground
the tall guy makes kissy faces at sue as he touches his crotch
walt sits there for a second he shouldnt help but walt solves every situation by being aggressive
walt drives off then makes a u turn
the tall black guy now focuses on trey
what are you sposed to be
trey puts up his hand to hi five
the tall black guy just looks at him
yo its cool dog
what the fuck are you doing in my neighborhood boy
were going to red roost to get some cds
that place is trippin bro
what you call me you fucking with me bitch
you think youre funny
im warning you boy
what you all come up in here for
you here to bring me this present
this oriental yummy for me
dont worry ill take good care of her
great another asshole with a fetish for asian girls
god it gets so old
whats your name girl
its take your crude overly obvious come on to every woman who walks past and cram it
thats my name
you should keep your bitch on a leash put a choke chain on this whore and yank
oh of course right to the stereotype thesaurus
call me whore and bitch in the same sentence
the tall black guy grabs sue by the arm
trey moves slightly towards sue and is pushed down into a pile of garbage
you think youre pretty funny dont you
what are you gonna hit me now
thatd pretty much complete the picture
the tall black guy pushes sue hard against the wall
you dont know when to quit
the old black pickup pulls up and stops next to them
sue trey and the black guys look over
walt sits behind the wheel he looks right through the tall black guy
what the fuck you looking at old man
and your buddies
whats the matter with you
dont any of you work
i see you lazy show offs in the middle of the day slowly walking across the street or harassing women
nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around for christs sake
why dont you get the fuck out of here while ill still let you
thats right bitch
what makes you spooks think you can bully a couple kids with impunity
are you fucking crazy
look at me slick
youre crazy if you thinking im fooling around
you are fucking crazy
you have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back
the black guys are a bit dumbfounded
walt stares them down
but you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out
all bravado drains away from the black guys
walt is a rock
walt grins slightly and spits on the ground
fuck this guy
he aint worth it
the trio walks slowly across the street forcing a car to miss a green light
trey puts his hand out to shake walts
man thanks a lot mister
walt doesnt extend a hand he lets trey stand there like an idiot
trey slowly lowers his arm
walt looks at treys outfit
go home clown
and pull up your goddamned pants
walt turns to sue
come on ill give you a ride
walt and sue drive in silence
finally sue speaks up
so whats with you you have some sort of savior complex or something
what in the hells the matter with you
i thought all you asian girls were supposed to be so smart
what are you doing walking around in that neighborhood
thats how you end up in the obituaries that is if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river
i know i know
take it easy
walt looks at her for a second
shes not ruffled at all
so that goofball back there
hes your boyfriend
yeah kind of his name is trey
why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that
why dont you date one of your
one of those other
you mean hmong
were hmong not hu mung
what is a
where is hmong or whatever
youre so enlightened
hmong isnt a place its a people
hmong people come from different parts of laos and thailand and china
then why are you in my neighborhood instead of back there
its a vietnam thing
we fought on your side and when america quit the communists starting killing the hmong so we came over here
walt is quiet for few seconds
whyd you pick the midwest for christs sake
theres snow on the ground near half the year
jungle people on the frozen tundra
we were hill people not jungle people
boo ga boo ga boo ga
blame the lutherans
they brought us here
still youd think the cold would keep all the assholes away
sue laughs again at walts conscienceless racism
thanks for the ride
you know you seem okay
what the hells the matter with your half wit brother
he a little slow or something
tao is actually really bright he just doesnt know which direction to go in
oh poor toad
its really common
hmong girls over here fit in better we adjust
the girls go to college the boys go to jail
walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper
he flips from section to section
daisys at his feet
next door phong sits watching walt
he can see her mumbling under her breath
old hag giving me the evil eye
walt opens the paper to the tv guide section and lingers at the horoscopes for a second
aw what the hell
walt reads aloud to himself
your birthday today this year you have to make a choice between two life paths
second chances come your way
extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti climax
your lucky numbers are and
walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the porch
what a load of crap
walt lights up a cigarette and exhales
walt watches as the only white woman on the block struggles to unload her groceries from her car
one of her bags rips
three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled groceries
one of them makes a crude gesture behind her back
christ all friday
whats wrong with kids today
walt gets up to go help but before he can get to the sidewalk another neighbor has gone over to help
tao bends down and carries her bags up to her door
well ill be damned
mitch and karen sit across from walt
a small store bought birthday cake sits in front of walt
walt reads his birthday card
its signed love mitch karen ashley and josh
all the signatures have been written in a womans cursive style and with the same pen
mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to walt
go ahead dad
what is it
just open it
walt opens the package its a gopher reaching tool the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up objects that have fallen behind the stove etc
walt looks at his son and daughter in law
its a gopher
its so you can reach stuff
you know it makes things easier
heres one from me
karen slides over a another wrapped gift
walt opens it
its a phone with really big numbers for old people
its a phone
thank you karen
i just thought
we thought that it would
make things easier
yeah i see that
theres nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself
karens right dad
youve worked hard your whole life
maybe you should think about taking it a little easier
walt lights up a cigarette
and thats another thing dad
you should get rid of the coffin nails
walt says nothing
and the house now that moms gone its got to be a lot to maintain let alone clean
and youre all alone in here
its worse than walt thought
he puffs smoke
theres these great places now these communities where you dont have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow
people who are like you alert active but are alone and would benefit by being with other folks their own age
dad take a look
we brought some pamphlets
mitch and karen storm out to their land cruiser
mitch carries the gopher grabber tool and karen has the big numbered phone in her hand
i told you i told you this was a bad idea
i know you were right
son of a bitch
he just wont let anyone help him
well we tried
now we can just drop it
no one can say we didnt try
to hell with him kicking us out on his birthday
we shouldve stayed home with ashley and josh
they knew better they wouldnt even come
the goddamned kids are smarter than we are
mitch screeches the tires as they take off
walt waits for them to clear out before coming out on the porch with a can of pabst
daisy comes out and lies at his feet
walt covers his mouth as he coughs
a dime sized circle of dark red blood is left in the palm of his hand
walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer
walt continues to sit on his porch a long row of empty pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing
walt looks at a photo in his wallet his and dorothys wedding photo
walt looks down at daisy we miss momma dont we daisy
a vehicle pulls up to taos house
a party is in full swing
sue comes out and helps the hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house
sue catches walts gaze and steps over to his porch
hey walt what are you up to
walt points his index finger at the can of pabst in his hand
were having a barbecue
you want to come over
what do you think
theres tons of food
just keep your paws off my dog
no worries we only eat cats
no im kidding you moron
come on come on over
you can be my special guest
im fine right here
walt reaches into the cooler for another beer
its empty just water and ice
son of a bitch
what have you had to eat today walt
a piece of cake and some beef jerky
come on over and get something to eat
weve got beer too
walt exhales loudly oh what the hell
its my birthday i may as well drink with strangers instead of myself
walt gets up and walks with sue towards her house
happy birthday wally
dont call me wally
inside are thirty hmong and walt who sticks out like a sore thumb
total fish out of water
walt looks in the refrigerator sue looks over his shoulder
you do have a lot of beer but no pabst
as they say when in hmong
are you sure its okay im here
everyone keeps looking at me and when i look back they look at the ground
phong appears from the crowd and points at walt
you get out
out of our house
to sue what is he doing here
walt cringes at her presence
whatd she say
she said welcome to our home
no she didnt
no she didnt
why is this white man in our home
a man like him brings nothing nothing but sorrow and death
several relatives usher phong away from walt
the relatives are embarrassed at the outburst
she hates me
yes she hates you
what did i do
a little hmong girl walks past and walt pats her on the head
everyone in the room looks in horror at walt
what the hell are all you fish heads looking at
sue looks around and then pulls walt out of the room
maybe we should go in the other room
sue explains a few facts to walt
a lot of the people in this house are very traditional
number one never touch a hmong person on the head not even a child
hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head so dont do that
thats dumb but fine
hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude
thats why everyone looks away when you look at them
yeah some hmong smile or grin when theyre yelled at or get into a confrontation
its a cultural thing
it expresses embarrassment or insecurity not that theyre laughing at you
good god you people are all nuts
walt opens another beer as sue speaks hmong to a relative
walt notices an old hmong man staring at him
walt interrupts sue
you said you guys dont look you in the eye but that guy keeps staring at me
sue laughs and gestures to the old hmong man
the old hmong man steps over and nods to walt
this is kor khue
hes the lor family shaman
sue smiles and nods
something like that
the hmong hold their clan shaman in very high regards
boo ga boo ga
kor khue says something to sue in hmong
she turns and translates to walt
kor khue is interested in you he heard what you did
he says he would like to read you
he wants to read you
tell you your soul
itd be rude not to allow him this its a great honor
tell kor to be my guest fire away
sue speaks hmong to the shaman
the shaman responds and sits down across from walt
he looks at walt for a long time
walt stares straight back at him
the shaman mumbles to himself
finally the shaman turns to sue and speaks very rapidly
as sue translates the shaman watches walts reaction
kor khue says that you think youve been disrespected
you do not live your life
your food has no flavor
you are scared of your past
you stopped living years and years ago
kor khue says youre not at peace
walt looks like hes been hit by a truck
the shaman watches walt closely he knows he hit the nail on the head
walt looks pale
hes been spooked good
he wipes sweat from his forehead
walt gets up and steps into the kitchen
he takes several deep breaths
hes pretty shook up
je zuz christ
walt looks around at all the hmongs eating and carrying on
walt sees a young man give up his seat to an elder
walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and offer tea and cookies from a tray
walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom
walt coughs hard
he wipes blood from his lips
sue comes in and looks at walt
are you okay
walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom
walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands
hes still pale
he looks long and hard in the mirror
walt is stunned it all adds up
walt hasnt really lived in years he hasnt relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from korea in
to himself son of a bitch
ive got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled rotten family
walt looks at himself
walt opens the bathroom door
sue stands there with a concerned look on her face
are you okay
you were bleeding
walt smiles disarmingly
i just bit my tongue
lets get some of that gook food im starving
walt sits amongst several old hmong women who take great delight in feeding him different hmong dishes which hes obviously never tasted before
walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food occasionally making jokes like hes choking etc
this corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the hmong ladies
sue comes in and rolls her eyes at walt
come on you glutton lets go downstairs
im fine right here
come on you said not to leave you alone
walt and sue descend the stairway
walt is really out of his element down with all the hmong teenagers
and the first person he sees across the room is tao
well look whos over there
whats his name who tried to steal my gran torino
my brother tao
tao is in the corner he avoids walts gaze
sue walks over to a group of boys leaving walt alone
walt doesnt know what to do with himself
he leans against the dryer
the dryer wobbles
walt gets on his hands and knees
he looks under the dryer
he adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine
he just cant help it
all the hmong kids watch walt trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party
walt looks up deer in the headlights
it was wobbly but i fixed it
its fine now shouldnt wobble anymore
the hmong kids look away covering their mouths with their hands
walt glares at tao who immediately wipes the smile from his face
sue walks over and hands walt a drink
sue walks off
walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls
one particularly gorgeous young willow wisp of a girl stares across the room at tao
tao looks back at her but then looks away
the girl keeps looking at tao smiling and twisting her hair
tao doesnt approach her but three other young men do
they do their best to charm her
shes polite but not interested she keeps looking at tao
walt laughs at taos ineptitude shakes his head at this wasted opportunity
suddenly the girl steps over to walt
she smiles my friends and i were just wondering what youre doing here
what am i doing here
anyways im walt
im wa xam
no wa xam
what do you do
not too much
i fix stuff i guess
well i fixed my wifes friends sink yesterday
i drove my aunt to the doctor to straighten out her prescription
even fixed my screen door before it was broke
thats one thing ive never been accused of
a bastard yes
wa xam laughs
well have fun
im going to take off
a pleasure to meet you yum yum
she laughs at walt butchering her name and goes upstairs
the three young suitors follow her up
tao watches her
walt comes over to tao who is startled
relax zipper head whatta you think im gonna do shoot you
tao looks like he wants to run away
i wouldnt say anything either if i was you
walt sips his rice liquor
walt cant help but rib tao
you know i knew you were a dipshit even before the whole garage deal but i have to say youre even worse with women than you are stealing cars toad
its tao not toad
my name is tao
good for you
anyways youre blowing it with that girl
not that i give two shits about a toad like you
you dont know what youre talking about
wrong egg roll
i completely know what im talking about
i know im not always the most pleasant person to be around but i got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me
i had to work at it but i got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me
walt points across the room
he sways slightly
you just sit there and watch as ding dong and click clack and charlie chan walk away with whats her face
she likes you you know
she was standing over there orange dress twisting her hair and smiling at you
you mean wa xam
walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods
anyways she likes you i know i talked to her
great girl charming girl
i love yum yum
you just watch her walk out the door with the three stooges
because youre a big fat pussy
walt drains his drink
i gotta go home
good luck puss cake
you need it
walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly hmong women come over each carrying a flower bouquet
no more flowers
the elderly hmong women nod and speak rapid sentences in hmong to walt
he has no idea what they are saying
please keep your flowers
the hmong women nod smile and chatter away ignoring walt
they walk past him and set the bouquets on his porch
okay just put them on the porch
but thats it
the doorbell rings
walt answers a skillsaw in one hand
standing on his doorstep are three hmong women
what now gee
gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil
stop bringing me stuff
gee scolds walt in hmong
ive had it
gee opens the corner of the tinfoil
walt looks at the food
you have to stop
gee pulls the tinfoil off
walt gazes at the food
is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day
walt pulls up in his pickup truck
sue and vu wait on walts porch
tao stands out on the sidewalk
walt gets out of his pickup
vu rambles on in hmong
walt looks at his watch
he looks at sue for the translation
tao is here to make amends hes here to work for you
no hes not
mother says that tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt
hell start tomorrow morning
the kid is useless i dont even want him on my property
i thought we already went over that
its very important to my mother that you accept
itd be an insult to refuse
how is this all of a sudden turned around on me
the goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow im the bad guy if i dont accept
my family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you dont let tao repay
tao interrupts from the sidewalk
come on sue
if he doesnt want to lets just go
sue and vu yell at tao to shut up at the same time sue in english vu in hmong
tao looks at the ground
walt sees the earnest looks on the hmong womens faces
their expression begs walt
walt gazes back at tao
walt looks disgusted he exhales loudly
walt walks past them and into his house
jesus joseph and mary
these hmong broads are like badgers
walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper
tao walks sheepishly over to the property line
son of a bitch i didnt think hed show
walt waves tao over
tao barely looks at walt
what are you good at
thats what im asking
what are you good at
if youre gonna work for me i have to know what you can do
i dont know
thats about what i expected
okay why dont you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder
count the birds
yeah you can count
you slopes are supposed to be good at math right
yes i can count
tao stands in walts garden with his arms folded
walt walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence
walt doesnt even look at tao
you want me to do that
i want it done right thats why
but youve got me just standing here
what am i supposed to be doing anyway
scaring away crows
tao shoots walt a dirty look
its a perfect job for you plus you people dont seem to mind squinting in the sun all day
walt waters a flower bed
tao comes over and stands there
walt finishes watering before even looking at tao
what do you have for me today
you want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by
dont get flip with me zipper head
i aint the one who tried to steal and dont forget it
i dont care if you insult me and say racist things
ill take it
that i know
you have no teeth kid
thats your problem
you have no balls
look im stuck here
why dont you give me something useful to do
because unlike you im not useless
i maintain my property whereas you swamp rats let your houses go to hell
walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated house
wait a minute
how long do i have you for
he doesnt want to answer
how long toad
till next friday
walt laughs out loud
it makes tao cringe
go get my ladder out of the garage
tao is at the top of the ladder
walt and the hmong neighbor grin at him from the bottom
when youre done caulking the siding nail that gutter back up i can see it right out my kitchen window its been bugging me for three years
the neighbor says something in hmong to walt
you said it brother
tao digs up a big tree stump out in the rain
its hard draining labor and tao is covered with mud
taos shovel hits rocks and roots and clay
we see tao do various chores scrape paint hang screen doors reattach house numbers trim bushes etc
walt scrutinizes his every move
tao is a virtual slave
walt watches with great satisfaction as tao paints one of the neighboring houses
the neighborhood is really shaping up
walt sips his coffee with a slight grin
he is really really really enjoying this
a very old hmong man and his very young grandson walk up walts driveway
the grandson translates for grandpa
grandpa says he want to know if you can have tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch
walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad
i dont see why not
tell him sometime after lunch
tao walks up the sidewalk
before ringing the doorbell tao looks down at his hands which have several callouses on them
tao rubs his hands with a smile
this has been the first time tao has really risen to a task presented to him
tao reaches for the doorbell
walt stands over the sink coughing
in the b
the doorbell rings
walt coughs up a big spot of blood its thick with fibers
the doorbell rings again
walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink
walt answers the door just as tao rings the doorbell a third time
walt looks angry
jesus lord almighty knock it off
its my last day whatta you want me to do
take the day off youve done enough
tao looks disappointed but says nothing
he nods and starts to walk away
walt calls after him
tao turns around
walt wants to say something but stops
nothing never mind
walt shuts the door
walt sits in the crowded waiting room
he looks around
hes the only white person in the room
even most of the staff is african or from india
as walt waits names are called out such as alvarez ngaima yang and abdalla
finally when the name kowalski is called the muslim woman cant pronounce it correctly
walt sits in a chair his hands folded in his lap
a short asian man in a doctors smock comes in with a chart
i looked over your paperwork and i think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests
i feel that this
wait a minute
wheres my regular doctor wheres dr
fellman retired three years ago
im his replacement dr
mitch karen and ashley are in the kitchen
the phone rings and ashley looks at the caller id
its grandpa walt
well pick it up
you talk to him
im doing bills here
hes your father
ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the talk button
the camera intercuts between mitch in his huge kitchen and walt sitting on the edge of his bed
not much how about you
im fine fine
how about the kids and karen
everyone is fine
there is a long uncomfortable pause
walt looks at some xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed
well thats good
speaking of busy i have a lot on my plate right now unless theres something pressing
walt looks at a pale blue pamphlet
mitch looks at his housekeeping bill
yeah so its not a good time right now
why dont you call me over the weekend
okay it was nice talking to you bye dad
walt hangs up
he lies down on his bed
while walt fills a bird feeder he notices tao next door
tao stands tiptoed on the top of a six foot ladder trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw
walt shakes his head and walks over to tao
tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder
i appreciate youre doing something on your own but youre the only person i know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches
you dont stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch youre hacking away at youll end up kaput
tao looks and sure enough a thick black power line is five feet below the branch hes almost severed
go grab the extension ladder from my garage and ill show you how to do it right zipper head
tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs
walt lights a cigarette looks up in the tree and nods
make sure you put the ladder back when youre done raking up the leaves
walt walks back over to his porch grabs a pabst from the cooler and watches tao rake
a white honda turns the corner and drives slowly past tao
smokie and spider smile menacingly at tao as they pass
this kid doesnt have a chance
the honda now slowly passes walts house
walt just stands there sipping his beer
the honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at walt
the rear window of the honda opens
walt holds out his right hand like a gun
he closes one eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb several times as if firing
bang bang bang
the honda takes off
walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette
walt doesnt notice but tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard
the doorbell rings
walt opens his door
tao stands there with his hands in his pockets
hes a bit apprehensive
what do you know about faucets
walt stares at him for a second and then laughs
tao looks on as walt turns the faucet on and off it drips water at its base
walt looks under the sink
for the love of pete
it must be a hundred degrees in here turn on the fan
tao flips the switch on the ceiling fan the fan wobbles and shakes it looks like its about to fly off
walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head
the ceiling fan and faucet are taken apart on the workbench
walt reinstalls the diverter valve
tao looks at all of walts tools
man where did you get all this stuff
what are you talking about
all the tools and stuff
where the hell do you think i got them toad
this may come as a shock to a thief but i actually bought the things i have with money i earned
yeah yeah yeah thats not what i meant
theres just so much shit packed in here
you need the right tool for the right job
every single thing here has a purpose
okay whats this
tao points to a tool
post hole digger
tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession questioning walt with his expression
walt can see something is bothering tao but hes too uncomfortable to speak up what
i cant afford to buy all this stuff
i didnt buy all this stuff at once blockhead
ive lived here for fifty years
a man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools
look kid i think i know where youre going with this
you dont need everything to maintain a house
im going to let you in on a little secret
walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down three items in quick succession
this is for you
roll of duct tape can of wd and a pair of vise grips
any man whos worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things
in the odd chance that doesnt work out you can borrow something
walt coughs and covers his mouth
both tao and walt see the spot of blood in his hand
whats with that
whats with what
the blood you just coughed up
thats not good you should see a doctor
walt quickly changes the subject while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub
what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night
who are they
i gathered that
what did they want with you
they wanted to take me away because i blew my first initiation
you joined up with those pukes
damn you are a pussy
why in the hell did you do that
i dont know
they were persuasive
my cousins in the gang
they just talked me into it i guess
well at least youre honest about it
a long silence
walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan
so howd you blow your first initiation
tao nods towards the gran torino
the gran torino
christ all friday
walt straps an old westinghouse freezer onto a two wheeled dolly
walt attempts to pull the freezer upstairs
walt strains with the heavy appliance
its too much weight for walt but this doesnt stop him from heaving and pulling
walt could have done this by himself when he was younger
walt sits down on the step and breathes hard
mitch watches afternoon baseball drinking an imported bottled beer
karen pokes her head into the room
see you later im taking the kids to the mall
mitch never looks up from the tv
just dont spend too much goddamned money
we hear karen and the kids exit
finally get the house to myself for once
the phone rings
mitch looks at the caller id
it says dad
mitch almost doesnt pick it up
its me dad
the camera intercuts between walt in his small kitchen and mitch in his huge den
im getting the old westinghouse up out of the basement
mitch mouths the word shit
i got it on the dolly
yeah thatll help
and its a bit heavy
for one guy
i need a hand
so are you busy
does it have to be done right this second
its been down there for years
yeah id like to get on it
does it work
we were thinking about getting a freezer
what are you going to do with it
giving it to aunt mary
cant she give you a hand
shes eighty one
i know i was joking
what does she need it for
to freeze food
mitch opens another beer
yeah well id love to help you out dad but im just walking out the door
i have to bring the kids to the mall
why dont you call stevie
your brother lives out of state
well i dont know what to tell you im on my way out
keys in my hand
if you cant find anyone by next week give me a call
walt nods and hangs up
mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer
like she needs a freezer
the doorbell rings and tao opens the door
there stands walt
tao is a little shocked
you got a minute toad
walt and tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly
i just need a little push
all the weight is up top so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step
let me take the top
naw i got it
no really ill take the top
it looks pretty heavy
im not crippled
i got it
if you dont let me take the top i aint helping
ill go home
listen zipper head nows not the time to go and
you listen old man
you came and got me because you needed help so let me help you
either its top or im out of here
walt studies tao for a second
tao doesnt blink he holds his ground
walt nods trying not to grin
okay then be my guest
just dont let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me
dont give me any ideas
tao and walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break
they both breathe hard
that thing weighs a ton
yeah but it runs like new
they dont make them like that anymore
what are you going to do with it
i havent used it in years and it was always in the way down there
oh i dont know
sixty bucks maybe
why you need a freezer
our downstairs one died
walt thinks for a second
twenty five and its yours
you just said sixty
save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper
walt and sue sit eating laab as they watch tao who washes and waxes the gran torino in walts driveway
sue laughs and shakes her head
kind of ironic huh
what the hell do you think im referring to
toad washing the car he tried to steal from you
it seems like justice to me
and if he misses a spot hes doing it all over
its nice of you to kind of look after him like this
he doesnt have any real role models in his life
i aint a role model
youre a good man wally
i wish our dad would have been more like you
dont call me wally
no im serious
he was hard on us really traditional really old school
im old school
yeah but youre american
whats that supposed to mean
sue shrugs him off
they look at tao for awhile
you like him dont you
dont be crazy
he tried to steal my car
and you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and
watch the language
and youre a good man
hand me a beer dragon lady
sue hands him a beer and walt pops the top
so tell me the problem with hmong boys again
im not completely clear
hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily
date who we want stay close to our mothers but are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence
the boys fall through the cracks
the boys float around
the fathers belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to
does that make sense
the boys dont ask their fathers for advice because over here their fathers no longer have the answers
hmong boys become almost invisible they end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there
the girls go to college and the boys go to jail
its more common than not
walt reflects on this for awhile then changes the subject
you still going out with that clown
i dumped him
he was a dim wit
walt and tao spread mulch around walts vegetable plants
you know the hmong consider gardening to be womens work
is that why i see you out in your garden all the time
besides zipper head we aint in hu mong
walt lights a cigarette
you should quit those
its bad for you
so is joining a gang you dipshit
seriously you should quit i saw you cough up blood
so you ever think about what you want to do with your life
i dont know

walt holds the door for tao and they enter
the barber has his feet up reading a playboy

walt hands a pair of beat up work gloves to tao

walt and tao walk up to the superintendents office trailer on a construction job site
walt and tao come in

walt and tao exit and walk back to the truck
walt pulls into a home depot parking lot
what are we doing
what are you gonna put all your tools in an empty rice bag
walt and tao walk the aisles
walt grabs a tool belt and tosses it to tao
youll need this
walt then tosses tao a utility knife holder
and youll need that
now where the hell do they hide the hardware holders
i cant afford any of this
ill get it but youre paying me back with your first check
walt pitches a hardware pouch at tao
and you need this too
that should about do it
not to bitch but wont i be needing some tools
tools i got but i aint loaning you my tool belt
you can buy tools as you go
i appreciate all this
aw forget it
no i really do
walt sticks out his jaw and looks tao straight in the eye
tao doesnt know what to expect
walt puts out his hand to tao
tao extends his and they shake hands
its really quite a moment for both of them
tao gets off the bus his tool belt over his shoulder
tao looks tired after working but content
he walks past an abandoned lot
the tricked out honda pulls up and stops
smokie spider and company get out
tao looks nervous but remains calm
just seeing what youre up to cuz
im getting home from work not that you guys would know much about that
so its true
you got a job
come on what do you guys want with me
jesus christ tao
what do you think
ive been sooooo easy on you but i cant just go on like nothing happened
you cant just leave me alone
the gangbangers grab tao
tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt
keep your hands off my stuff
you and everything you have is mine
i own you
smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement
whatever tools smokie cant destroy he tosses onto the roof of the closest building
you cant just walk away from us tao
it looks bad
it makes me look bad
smokie lights a cigarette and exhales
whats the phrase im looking for
oh yeah i need to save face
smokie grabs tao by the neck and presses the lit cigarette into taos cheek
tao screams as his flesh burns
walt spots tao as he takes out the trash
tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction
hey i gotta run
wait a minute
where have you been i havent seen you in days
walt squints at tao
he steps closer
tao looks away
walt tilts taos head up he sees the burn
what in the hell happened to you
dont worry about it
dont worry about it
look at your goddamned face
i said dont worry about it
its not your problem
walt looks at the ground and spits
couple days ago
grabbed me after i got off the bus coming home from work
i did everything i could possibly do
they broke some of your tools
ill replace them
forget the tools
where does your cousin live
no walt i can manage
i dont want you doing anything
walt is angry but eventually nods at tao
you need any other tools for work
i could use a roofing hammer
go in the garage and get whatever you need
tao leans over his desk with a black sharpie marker
he carefully writes tao vang lor in black ink on the face of his smashed up tape measure
he puts it back into the tool belt and grabs another tool to label
walt sits in the dark the only light is from the radio tuned to baseball
daisy lies in the front seat
next to daisy is the m rifle
walt watches as spider and another hmong gangbanger step out of the rundown duplex get in their honda and drive off
thats the last of them
walt pulls out his colt
automatic and chambers a round
walt pounds loudly on the door
a moment later the door starts to swing open and a voice is heard
what the hell did
walt kicks open the door and grabs smokie by the collar
walt drags the pound smokie out of his house and tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk
smokie is stunned
walt kicks him hard in the ribs
how the fuck did you get here
you arent that hard to track down
walt boots him again
smokie curls up in the fetal position
what do you want
walt kicks him a second time
i came to give you a chance
something comes out of the shadows under the porch
walt swings the barrel of the big colt
at the movement
its a cat
walt puts his pistol away
its just you and me
nobody knows or has to know i was here
you lay off tao
tell your guys he aint worth it or whatever the hell you want
you dont talk to him you dont go near him
this is your one chance
you lay off and no one will ever be the wiser
smokie says nothing
ill take that as a yes
i dont want to come back here
but if i do believe me itll be goddamned ugly
walt kicks smokie again and stalks off into the dark
walt pulls up his driveway and parks
daisy jumps out and walt carries his rifle into the house
walt walks stiffly
walt gets to the door and drops his keys
when he bends down to pick them up you can really tell hes sore and hurting
walt groans as he goes inside
hes feeling his age
vu sue tao and wa xam all sit in lawn chairs talking and laughing
walt flips the inch thick steaks on his weber
how do you want your dog
i mean steaks cooked
medium medium well
walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that vu made
is this hmoog or laab
isnt it usually a little spicier
tao wa xam and sue laugh
oh whatever wally
usually its got more zing
jesus christ look at you
ive never seen you like this

kicking back having a good old time
youre sure pleased with yourself today
and its a little unnerving if you ask me
aw go on

youre feeling pretty good arent you
well who wouldnt
im surrounded by beautiful women its a beautiful day
great food good friends
hell even toad isnt driving me nuts for once
it never ends
im just kidding

if tao doesnt ask you out soon i will
dont listen to him wa xam
hes a white devil
id love to walt but he beat you to it
ill be damned
wa xam and tao nod
theyre a bit embarrassed
yeah theyre taking the bus
thats no good
a charming young lady like this deserves to go in style
take a limo
walt nods towards the gran torino
the gran torino
youd let me drive it
they shake hands
walt watches baseball
he hears a car outside
shouts are heard and glass breaks
walt gets up and looks out the shades
taos house is raked with gunfire coming from a van
windows shatter and the siding splinters
fifty bullets shake the house before the van peels off
walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds
walt goes from room to room from vu to phong finally to tao making sure no ones been hit
is everyone okay
is anyone hit
tao wheres tao
tao sits up from behind the couch
blood pours down his neck
walt lays tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt
walt probes around taos neck
what is it
youre just cut is all
is everybody else okay
walt looks around at the bullet holes in the walls
tao follows his gaze
its a miracle no one was killed
they aimed high
sure enough most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls
she went to our aunts
i said call her
get the goddamned phone and call and see if shes there
tao scrambles for the phone and dials
tao speaks hmong to whomever answered
tao starts to speak faster
he looks at walt and shakes his head no
for once vu and phong understand what walt was talking about
there is anguish on every face in the room
walt sits across from tao drinking rice liquor
walt speaks loudly without any consideration for phong who shoots him dirty looks
this is exactly what i didnt want
why the hell am i even here
maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans
walt sips the rice liquor
walt now speaks quietly to tao
in korea i learned not to care
the best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in korea
you harden yourself
dont let anything get to you
phong looks out the window and screams
she runs over and swings open the door
everyone expects the worst
and it comes like a cold wind sue walks in like a zombie
she has been brutally beaten
her clothes are dirty and torn
blood runs down sues legs from under her shirt
walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand
sue staggers into vus arms
sue hugs her mother and sobs
tao reaches to hug his sister but phong screeches at him pointing at walt and back to tao
walt is destroyed
he steps outside into the dark
walt staggers across the yard to his house
no no no no no
walt bursts in the door throws himself in an easy chair and cries
he tries to stop and cries harder
its the first time walt has cried in fifty years
he wails crying for tao sue his wife kids and himself
he lets it all out
daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs his old dog as he bawls
walt sits red eyed
hes done crying
family photo albums are scattered around
father janovich knocks and eases open the front door
kowalski are you in here
come on in
father janovich comes in and sits down across from walt
are you okay
the police finally left
no one is talking
one thing about the hmong they keep their mouths shut
ive noticed that
father janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it
pictures of mitch and steve as babies
you know theres no way that tao or sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys dont go away
go away forever
you know it as well as i do
what are you saying
you heard what i said
they took sue to the hospital
theyre all scared
i know that
believe me they all know that
hes sitting out there staring at your front door
you know what he expects mr
yeah well what would you do if you were me
if you were tao
what would you do
father janovich shakes his head
i know what id do if i was you or at least what you think you should do
if i was tao i guess id want vengeance
id want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys
what would i do
id come over here and talk to you i guess
i know youre close with these people but this pisses me off too mr
id love one
theyre in the cooler grab me one too
father janovich grabs four beers two for each of them
he opens a pabst and takes a big swig
damn all this
it just isnt fair
nothings fair father
father janovich and walt sit for awhile
so what are you going to do mr
call me walt
father janovich nods
alright what are you going to do walt
not sure yet
all i do know is they dont have a goddamned chance
walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe drinking coffee
tao comes in without even knocking on the door
what are you doing
thinking time is over
now its time to knock the ass out of those pricks
i know you dont want to hear this but you have to calm down
you have to have a clear head otherwise mistakes get made
back away from whats happened tao
dont let me down walt
this is going to end today
walt stands up and pulls out a chair for tao to sit in
i dont want to sit
i said sit down
just listen up for a second and dont say anything
tao sits down
walt rubs his hands together
i know what needs to be done
i need to prepare this needs to be carefully planned
you know im the right man for this
so cool down for a little while and meet me back here at p
i promise you what needs to be done will be done
i say we go now
and do what
you want to go kill your cousin and those other zips
tough guy all of a sudden is out for blood
what do you even know about it
tao is furious but says nothing
trust me tao
cool down and well meet back here at four
tao doesnt answer
i said okay
you wont do anything without me
you meet me back here at four
tao storms out the back door
walt pours more coffee
walt soaks in the tub
its filled with bubbles
walt looks over at daisy who rests on a towel in the corner
walt lights a cigarette and exhales
daisy curls up her lips at the smoke
i know i know
give me a break its the first time ive ever smoked in the house
walt meticulously mows his lawn
he carefully trims around the fence and birdbath
martin finishes cutting walts hair
there all done
ten bucks american
i dont suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave you withered old italian mummy
a straight shave
youve never ordered a straight shave ever
i always wondered what they were like
unless youre too goddamned busy
let me heat up a towel
walt hands martin the barber a twenty
heres a twenty
keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular
walt gets fitted for a new suit
the old tailor carefully measures walts shoulders
so you can take it in right here
take about an hour
never had a fitted suit
walt comes in and father janovich looks up
kowalski what can i do for you
ive come for confession
oh lord jesus what have you done
take it easy
what are you up to
are you going to let me confess or not
walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous sweating father janovich sits on the other
how long has it been since your last confession
bless me father for i have sinned
what are your sins my son
in i kissed betty jablonski at the work christmas party
dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just happened
i made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing
and lastly i was never close to my two sons
i dont know them
i didnt know how
whatta you mean thats it
its bothered me for years
god loves and forgives you
say ten hail marys and five our fathers
are you going to retaliate for what happened to sue
walt says nothing
father janovich looks hard at walt
im going over to that house today mr
is that so
and every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning
i gotta go padre
busy day ahead
go in peace
i am at peace
walt and father janovich shake hands
father janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair
je zuz christ
walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled
tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons the m garand rifle and the colt
tao picks up the heavy rifle
which one do i get
you ever fire a weapon
tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target
put that down
i got something for you
in korea october
we were sent up to sweep a chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad
i was the only one who came back
i received the silver star
i want you to have it
when we went up that hill we knew it was ten to one against us but we went anyway
this trouble now its similar
were walking right into it
we might not be coming home tonight
the hell we wont
were going to roll in there and tear ass
dont be a fool these guys are waiting for that exact reaction
tao is quiet for a minute
how many what
how many men did you kill in korea
thirteen for sure
what was it like to kill a man
you dont want to know
go get the silver star
its in a blue wooden box in the cellar
tao goes downstairs
he turns on the light and goes into the cellar
tao locates a blue wooden box and opens it
tao holds up the medal
he looks at it closely
and wham walt slams the heavy cellar door shut behind him
walt slides the bolt lock into place with a loud tao couldnt kick his way out of there in ten years
of course he tries anyway
tao is furious
he throws things
what the hell are you doing
let me out of here you goddamned son of a bitch
quit smashing everything
youll never get out of there so just relax
you let me out you crazy old fuck or i will kill you when i get out of here
tao pounds on the door
walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles tao
you want to know how it feels to kill a man
it feels goddamned lousy
and it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up
a dumb scared little gook just about your age
i shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs
ive thought about that kid for fifty years
and i promise you boy you want no part of it
me ive got blood on my hands
forgive me for tricking you like a dope
ill call someone and have them let you out later
let me out
tao pounds on the door
youve come a long way
im proud to call you a friend
you have your whole life ahead of you whereas this is what i do
i finish things
youd just get in the way
walt goes back upstairs leaving tao locked up in his cellar
tao howls to be let out
walt walks out his front door with daisy on her leash
he walks over to taos house
phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at walt
she yells in hmong as walt walks straight up to her
aw pipe down you hag
youre an evil man
ive seen your kind before
back home white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young mens minds with ideas of glory
then youd lead them away to their deaths
walt of course has no idea what she said
fine i hate you too
walt holds out the dog leash to phong
she looks down at daisy and back at walt
she lashes out again in hmong
i need you to watch my dog
walt holds the leash closer
phong folds her arms in defiance
walt exhales loudly
walt lifts up one of the legs of her lawnchair and slips the loop of the leash underneath it so daisy cant follow him
her name is daisy
walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets daisy
he scratches her belly
you take it easy old gal
you good old girl
walt gets up and walks away without looking back
phong is stunned she is silent for once
walt walks in and sits down
he nods to the regulars
good afternoon gentlemen
walter how are you doing
never been better
beer and a shot walt
i think ill have something different
walt looks at the liquor display
at the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of johnnie walker blue
think ill try that johnnie walker blue label
the regulars all oooooo and ahhhhhhh at walts order
whatta ya win the lottery wally
naw just having something special
walt sips his scotch and nods
why dont you get all the guys the same
this is too good not to be shared
walt finishes his scotch and points for one more
several regulars hold up their drinks towards walt
walt slips into the phone booth
he puts in change and dials
sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed
the key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle
open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar
i have to go
the line goes dead as walt hangs up
sue jumps up out of bed pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs
phong blocks her path
phong grabs sue by the arms
who was that
where are you going
you tell me whats going on
sue squirms away from phong and runs outside
on her way over to walts house she sees daisy leashed to phongs chair
it scares sue even more
father janovich paces back and forth
the squad car pulls up to him which is exactly what hes been afraid of all day
sorry father we have to go
im telling you
if were not here there will be bloodshed
weve been here for hours
we cant afford to anchor a unit to one location
im begging you to stay
i just got word from my sergeant were pulling the plug
no you arent
my orders are specific
you came with us youre leaving with us
father janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the squad car
the squad car drives off
walt pulls up in front gets out of his pickup and slams the door
he looks at the duplex
its a total eyesore
what a goddamned mess
you slopes should be ashamed of yourselves
walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex
six very scared very jittery hmong gangbangers look out at walt from various doorways and windows
is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows
smokie and spider step out and stand on the porch
smokie smiles at walt
walt spits on the ground
i wasnt sure that youd
shut up gook
im not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp dicked little baby midget like you has to say
spider pulls his pistol
thats right boy
defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family
your own blood for christs sake
go ahead pull your pistols just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys
smokie and several other hmong gangbangers pull their guns
you have no honor
youre the scum of the earth and when youre gone do you think anyone will care
no one will mourn
you wont be missed
all the hmong are spooked at walts absolute lack of fear
wheres tao old man
he too scared to come and stick up for himself
tao is too good for this
you pukes arent worth one second of his time
walt slowly puts a cigarette in his mouth
even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their pistols around
you boys are a little bit jumpy
you watch it old man
no i think youd better watch it
walt looks around
other than the gangbangers a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown
sue opens the front door runs to the stairwell and pounds down the stairs
tao are you alright
she unlocks the cellar door
tao comes out in a rage
whats going on
he left without me
whered he go
he went to smokies without me
tao takes the stairs two steps at a time
sue grabs taos legs and hangs on
dont you dare
stay away from them tao
i dont want anyone else getting hurt
leave me alone
they struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the kitchen floor
tao runs for the door when something catches his eye
the kitchen table
the rifle and pistol are still there
walt purposely left the guns at home
anybody got a light
i got one
walts slight grin fades
he mutters to himself
hail mary full of grace
walt reaches into his coat pocket
six hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their pistols and fire
walt is struck down
walt falls dead
a zippo lighter clutched in his hand
walt never intended to kill anyone
tao and sue arrive just as smokie spider and company are being driven away in police cars
tao looks at smokie in the squad car
smokie no longer looks tough or hard he just looks scared
on the street walt is being bagged by the ambulance crew
father janovich prays over him
tao steps up to a police officer
you have to step back
he was a friend of mine
i said step back
tao turns to the hmong police officer
what happened man
the hmong police officer looks at the white police officer and then to tao
you heard him step back
tao speaks to the hmong officer in their native language
please man its important
hes my friend
tell me what happened
the old guy reaches for a lighter and they gunned him down
the gang said the old guy was here to kill them but he didnt have a weapon
whats going to happen
we actually have witnesses for once
these guys are going away big time
the white officer yells at the hmong officer
officer chang get those people back
you have to step back now
tao hugs his sister
sue openly weeps
tao holds it in
he looks at his friend walt as the bag is zipped over him
tao and sue wait in front
tao wears a suit sue is in a traditional hmong dress
a taxi pulls up and they get in
sitting on the porch is phong who rocks back and forth in her rocking chair
phong holds daisy in her arms gently petting the old dog
were at the funeral of walter kowalski
walt is dressed in his new suit
along with the crowd youd expect tao and sue are seated near the front
walts sons and family are there
mitch gives tao a dirty look
tao looks back at him his gaze bores right through mitch
mitch looks away
father janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks
walt kowalski once said to me i didnt know anything about life or death because i was an overeducated year old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women
and promised them eternity
walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it
but walt was right
i knew really nothing about life or death until i got to know walt
and boy did i learn
all of walts family are seated in an office as a lawyer reads walt kowalskis will
tao is present along with walts family
which brings us to our last item
and again please forgive the language used in mr
im simply reading it as it was written
the lawyer takes a sip of water before reading
and to my friend tao vang lor i leave my gran torino on the condition that you dont choptop the roof like a damned spick dont paint any idiotic flames
on it like some white trash hillbilly and dont put a big gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipper heads cars
it just looks like hell
if you can refrain from doing any of that its yours
