more info about this movie on imdb
com half in shadow a man named vallon dressed in black fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck
he raises a jagged razor to his face rakes it across his right cheek drawing blood
he does not flinch
the sharp scraping of the jagged blade against skin is the first sound we hear
vallon cuts himself similarly on the left cheek then hands the razor ceremoniously to a boy standing beside him
the boy no more than twelve years old looks at vallon worshipfully keen eyes shining with fear and excitement
he starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket
the blood stays on the blade son
he hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch
very carefully the boy known as amsterdam wraps the razor up hands it back to his father
from the shadows vallon now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end then holds his free hand out to his son
amsterdam squeezes tight
vallon nods toward the door
amsterdam pulls it open
outside is a dim hallway
we hear sounds that might be animal or human
music begins a steady driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn
vallon strides in long measured steps
amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him
they are walking down a long corridor thats like a tunnel
patches of light stain the darkness
sometimes amsterdam glimpses a face peering out from the gloom
once or twice he almost stumbles over a body stretched across his path
another room even smaller
the only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a madonna and child painted on the wall
a beefy man picks up a home made pike its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point
he is smiling
the grin is huge but cockeyed
it occupies only half of his face
the grotesque unending grin is the result of facial paralysis and has given him a nickname happy jack mulraney
jack lifts the pike carefully then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits
he slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top
wax falls on the cage splattering an unlucky rabbit
jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars impaling the rabbits body
he pulls the pike from the cage and leaves
jack falls into step beside vallon and amsterdam
he holds the pike with the dead rabbit high next to vallons cross
did you bring the boy for a charm priest
for a baptism
now a woman joins them
shes dressed in mans clothes her pants held up by suspenders
she wears a set of iron claws
music builds growing more insistent and more ominous
now a figure looms before them
over his street clothes this warrior wears a rig of home made armor made from fracgments of steel lengths of chain and bits of leather
he carries a battle axe as lightly as if it were a twig
well send a few across the river today priest
he joins the procession
another woman as tough as the first and half again as large and several more men all armed with implements of destruction fall in beside him
their faces are marked with blood like vallans or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink
the group grows ever larger and more forbidding
occasionally people dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow
vast and dank like a cavern
we start close on
the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead
then a little wider to reveal an eager boy shang draper about the same age as amsterdam
he drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat then sews it closed
he hefts the animal by the tail swinging it as he stands up
he is near a primitive forge where a half drunk slacksmith hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to other men and women
the floor is covered with bits of lead and steel which shang has been using to sew into his rat
shang follows the crowd of men and women with their weapons
and now we see this room full
it is huge the main room of the old brewery crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort or out of fear men and women together or separately drunk
or passed out
they are like zoo animals in a pit
there are sticks of furniture jammed in corners or more often arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms
above shangs head vallon and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them
armed men and women from the brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them
shang scurries up after them
the men and women from the brewery fall in behind vallon and the others in the lead
shang spots someone near his own age toward the front amsterdam
he presses through the crowd like a hunting dog
whats the fight
the dead rabbits against the native americans same as ever
but itll all be settled today
are you native or rabbit
points to rabbit on pike what do you think
ill stand by you then
the group now turns down the last corridor as dim and long as a tunnel
in the distance theres a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a man monk eastman
vallon stops near the door
i dont know you
lightly i suppose theres to be a fight
vallon catches the heavy celtic inflection in the mans voice
names monk eastman
and you want to fight mr
lf theres money in it
fight for the natives
they have a proper war chest
well i might at that
but i thought id ask you first seeing as how im not quite a native american myself
lets see your skills and well talk of payment later
but if you like what you see pay me double
monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a shattering kick sending it flying off its hinges
clear white light streams in and we see monk eastman plain for the first time a huge man in stature and girth wearing a small derby that intentionally makes his
head look even bigger
as the door splinters settle stand with us then
winter wind blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet
vallon carrying his cross high steps through the doorway
the others slowly follow vallon out of the building which is three stories high and maybe a block long
a dilapidated sign identifies it as the paints brewery
it is the tallest structure in the midst of low squalid shacks winding alleys as narrow as a snakels back and dirt streets filled with ruts mud and filthy snow
a few pigs wander forlornly about rooting for garbage
wash hangs stiff in the middle of the square from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero
the brewery occupies one side of a square surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks
if this place resembles anything at all its a horrible hybrid of londons limehouse and a pioneer town in the american west whose best days have long passed or never
came at all
vallon stands still staring across the square past the monument
his battalion of irregulars waits for his signal
very very slowly
from around both sides of the monument comes another gang in size the same as vallons men and women both armed like visigoths with homemade weapons knives pitchforks building blocks
and bricks boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends
every member of this second group is dressed in a long duster which reaches to the ankles
several men in front of the group sport dusters made of leather
on whose challenge are we assembled
a man in a leather duster bill the butcher steps forward
he is young lean and fierce
and then there are his eyes
they do not match
one is real
the other is a huge bulging pearl upon which has been engraved instead of a pupil a full color portrait of the american eagle
on the side of the square arranged to get a good view of the impending combat is a group of street kids girls and boys none older than eight
they talk and laugh excitedly among themselves picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team
on the challenge of the native americans to settle for good and all who holds sway
by the ancient laws of combat we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us
valor is avid for glory and glory is in our wounds
but this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes bill
can you see it clear with your single eye
whoever fights untouched in battle has skill but the warrior who returns wounded has been touched by god
it wasnt god who touched your eye
it was god gave me guidance
will you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator and not look away
no honorable man turns an eye from his death
i dont expect a death blow from your hand butcher
lets have at it
there is another matter
say it out and quick before spring gets here
no native american warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the halt and maimed
so we would like to know whether squire jack mulraney of the dead rabbits can smile out of both sides of his face
a pause of a single second
then happy jack takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square
it lands right at bill the butchers feet
in a flash bill the butcher opens his coat
inside on a special belt he carries a cleaver a carving knife and other instruments of the butcherls trade all stained with blood and gristle
now the man standing next to him removes the broad belt from around his coat
the brass buckle is sharpened to a point the leather studded with glass
the gallery of street kids tenses for action they are thrilled
vallon reaches up to the cross pulls off the top piece to disclose underneath a gleaming sword point
he folds the arms of the cross down like the blades of a jackknife
prepare to receive the lord
and the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across paradise square into battle
vallon draws first blood
he impales a native american on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again
amsterdam and shang exchange a glance of frightened worried wonder
then a native american rushes at them shouting for blood
the boys act together
amsterdam dives down in front of the man sending him sprawling
shang bludgeons the fallen warrior using his lead filled rat like a blackjack as amsterdam kicks him savagely the native collapses unconscicus at their feet
before the boys can thank one another however they are separaten by the surging gangs all around them
bill the butcher leaves his meat cleaver imbedded in the middle of a mans skull then wades through the combat as if shielded by a charm
the gallery of street kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with vallon battles three natives who come at him at once
monk eastman grabs a native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride
he raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it breaking his spine like a thanksgiving wishbone
the gallery of street kids is awed by this display of power from a new star in the making
the rabbit warrior in the home made armor grins at an intrepid native and lowers his battle axe
the native rushes as the rabbit warrior swings and separates the man from his legs
a native woman lowers her head and charges her dead rabbit adversary delivering a shattering butt to his stomach
a native boy holds a rusty old pistol which he uses at pointblank range against several rabbits
a rabbit woman flies into a native using her iron finger extensions to gouge his face
the native with the deadly belt uses it to tear a piece out of a rabbits face
amsterdam beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight looks around in growing panic for his father
shang uses his lead rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the brewery
the street kids can tell hes trying to escape and start booing him
as shangs grabbed from behind and pulled off his feet by a peg legged native
he throws the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the sword sharp point of his wooden leg against shangs throat
desperate i run with you
im one of you
born a native american from the blood of five generations
then you oughta be a red indian
he pushes down
shang starts to bleed
but now peg leg is distracted by the sudden sound of bells and whistles
he watches the boy trembling on the ground then moves off him making for the sound of the bell leaving the boy quaking
the sound grows louder as two horse drawn carts full of battle ready police tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in paradise square
the bells on the carts toll loudly and work magic
the fighting stops
the police all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets leap off the wagons
there are several moments of absolute silence broken only by the sound of the wind and the groans of the wounded
then as one the dead rabbits and the native americans rush the police together hurtling stones and brandishing weapons
even the street kids get into the act kicking and biting and generally having a fine time
the gangs swarm all over the police driving them back
some lucky cops climb back on the wagons and try to get away
the unlucky police remain behind dead on the ground
the gangs cheer jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating police
when the second wagon disappears from view the gangs confront each other once again
another brief moment of quiet
the street kids settle back into their spectator role
then the gangs go at each other with fresh intensity
amsterdam finally sees his father and starts to push his way toward him
vallon and bill the butcher stand facing each other in the midst of battle like two titans then they rush at each other joining with a terrible fury
shang still blindly swinging his blackjack makes his way closer to the relative safety of the brewery his face stained with tears of fear
he hits someone
the man turns swats him down
shang sprawls on the street which is a swamp of mud and blood and dirty snow and finds himself face to face with a departed peg leg
someone has removed his artificial limb and driven it through his heart
across the square amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a native american sneaking up behind him
amsterdam grabs a long truncheon from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the knees
the man falls howling
amsterdam hits him again
he is hysterical
vallon and bill the butcher keep fighting
amsterdam sees with a single look that his father is in the fight of his life
he looks for a weapon to help
sees a hatchet lying by the body of the rabbit he has just beaten senseless
he grabs it and runs forward looking for an opening between the butcher and his father
as the two combatants move amsterdam moves
bobbing weaving feinting falling back
looking for his chance
as bill deals vallon a blow that rocks him back and throws him off balance
just as amsterdam has made his move
he rushes forward sees his father falling tries to turn but
the boys hatchet slashes his father in the leg
vallon falls to one knee gestures frantically to the stunned amsterdam to get away
and bill is upon vallon sinking his knife into his chest
vallon screams and falls on his back bill kneeling over him
he looks into his enemys eyes
and vallons eyes lock on his
for all his suffering vallons eyes hold bill
he forces himself to look at bill
its a terrible struggle
but vallon will not look away
amsterdam hysterical rushes at the butcher
the butcher grabs amsterdam by the arm making him drop his hatchet
you need a weapon
use a knife
he puts the struggling boys hand on the hilt of the knife that the butcher sunk into his fathers chest
it makes a deeper cut
and his hand guiding the boys he rams his knife deep into vallons heart
say a benediction priest
vallon bellows in agony
amsterdam screams at the very same moment his cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air
to amsterdam hold this close to mind boy should you ever think of going up against the native americans
bill the butcher rises and all around him as if on some mysterious signal the fighting subsides
a dead rabbit sees the fallen vallon takes a battered brass horn from his belt and sounds three notes quick and sharp
as the notes fade away the fighting stops completely
announcing ears and noses will be trophies of the day
the rabbits scamper to collect their dead and wounded before the natives can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs
but there are many corpses maimed
the street kids disperse
the main battle is over and the natives have clearly carried the day
the rabbits file past vallon rorming a protective circle around him
amsterdam kneels at his side
vallon tries to speak
blood bubbles in his throat
cant cross the river
with steel through my heart
amsterdam looks around
none of the rabbits makes a move
this is clearly something he is meant to do himself
amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife pulls on it
vallon tries not to cry out
the knife does not move
amsterdam tries again
he cant budge the knife
nearly wild amsterdam pulls with all his strength
vallon screams in agony
amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his fathers back four inches off the ground
still the knife will not move
vallon passes out from the pain
now finally someone steps forward monk eastman
he leans over but amsterdam berserk with grief pushes him away turns back to his father and with a last desperate pull draws the knife from his fathers heart
he throws it on the ground
monk picks it up wipes the blade on his arm closes the knife and hands it to amsterdam
thats yours rightfully
now monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside vallons coat removing some money
and this is mine
only whats owed
use the rest for funeral
he tries to shove monk away from his father when the native warrior intervenes
amsterdam wild with shock and grief turns back to his father as monk takes whats owed him
amsterdam bends over to kiss vallon on both cheeks then on his left eye
the boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid springs open amsterdam jumps back despite himself
vallon stares at him a last moment of recognition
think of me
dont never look away
vallon convulses and dies
amsterdam shakes him to revive him
take the body
bring the boy
several rabbits take a step or two forward but amsterdam springs up at them like an animal
come an lad
therels nothing to be done now
leave him be
hes his to mourn
and the rabbits turn away going back to the old brewery or vanishing down the narrow streets
now a few citizens venture out into paradise square
a couple of scavengers scoot about looting bodies
amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving undisturbed keeping solitary vigil over his father
a title is superimposed across this scene the same afternoon
as the sun goes down we have our first full look matte at the low pale outlines of the city
the harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships
just north of the island tip is the steeple of the citys tallest structure trinity church
the buildings of wall street are masses of concrete and wood the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones
just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the five points
the old brewery stands tall and forbidding over paradise square
above the five points in the distance we can glimpse some finer newer buildings
one wide street broadway seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor
the only sounds are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats the creaking of masts in the winter wind
a closer view the title fades off
we see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying immigration the sun has nearly set
a boy about years old sits on the edge of the castle garden dock gazing down at the frozen hudson
he can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice
his name is johnny sirocco and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness
abruptly he reaches down and smashes through the ice with his fist
in slow motion we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current each bearing away a reflection of johnnyls face like pieces of a puzzle
wheres your family sonny
johnny sees a policeman scrutinizing him
lilting brogue my mothers just there
he gestures toward a ship where men are unloading cargo
in a hoist they are lowering a thin pine coffin to dockside
on the trip her insides all broke up
she wasnt dead and there was three others fighting for her bed
and your father
wheres he then
i never knew him
taking johnnys hand we better see to you then
the policeman leads an awed johnny through the teeming streets of the five points
where all those streets come together right ahead is the true five points
but most speak of the five points and mean anywhere between the battery and the bowery
although the nights cold the streets are jammed
whores painted like carnival gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up
sounds of laughter and combat filter out from garish saloons like the little naples the hell hole the egyptian hall
in the midst of all this highlife are beggars and the sickly looking for charity scrounging garbage in the street
an indigent battles a cripple for a meager scrap of faod
a richly dressed woman riding by in a carriage hides her eyes by raising a huge bouquet of flowers in front of her face
streets hereabouts are lively of an evening
the city comes here to sport
but theres places to put up a boy on his own
three women exquisitely costed burst from the door of the egyptian hall
under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp their faces are no longer striking
johnny stares there is something not right about these faces
what are those
those are as you might say a sort of
we see one of the womens faces suddenly harsh under gaslight under thickly caked make up is a smiling transvestite
sort of whatnot
ill buy your bonny friend
the policeman fetches the transvestite a strong whack with his nightstick
the transvestite screams and falls
and johnny runs
but johnnys off already lost in the mad street life
a funeral chapel
vallans body lies in state
he is wearing his gang regalia and all the dead rabbits file past his coffin in solemn tribute
a woman bends down and kisses the body
happy jack mulraney holds vallons crucifix which he has obviously inherited
as a disreputable looking minister mutters prayers happy jack whispers to a silent amsterdam
we passed the plate amongst ourselves
come up with enough ned to carry all this and carry you a while too
he stuffs some money in amsterdams pocket
where will my father rest
potters field with everyone else
my father wont be buried with everyone else
hell lie separate in fresh ground facing east
what difference where he faces
hell face east for the second coming of christ
when jesus gets to the battery you show him the way from there
the minister finishes the service
cornelius a funeral director who resembles one of his own customers ushers in a woman maggie pulling a lovely year old girl jenny everdekne by the hand
the woman is obviously drunk the girl frightened
will you have music entlegen my daughter do any song you like
not tonight maggie we got
monk eastman interrupts from the background
any ned in your pocket sir
monk hands maggie some coins
she sing sweet as she looks
pure celestial sir
to girl go on jenny
jennys voice is sweet as promised
the song she sings however is a bawdy saloon song
maggie cuts her off fast
no jen the other
jenny starts to sing a hymn
to avoid looking at the corpse she lets her eyes rove all around the chapel until she sees amsterdam
she locks straight at him until the hymn is over
and he does not take his eyes off her
cornelius is about to escort maggie and jenny into another room crowded with mourners when a smartly dressed man daniel killoran gestures to him from the shadows
tweed would like a word mr
cornelius hesitates tweed of tammany
at the mention of the name cornelius shoos maggie and jenny into the mourning room and shuts the door behind them
then he gives killoran his full attention
in your office
at your pleasure of course
as the door opens we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto the spectacle in the next building
he is in his late s already a little fleshy but dressed with dash william tweed
he shows a bemused almost schalarly interest in the goings on next door
this mortuary is located next to a bordello where the windows are uncurtained and the energy and variety of the activities inside is astounding
tweed finally turns as killoran opens the door
with a view like this im surprised the dead can rest in peace
is there anything i can
happy to serve mr
lend me something
puzzled oh i dont know what i could
i believe in form and appearance you see
just like yourself sir
and i believe in law and the power of example
our city is a lawless wilderness sir
im asking you to help chasten it
a matter of civic duty then
and civic pride
i want you to help me set an example
smiles i only need to borrow one of your clients
two native americans open the door where vallon is laid out and bill the butcher strides into the room
there is immediate tension like an electric charge as other natives stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while bill walks over to the coffin
he places a black rose in vallons folded hands
tomorrow your cortege will cross paradise square into territory protected by the native americans
you will be permitted undisputed passage both ways
that is our tribute
after that any rabbits wishing to join the native americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed
all others will be dispatched
he starts out of the silent room but stops when he sees mank eastman looking at him with easy interest
bill the butcher stares him down but monks gaze never wavers
ill expect you first
oh i dont know
all that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake
ill spill blood when the price is right
but blood for ceremony
i prefer holy communion
you saw us fight today
you know we can pay any price
not now and not any time after
independence is a slippery thing
but being a rival
well thats dead dangerous
bill brushes past monk and leaves followed by the natives
now the rabbits file out with monk among them
come on boyo
ill put you up tonight
ill do for myself jack
amsterdam stares at him theres no mistaking youre his son
happy jack leaves amsterdam alone in the room
now by himself sure of no one seeing amsterdam cries
cornelius is seated in his office enjoying a late supper while looking out his window at the bordello activity across the alley
a noise at the door disturbs him amsterdam
whats the cost to bury my father proud and proper
for a plot a headstone hands to break the earth
what are your current means
amsterdam turns out his pockets which contain bill the butchers pirate knife as well as the cash happy jack pressed on him
cornelius takes it all
of course youll have to wait three days for a city permit
but all this may do for part
amsterdam takes the knife back from cornelius
thats owed another
a grey day
amsterdam stops in front of a window
he struggles with his scarf trying to keep himself warm
his eye strays for a moment and he sees he is outside mr
then he notices something else
his father propped up in a coffin on public display
there is a large sign beside the body the dead end of lawlessness
tammany abhors crime
tammany means justice
a sizeable crowd is goggling at the body
amsterdam bulls his way through the people to the street
he looks in the gutter then looks up quickly
someone is watching him johnny
hes carrying an armful of wood
amsterdam grabs the longest plank johnny has
its a penny the load
he turns with the plank in his hand and starts to run back through the crowd
johnny manages to grab the other end of the plank
but amsterdams so strong he yanks him right along
the crowd yells as it parts for amsterdam who charges through using the plank like a battering ram with johnny on the far end born along by stubbornness and momentum
amsterdam shatters the window and the crowd scatters in a blizzard of glass
amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin which falls over spilling vallons body knocking the boy over
amsterdam picks himself up as johnny stands frozen
he starts to pull his fatherls body from the window
help me goddamn it
in a daze johnny steps forward and helps amsterdam pulls the body onto the street
now the sound of whistles and wheels and running horses as a wagon full of police arrives on the scene
behind them the crowd returns yelling insults
the police run toward the window
cornelius dithers at the front of the crowd
amsterdam and johnny exchange a look
then johnny runs for it
amsterdam stays with the body
as the cops close in swinging clubs
amsterdams grabbed and hit a couple of times
the crowd yells
a cop swings his arm back to give amsterdam a good wallop
and someone grabs his arm bill the butcher
whats this all about
ask the boy
i paid cornelius for my father to rest in honor
he told me i had to wait on a permit but he only wanted time to
bill picks up the tammany sign from the ground
make another arrangement looks like
to cop better go along
ill see to all this
take the little malefactor
the cops yank the wildly flailing amsterdam to his feet and drag him off to their wagon
bill the butcher approaches cornelius
give the boy what he paid for
amsterdam is hurled into the police wagon
the door is locked behind him
he pulls himselt to his feet looks out the tiny barred window sees
dead rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession
several help load vallons body back into the coffin and place it onto mr
cornelius fancy funeral wagon
monk eastman leaps up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight
there are peddlers everywhere
one dispenses drinks from a portable samovar
a sailor hawks ships in a bottle repeatedly shouting the same advertisement encourage the work of a landswamped sailor
a silhouette artist offers to draw portraits of passersby
funeral music is furnished by street musicians a drummer a fiddle player and a horn player with a couple of buskers performing along side for good measure
cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square
the gang follows solemnly behind
and across the square the police wagon carrying amsterdam starts moving off in the opposite direction
he keeps looking out the tiny wagon window
the funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal
peddlers cries once again fill the air
the buskers start playing a snappier tune
snow begins to fall
a huge awful prison building modeled on an egyptian mausoleum
amsterdam trying to hide his growing fear waits on line with other prisoners all of them older than he
at the head of the line prisoners are being processed by a jailer and a couple of cops
each prisoner is asked several cursory questions then told to strip
every one of the men is scarred in some way
amsterdam nears the front of the line
the man just ahead of him undresses
his left buttock is missing and his back is covered with whip scars
a prisoner behind amsterdam whispers loud enough for amsterdam to hear
aint his first tombs trip
ansterdam steps up to the desk
the jailer hardly takes notice of him
what do they call you
and this is the first time in the film we have heard his name
the jailer looks him over
your full name
the jailer writes this down with a scratchy pen
i told you
skeptical resigned address
ill put city
now whats your age
got a family
well where was they from when you had one
as amsterdam obeys the jailer turns to the cop in the leather helmet standing at his side
whats the charge asbury
the jailer finishes writing
amsterdam stands naked
through that door there
lowers his voice and dont stand too near no one else
the largest noisiest gaudiest dive we have yet seen full to bursting with bawdy customers even at this late hour
therels a long bar where men and women stand three deep lots of small tables a dance floor and a stage on which four blowsy dancing girls are giving out
with a ribald number titled my fathers teeth were plugged with zinc
one end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an attached hose
bar attendants dump the unfinished contents of glasses into the open barrel top as a line of far gone drunks wait their turn for the hose
maggie jennys mother is close to the front of the line very drunk hanging on to a mush faced hoodlum
two visitors watch
one has a pad and makes quick sketches
ought to be served in a trough properly
will you try some
what is it
its made of all thats poured and not drunk and any they can salvage thats spilt
maggie grabs the hose staring at the artist as she takes a drink
his hand moves quickly an the page sketching her
to maggie your health
she spits at him insulted
the artist steps forward puts some of the all sorts from the hose into his glass and toasts maggie
she nods and turns away
as johnny enters dragging a large sack across the crowded floor toward a far door
johnny rushes toward a wooden pen in the center of the room
there are cries from the crowd of sportsmen of hurry it up and more speed
johnny dodges a kick or two before he finally arrives at the pen
he upends the sack over the pit and a dozen live rats tumble out
a gamemaster slips johnny a couple of cents as he starts his spiel
alright gents and ladies your bets now on towser against the vermin the count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes
the crowd starts to place bets
a sleepy johnny settles down close to ringside to watch the show
at a signal from the gamemaster a trainer tosses towser a fierce mongrel into the ring
the crowd cheers lustily continuing to shout out bets as the dog goes after the rats
the rats fighting for their lives bite the dog attaching themselves to his body
towser retaliates by gnawing the rats snapping them in half and spitting them out
as the crowd cheers and towser kills and money changes hands johnny curls up and goes to sleep
a row of cells noisy and cold
the guard shoves amsterdam into a cell
you get to live private until they come from the orphans asylum
on account of your tender years
there is nothing in the cell but a board for a bed and a window through which amsterdam can see the late winter moonlight
he looks for stars in the sky but can see none
jenny everdeane and a girl friend her own age huddle together in a dark corner of this huge space
the friend opens her hand to show jenny a glimpse of what shes clutching a penny
let me see
i dont believe it
closing her hand no
its a danger
oh come on
friend shakes her head then tell me where you got it
from some man
he took me in his carriage
he only wanted to do something to me fast
shrugs i didnt understand
would he do the same with me
i wont tell you if hes around again
clutches penny tight hes my secret
better keep it more careful then
the friend gets up and starts across the brewery floor acting nonchalant
but she looks around her across the sleeping passed out bodies past the desperate families and their squalling infants to see if shes been noticed
a man and two women cast a glance her way
she looks away but the trio keeps watching her
then fans out and starts to follow her
the friend looks over her shoulder again
sees the man
locks in another direction sees the woman
and then the second woman
all closing on her
the friend starts to run
the trio runs after her
and no one else pays attention
the friend plunges into one of the warren of tunnels that lead off the brewery floor
camera plunges through the darkness after her
her footsteps echo there is the sound of stumbling falling an angry curse and a blow being struck
the friend picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running camera following down the dank halls
suddenly the trio runs ahead of the camera
there is a scream
and others sounds follow quickly now the dull thud of a heavy object against bone repeated several times and then very soon after the most terrible sound of all silence
then two women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel fighting over the penny
the man several steps behind them throws an object to the dirt floor its a stone and it is covered with blood
he comes up behind the two women quickly and grabs the penny from them with a hand that still drips blood and gore
they chase after him across the crowded brewery floor
camera races along the ornate corridor past portraits of many affluent and self important gentlemen
through a door and into
small in size but there are dozens of cages of canaries all around
tweed looks up startled as the door flies open
the birds set up a commotion
camera bears down on tweed as a pair of hands grabs him and hurls him against the wall
bill the butcher glares at tweed
some natives come into the room behind him
you come into the five points and you stole from me
i dont know
you stole vallon
he was my kill
my example of my power
you took him and made him yours
youre a lunatic to come here like
in the background same of the natives have begun to play catch by removing the canary cages from their places and tossing them all over the room
just listen good
the native americans holds the five points
we have prevailed
what you do outside the points is your deciding
outside is your city
inside the points is mine
anyone who says different or does different or thinks different
smiles theylll draw my unwelcame attention
i do understand yes
bill pushes him away and starts out
but you dont understand at all
bill keeps walking
theres a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow streets
turns now you just stay out of my place
its all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver
bill waits for tweed to continue
but tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage
its good work
as far as it goes
you wouldnt be talking to me otherwise
but were talking about different things bill
you describe the present
i see the possibilities
look to the future
there is so much more
the butcher starts to look interested
the natives have cleared out only tweed and the butcher remain
the cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been straightened
bill stands beside the door while tweed relaxes in a chair
theres things demanding to be done that no police force can do not even an obedient one
theres contributions from every dive and brothel
loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected
boss tweed contd and now you and your natives have emerged as the foremost force in the five points im prepared to extend you an opportunity
you can work for tammany
we work for no one
in the performance of these civic obligations
and for a satisfactory
im prepared even to say equitable
its not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized
but then the founding fathers never imagined the city new york has become
maybe you tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle work
might build you up
wed like to
i do miss it
but its wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity
then get cops to do it
oh jesus no
the appearance of law must be upheld especially while its being broken
appearance means nothing
perhaps not within the points
but the smart man could go higher
bill looks at tweed for a long moment
the he shoves himself away from the wall pulls away the chair on which tweed has been resting his feet and sits down close to him
if you can talk plain maybe we can do business
a small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid fire wagon labeled americus co
curious spectators and panic stricken residents crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in flames
as johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire tweed in a white coat and fancy fire helmet steps off the fire wagon to address
no praise god but all we own
tweed places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity then sits on it
waiting on reinforcements
the sound of another bell nearby
down the street from the opposite direction come two more fire wagons
the crowd starts cheering
tweed does not move from the plug
thats not them
its only the black jokes
seems your fire interrupted their festivities
the wagons pull up next to the fire plug
each of them has the words black joke fire co
written large on the side but the firemen wear party costumes not regular uniforms
some are dressed as british redcoats still others as indians
the flames continue to devour the building but tweed does not budge from the plug
he is approached by the black jake chief who is dressed as an indian chief
may i point out that the building is burning to ashes
and may i then remind you pocahontas that this entire area is the province of the americus company and you will kindly keep your distance
the rival fire companies size each other up and start toward each other
the building continues to burn
tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug
as the two companies are about to close with each other a second bell sounds
tweeds reinforcements have arrived the native americans led by bill the butcher
they pile off the wagons before the horses halt
now the black joke co
is outnumbered and it falls back
as the crowd cheers tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug
the men of the americus co
give a great shout and start firefighting a hose is hitched up to the plug buckets are filled a primitive pump sends water spluttering everywhere
but there is not much blaze left to combat and the men quickly grow frustrated
tweed realizes this immediately
next building over boys
mustnt let it spread
the men charge into a neighboring building stomping down doors climbing through windows and swinging axes with gusto all to save a building that is in no danger at all
a local poll named daniel killoran detaches himself from the crowd and approaches tweed giving him a hearty slap on the back
another proud night for tammany bill
just tell them
lowers his voice to take enough to share
and not to steal so in the open
indeed the men are leaving the building with lots of loot
citizens who question their right to do this are promptly knocked down
killoran grabs bill the butcher as he rushes by
boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot out the back
bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry woman approaches tweed
the black joke could have saved my house
black joke had no business here madam
their business was to save my house
tammanys your business
when were here to call upon theres no need of other
we understand loss madam and take care of our own
as tweed leads her off away from the blaze and the thieving he passes a boy sitting an the curb watching the fire
and watching tweed
the flames light up his eyes as we
jennys face as she tries to sleep on a narrow filthy mattress
her mother maggie lies beside her crowding her thrashing about in a troubled drunken sleep
amsterdam eyes wide lying on a cot in the middle of a long room crowded with kids this place is a step or two up from the brewery but not
a big step
he stares at the ceiling eyes grave untroubled by the small cries of loneliness and fear that come from some of the beds surrounding him
as we move close on his eyes we
the same eyes
smart and full of savagery
it is amsterdam
he is now in his early s fully grown and no man to trifle with
moving with jungle stealth and strength he
bursts out the door within the massive frame of a great iron gate over which hangs the sign high bridge orphan asylum
he starts to run and a title comes up
pursued by guards amsterdam runs hell for lather for a long vaulted bridge
its a beautiful stern old romanesque span across the harlem river with rolling banks of leafy trees on the far side
even in the twilight we can see that it is late spring the end of a long afternoon
amsterdam is on the bridge
but he does not slow up until
two orphanage guards suddenly tackle him
a third guard beats him with a billy club
amsterdam moans and curses as much from frustration as pain
its blackwells island certain now boyo
the second guard pulls amsterdam up by the hair
are you hurting
lets hear you
amsterdam wont give him the satisfaction
the guard hits him
amsterdam goes down biting his lip so he wont cry out
instead he forces a smile
theres nothing funny boyo
you been beat and turned back four times now
but every time you bring me back
you got to come further to catch me
through the thick fog comes a ghostly apparition a tattered skull and crossbones made of rags fluttering from the mast of a leaky unstable vessel
the bow of the small boat breaks the fog and on board we see a hulk called sheeny mike kurtz and a huge black kid named jimmy spoils manning the
johnny sirocco grown wary and wiry peers into the fog like a lookout while shang draper at the tiller looks anxious
the hull of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them not five yards away
hard starboard shang
panic i told you forget that sailor stuff
which ways star
their ticket craft crashes into the side with enough force to make a loud thump and to send shang sprawling
sarcastic why dont we just knock on their front door
shang gestures for quiet
they wait and listen
no sound from the deck of the boat above them
the boys throw two rope ladders over the rail of the larger ship and start climbing
the boys board the ship and gather on deck
they look around uneasily spooked by the silence and the fog
spread out and make for the cabin
moving slowly the boys fan out and move toward the cabin at the far end of the deck
johnny stays close to shang holding onto the shipls rail for support
looks picked clean
his hand on the railing is bloody
on the other side of the deck sheeny mike discovers more traces of blood and signals shang
bill and the natives must have got here first
johnny freezes in terror
a long shadow falls across his shoulder
standing before him holding a musket and covered in blood is the ships captain
a butchers cleaver is imbedded between his neck and shoulder
with his dying energy the captain takes aim at a petrified shang and fires his musket
jimmy spoils jumps the captain from behind sending the musket ball way wide
but the sound of the musket is thunderaus and echoes through the harbor
the boys panic and head for the side
thatll bring the harbor cops for sure
about the dead man wait
if hes still alive hes good for ransom
hels dead as good friday cant you
then well take bill the butchers cleaver and sell the body to the medical students
theyll go five dollars for it anyway
well get something out of this
shang and johnny start dragging the body
pushing pulling and mostly panicked the others help
as they boost the body over the side the sound of a bell cuts through the fog
shang shoves the body off the side and into the boat
it lands with a resounding thud
the boys clamber after it
pushing off with cars tearing their rope ladders from the side of the ship stumbling over the captains body the boys slip off into the fog
the harbor police are so close to them they can see a police lantern shining
the boys stay absolutely still
suddenly we see the police boat breaking through the fog then disappearing again
we cant go back to corlears hook theyll be watching
well make for blackwells
and which ways that through this fog
johnny throws his hands up for quiet
from close by comes the sound of cops voices
they are near
the boys stay as still as they can
and the voices recede again in the thick fog
should have asked them directions as they drifted by shang
youd have liked that wouldnt you coal face
youre the only one theyd miss in the dark
lets quiet or well all be found out
as the boys stay still their boat drifts against an outcropping of land and stops
we lay up here till first light
then we run back across the river
contemptuously river pirates
spoils settles back and tries to sleep
johnny watches shang in the bow
shang is too agitated to notice johnnys stare
he looks away waiting for the sun
shang drowses in the boat fighting fatigue then succumbing to it
but hs brought awake suddenly by a loud splash
he looks in the direction of the noise sees
the body of the slaughtered ships captain floating away in the company
he starts to cry out but amsterdam grabs him locking his throat in the crook of his arm
to everyone push off
or his pipe snaps
the other boys are too stunned to resist
they push the boat away from the island
head straight out then turn for the current
he pushes shang away from him
the two boys stare at each ather finally remembering
breathing hard figured you for dead
this is my crew
and welcome to join if youve the mettle
were river pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers
casual disdain youre lost
youve no business saying anything against us
do you know how much you cost us
you know how much that bodys worth
i doubt its worth the water its floating in
fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis
ill make it back for you whatever it is once were in the city
just keep sailing or were all done for
beat to crew go ahead then
beat to amsterdam he was in his prime
hed have fetched thirty dollars easy
a ramshackle room near the docks
it is part meeting hall part living quarters for the gang and part clearing house forstolen goods
shang presides over a boisterous meeting
youre as flat as broadway going north
we cant run the river no more
were poaching the natives and the harbor cops are looking for us
the cops can go to blazes
who cares about them
youlre all sand when it comes to cops shang
but do you have the sand to go against the natives
it aint the time to go against the natives
weve got to build first
then we go
if we go like we did in the river all of usll sink
amsterdam is sitting off to the side watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment
johnny sits next to him
does shang have the sand to ever go against the natives
i dont know
he acts like it
if he only acts held be better on the stage
looks away like her
his tone of voice has changed
jenny everdeane passes before him shes ravishing
amsterdam stares as if hes trying to see into her heart
jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward shang
shang turned her into the best bludget in the points
jenny gives shang silk scarfs wallets and several purses from her coat
shes his mort is she as well as his best provider
but jenny says shes anyones she chooses
jennys haul is impressive
shang picks a bright red silk scarf with a distinctive paisley design from the pile of stolen goods
he examines it with a shrewd appreciative eye
thats the prize of the month
spice islands silk
he puts the scart in his coat pocket with a flourish then throws his arm about jenny in a proprietary way
youll learn our way if youre going to be one of us amsterdam
jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name she looks over and recognizes amsterdam now
every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang
morts more than men being morts
and why is that
because morts have more resources
men can work only on their feet but a mort can turn out on her back
i mean why give at all
why dont they keep for themselves
if you think theres something off about my way of running things you got no place in this gang
i got no place anyway and you got no gang
this aint a gang no matter what you say
its a mob
theres a tense hush in the grubby room
shang takes his arm from around jenny wanting to be restrained
smiling its all your play now shang
maybe you can set him right
jenny hands him a cane
barely managing to hide his reluctance he starts slowly toward amsterdam who stands his ground
the gang steps back to give them room in this tiny space
shang pulls the cane apart its a sword cane but amsterdam shows no fear
he shifts his weight a little watching
and theyre interrupted by a
you boys settle with me before you settle each other
they turn to him
ive come for my due and proper shang
happy jack mulraney the dead rabbit gang member with the halfparalyzed face stands before them in a policemans uniform sparkling clean and splendid a leather helmet and long coat
in his hand he twirls a as agreed then jack
shang opens the top of the gold handled sword cane
inside are large solid lumps of cocaine
jack reaches for the choicest
still smiling are you
sizing him up its the young vallon is it
i hardly recognized you
i hardly knew you under that hat jack
by now jack has taken not only the cocaine and the money and swag shang offers but several of the purses and wallets jenny delivered
jenny stares at him with contempt and he laughs tossing one of the purses back at her
for your respect
jack turns to leave but a brash boy blocks his way
moving fast and fancy jack bashes the boy to the floor with his nightstick
any number at all come on
several of the gang make a move toward jack but shang waves them back
jack departs unharmed to general disgust
jenny walks back across the room to help the brash boy
shang glares at amsterdam slides his sword back into his cane and follows jenny trying to explain himself
is that sand weve just seen
a hot summer day
all the tradesmen are out in force jamming the square and the side streets leading to it
amsterdam walks fast through the crowd enjoying the freedom and the bustle as johnny tags along close behind him
ive got my own way to go why dont you find yours
because your ways different and i want to see where it goes
amsterdam looks at him unless you say otherwise
amsterdam shrugs and keep walking
you act like you have something in mind like you know every day what youll be doing the next
me i dont figure on tomorrow
well if you shut up a while maybe itd come on its own
he stops looks now what the hells that
following his glance oh thats heaven
we see what theyre looking at the old brewery
in worse shape than ever before but shut down abandoned
a tattered banner flaps against the front door future home of the five points mission praise god
the reverend shadrach raleigh pastor
the city shut down the brewery as unfit to live and tammany gave it over to this minister
you dont know
tammany makes the city run
a political organization thats like
like the native americans only ranging over the whole city
as johnny continues to speak we see tammany tactics in action ward healers dispensing coal to the poor and toughs stealing meat off of butchers wagons a political parade with
fife and drum and politicians including boss tweed in ceremonial indian costume and a group of goons busting up a saloon tweed making a speech to enthusiastic constituents and a tammany fire company tearing through the streets scattering everyone in their way finally revealing they are not rushing to a fire but are crasing off a rival fire company
they seem like the law but they got a way of acting outside the law
anything that happens in this city on the straight or on the sly tammanys a part of and boss tweedls the heart of tammany
amsterdam studies johnnyls enthusiastic face
theyre the best gang there is
so if tammanys the best go with tammany
what are you running with this mob for
cause theyre more my size for now
with tammany you got to do something large something that makes them take notice of you
youre better oft without their notice
you can run free work your own schemes
but if your schemes have size you need size to bring them off
what are you thinking
johnny shrugs grins he doesnt want to give anything away
amsterdam understands turns toward the brewery
let me in if you ever get it figured
amsterdam starts toward the old brewery johnny keeping step
ill go on my own from here
johnny stops and amsterdam continues on by himself
amsterdam holds a candle high for light
he crosses the main floor enters one of the side tunnels
a tiny room we recognize from the first scene this is the place where amsterdam lived with his father
he crouches and tears up some floorboards then quickly lowers himself into the hole
a short tunnel under the brewery floor the kind a kid might make
amsterdam has trouble crawling through it
dirt and rock sprinkle him until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole a battered leather money purse and a paper wrapped package
amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of money is still there then turns his attention to the package
he tears it open
inside is the pirate knife that bill the butcher used to kill amsterdams father
amsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it
the candle light makes the blade gleams
a shock of summer sunlight as amsterdam emerges from one of the back entrances of the brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels broken glass and insensible drunks
amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley letting his eyes adjust to the bright light
ahead of him he sees
shang draper in jovial conversation with a second man we do not recognize
the man is bareheaded and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head
amsterdam waits watches
shang takes the red silk scarf he got from jennys swag and hands it to the second man
he and shang shake hands as if they have concluded a business deal and the second man walks away
amsterdam presses himself close to the door as shang looks around
doesnt see amsterdam
and walks off in the opposite direction across paradise square
the main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange
bill the butcher makes his way past small groups of men engaged in heated political dealings of dubious virtue
bill knocks on the door to tweeds private office while hes opening it
inside is boss tweed seated in a large wooden box like a primitive sauna
around him are various petitioners and his assistant daniel killoran
i dread city stimmers
they bring illness and beget vermin
petitioner l gleason my plague box fends off all pestilence
its elixir combats ill humors
we cant have every citizen of the five points boxed up like cargo
but the season is vicious and i must take thought of our constituents
gleason id like you to shake hands with mr
gleason dubious shakes hands with petitioner as bill the butcher looks on with amusement
a friend and owner of an estimable carting service
work out an arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of mr
gleasons wondrous elixir outside this excellent box
at a cost mr
gleason of how much the barrel
figuring rapidly oh perhaps twenty five dollars
and how much mr
baff for haulage and distribution
the same again
thats a price of fifty dollars
and greedy low piracy at that gleason and baff splutter but a price that tammany in its generosity will meet
merely submit a bill for a hundred
well each have half
and ill retain this box for further experiment
killoran leads the astonished gleason and baff away as bill approaches
bolt the door
as tweed speaks and the anti plague vapors swirl around his head he keeps his eyes closed
scotchy lavelles gone wrong in his accounts
scotchys a good man
not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from sparrows and use it for his own
opens his eyes you got to give him over bill
i cant do that
no matter what he steals i still get more from him than any two others
as do you
what about charles mcgloin
hes running a panel game off to one side
did you know that
bill shrugs i cant get a days work done for all the good citizens pouring in here complaining about crime and corruption all over the points
they accuse tammany of carelesoness
some even suspect
a few practically suggest
eying bill significantly our complicity with this rampant criminality
we must show them tammany stands behind the letter of the law
we need to set an example
beat charles mcgloin will do
ill set the trial for friday
camera moves high along the outside wall past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows
eyes peer out as if a peep show is underway directly below in the tombs courtyard
a prisoner is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head
the crowd is in a carnival mood hot corn girls street vendors hokey pokey i
ice cream merchants even buskers all add to the holiday spirit
jenny works through the crowd pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers
she stops once or twice to have a word with a gentleman flirts for a moment then moves on
further back in the crowd amsterdam notices her
he watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to fascination as he realizes what shes doing picking pockets
the best bludget in the five points
he starts to follow her
jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform but shes so intent on her job she has not noticed amsterdam
the closer the platform the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings jennys concentration is absolute
on the platform an assistant hangman addresses the crowd
those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward
part of the crowd presses in toward the platform temporarily blocking amsterdams view of jenny
he is right against the platform
what am i bid for this coat
a coat of some wear but excellent cut
containing a rather remarkable pocket silk
bid a quarter
a quarter thank you
do i hear fifty cents
the hangman is holding up the condemned mans coat which contains the red silk scarf amsterdam saw shang give away
amsterdam flips the hangman a quarter reaches out and grabs the handkerchief
just for the silk
he stuffs it into his pocket and starts to push his way through the crowd
on the platform the warden steps forward holding a primitive megaphone
do you have any last remarks charles mcgloin
mcgloin grunts from underneath the hood
not from under this hood i dont
crowd near the platform begins to chant no hood no hood no hood
the warden puts his hand on the hood starts to remove it
and the crowd cheers
amsterdam turns sees charles mcgloin
bald with a deep scar running front to back on his head
the very same man he saw in the alley with shang
mcgloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd
the warden holds to megaphone close and mcgloin bellows
i never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may god greet me as a friend
the crowd roar approval at these words
amsterdam pushes through the crowd looking for jenny
spotting her finally
while up on the platform the noose is placed around mcgloins neck and he is hoisted up in no time
we hear his neck snap
his feet kick after death
the crowd raises a zighty cheer
amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting broadway stage a vehicle that looks like a horsedrawn train car
the stage will take spectators back uptown from the hanging
he is working his way toward jenny who is now boarding the stage
amsterdam dashes through the crowd and squeezes onto the stage which moves forward with a jolt
once on board amsterdam looks through the jammed car sees jenny about to sit down a man has offered her his seat
she smiles dazzlingly as she sits
and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap
the man looks down on her and she smiles up at him again
he is bequiled
amsterdam manages to get a little closer
i hope you wont think me rude if i speak
you look a proper gentleman down to the ground
as this conversation continues we watch not only jenny and the man in conversation and amsterdam watching them but we begin to notice what amsterdam sees
although jennys hands apparently remain folded on her lap her right hand moves slowly out from her wrap
toward the man
well i wouldnt want you to think me forward you see
and brushes past his jacket
he does not notice or feel a thing
jennys hand glides past his thigh
nearly brushing it
moving up across his pelvis and around his buttocks
does it matter to you what i think
well i might like it to
toward his pocket
the man is in jennys thrall
he feels nothing and continues to have no idea what is going on
but amsterdam knows
every silken surreptitious move of her hand across the mans body is like a caress that amsterdam can feel
jennys grace is balletic and erotic
as she picks the mans pocket she is without knowing it also seducing amsterdam i mean if you would like
i might like sir
but i cant say now
her hand hovers above his pocket waiting for the sway of the stage to match and mask her movement
and she starts to get up as soon as the stage jostles
the entire car full of passengers leans into one another
and jennys hand slides the mans wallet from his trousers as he recovers his balance
amsterdam watches her withdraw her hand in a flash and hide it beneath her wrap
because this is my stop
may i walk with you a little then
firmly that would be too bold
but ill never see you again
i come every thursday to the tombs to see my father
ill look for you
jenny fetches him another fine smile its almost demure and takes her way off the rear entrance of the stage
lt pulls away up broadway and jenny walks briskly toward an alley
jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself then moves her body a little
and her arms seem to come off
she has been wearing a set of artificial arms hollow inside which she can leave folded on her lap misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing
shes folding up the appliance cotton sewn over a soft form when a voice behind her makes her turn
may i walk with you a little then
as jenny and amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the citys main thoroughfare
are you a spy then
got no one to spy for
im an appreciator you might say
appreciator of what
a good touch
she stops in the street looks him straight in the eye
dont bother with the chat
if you want me we come to a business arrangement
lf the terms is right then i decide how you suit me
then i do it or not
just take a minute i was just
i know what you was just
i had years already of what you was just
you know how i got so good at thieving
sos i wouldnt have to lay down for everyone who had the ned
now i do it when i want to for how much i want to
otherwise i dont do it and dont have to do it and to hell with anyones rules but my own
what about shangs rules
you pay a lot over to him
the better your day the better his
it dont seem gute right
a little curious now whats it to you
give him this
he hands her the red silk scarf
she recognizes it instantly as the same one she gave shang
and you can keep a little more of what you earned
howd you come by this
i got my own touch
are you making me a present or making an arrangement
its your rules right
so you decide
she looks at him for a moment then starts to tie the scarf around her neck like a kerchief
a gentlemens wallet skims across a pitted wooden table straight into shangs hand
jenny is giving him her cut
he opens the wallet looks up at jenny
no more goods are forthcoming
amsterdam hanging back watches them both
shang sees the red silk scarf tied around her neck
pretty slim cut for a hanging day
whered you get that
beat it dont suit you
a sweltering evening
the streets are jammed with revelers and residents
some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air
happy jack mulraney leads a group of apprehensive uptown citizens past drunks and whores
commissioner brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions
nothing but our safety of course
alls snug around paradise square in my company squire
he gestures toward the street down which one oi mr
barnett baffs carts is being drawn by a team of wheezing nags
the cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as an anti pestilence influenza thwarting solution
a service of tammany hall
as the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing residents hoses spurt waves of solution all over the streets
many people are soaked
jack and his citizens jump back just in time
tammany makes the streets nanitary i make am safe
apprehensive even against them
a small distance behind the anti plague cart moving in rough formation come some of shangs mob heading aimlessly across the square cruising for action against them especially
let me demonstrate
jack takes out his gold watch and chain which he hangs carefully over a nearby lamppost
then very casually he leads the citizens off
well be back for this at our leisure
you dare leave it here
safe as a vault lady
since all knows its mine
the gang draws abreast of the lamppost
no one makes a move to take the watch until one of the youngest boys reaches out
but shang knocks his hand away
jack at a distance nods approvingly
you know thats jacks
it should be hangin off jacks vest then
not here like some war flag
that watch is a small price for free run of the points
if its free how come we pay so much
wo shouldnt pay for whats our due
we dont tight when we dont have to
its not warring that counts
its the living day to day
smiles is that right
did i hear that correct
john did we hear that correct
eyes now on johnny
jenny looks at him with great interest
uneasy pause we heard the same
he reaches for the watch
happy jack stands at the lamppost aghast
a woman lowers her head and retches
jackls watch and chain are still in place
but the watch has been smashed
and hanging from the chain is a black cat skinned and strangled
happy jack stands with his citizens
the room quiets as one by one the mob notices him
he grabs the young boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and starts to beat him
whatd you do to my watch you dirty little bastard
jack breaks the boys hand with his nightstick
the boy screams and faints
so does one of the women in the group
jack takes the boys other hand
hands wont be so quick in future
thats enough sport this evening jack
stepping forward it wasnt him
all turn to look at johnny
jack drops the boys hand
i have word for you from who did it
youre to meet him at sparrows chinese pagoda
a low and lunatic place a combination of an opium dream out of the arabian nights and a panel from a bosch triptych
fan tan games played by orientals women and children of various colors suspended in cages from the ceiling as men and women in a secondfloor gallery point at them and
on the main floor a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of all sorts
jack charges in the front door looks around
all right step out you yellow
all the noise subsides
only the fan tan game continues nothing is so interesting that these orientals will stop gambling
now amsterdam steps right in front of him
its a grandstand play
hello happy jack
im the one youre looking for
then youre marked for dead
jack lunges ahead swinging his night stick
amsterdam throws a chair across his path
jack stumbles goes down dropping his night stick
amsterdam grabs it jumps on top of him hits him twice on the side of the head
there is a cracking sound
the patrons of the pagoda gather round
and no sign of amsterdam
two patrons step away from the all sorts barrel
hanging from the spigot like the cat from the watch chain is the body of happy jack mulraney
the belt has been removed from his trousers tied like a noose around his throat then looped over the spigot
his teeth lie scattered on the floor around him
his night stick has been jammed down his throat
amsterdam holds the fancy coat from jacks uniform over his arm
carefully he drapes the coat over jennys shoulders
shang steps forward
i gave no order for this
amsterdam says nothing at first just holds his hand out hes holding the very quietly never mind giving orders
what were you giving this for
im calling you out amsterdam
i got this at the hanging
it was charles mcgloins
everybody here saw you take it from jenny
what was mcgloin doing with it
whatd you give it to him for
i didnt give it to him
why would i give it to him
i gaw you give it to him
last week behind the old brewery
to group hes gone flat
i got no reason to trade with the native americans
what about stepping up in the world as it were and leaving the rest of us behind
theres a reason
making a separate arrangement for yourself with the one native so stupid and luckless that he got hung
thats you to the ground shang
very edgy now to group who believes what hes saying
can any of you believe what hes saying
any of you that believes i did proper by happy jack mulraney tonight stand beside me
any of you that still likes shangs way with the cops and shangs way with the natives go to him
to shang or should we settle right now you and me and just see which of us is left standing
let see where they stand
jenny rises stands next to amsterdam
jimmy spoils johnny sheeny mike are next
now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all stand with amsterdam
whats your pleasure shang
one of the young boys has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt
shang grabs it
he bites the head oft the rat and spits it across at amsterdam
amsterdam almost smiles at him
shang sneers drops the body of the rat and leaves
this mob ever have a proper name
we was called after shang when we was named at all
were the dead rabbits from now
they were the best
they were history
they were legend and well live up to them
amsterdam sits on an empty pier watching the ships in the river
theres a sudden rustling noise as a noose coils around his neck
shes slipped the silk amsterdam gave her close to his throat and shes tightening it
amsterdam starts to resist
then he sees hows shes looking at him
she uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers
she kisses him
whats this then
payment for the silk
then drops the silk from his throat and starts to touch him
then his hands are under her skirt
then under the cloudy moonlight they start to make love
amsterdam pulls happy jacks uniform coat over jenny to keep her warm in the chill air
you were waiting for me out here werent you
maybe i was yeah
you was that sure of me
sure enough to wait anyway
waiting dont cost nothing
it dont do to be sure
i could go away just as easy
he sweeps the coat away from her body allowing her to leave
ill say when i want to not you
beat smile one way or another i get what i want
looking at him yeah
if it was just a shag you wanted
youre a gypsy are you come to tell my fortune
go ahead then

hell know about me soon enough
and after the butcher

youll be in love with me
you just had me
you can have a mort any time you want
so why look for more than that
thats taking love not giving it
i want it to be just you and me no one else for either
cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other
i dont know i want to mean something to you or anybody
can there be good in that
he stares at her
jenny pulls the coat tighter around her
itll take a while if we do
if we ever do
and what about the meantime
a crowd gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the points
a beefy speaker is making an anti irish speech on behalf of james w
barker a mayoral candidate supported by tammanys current rivals the know nothing party
hand painted signs are everywhere bearing barkers unsavory likeness
a couple of buskers provide a musical score for the political spiel
the potato is a thick vegetable
comes out of the ground dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death
cheers and laughs from crowd we dont want to keep lem out of the country
well even give em a place at our table
but we aint gonna vote em into office
much cheering and jovial approval from the crowd
on its fringes amsterdam and the dead rabbits make their way roughly across the square
any irish hears that will be out for blood
the irish is too busy building up tammany
thats where their brains and muscle goes
once theyre inside with their cronies they turn on their own outside
tammanyd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could
wed do the same
amsterdkm not against our own we wouldnt
thats the difference
tammany earns better
thats the difference
i aint seen their ned yet
johnny stops walking betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain the days deal
you will at days end thats our arrangement
a quarter a voter whether theyre repeaters or not
im telling you we got a square deal
its sound amsterdam
well its ned anyway
just make sure you count it when we get it
its just a days job we dont have to make it a lifes work
we work for tammany today and kill them tomorrow if thats our pleasure
so were politicians just for today
not for a minute
were better than that
the dead rabbits go about the business of rounding up tammany voters
they pick up drunks in alleys jenny and some of the dead rabbit morts raust patrons in a whore house rabbits shanghai sailors from saloons corral citizens as they walk
along the street either wheedling or bullying to get them to vote
its the strong arm of democracy
on one side of the door some dead rabbits with a rabble of potential voters on the other police doing their best
behind and all around various ward heelers and small time politicians representing both the know nothing candidate barker and tammanys fernando wood
varicus factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their voters into the polls
hes got the right to vote damn you
not four times he dont
shoves a voter therell be no damned repeaters here
the cop and jimmy play tug of war with a besotted voter while other gang members rush to grab voters leaving the polls
the main floor is jammed with clubmen and party racks
daniel killoran bustles from group to group making promises taking notes and searching out boss tweed who is holding court in a far corner surrounded by i would never speak
ill of a rival
i would never say that every know nothing is a horse thief
it is my observation however that every horse thief is a know nothing
good natured laughing all around
even tweed seems amused
killoran catches the boss eye and whispers to him
the know nothings are already finished and theres four more hours at the polls yet
keep our men voting
everybody works today
its not a victory we need daniel
i want a triumph
amsterdam roughly deposits repeat voters in the barber chairs as the barbers work frantically to cut their hair prune beards and otherwise alter appearances
as soon as one customer is done sheeny mike douses him with bay rum and pushes another repeater down in his place
johnny keeps count of the turnover
now thats eight
and how many still to come
he looks toward the door where more repeaters are lined up waiting their turn under close supervision
i already voted once today
cast for tammany by god and fernando wood
come here and do your duty
amsterdam grabs him and slams him down in a chair
amsterdam and some rabbits burst into the front door frightening and scattering all the chinese gamblers
barking orders line up like soldiers
they got no notion what youre talking about
to johnny you explain their democratic right
illl see they unterstand
amsterdam grabs the nearest two chinese by their pigtails and hurls them against the wall
amsterdam and the rabbits prowl the murky darkness where opium eaters lie in bunks stacked high against the walls
the rabbits start rousing and rounding up the opium eaters
jimmy spoils slings a couple over his shoulder like flour sacks
amsterdam shoves two more out the door past an admiring daniel killoran
to johnny i come to see if our counts square
you boys have made a remarkable showing
who the hells this
hes our tammany man
killoran compares his figures to the piece of paper where johnny has been keeping his own count
with an edge our own tammany man
we are coming along
happy to meet any friend of johnny siroccols
pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole five points
best but one
killoran looks up
johnny standing behind amsterdam shakes his head no vigorously
killoran gets the message
smooth maybe nobody
but when the counts done the numbers will tell whos come out in front
im in no race
just pay us what you owe
at the victory celebration
a tammany victory celebration
when we last saw this place as amsterdam confronted happy jack the place was busy alive
its riotous now jammed to bursting with politicians criminals gang members morts whores hangers on uptown thrill seekers journalists and cops not all of them off duty
the sound of the place is a cacophony of shouting singing gambling and strange music which we cant identify at first
we start close on a huge ruby ring and we hear
read what it says there alongside the ruby
read it out
and we move out as a well wisher reads the latin inscription
fortuna juvat ordentes
a grand victory gift from the men of tammany
now tell em what it means mayor wood
fortune favors the bold
tweed gives him a resounding slap on the back
what do you think
would that make a fit motto for our fair city
well i could certainly see
interrupting weve got a motto
what is it
no one knows well hell lets get one we can remember
were going to build a new city hall we better have something to put over the front door
and mayor youll make sure the latins right
as wood nods his assent camera moves across room
past the gilded cages suspended ten feet over the floor where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation
occasionally a reveler will jump up to try and grab one of the caged inhabitants
still moving camera
passes a stage where we finally see the source of all the strange music weve been hearing the music is provided by chinese musicians a woman singer a dancer and
they perform some weird mangled five points version of chinese opera
the music and performance continues as we move past
across a pewter fan tan table where chinese gamblers play with fierce animation and concentration
by comparison the occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists
everyone shouts and scrambles to place bets with the fan tan dealer
above the dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling through which other players may watch the action below
these fan tan players lean over an elegantly carved rail peering at the action on the table below placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a basket
attached to wires that whirrs constantly overhead
we continue to move past
until we are at the door of the place where amsterdam johnny and the rabbits are having words with a bouncer
i dont know you you dont enter
enjoying himself come on what are you saying
if you dont know us now youll know us tomorrow and youll be working for us next week
more temperate daniel killoran knows us
oh he does
we work for him
the hell we do
to amsterdam tampen down will you
why dont you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story
he shoves johnny who stumbles back into amsterdam
theyre both mad now and they step forward together toward the bouncer
until killoran intervenes
to bouncer its all right nat
theyre saying the truth
they gave a good days work for a good wage
killoran hands over a paper wrapped parcel of money which amsterdam takes firmly
a fine first showing
but second best
you dont say so
its no shame to be bested by veterans
the native americans always sweep the field
we count on them sure as mass comes an sunday
to johnny glaring did you know this
is this some scheme of yours
no i didnt have no idea
i was working the same side as the natives
thats only right
bill the butchers our ambassador throughout the points as you might say
its deemed an honor to work with him
everyone knows bill poole everyone fears him everyone
i sure as hell dont fear him
and i sure as hell wont stand with him or any who calls him one of theirs
well if its matter of personal honor the money can only be a further insult
i have no wish to rile you further so if youll allow me
he reaches to take back the parcel of money but amsterdam bats his hand away
where is he
wheres bill the butcher
this is a tammany night
if you and bill poole have matters to settle you can do it any other time any other place i dont give a good dancing goddamn
but you do it here tonight and all the five points will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven
or you could as the book says put away childish things
join the celebration
personally i always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing
amsterdam stares at him as we
as a chinese acrobat twirls in the air off the stage and lands in the middle of the audience
the crowd is raucously appreciative as the acrobat does gymnastic moves among them
past a table where the dead rabbits have settled
it is later in the evening and everyone has been drinking
amsterdam sullen intense watches
bill the butcher across the room
he is like a prince regent
everyone pays him court including several uniformed cops tammany hangers on and newspapermen
bill receives the attention as his due
while amsterdam keeps watching contempt and hatred gleaming in his eye
he pays attention to none of the gang around including jenny
johnny takes advantage of the situation
i got experience
its the education i lack
and you heard i was a good teacher
i dont listen to talk i figure for myself
and i figured youd be good at everything you did
and tonight i got the ned
and now what
now im ready for you
unless theres an arrangement between you and amsterdam
glancing over at amsterdam not to my thinking
needs to be sure amsterdam
listen up amsterdam
amsterdam glances over at them
to johnny you going with me or him
its my thinking matters here
you dont have to ask him nothing
makes his decision hows the evening passing
puts his arm around jenny cause its treating me fine too
she gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor johnny following her holding her hand
as they pass amsterdam he leans toward jenny
this is no game you and me
dont go on like its a game
i said already its not a game
johnny pulls her away
as he watches her go through the crowd amsterdams gaze falls on bill the butcher again
and for the first tine their eyes meet
bills eyes rest on amsterdam take him all in
but dont remember him
he looks away as a tammany hack steps up to pay court
and a master of revels center floor shouts
gentlemen and gentlewomen if you please
we will now
raise the cages and start the bidding
the crowd cheers and kids pull on a series of ropes and pulleys to raise the cages further above the floor until they are parallel with the second floor gallery
of the pagoda
women and men call out bids even as the cages rise through the air
depending on their age the women and children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation trepidation or fear
a few drugged or drunk on all sorts lie insensible in their impossibly cramped space
johnny and jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she spots a couple leaving a room and walks inside
johnny closes the door behind them as a burst of applause
rises from the main floor where bill the butcher stands in the dead center of the room
he slowly removes his coat and hands it to a flunky
he is wearing his battle vest underneath and it is fully rigged with all his butchers implements
the place quiets
kids swarm silently like busy ants all over a huge wooden chandelier lighting its hundreds of candles
only the noise from the chinese playing fan tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now
the kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is raised toward the pagoda ceiling casting the whole place into a new riot of light and shadow as the butcher
now the chinese opera dancer steps forward and stands near bill
the unsprung music begins
the dancer starts to move sinuously
and bill with amazing skill starts throwing his knives
the knife misses the dancer by a hairsbreadth landing in the floor near her foot
she doesnt flinch
she keeps dancing
and bill keeps throwing
the knives which follow the dancer around the room in a careful deadly choreography
they land just inches from where she has just been or will be in a wall a pillar the apron of the small stage the bar the barrel of all
after each knife lands kids retrieve it
when one of the knife kids pulls the blade from the all sorts barrel drunks knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole
native americans meanwhile work through the awed attentive crowd
they avoid cops tammany members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too sober
but when one of the natives spots a marginal citizen they grab his hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes
center floor bill pulls two knives out balances one in each hand
as a whore in the crowd pushes a guy whos groping her toward a couple of natives
hels wearing a large ring
as soon as the natives see the ring they throw their arms around the groper like a long lost pal and escort him to bill
who throws both knives rapidly at the dancer
they land on the floor inches from her dancing feet
she spins away to great applause as the natives bring the groper to bill
are you prepared to be celebrated
are you ready to be famous
how much will it cost
just a moment of your time
my men will assist you
they do quite a bit more than that they grab the groper and knock him to the floor
in the crowd one spectator turns to his companion
watch this careful
ive never seen the like not even in barnums museum
the groper cries out as the natives pin him to the floor spreadeagled
bill has one weapon left
in a special pocket inside his vest
its his cleaver
he takes it out slowly savoring the moment
the pagoda goes quiet
only the gambling continues
the music dies
the only sound beside the noises of the chinese at their fan tan is the groper who hollers for help as soon as he sees the cleaver
bill hefts the cleaver in his hand feels its weight calculates timing figures distance
and starts throwing it in the air
catching it by the handle
then throwing it again
higher faster and harder with every toss
in full control whats it so quiet for
i dont need quiet
the chinese opera music commences with a dissonant crash
and bill catches the cleaver again
but every time he throws it and every time he catches it by its handle
he also moves closer to the terrified groper
standing very close
he gives the cleaver a mighty toss
sending it spinning high in the air
up past the cages
past the second floor gallery jammed with appreciative spectators
until it slows
seems to hang in the air
then starts its descent
towards bills waiting steady hand
the groper screams in fear
bill smiles confidently holding his hand out until
just as smoothly just as confidently
he pulls his hand away and the cleaver falls with terrific impact on the splayed hand of the groper cleanly severing it at the wrist
the groper faints dead away as a tremendous cheer greets bills amazing feat
one of the natives tosses bill the severed hand
bill slides the ring off the finger and tosses it to the chinese dancer
theres for your beauty and your song
the dancer puts the ring on her finger and dances off
bill tosses the hand to the floor and walks back to his table
the crowd parts murmuring compliments on his dexterity and the knife kids reverently return the butchers implements
now two dogs from the rat pit in the back room run through the crowd and fight frenziedly over possession of the bloody hand
the crowd passes the groper overhead and we see from above the gropers unconscicus body being passed from hand to hand
the crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door
the gropers stump bleeds on them as he passes overhead sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament
bill approaches his table acknowledging the continuing adulation and is about to sit down when a voice rises above all others
bill turns searching out the voice
and sees amsterdam standing at his own table
his attitude is calm smiling respectful
but his eyes are demonic
my compliments on your exhibition sir
thank you sir
it was like watching a dance
bill nods his thanks some great grand goddamned dance
bill looks at him more closely you know me sir
are you missing a finger
appreciative laughter from the crowd
the laughter turns a little uneasy
bill the butcher sizes up the younger man
do you have a name
thats a new york name
suddenly smiles shall we drink to it
they drink and to my other name
will you drink to that
priest vallons son
amsterdam nods of course ill drink to that
your father was a worthy man
not worthy of you
those dogs aint worthy of you
you aint worth what they feed on and what they shits too good for you
only the chinese gamblers at their fan tan ignore this confrontation
what do you want boyo
i got to give you something butcher
something from my father
amsterdam pulls out the piratels knife which bill the butcher used to kill his father almost years before
you got the sand to draw a blade in front of me
you will make good sport
come ahead and give it here you son of a bitch
and amsterdam throws the knife the bright blade flashing out of his hand like lightning
and just as quickly the buitcher picks up his table sending glasses flying and breaking using it as a shield
and the knife thumps into it dead center
the butcher heaves the table at amsterdam
sending patrons yelling and scattering
amsterdam leaps out of the way of the table then runs at bill the butcher
whos already coming for him
as they clash and grapple with each other
patrons all over the pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to make bets on the outcome
the odds do not favor amsterdam
and neither does the fight
amsterdam fights with real blood lust but he doesnt have the butchers skill or experience or dispassion
he breaks the butchers clinch
hits him once in the face
then a second time and then gets floored by a well placed kick
the crowd cheers
and on the second floor jenny and johnny come out of the room
still arranging her clothes jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below sees the fight
and starts to run down the stairs
johnny watches her go
looks at the fight again for a second
then follows jenny to the main floor
the butcher is on top of amsterdam now
he hits him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver
then hits him again
in the crowd now jenny finds sheeny mike
the butcherll kill him if we dont do something
it was amsterdams own doing
and itll be our death too if we try to stop it
finally catching up thats the truth
the truth is you dont give a damn about him
yeah well if he gave a damn about us he wouldnt have called out the butcher in the first place
jenny looks at him with contempt then starts into the crowd
johnny grabs her arm but she pushes him off
on the floor bill uses the flat side of the cleaver to smack the barely conscious amsterdam on one side of his face
then on the other
until amsterdam is barely sensible
bill grabs him by the hair
amsterdams body is slack
what do you say
loin or shank
rib or chop
the crowd yells their choices
jenny tries to plunge through toward amsterdam but a half dozen morts and whores put hands on her and hold her back
come on let me hear you
the crowd yells louder youre all talking at once i cant hear you
a near frenzy i dont hear the choicest cut
the best the vital
they quiet a little to listen the heart
i think i must have the heart
this is greeted with the biggest cheer of the night
the newlyelected mayor wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the slaughter but boss tweed calms him with a single dismissive gesture
even the boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice
come on look at it
you fancy yourself a gladiator act a gladiator
raises his cleaver watch the death blow when it comes to you
go to hell with open eyes
bill the butcher readies himself to deliver the blow
and a hand grabs his wrist stopping his arm
who would dare do this to bill the butcher
bill turns incredulous to look into
the untroubled face of monk eastman
its been a full evenings fun now butcher
you got nothing to do with this monk
well im the game warden you might say
im telling you this bucks too young yet
wait till hes aged for a proper kill
with his gigantic strength monk actually pulls the butcher off amsterdam and onto his feet
just settle yourself bill
and he part shoves part throws bill back a good twenty feet
and let the merrymaking continue
the dead rabbits have scampered forward and theyre picking amsterdam up off the floor
monk looks at jenny and johnny who each have amsterdam by an arm
it was his father took me in first and its thanks im returning now
ignoring bill this squares any debt
get him out of here
as the rabbits carry amsterdam toward the door monk finally turns his attention back to bill
ill have you then
come ahead bill
unless youre wanting to shout me to death
and bill comes forward brandishing his cleaver
monk eastman stands his ground unmoving untroubled
everyone looks on in awe at this contest
except boss tweed
to killoran if these two are going to combat it aught to be a worthier occasion
and more rewarding for all
tweed signals to bill stop
the butcher sees the signal but cant believe it
he shakes his head
his blood is up
he wont stop
tweed signals again
bill keeps coming
tweed signals killoran who stands himself
and when he stands every cop and tammany loyalist in the place a hundred of them anyway stand behind boss tweed
as bill keeps coming and monk stands easy waiting
the natives and their allies now stand facing the tammany crew
the tammany backers dressed flush and fancy face the scruffier more savage five points bunch the twin factions of the criminal underworld so different in style and so similar in
purpose size each other up from opposite sides of the room
the odds are shifting the stakes are climbing
even the chinese stop gambling
for the first time all evening the room is absolutely still
even the dead rabbits have turned at the door to see what will happen
tweed and the butcher lock eyes neither blinks
then after a moment
a very long moment
a calm bemused tweed raises his glass
i only wanted to thank you bill for the customary good job today
and an equally bright future for us both
bill does not look placated
the whole place seems ready to explode
until boss tweed rises to his feet and raises his glass higher
will you drink with me bill as a friend
an honored friend
bill weighs the proposition
then looks to his men nods his head to call them off
he grabs a glass off a table to join tweeds toast
the music begins again
the gambling recommences
patrons take their seats
the dead rabbits help amsterdam out the door
monk eastman sidles up to bill the butcher
if theres one thing i cant abide its fighting for free
he takes the butchers glass from his hand raises it in salute drinks deep and hands it back to him
at the door of the pagoda a badly beaten ansterdam starts flailing and fighting by brute instinct
he hits jenny and she goes down
johnny grapples with him as jenny picks herself up and struggles to help subdue amsterdam
he knew what he was doing hitting you
lets get him up
she grabs amsterdams arm and with johnnys help tries to hoist him back to his feet
looking at amsterdams bloody face therels too damn little of him left to know anything
they start across paradise square holding him up
as the rest of the dead rabbits join to help them
all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the five points
and the bouncer closes the door
another door opens and amsterdam stands on the threshold
a week or so has passed since the big night at sparrows pagoda but amsterdams face still shows the marks of bills beating
don whiskerandos is ministering to monk eastman with a straight razor giving him a close and careful shave
monk is thoroughly relaxed doesnt even glance over when the door opens hardly reacts when don whiskerandos says
someones here for you
whats he look like
he looks pretty damned sorry
looks at amsterdam indeed
can i buy you a shave
face is too sore eh
im beholden enough to you as it is
i dont like to be beholden
were all even son
theres nothing more between us
id like it if there was
are you proposing employment
the dead rabbits got to get strong before we make another move
i figure youre the one to make us strong
theres a lot we can learn from you
boyo im a freebooter and a mercenary not a teacher
i cant learn nothing from you and i cant earn nothing from you either
the dead rabbits is going to be glorious again
were going to reign over the points
and bill pooles natives
what will they have to say
they wont have tongues left to speak
dont worry about what theylll have in their mouths
you think about what they got in their hands
beat listen son
take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father
temper yourself like a sword and pay attention to balance
anger spoils an edge
then you say no
monk sighs and points to a huge war club which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror
it has deep marks running along its front like you see my instrument there
first notch represents two dollars and fifty cents
thats how much i got for my first kill
there are forty eight more notches after it and my fee has grown with each one
i can accommodate you alright but you got to afford me
so do business with me or do it on your own
everything i got is still to come
so i guess its on my own then
youll find independence a fine thing a fierce thing
although i do hold money preferable to all
amsterdam turns to leave but im sure well have news of each other
as he shuts the door of the shop monk eastman gestures to don whiskerandos for another hot towel
a large wagon bearing a tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street
boss tweed sits on the front seat next to the driver as his minions hand him coal sacks
tweed distributes them with a smile to the needy who trot next to the wagon
to the people as they grab the coal tammanys here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart
its tammany can make this city a fit place with the help and vote of all you good people
as he continues bill the butcher jumps onto the wagon and sits down beside him
boss tweed hardly gives him a glance
you sent me word
we could use help here
grab a sack
i keep my hands clean
now he looks at him so ive observed
tense better be on your mark to talk like that to me
it was you stopped me at the pagoda
i would have cut monk inside out
what if you hadnt
think of the embarrassment
and what if you had
consider the waste
next time youre in a dust up like that think ahead and make proper plans
itd be a grand source of revenue whoever prevails
it touches my heart how you always
have our best interests in mind
our mutual interests
thats why i want you to contact monk eastman
bills incredulous i want you to extend a proposition
i want him to join us
oh not tammany of course not
we could no more have him there than you
but he should throw in with the native americans become aware of our arrangement and
well use his influence shall we say to enrich us all
youre saying i cant do everything you need
you dont think the natives has been doing good and right
you think theres something more he can do that i
interrupting its none of that bill
none of that
his independence is like a rebuke to tammany
and an insult to you
then you should have let me have him at sparrows
if id been confident absolutely certain that you would have prevailed
monk is an unpredictable power and a figure of size
he needs to be reckoned with
he needs to be killed
hes an elemental force
them you dont destroy
but you can contain them and use them for the good they give off
he hands bill a sack of coal
bill doesnt answer
he hops down off the moving wagon and the needy give way quickly before him then regroup and swarm after tweed and his coal
the boss continues with his tammany spiel enjoying all the attention as the butcher watches disdainful of tweed but filled with angry frustration
from his face we
the incredulous face of monk eastman as he looks at bill the butcher
and this is your offer
its boss tweedls offer
how do you think wed sit as allies bill
the only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretched out dead
my thoughts exactly
then why are you here
because you were asked to be
you were ordered to be
and who would order me among the natives
and would you follow my orders even if they was being relayed from william marcy tweed himself
he eases himself out of the barber chair
the butcher tenses as monk comes toward him
dubious and doubtful my friend
but your offer pardon the offer you bring is the most generous thats ever been extended
i favor the terms if not the personalities
so let us decide the way any native american would appreciate
well do it the democratic way
he throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there beside bill the butcher his arm thrown carelessly around him
passersby stop in wonderment as monk addresses them
citizens of the five points
it seems the native americans have come to trouble
they have grown so weak that now they seek my help
they can pay any wage i ask
but i ask you now
even for money should i carouse and conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle on his chin every time his cock gets hard
monk is beaming the butcher is appalled
his body tenses like a snake ready to spring
but the people in the street just stare they cant believe what theyve just heard
to bill there
im afraid the people have spoken
ill see you again you bog irish bastard
well if its a fight you want now bill remember to come back with a bankroll
monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair
bill glares at the people in the street
one lock from him starts them moving fast
but they do not look away from him quite so fast or at him either with quite the same fear
the vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for the evening
an altar has been hung with bunting ships lanterns and candles illuminate the place
the reverend shadrach raleigh greets everyone
the room already crowded with celebrants of all ages grows quiet as the dead rabbits done up in their party best show up for the revelry
ah the native americans is it now
are they coming
we dont want a ruckus minister
nor do i
i intended no disrespect
id heard the native americans were figures of the greatest prominence here
indeed they are just for the moment
let them come
happy to have them
everyones welcome in a house of god isnt that right reverend
as all are welcome in heaven
ild like to go to heaven
ild like to go to heaven and bite off gabriells ear
youre still welcome even with such peculiar appetites
but if the natives do come father
im not a priest son
theres no accounting for what may follow
im sure gods hand will guide us in that
just as he guided you here at the right perfect time with a right perfect regent
the young lady with the sunset hair
step forward please
radiant and curious jenny joins the reverend raleigh in the center of the room
and the evenings regent chooses her evenings partner
there is much muttering about this from everyone
someone makes a wet farting sound
unfazed here we make only joyful noises to the lord
under the instruction of the bustling reverend and his helpers the women skeptically stand away from the men who allow themselves to be arranged into a line
the reverend raleigh escorts the delighted jenny to a chair that has been placed by itself in the center of the room
jenny sits down facing away from the rest of the guests
she holds a mirror in her hand
the men please
one by one
the first volunteer reverend raleigh brings forward is a reluctant sheeny mike
there are rude comments as he leads mike slowly to the center of the room coming up behind jenny until she can see mikels face reflected in the mirror
she shakes her head
next gentleman please
the boys push out one candidate
now another candidate comes forward
and still another jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess
now it is johnnys turn
he walks slowly across the big room and stands behind jenny trying to look confident
the moment is long the rooms tense
until just once but very decisively jenny shakes her head
jenny watches johnnys face in the mirror
she stays still
finally he walks back to the gang
now amsterdam starts toward the center of the room
he keeps his eyes fixed on jenny
jenny catches amsterdams reflection in the mirror
she nods her head
a small band strikes up a barely recognizable version of a mighty fortress is our god arranged in waltz time
jenny rises and holds out her arms to amsterdam
they start to dance a little clumsily as other couples join them
so you accept
you accept to be my mort and no one elses
teasing no its just that i didnt recognize you in the mirror
you still got some of the face the butcher gave you
going along with the joke its not the butcher its the dancing
it shifts my face all around
maybe youll look better later
the reverend raleigh and his helpers dash among the dancers distributing lighted candles which the couples take and hold as they move around the floor
i will if were together later
she smiles and what about after that
i chose you just for tonight
if thats not good enough ill go with someone else
she takes a candle from the reverend and holds it so the light flickers on amsterdams face
ill have tonight
but after this dont come to me no more till youre ready
his eyes in the candlelight show both his love and his resolution
jenny nods and they dance away
losing themselves now among the dancers all moving and holding candles
as they dance their movement becomes split sequential a study in motion like an old gjon mili photograph
their bodies create a rush of yellow light across the screen like the tail of a comet
in the hallway
johnny stands pressed against a door
louder hissing amsterdam
who is it
come on in
i dont want to come in
you come out
just a damn minute
amsterdam comes to the door half dressed and sleepy
we see jenny asleep on the floor inside
what do you want
just before dawn
the streets are empty the river is quiet
amsterdam follows johnny out of the house
im going to fight you
oh jesus johnny im tired
how about sometime else
you want to tell me what this fights over
is it the butcher
johnny turns determined alright alright
then tell me why like this
so when i lose no one will see
and he slugs him
harder even than he thought he could
amsterdam stumbles stunned then pulls himself up
and charges at johnny knocking him down
the two friends punch wrestle bite and pummel each other with such extravagant energy that they soon
roll off the pier
onto the muddy ground underneath the pier
they land with a shuddering splash in the soggy earth but they keep fighting
as a pack of orphans eyes glinting like night animals scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow
amsterdam has the physical advantage and more skill
but johnny has the fury
all the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically making the match nearly even
the orphan pack watches the fight silently showing no favoritism or emotion just an edge of curiosity
amsterdam hits johnny a wicked combination that makes him sink to one knee in the mud
but johnny will not go down
amsterdam hurt himself just stares at johnny in wonderment
it wasnt me thats been dancing and shagging all night
and he pulls himself to his feet and throws a roundhouse at amsterdam who half staggers out of the way
the moment throws johnny off balance and he falls in the mud again this time on all fours
amsterdam sinks down beside him
johnny wont stop he throws a punch that amsterdam can see coming a block away
but hes too tired too duck or maybe hes just fed up
he takes the punch and falls on his back
thats it then
and he throws himself on amsterdam
its more like he rolls over onto him than anything but hes on top of him now hitting him in the face with all hes got left in him
amsterdam heaves johnny off and pops him a solid swipe to the jaw
that does it
johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the pier
the orphan pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes
amsterdam struggles to his feet stops at the rivers edge to get a handful of water to revive himself
then he looks over sees his unconscious friend
goddamn you anyway
he grabs johnnys body by the shoulders and pulls him to the rivers edge
he gets some water on his hand lets it drip over johnnys face washing away a little of the blood
he draws some more water and rubs it gently onto johnnys face
close on the motion of his hand
it is nearly gentle
as don whiskerandos hand holding a razor travels over the great plains of monk eastmans face
his hand is shaking
whats the trouble don
theres someone here
monk bestirs himself in the chair sees bill the butcher standing in the doorway
its just a man of commerce
monk settles back in the chair as bill the butcher walks into the shop
youre right enough this time monk
to don whiskerandos go ahead
the barber hesitates go on with your work
ill finish my business
don whiskerandos picks up a pair of scissors and nervously starts to trim monks hair
come out with it then
bill nods emphatically at don whiskerandos who is clearly terrified
bill nods again almost vehemently
don whiskerandos shakes his head
bill glares at him
the barber takes a step back
monk opens his eyes starts to size up the situation
you damn craven do it
bill leaps forward grabs the trembling barbers arm and pushes it toward rising from his chair what the hell
and the scissors held by don whiskerandos and pushed by bill the butcher meet monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair
the long scissor blade sinks into monkls right eye
monk bellows staggers toward don whiskerandos who shrinks against the wall
the scissor protrudes from monks eye as he rages blinded by blood now reaching out for the butcher your eyes was open for that alright
and you still got one to see this
bill the butcher reaches above him for monks war club which hangs on the wall
he grabs tight hold of it and with monk nearly upon him swings it viciously at monks head
the blow sends the scissor flying out of monks eye with the eyeball still attached
it also smashes in the side of monks face
he falls still grabbing desperately for the butcher
who now stands over him beating him incessantly with the war club
caving his head in
don whiskerandos looks at bill in a virtual paralysis of terror
the butcher lets the club fall reaches in his pocket and throws some money at the barber
if i was you id use that to open in a new location
the enormity of what hes done is beginning to sink in
he turns to leave the shop
but stops in the doorway
outside citizens of the points are staring at the fallen monk in mute wonder
they have just witnessed a moment in history
bill the butcher surveys them all silently then calls out to don whiskerandos
the war club
the barber steels himself to carry the bloody club to the butcher who hefts it slowly in his hands in view of all
he takes a knife from his vest and cuts the last notch in the club
he steps down into the crowd which parts before him
he walks among them in regal splendor the war club at his side dripping gore
as the crowd falls back bill spots amsterdam johnny and some of the other dead rabbits watching his every mave
holds out the bloody war club in front of him
straight in front of him
pointing it right at amsterdam
i promise you amsterdam
i promise you
then he grins turns away and walks through the crowd prince of all he surveys
boss tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast gaslit restaurant at a long table overburdened with food
seated along both sides of the table is an array of the citys power brokers with whom tweed and his tammany minions mix easily
their attitude toward the power brokers is a mixture of ribald fawning and fine condescension the power brokers in turn enjoy the food and the music from a small band
and the dancing girls who flirt and entertain them while exuding the unmistakable impression of amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization
tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered horace greeley editor of the influential tribune
i may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your company mr
and the pleasures of the company provided you mr
without the tribune endorsing your politics
i suppose you can at that
take with one hand flay with the other
virtuels on your conscience horace but tammanys in your heart
killoran materializes at tweeds side and whispers something quickly discreetly in his ear
tweed excuses himself rises quickly and walks across the restaurant floor
past the band and the dancing giris
to the swinging doors of the kitchen
as he pushes open the swinging door his face has lost its humor
a madhouse of activity
waiters in black suits vests and serving outfits stream by carrying huge trays of food while the kitchen staff works double time to keep up with the unceasing volume
as boss tweed walks in bill the butcher plucks a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as its carried out the door
im not good enough for your table so i eat where i can
takes a big bite its good what is it
is that like pigeon
i killed a pigeon once but it didnt taste nothing like this
you killed a bull this morning
i told you to make an arrangement with him and you come back with his blood on your hands
chewing his food he insulted me
he aggravated me
i couldnt stand for that for no one
you stand for anything if i tell you
you think i should be afraid of you
you act like lightning strikes when you talk
as they talk and the tension builds between them the two men are constantly buffeted by the swinging doors and the unending stream of i never was afraid of you
so dont think i was or act like i was you aint earned it
what did you earn us killing monk
whered you earn the right to ask that question
you raised some dust in the streets a while back but no more
you got power but you aint got muscle and you aint got a notion what it means to be a warrior
i see it lost you a lot of gods sense along with that eye
you dont know nothing about that
it was my doing
it says in the book if thy eye offend thee pluck it out
i followed that law with my own knife and hand
the first i ever fought priest vallon he bested me
and when he came to bring me to death i looked away and he watched me and he let me go
the shame was worse than the killing
i would have cut out both eyes if i could still have fought but cutting just the one gave me heart
when i killed priest vallon that restored me
now i sent monk eastman over i got glory
i got all there is and small thanks to you squire
measured conciliatory you need two eyes to see the depth bill
thats how we help each other
if it wasnt for me would be happy enough to plunder the points and put the fear into people who dont know nothing else
but bill im only saying
look in the distance
you want to sit at my table fine
but you must always remember who the host is
its not a matter of courage welre talking
bill grabs another piece of food from a tray
howls these manners
fine if youre hungry
im always hungry
ive always told you bill
theres plenty for all and more for us together than separate
well dine together sometime
bill the butcher nods appeased and leaves swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos making everyone get out of his way
boss tweed watches him go his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage
everyones gone except some waiters cleaning up and boss tweed and daniel killoran who sit at the end of the banquet table
leftover plates of food have been massed at tweedls place and as he talks he picks from them
let me put this to you daniel
now that the butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the five points a man of myth and moment who is there to take his place
as killoran starts to answer of course
then what do we do about the butcher
hes too useful to be killed but he must be checked
it could be a police matter
any cops who might have the mettle to go against the butcher have blood ties to the gangs
they cant be trusted
and any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use
if bills to be checked it must come from within the points not without
the dead rabbits did a proud job for elections
that amsterdam boy has sand
the last time i saw him he was under the butchers knife looking like a fine filet
who else is there
well the rough and tumble boys over to slaughterhouse point
theres country mccleesterls bunch too and the plug uglies but theres none that have the promise of the dead rabbits or the stake neither
what would that be
the boy amsterdam has a blood feud with the butcher
hes sworn revenge for the death of his father and hes got the heart to carry it forward
hell have the skill and power soon enough
blood will make a man intrepid
bring them along then
nurture the rabbits with neglect
let them roam where they like
and if they roam into some portion of our own revenues
id tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use
theyll cross with the natives soon enough and keep each other occupied
bills got to be a lot more than occupied
ill hold bill in check
if he becomes unwieldy
well damn it all daniel i might just have to oil up my old musket
what do you think of that eh
boss tweed gets up from the table
a waiter is dimming the gaslights filling the room with deep shadows
itd be gratifying mr
but poor politics eh
well we musnt have that
as he walks away i do miss those roistering days though
oh and bring some of that food for the canaries
the sharply angled turn of doyers street nicknamed the bloody angle
sound of a horse and cart as we see a row of upturned mostly women and a native american drives a cart carrying large barrels of milk
a second native rides beside him on the seat holding a rifle looking impassively at the faces turned up to him
a woman holding a baby in one arm and a child by the hand steps in front of them
they almost run her down
we aint had no milk this week
you can have as much as you can pay for
to crowd anyone thats got the ned step up with your pitchers
any not come back when you do
the woman gives her children to other women in the crowd and advances toward the wagon
native cocks his rifle
and jenny steps from the watchful crowd
i got ned enough for all
she holds her hand out as she walks slowly toward the milk wagon
shes carrying a huge fistful of gleaming coins
the natives on the wagon watch her warily
and are jumped from behind by a couple of dead rabbits
amsterdam grabs a milk pitcher from a woman in the crowd axes open the spigot on a milk barrel and fills the pitcher to overflowing
jenny jumps up on the wagon seat
to amsterdam whats our rate
what do we charge
johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the natives
just till were established
then we raise it a penny more than now
is that what you want
you say then
beat then to crowd therell be no paying at all this day
or this week neither
this is dead rabbits business from now on
the crowd scrambles for milk and the rabbits try to keep order
to crowd well take ned if you got it now or in future
but no one will go without
to jenny except us
you opening a charity
theyll pay us what they owe in loyalty if not in cash
tammany gives coal we give milk
they can afford it
the midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty and slightly desperate this is a place that needs low light and long shadows to look good
amsterdam and johnny are at a long bar talking to mother joyce a beefy wised up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms
this place is so clean its the next thing to chaste
and safe as a convent too
from the natives maybe
but not from us
youre saying i got to worry about your mob too
no worries at all
you throw in with the dead rabbits and well worry about the natives
across the room jenny is sitting talking to a few of the whores one of whom is a mixed blood eurasian with long black hair named emma loss
she gets up lazily and heads for the bar
as she passes a drunk he reaches out to grab her
shes used to this and she knocks his hand away
he keeps after her
at the bar mother joyce notices emma being hassled but pays no attention her girls can take care of themselves
to amsterdam and johnny and if someone else comes along do i pay them too
you only pay us
we see you safe from everyone
johnny has been watching the drunk bothering emma loss
without saying anything to amsterdam or mother joyce johnny leaves the bar walks over to the drunk and shoves him away
leave off her
she dont want you
not even if you could pay her
hey just a minute
to emma he cant pay
i can pay
watching this maybe i should offer johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights
laughs a bouncer
i dont know if he could bounce on a feather bed
he wants to be a character like you is that it
hes got his own ideas
too full of tammany maybe but hes a fast friend
across the room johnny is talking to emma loss
she nods and starts to lead him upstairs
but in my trade you go on your instincts
my instincts says to heed you and my memory of your father says im right
well shake on it
amsterdam grabs her hand and have one of my best to seal the bargain
a lanky blonde seated across the room near jenny bestirs herself
come here and show my new friend why were worth special care
jenny watches megs move toward amsterdam
big enough to contain a half gutted mattress supported by a rickety bed some worn sheets and a few guttering candles
johnny undresses as emma sits on the bed and starts to take off her dress
you liked that old man
you would have gone with him
i like anyone that pays thats all
tell me what he wanted you to do
he mostly wanted comforting
i never seen hair so black
can you take the pins out
it takes so long to do back up
he sits beside her and starts slowly almost tenderly to remove the pins
did your mother have the same color
i dont know
as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders lie back i want to look at you
his eyes glide along her body whats that mark
i always had it
touching her lightly and there
is that a scar
she looks at her naked belly there was a baby
they cut it out
and that on your shoulder
that looks old
yeah i got that when i
interrupting quiet i dont want to know when
dont tell me about before or what you used to be i dont want that
what about your scars
do you have scars
none i ever seen
maybe you can find them
her hands and mouth cover his body
he closes his eyes
amsterdam and megs are undressing each other when jenny walks in
i can see you later
megs leaves brushing past jenny
what are you doing
i couldnt decline what mother joyce offered
its in the interests of business
you understand business
sure i do
but theres something else i still dont understand
at sparrows pagoda did you hit me knowing it was me
she hits him
in the face
not a slap
a solid punch
his nose starts to gush blood
he puts his arm under it to staunch the flow keeping his eyes an her
id be celebrating but im losing too much blood
jenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his nose
put your head back
that dont work
put your head back i said
as she tends to him so why so sudden then
every day i see you and you complain i cant decide
now i decide you say its sudden
its the whore did it then
dont flatter yourself
its because youre jealous
its because you didnt lie about hitting me
christ i wish i had
come here then
he reaches to pull her down on the bed
theres too much past
the room where johnny fetched amsterdam out for the fight
amsterdam and jenny have just made love
it must be morning
i dont care im not getting up
this is what you meant then
its going to be just the same from now on
every morning i wake up next to you
or you dont wake up at all
we only just started in and youre already threatening me
its not a threat
no teasing now its a declaration of love
i prefer my kind
she reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine diamond ring which she slips on his finger
amsterdam reacts with surprise gratitude and of course suspicion
whered you get this
you said i was the best thief in the five points
but i got restless
will you wear something i got
a long street of tree shaded houses
north of the five points
this is the first time we have been outside the five points and paradise square
the city rent place
jenny and amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street
amsterdam dressed in a suit cant quite conceal his wonder as he stands staring at the house
what is this place
she gestures for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a maids outfit
i dont see nobody
thats the best time
theyre all having lunch
at the back door of the grand house as jenny opens it slowly and glances inside
youre off your head
pleased showing off you can wait on me a minute
or ill see you back in the points if youre scared
amsterdam looks at her dont worry
i know every house on this street
they all leave their doors open
they live like theyre not in new york
she goes in the house
amsterdam watches through the window sees her going up stairs
then he looks at the dining room visible distantly through an open kitchen door
he watches fascinated fragments of the everyday rituals of a world hes never seen
as sounds drift listlessly from the street beyond and a light breeze blows we see in a series of dissolves the serving of a meal servants carrying and passing plates
family members reaching for dishes and passing them the low kurmur of konversation in accents he has never heard
its not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him
it is as if he has stepped into another dimension
he loses his sense of time and of danger
so that when jenny touches his arm she surprises him thoroughly
i might still be taken for a maid
but youre nobodys notion of a butler
as jenny and amsterdam walk away from the house
she holds his arm
they look young and full of hope like a servant couple just over from the old country enjoying a day off
the police commissioner lives the next street over
i was thinking of visiting him next month but cops dont buy goods
they keep all their graft in cash
amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual
she opens her satchel a little way then nudges him to have a lock at the swag inside
hows that for ten minutes
its a lot to fence
im not going to fence it
im going to keep it and take it where no one will recognize it
where would that be
past the mississippi river somewhere into that territory
thats a hard journey for a woman alone
youd be with me
you got it all planned and straight is that it
once i said id be with you i wanted someplace we could be together
someplace better than here
whats the matter with that
except theres no place but here for me right now
i got to settle things
yeah i know but im talking about settling down not settling debts
you dont have my obligations
the dead rabbits sweep across the bustling square johnny and amsterdam in the lead
its a fair days wage
we just move the people out of the building and collect
who owns the building
the gang approaches a tumbledown building called jacobs ladder because of the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof
two well dressed gents stare at the building fretfully
to johnny im glad you came in force
theres half a hundred people still in there
and not ones given rent the whole year
you live here
no no of course not
i mean in the city
a ways north ill bet
a rifle shot sounds from an upper window and a rabbit falls wounded
they all duck for cover
its not just citizens in there
of course it is
from their damned gang
some of them live there
some of who
the native americans
we didnt contract for that
well pay extra for the danger
but you will pay extra
turns to gang lets go and greet some natives
under scattered rifle fire and a barrage of rocks the gang storms the building charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were attacking a medieval fortress
arms reach out from windows to try and pull them off
the rabbits respond with knives and pistol shots
as they charge inside the camera rises to an overhead shot and we
the same overhead angle
bodies litter the street everywhere
some dead and wounded rabbits lie near natives who have gone to their reward
some building residents wander the street in a daze
johnny is collecting money from the two gents who look very pleased as amsterdam approaches with jenny
hes carrying a rifle he took from the building
to gents alright then
very much alright
quite a spectacle
just the entertainment you favor is it
pardon me for a moment gents
he turns to jenny you wanted to settle you and me
thats so isnt it
you did agree did you not
i did yes
good because i didnt want to act hasty
i can never tell for sure what youre thinking and sometimes im not always sure what youre saying
interrupting excuse me we have to finish and
to gent excuse me
well conclude in a moment
back to jenny where do you settle
amsterdam what are you saying
im asking where does anyone settle
i dont know you mean a place a home
a home yes
excuse me but we really must conclude
ignoring him well im saying to you then jenny everdeane welcome home
no one sees it coming
amsterdam flashes around swinging the butt of his rifle into gent ls midsection doubling him over and sending him breathless to the ground
amsterdam spins again and swings the butt into gent s face knocking him cold
room enough for all
to johnny get them out of here
theyll come back looking for you
with whose help
they wont help these flourishing bastards even for ned
to jenny tell any who wants they can stay
if they cant pay rent they can join the gang
but make sure the best rooms go to us
interrupting i know this building
as jenny leads amsterdam through a narrow tunnel
the place is like a weird catacomb it is narrow and dank filled with bones of dead animals of the two and four legged variety
these lead all under the square into the brewery and out again from there
theyre closed off and forgotten since the reverend opened the mission
pass me the candle
amsterdam hands jenny a stump of candle which she holds high enough to see
that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of jacobs ladder
its a graveyard memorializing gang members gone to a better world or worse
trophies from many gangs including the bones and skulls of some dead rabbits litter the place in loose ritual fashion as if this were a catacomb in palermo
stooping low jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room where several paving stones have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross
a slab of slate serves as a headstone and on it in fading paint barely legible is the name maggie everdeane
we lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to the brewery
one day she slept so drunk she never woke and i brought her back here
dug this myself
give here what i gave you
amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of blackbeards treasure box
she opens it and holds the candle close inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries
theres a lot of it glittering with promise in the guttering flame
jenny starts to dig in her mothers grave
shell keep an eye on this for us
how about some help
he kneels beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones
you trusting me with your treasure then
just take another look at it to remind you
i can always do fine on my own
amsterdam reaches inside the chest pulls out a ring and slips it onto jennys dirt covered finger
she kisses him
whats mine is yours is that it
i could use this too
from the bag he holds up a small gold cross
you making an offering to the reverend raleigh
amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to dig again
are you sure we can trust your mother
boss tweed listens to an angry bill the butcher as they walk briskly down a long marble corridor lined with formal portraits of former tammany worthies
the building and how many
a dozen at least of my natives
the dead rabbits are a wooly bunch alright
i want at them
all of them and amsterdam especial
not just now
its between too late and too soon
theyve become a little too prominent for comfort but theyre still too small for you to soil your hands
the man who killed monk eastman pushing around a mob of upstarts
its practically undignified
to hell with any of that
tweed stops under a grand new portrait of himself
very well and to hell as well with any plans you and i may have for growth and change and even greater reward
youll never advance anywhere beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination
i dont got to advance anywhere further
got to no
but ought to
he hands him a fancy embossed envelope
eyes merry an invitation
better by a little than their place in the old hideout
theres even a window that throws some light an the few bits of castoff furniture in the room
an the bed where jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn light
and an amsterdam who is dressing quietly in the corner
he checks in his coat pocket
finds the gold cross
jenny does nat stir
start close on amsterdams hand as he places the gold cross in a small hole at a grave site then covers it over with dirt
then we see amsterdam is kneeling at his fathers grave
he never had his own cross
now he stands and turns
jenny is half hidden behind an elm tree
your touch is light but as a tracker you work awful heavy
now that i met your mother you should come and meet my father
as jenny starts to walk towards the grave we see for the first time
that we are in the country a graveyard in an open field with an astonishing panorama of new york and the east river
matte the cemetery is atop a hill and the east river busy with ferries and vessels of trade glistens in the near distance
just beyond it is manhattan island low buildings winding narrow streets houses surrounded by open land
a breeze off the river rustles jennys dress and blows her hair as she steps up to the grave site looks at the headstone and sees
it is blank
no name no date
you should finish the stone
itll be finished when everythings finished
thats when helll rest
the hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace
he holds up his open hand covered in dirt
it was bill killed him not you
with my hand on the knife
and his hand on yours
and me feeling the life go out of my father
he looked at me
he looked at me and he swore me with his eyes
i could feel his spirit
i say i could feel it rising
flowing through the knife like blood into my own heart
you talk like he lives in you
i dont want him to live i want him dead
i kill bill and im free of them both
you think you can be free that easy
you need your way so clear and you use anything to clear it
me everybody were all just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts
youre part of me now like the gang is part of me and my father both
if i can bring us to glory then my father
like the book says
my father can enter his house justified
as amsterdam continues to talk we
the growth of the dead rabbits as we continue to hear amsterdam speak passionately to jenny
we first see the rabbits surrounding and overturning a fire wagon this starts as a live action scene but soon bleeds into sepia then freezes like an old magazine illustration
all of us is set on the same road together
the gang can have everything they ever wanted and get me what i want while theyre doing it
were not interfering with each other were helping each other
its all the same were all one together
we continue with sepia illustrations of dead rabbit morts picking pockets and purses along a crowded broadway climbing onto a wagon distributing newspapers and tossing off the occupants taking over
the route themselves swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded
well all have a share of the profit like well all have a portion of the fame
if we come to be notorious that only means were strong and if were strong that means were ready
a sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner refurbished and manned by rabbits all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called tamlas
they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film
only johnny amsterdam and jenny do not wear them
the sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon tears around paradise square scattering everyone in its path the dead rabbits laughing their tamlas flying behind them
and ill know that time know it right off when it comes
just like i knew you
the live action dissolves to
the last image in the montage an illustration of amsterdam a half decade older turned out in fancy clothes but with all his fierceness intact
this is a magazine illustration and there is a dated headline over his picture fresh scourge of the five points
the date reads june
and just like that therell be no way of stopping till its ended
from this illustration we quickly
amsterdam as he is in the picture but in live action springing to his feet and yelling at a couple of prizefighters doing battle in a ring
finish him now
far up the sparkling hudson a raft floats slowly upstream
its a huge thing perhaps half a city block in size crowded with sportsmen
they form a large ring around two mammoth prizefighters who are brawling with bare knuckles
amsterdam and johnny are among the spectators
our man will take him in another five
what puts you in such a hurry
fighter fetches fighter a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him crashing to the deck
as soon as he hits the floor a card girl appears carrying a sign announcing round
seconds drag the stupefied fighter to his corner while two boys minister to fighter sucking the blood off his knuckles
a gong sounds to announce the appearance in the center of the ring of the fight promoter a florid and fulsome p
i want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants today but to their sponsors the dead rabbits
indicates one side of the ring and the native americans
he flings an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring where bill the butcher sits with daniel killoran and a large group of natives
amsterdam and the butcher eye each other with all the old animosity its almost ceremonial now part of the tradition
their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition
with their indulgence id like to remind you also of the further wonders that await you at my new museum located on broadway
there are boos from the crowd at such untoward commercialism
t barnums gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural from nature and from myth
continued boos and to encourage you also in the view that new albany ordinances forbidding sportive violence on land shouldnt dampen your enthusiasm for wagering
bets down entlegen and you gents
indicated fighters fists up
the fighters come to center ring circle each other then start slugging
a flurry of punches and fighter goes down again
as he hits the deck the round automatically ends and the between rounds ritual takes place again
dobbs will take him this round
thatll be something
the natives has never lost before
because theres never been a dead rabbit fighting before
thatll shame them thorough
therell be worse than shaming
we only got the natives in range
its time to squeeze the trigger john
the next round begins and the fighters set to mauling each other furiously
dont push the natives too far amsterdam
otherwise itll be tammany pushing back
that dont matter any more
it does matter and its going to matter even more
tammanys the heart and future of this city
if the rabbits is going to keep growing were going to have to throw in with tammany some way
the action in the ring is furious
the crowd cheers
fighter seems about to go down but recovers and starts returning punishment to fighter
they got that conscription act from washington keeping them busy but they wont leave us alone forever
and the natives is strong as they ever been
in the ring fighter drives fighter to the deck again and this time indicates fighter you call that strong john
in the ring a couple of agitated native americans are trying to get at the rabbit sponsored winner
rabbits start to rush the ring but amsterdam waves them back
to johnny this is our time now
trying to make official announcement the winner
the winner in the th round is the dead rabbits champion high water dobbs
the unofficial ring combat continues knocking barnum about as the new champ throws marauding natives around like empty flower sacks
amsterdam iumps into the fray pushes some natives away
they start for him but the champ stands them off while amsterdam whispers to barnum
just a moment please gentlemen
theres a word for us all
amsterdam whispers to him briefly something large something grand something epic
the greatest these are my own words of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong ever done in the five points
the crowd quiets their sporting blood still up curiosity engaged
only johnny seems glum concerned
this is to be a duel not for money but for honor
a fight to the death
interrupting emphasizing to the death
if he can stand up to it
on which money i hasten to add may certainly be wagered
the names of the two champions are amsterdam vallon here beside me and
william poole known to all as
leaping up they know me by any name you son of a bitch
the crowd erupts this is a death match between olympians
only johnny does not rejoice
he looks at amsterdams face flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come and he has to turn away
he walks away from the ring as killoran tries unsuccessfully to pull the butcher down and cool him off
yelling ill have him stretched on a spit
killoran is beside him now whispering urgently
bill the butcher shakes his head vehemently
to killoran you got no more to say about this now
come on bill
let go of your tammany wet nurse
my challenge your terms
to bill dont do it you cant do it
theres the conscription to deal with and elections coming too
thats your calling now not these ancient quarrels
ill do my work
but this is a shame a public shame
it demands my attention
yelling to amsterdam fine then
fine and welcome
day after elections well meet with seconds on neutral ground to work out time and terms
it will be done and done
he walks to the ring holds his hand out to amsterdam
you know this hand
last time it was this close it was on your throat
i remember it better from another time
he takes the butchers hand
the duel is on
start close on money being counted out
and a receipt quickly written and given
we think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between amsterdam and bill the butcher but we go wider to reveal an office tables and
chairs and a line
two lines in fact
one very long filled with young man
and the second very short in which a clerk is handing the receipt to a prosperous young your release from service according to the terms of the conscription act
keep it somewhere safe
ill keep it with me
there is only one other person standen behind the prosperous young man and he steps up quickly and hands to the clerk as the prosperous young man heads for the
past the second line which snakes out into the street filled with draftees who shout at the prosperous young man as he leaves
hey tell your papa to pass me three hundred dollars too
tell him if he dont well come get you on our way to gettysburg
the prosperous young man hurries away but spots boss tweed and daniel killoran as he leaves
tweed id take the time to say proper thanks but
no thanks owed son
conscriptions federal law and sos the exemption
you might remind your father though that you saw me here today minding that the laws strictly and equitably enforced
the prosperous young man hurries out as the draftees continue to holler abuse
boss tweed heads for them followed by killoran
you see how much they like this damned law
enforcing its going to hurt us in elections
its not my law and not my liking either
but washingtons always treated us with sufferance and we must extend the same regard to them
to draftees boys we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of crisis
were bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them thats what
boys the union is in distress our land is wounded deeply our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing
we must ask ourselves how
yeah you could talk a dog off a meat wagen tweed
but lets see you fight
thatd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see
as he backs off thank you boys thank you for your understanding
to killoran holy mother
tweed hustles killoran outside where the line of potential draftees snakes down the block and into paradise square
daniel between the blindness of washington and the damned brass of bill poole tammany will fall like an autumn leaf
we must take what measures we can
attend to the butcher
after the elections of course
unless you think amsterdam will do our work for us first
he could at that
then he would become a fresh concern not so daunting as this
turns to the draftees in the street boys ive just had a word with your compatriots inside and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit
they have manifeste for joining this great struggle
there is a chorus of boos and jeeps from the draftees outside
put a rope around it tweed and swing in your own wind
great weeping jesus daniel whatever happened to the halcyon days
election day pandemonium
the dead rabbits arent working the repeaters this day but johnny observes the action as native americans identifiable because of their long dusters strongarm repeaters into the polls
his attention is drawn to a harried telegraph operator who is being shouted at by natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering volumes of the voting
the poor operator cant cope
its chaos here too
the large main room is filled with telegraph operators receiving election returns
there is shouting and concern throughout the room
even boss tweed shows signs of worry
i swear that science will be the death of industry
the telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get the repeaters in and out
losing patience your role is to expedite daniel not to explain
killoran looks at him blankly do something
if youll allow me
they both turn to see johnny standing coolly before them
theres a scheme we might try
you got no place among us get the hell out of here however you come in
a moment please daniel
to johnny youre a dead rabbit arent you
friend to amsterdam
johnny nods and therefore no particular friend to us
what brings you here
science and opportunity
you got opportunities enough among your own
i did have
but times change faster than people
some people anyhow
and i like to stay with the advantage
well then a gentleman of foresight
are you suggesting
or perhaps youre even saying
that your friend and your gang may be
well lagging behind the great march of history
something like that yeah
well fine step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind
start close on telegraph wire humming with the election returns
and below it far below johnny killoran and a couple of tammany boyos looking up at the wire
i aint goin up there
i got my election suit on
this electionll be over unless we get up there
this was your notion you go up there
looking at polling place him
he looks likely and he aint workin
he points over at sheeny mike kurtz who is observing the action at the polls
calls to him sheeny mike you want to make
to boyo how much
to sheeny mike five dollars
just to help us
a bit wary whats the pitch johnny
amsterdam wouldnt like it working with tammany
well now if amsterdam wouldnt like it
interrupting he knows about it
welre working a whole new scheme
but i wont tell him youlre helping if thats the way you want it
and you can keep the full five
just start climbing
beat wheres the ned
boyo hands sheeny mike five bucks which he pockets as boyo gives him a large pair of shears
mike wipes his palms on his pants and starts up the pole
for killoran and the tammany boyos this is like a circus stunt
they watch mikes ascent with pleasure
sheeny mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole
he turns to look at johnny and the tammany group below
a couple of spectators have stopped to watch as well
mike gets to the top of the pole reaches out stretches out toward the telegraph wire with the shears
makes the cut
on the ground johnny looks relieved
the boyos offer a partmocking round of applause
in the spirit of things sheeny mike turns to acknowledge the applause
but long enough so hes distracted
he sees the upturned faces fill suddenly with fear and he turns when he hea
rs a sharp odd a live telegraph wire is coming at him
he doesnt even have time to scream
the wire hits him whipping around him as jolts of nt leap through his body and he falls to the ground
hands pick up the lifeless body of sheeny mike and start to carry it off
past amsterdam and jenny who stand on one side of it watching
and johnny who is on the other
he was working a tammany job tammany will see to him
he wasnt tammany
not like you
he made the right choice
you dont know what youre saying
you killed one of our own
one of your family
slowly i didnt know he was going to die amsterdam
and dont tell me whats my own and what isnt
youre not my family
and i swear i swear on the virgin mothers eyes
i know what im doing amsterdam
its you thats always been blind
they look at each other ill say my farewells
johnny kneels down beside mikes body brushes the hair from his brow
you still smell like drink
he nods to the rabbits to carry the body on and as he rises a half dozen newsboys dash into the square carrying fresh copies of the tribune and crying
new tammany victory
fernando wood elected to third term
tammany ticket prevails by narrow margin
boss tweed vows armageddon for crime
looking at amsterdam and jenny cant you hear the future
he walks away from the gang through the rushing newspaper boys
the place has been cleared out for a war council amsterdam with a couple of dead rabbits and bill the butcher with a few natives
they sit at a round poker table with a green felt top
we say the square is the place
let barnum sell the tickets for a share of the price
interrupting a small share
and the rabbits and natives will split the majority portion equal
who works the crowd
this is a day of honor
no pickpockets no lush rollers nothing
ill cut their hands off
after the fight
we got to fix positions for everyone so there wont be no other fighting
i know for fact the roach guards has sworn blood against the black birds and the forty thieves dont tolerate the chichesters
as these delicate negotiations continue the only two outsiders in the place mother joyce and a bartender are listening intently on the far side of the room
amsterdam will make the butcher a fine banquet
my neds on the boy
hes got the youth and hes got the hunger
is he so hungry youll put up a hundred
officials stand on a high wooden platform facing a jeering crowd
banners announce a draft lottery
officials are preparing to draw the first numbers as boss tweed gives out with a speech
yes and the law of the land
lies in the balance
the conscription act of was handed down by president lincoln himself
shouting if lincoln signed it then let lincoln fight
its an army of the poor fighting for a bunch of rich slackers
tammanys been our voice let tammany pay the exemption for all
a young member of the crowd steps forward as boss tweed turns to look at those backing him on the platform killoran a cavalry officer in fancy dress
and out of sight of the crowd johnny sirocco
their expressions are not reassuring
your first payment mlords
the young crowd member hurls a stone through the front window of a nearby store
the crowd cheers and runs to sack the store and others surge toward the platform
johnnyand killoran grab a fearful tweed and rush him to safety
but the cavalry officer stands his ground with sword and pistol
that stops them
but only for a fractured eerie moment
then they jump on the cavalry officer pull him to the ground begin to kick and beat him
a building burns at the end of the street spreading a silhouette of smoke and flame in the air
as a lion charges down the street growling scattering rioters in its wake
its a mad frightening sight like a fulfillment of the biblical prophecy produced by p
t barnum whose museum is burning in the distance
screams yells curses and groans
cries of pain and fear as rioters jump out of the way of the wild animal then course up the street toward broadway burning in the distance
from above on the roof of jacobs ladder amsterdam and jenny watch the madness below
watching lion that must be the vanguard of barnums army
this city will burn like gomorrah
then well take what we can before it gets too hot
i think its past that already
itll never come to that
these people aint gang led and they have no purpose
theyd rather die for themselves than the army thats the purpose
what would you do
fight better and not get so mad
theyre only doing what they should have done years ago
whyd they ever think there was another way to live
they believed what people told them thats all
what people is that
the reverend at the mission
people like johnny sirocco
you believed johnny
and i believed you
i aint done nothing different than what i told you jen
i believed what you said abaut being with me with me alone
but you lied to me
its not me alone its just you and bill poole
youlre so blood blind you cant see nothing else not even this
i dont care a fine damn about what they want
its what i want
they wont dare harm the points thats all i care about
let them turn the rest of the city into hell
its another country anyway
its not a country for me amsterdam
i dont know about you
will you come with me
now is when im going
will you come
i dont want all this fighting to go to waste jen
i want to come out of it with something
and i got to be waiting for the butcher
jenny digs out her treasure from her mothers grave throws open the box starts to grab all the swag she can and hide it on her person
in her pockets under her clothes anywhere
she takes as much as she can but she has to travel fast
beginning a swift series of scenes that are like a laudanum nightmare
the street is jammed with people fleeing and people fighting
as jenny forces her way through trying to escape
a small mob starts to attack a house where a terrified family stands in the doorway
were with you dont harm us
show us your spirit and come out with us then
and put a candle in the window to show youre one with us
every light is a flame against the draft
the wife begs her husband not to join the mob but they pull him out into the street
the mob woman hands the wife a candle then runs back to join the mob
jenny starts to cross paradise square now
tries to cross anyway
and passes the stand where tweed delivered his speech that very morning
she sees the cavalry officer
several mob women have revived him with water
he has been beaten terribly but as he moans and starts to regain consciousness the mob women fall upon him with fresh fury kicking and hitting his helpless body
they break his bones with rocks and tear off the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks
now a second mob rushes toward the first from the opposite side of paradise square
jenny is buffeted wildly
its like being in a whirlpool
she grabs a little girl whose face is bruised and blaody but whose eyes shine wildly
what is it
cops has everything closed to the north and the militias coming
as jenny presses her way through the mob devoured streets
she sees men women and children attacking a small group of blacks
my daddy dont have to die for you
why should he fight and die for you
jenny looks ahead sees the river in the distance
she runs forward stumbles
some of the swag falls to the street
she scrambles to pick it up as rioters rush by her
matte the surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame
the piers are burning
the docks are ash
sailors battle a mob for possession of a small rowboat
as they fight the boat starts to drift
jenny spots it runs for it but so does another girl
younger than tenny maybe jennyls age when amsterdam fell in love with her
they both get to the boat at the same time
each grips it by a gunwale and they stare at each other like two jungle beasts over a kill
id kill you for this
the girl lunges at her with a knite and jenny shoots
the girl slides into the flame reflecting hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava
jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row
we stay close on her
working the oars clumsily furiously
moving the boat across the water trying to get away from the city
and we go wider now
a huge line of iron like the side of a glacier
bisects the frame then starts to move
jenny turns sees it
the looming hull of an ironclad war ship matte
it lobs cannon fire into the city setting off tremendous explosions
jenny turns back for the shore
as cannonballs land devastating rioters
matte police and militia push the rioters back toward the river like rats
a cannanball explodes in their midst
injuring many more cops and militia than rioters
the rioters rally run over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers
now the advantage is theirs cops and militia are in retreat
jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland
further from the docks
shells still exploding in the distance
jenny moves with the marauding mob recognizes doyers street
she splits away from the mob moves stealthily into the street known as the bloody angle
weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings
smoke and eerie light
the angle is lined with lampposts
and from every lamppost dangles the body of a black man
some are still smouldering
at the base of a lamppost a group of rioters have cut open the hog tied corpse of a black man and are pouring oil into it
one of the rioters sees jenny grins and holds out the torch hes holding
she shakes her head and starts to back out of the alley
the rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse
the body ignites in flame
the rioters pull on a rope and the body rises burning to the top of the lamppost
where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse refractions on walls all up and down the street
on the street as the flames dance and the bodies burn rioters dance and sing
from these mad shadows we
the face of amsterdam stepping out of the shadows of the roof
there are flames in the distance
the whole gang is assembled facing him as he speaks
no we aint going to fight but we can take something for ourselves out of this
i want to know who hung them bodies in the bloody angle
i want to address who done it
five thousand people in the street done it
boss tweed done it
abe lincoln done it
theres nothing you can do about any one of them but stay with us
youll have a little of your own back
these riots are a gift
he pauses just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the outside ladder leading to the roof its jenny returning
theyve made everything clear as you might say
to jenny are you with us then
until i can get out
ill go with you
straight at amsterdam meantime
were going for the armory at canal street
well have to beat the militia to get there
theres a way through the lines
jen did you see the cops and militia
i can show you from here where they are
i doubt theyll get to the armory in force before midday tomorrow
well get there first
well take everything we can carry and destroy the rest so no one else has the use of it the militia the natives nobody
then well turn to real business
well go down to the battery
why we going to take a sail to europe
but we could after this
slowly savoring this were going to take the banks
the government banks
awed silence from all are we not
beat steps forward seems we are
one by one then in small groups the entire gang follows her
they are uncertain reluctant even frightened at the audacity of the scheme
but they stand with amsterdam
the crowded main room of boss tweeds domain jammed with anxious politicos and officials as well as a harried group of telegraph operators who receive news of the riots from
all over manhattan
there is a huge map of the city against one wall the place has been converted from a political princedom to an operational headquarters
johnny sirocco and bill the butcher are there
other guests include the governor mayor fernando wood and a badly shaken horace greeley
they attacked me
i had every sympathy for them at first
too much sympathy horace
writing these riots were a rising against unjust laws and unsuitable law givers
i suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent
it is a criminal rising of the lowest class of the gangsters and rabble who have been allowed by tammany to run lawless
it was tammany and the rabble that elected you governor
and its tammany and the gangs wholl stop it
isnt that so bill
nods at johnny i wont say nothin in front of him
who knows what business hes here on
hes here on our business and my invitation
hes already been of great help
whats the opposition strength john
to answer johnny yanks back a curtain drawn across a high window
the view looking downtown is one of almost continual illumination every place the eye falls candles burn in sympathy for the rioters
each candle is against you gents
against you sir
dont you mean us
diplomatic some of us come from those people mayor
ill not deny they still claim part of me
perhaps your heart
gentlemen im sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of my friend here and by extension my own judgement
so as proof
john where will the mob go
what will the gangs do
johnny is uneasy about answering go on tell them what you told me
theres no telling about the mob
or the small gangs
but the dead rabbits if i was amsterdam
interrupting as indeed you nearly was
if i was
id figure to take the rabbits to the armory
would you agree with that bill
wouldnt you do the same
if you were fighting against the militia instead of beside them
what are you talking
interrupting you will have to fight beside them to take the armory
it cannot fall into unfriendly hands
i cant stand with the militia against the people
i could never work the points no more if i did
were all of us swept up in a great tide of events bill
have you learned to swim
from bills face struggling to make sense of this knowing tweeds right but not wanting to believe it we
johnnys face as tweed talks to him
it is later and the butcher has left
the activity is still frantic all around but tweed speaks in unhurried tones
im sure that bill will do his usual splendid job
but after that
well im afraid hes grown away from us
johnny looks puzzled he shows distressing signs of
shall we say free thinking
crime flourishes in chaos and these riots could encourage bill to overstep himself
he no longer inspires in me the same trust
well that you might
if you can prove yourself further
you already said in front of everyone you trusted me
in vital things
would i be talking to you now otherwise
vital things but small things
are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity
such as what
ridding me of bill the butcher
johnny is startled he may question your loyalty to me but bill would never believe you had the sand to go against him
hed never expect it
do you have the sand
from johnnys face struggling to make the right answer we
ansterdams face as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols for the next days scheme
let him in
johnny enters the common room of jaccbs ladder where the dead rabbits have gathered to ready themselves
as they work over their weapons and prepare battle dress johnny walks through their midst
they do not acknowledge him
except for jenny
did you miss us john
not a bit
rising to meet him are you here to spy
i dont have to spy
amsterdam leads johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can talk privately
as they walk i know what youre doing
i told tweed what youre doing
you dont know what im doing
youre going after the armory
am i now
why do you think that
cause thats what i would do and you and i think alike
and it dont seem worth a visit to tell me something you already think im doing
theres something else alright
tweeds arranged to kill bill the butcher
disbelieving who could tweed get to do that
one of his own
theres no one around him
interrupting listen it dont matter who its going to be done thats all
tweed aint going to wait around for you and bill to settle yourselves
im telling you so you have a chance
chance of what
a chance to do what you want
bury the butcher draw what blood you got to
but you better make speed
the natives will move on the armory too
and whats any of it mean to you
it means whatevers left of friendship i dont know
theres still part of me here
i dont want to see you lose everything in your life at once
im going to lose nothing
beat if you believe me you can stay
i got to go
he turns so amsterdam cant see his face and leaves so tammanys going to kill the butcher
that puts you and tweed on the same side
does that make the path clear enough to suit you
from amsterdams face trying to work out all the new angles we
amsterdams face full of resolve staring unblinking as
the barrels of two dozen rifles surround the edges the screen boxing amsterdam in as if his head were in a frame
and bill the butcher gazes at him with astonishment
we are for the first time in the natives lair a house hung with american flags of all shapes and vintages some of them torn by battle others by years
of weather and use
some of them go back to the early days of the republic
there is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes
no ones going to murder me
then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder bill because thats the only way youll ever see it coming
i dont believe it and i dont believe its you telling me
you got no reason to care about any danger to me
youre my kill butcher
no one else is going to have you not tweed not tammany not those pigs in the street
no one not even you bill will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me
id do anything to keep you for my own even if i have to protect you
you protect me
get out of here and go to hell
fine so long as i pass you on my way
maybe id believe you more if i knew who was talking to you
someone i credit
that means nothing to me
none of this means nothing to me because i am tammany
without me and my natives theyre nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough
you join with me and we fight against tammany fight them back and out of the points
then you and me can settle
but if you dont join with me then there wont be no settlement because youll be murdered in the street and the whole points will be mine
i relish the thought
just the thought
of cutting you up and opening you wide
so if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure imagine how im going to enjoy doing it
why dont i make it easy for you then
he turns his back on the butcher and starts to walk out through the entire gang of natives
same as youre making it easy for tweed
he keeps walking
through the natives
dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him
amsterdam looks around dont be like your father
dont make it too easy
amsterdam struggles to keep his temper
but he turns and keeps walking through the enemy camp as we
but this time he is walking among his gang
all the dead rabbits are assembled weapons ready
jenny is beside him
then jimmy spoils
then a few others
as the group passes others stand and walk with them
until the whole gang is rallied
and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building
as amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb like basement past the graves into a tunnel
torchlight gutters all around
their steps echo like repeated rifle shots
the whole gang marches down a tunnel under the old brewery
except for amsterdam and jenny they all wear their tamlas
many have marks and gang insignia on their faces
all of them have weapons
a lot of weapons
frightened faces people seeking shelter and safety from the riots appear in the darkness then vanish like ghosts
as the rabbits walk they summon memories of the first fight that same march through the tunnels when amsterdam marched beside his father
amsterdams face gives little away
but perhaps he is remembering that day too
the last tunnel
shreds of light from a door in the distance
amsterdam walks up to the door and just as monk eastman did years before kicks it down
dim dawn light floods the tunnel as the dead rabbits step out
the first thing we see is an elephant who trumpets fearfully at the sudden sound of the sattere door
the gang stops wary of this huge refugee from barnums museum but the animal is more frightened of them
it hurries on down the street
revealing behind it a group of several dozen rioters who carry a huge american flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend no draft
they stare at the rabbits with something near reverence
wheres the native americans
aint seen them
and the militia
theres a detachment coming on from two streets over
the rest is still north of here
what are you after
amsterdam points to a formidable building a block away the armory
it looks like a fortress
the devil himself couldnt take that place
thats why he sent us
the detachment of militia proceeds warily towards the armory
they are a young uncertain looking outfit their commander looks like an upstate farm kid
he tenses and his eyes widen as he sees jenny walking toward him carrying a boy in her arms
crying help me
oh please help me
hes shot we need a doctor please help
miss we aint a medical outfit
the main units ten minutes behind us theyll have
he doesnt get the chance to finish
jenny drops the boy from her arms and shoots the detachment commander once cleanly
as the boy roles into a prone position and fires two shots into the stunned detachment
while the dead rabbits swarm from every doorway along the street firing guns and brandishing weapons
its over in seconds
the detachment has hardly gotten off a shot
every one of them lies dead or wounded in the street
as the rabbits crouch over their bodies
a rifle emplacement manned by a dozen guards they stand anxious post in front of the armory
each window is barred and fortified and the front door is massive
but the tension in the guards faces eases a little when they see
the detachment of militia heading towards them down the street
some of the detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets several are being carried
the detachment unrecognized by the guards is made up entirely of dead rabbits
help us we got wounded
we cant leave the post
open the damn doors then
were bad hurt
wheres the others
just behind us
but i got our major here wounded so bad half his guts is out
guard signals for the doors to be opened to the armory as the detachment draws close to the emplacement
god its good to see you
ainsterdam shoots him where he stands as the rabbits overwhelm the emplacement
shouting move fast
we got to get out with everything we can before the militia gets here
as the armory guards return fire the boy jenny carried in the previous scene runs for the telegraph pole and starts to climb
a shot makes the wood fly inches from his face
as the rabbits storm into the armory firing wildly
the boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and cuts the wire
he shinnies back down the pole as the wire swings ineffectually in the air and we
a telegram held in killorans hand
he passes it to tweed
its from the armory guards
thats the last before the wire went dead
reading furious if the rabbits are already at the armory where the hell is bill and the militia
he throws the telegram onto the floor where it joins a whole sea of yellow telegraph forms
they are shin high there must be thousands of them
they got to be near
so long as theyre near its alright
the rabbits can take the armory but they cant hold it
if bill can get into position he can make sure they dont get out
alright then john you pray to any god you choose thats the fact of it
if bill thinks he can best the natives that is your opportunity
that is your moment
johnny hesitates are you a bible man
the book says in revelations i saw a new heaven and a new earth
if the hand of gods not on you to fulfill that prophecy then the hand of tweed will be
go on and god bless
johnny looks like he is about to say something but he stops looks at tweed a moment longer then nods acknowledgment and leaves
i dont believe he can do it tweed
oh i think he can
whether its one man against another or a mob against the city the mathematics remain the same
you never enjoyed the enlightenment of poverty did you governor
if you had youd know you can always hire half the poor to kill the other half
a tremendous volley of gunfire as if to illustrate the tweed theory of class warfare
bodies fall in the street
bodies fall from the armory
the building is under siege by the main unit of the militia and by bill the butcher and the natives
the dead rabbits are trapped
johnny snakes through the native american lines over dead bodies moving towards bill who he sees a hundred yards away
running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the militia commader
as shot widens the carnage is revealed
bodies of natives in their uniform dusters and rabbits in their tamlas lie side by side in the street
firing continues from both sides as the butcher shouts at the militia commander
we move now and we can drive them out
we press them and theyll break
i cant spare the men or stand the risk
we stay fast and smoke lem out
tweed put me in charge of this
i say we move and by the crucified christ we will move
turns to his men native americans come with me
any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down come with us
bill stalks through the lines rallying the men
and johnny starts to well show you gladiators greatness
the men start to join the butcher even some militia fall in
johnny slips through the men gathering near the butcher
hes closer to bill than ever
bill starts to mount their barricade
there is movement and commotion all around him as natives and militia fall into rough formation
it threatens to obscure bill from johnnys view
he has to make his move
he draws a revolver as militia and natives pass in front of him
hes anxious confused
his hand shakes
and hits a native who falls dead
right near bill
the butcher turns in the direction of the shot sees johnny
their eyes lock
johnny fires again
and bill shoots him
johnny falls with the first shot
bills above him now looking down at him
was it tweed or your friend put you to this
bill shoots him again point blank
youd lie to save your friend
in terrible pain no
theres no friends for me
me the same
pity us both
he empties his revolver into johnny
to his men hold your fire
toward the armory in there
hey in there
i want to talk to amsterdam
the militia commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward gun in hand
but a native stops him
amsterdams face appears in a front window of the armory
go on then talk
you and me
beat come ahead then
and bring my friends body
bill the butcher slings johnnys body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour
and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the armory
the militia watches in disbelief the natives in confusion
the dead rabbits keep the butcher in their sights
but no one fires
no one moves
and bill the butcher enters the front doors of the armory
as the butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang shut quickly behind him
its a scene of devastation inside dozens of dead and wounded everywhere
and enough rifles and munitions to sink manhattan island
bill the butcher stands dead center in the middle of the armory floor as amsterdam walks toward him
the butcher drops johnnys body in a heap at his feet
your friend made different friends lately
tammanys put us all in the same place
you want to get out alive
it dont matter to me
i got enemies outside enemies in here
the militia can move on me anytime
you could drop me before i get to the door
i dont want to lose you so easy
youll never get past the militia unless you come with the dead rabbits
youd lay aside whats between us
im not forgetting where i put it
if you do ill remind you
he turns leaves whats your call bill
im considering wheres my better chance
he walks to the doors
the rabbits guarding it dont make a move
he opens it himself and strides out into the street
bill walks alone toward the native militia lines
from every window
the dead rabbits watch him
the sun is high but the street is eerily quiet
there are faraway sounds of battle but here there is only the sound of distant unheard conversation between bill the militia commander and some natives
amsterdam watches intently
the butcher and the militia commander argue but we still cant hear what theyre saying
there is still no sound
until suddenly we see the militia commanders face
eyes wide with surprise as we hear the thunderclap of a shot
bill the butcher has just gutshot the militia commander
as if the shot were a signal the natives turn on the militia
its hellish close quarter combat
guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies
knives swords bludgeons kids with dead rat blackjacks women with hob nailed wooden planks attacking better armed but totally stunned soldiers
bill the butcher falls back toward the armory the natives following him
inside the armory amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang
go ahead them give them cover
give them some damn cover
the rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that even with amsterdams order no one makes a move
its amsterdam who fires the first shots
and that unleashes a great volley from the armory
toward the militia
the butcher and the natives are closer to the armory now
and the armory doors start to open
when a militia lieutenant signals
and militia on the surrounding roofs waiting for this moment suddenly open fire
on the natives below and on the rabbits on the roof of the armory
many drop in the street and fall from the armory roof
as the armory doors swing wide to admit the natives
as they run or stagger inside the rabbits start to close the doors
some rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops
other natives never make it to the doors
and a few are shot
when the doors close before they can get through
the dead rabbits keep firing but they have sustained grave losses
the butcher looks around at the natives who have made it inside with him he has perhaps one quarter of his original strength
well it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang
whose gang might it be
not william tweeds
jimmy spoils and a crew of natives push a cannon toward the rear of the armory
which way you pointing that
any way you say
one direction could let us out the other will let them in
they got to come in if were going to fight them
who do you want to fight bill
amsterdam motions toward the rear wall and jimmy swings the cannon around
everything surrounding them is movement and commotion as the remaining members of both gangs take whatever weapons they can carry from the armory stockpile
and jenny steps forward with a torch lighting the fuse of the cannon
which roars and blows a huge hole in the rear wall of the armory
to bill the butcher see you in the street
the gang members rush for the opening carrying whatever they can manage
outside the militia lieutenant hears the cannon blast
sees no damage to the front of the building
and signals for a frontal assault on the armory
high angle from above camera moving as the militia charges
following them forward then moving ahead to the armory shooting straight down inside no roof or ceiling as the gangs hurtle through the still smoldering hole in the wall
and drop twenty feet to an alley below
where militia on the roof try to pick them off
as the militia presses closer from the front gang defenses start to fall back inside the armory
everyone wants to get through that hole
amsterdam jenny jimmy spoils and some of the other gang nembers are carrying torches
jenny hands a torch to the butcher
amsterdam motions them all toward the back of the armory
but he stays behind
just for a moment
he bends over the crumpled body of johnny sirocco arranges it folding johnnys hands across his chest
youll have a warriors funeral anyway john
he stands and runs for the hole in the wall where jenny and the others stand waiting
he turns takes a last look inside the armory
the militia is battering down the front doors
then he raises his torch over his head
and hurls it through the air
jenny and the others do the same
his single torch blazes a path of light across the screen
the others joining it make a fiery constellation
as jenny jimmy spoils bill the butcher and amsterdam hurtle through the hole into the alley below
and start to run through the withering gunfire of the militia on the roof
just barely away
as jenny runs her swag drops and falls from under her clothes
she turns to pick it up but amsterdam pulls her on
and just away from the titanic explosion of the armory
the concussion throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof
it sends a fountain of flame and rubble high into the sky
it is volcanic in its brilliance and intensity
the sky turns black with powder blazing orange with flame
in the small streets behind the armory many gang members are crushed by debris or burned by fireballs breaking off from the central flame
the armory is gone
much of the surrounding area is gone with it
on the ground everything is smoke flame dirt death confusion corpses everywhere
gang members and kids running all over desperate
it looks like the last day of mankind on earth
bill the butcher helps a couple of fallen natives then sees through the smoke and flame and storm of ash
coming towards him
were finished all of us
but you and me aint settled
we got the same now a full share of nothing
theres nothing to settle
theres nothing left
amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket opens it for the butcher to see it is the pirates knife which the butcher used to kill priest vallon
then lets start over
bill the butcher looks tired sorrowful
he buries his face wearily in his arms
and for a moment we think he has given everything up
