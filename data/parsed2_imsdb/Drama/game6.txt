written by don delillo revised draft may steven schwimmer a drama critic asleep on his bed
he wears a sleep mask
the bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform
papers strewn on the floor
an exercise bike
a desk with and old manual typewriter reference works periodicals styrofoam cups
a cast off sofa with pants shirts sweater underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms
a counter that sets apart the kitchen area
a portable tv set on the counter
the remains of dinner for one
a row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor
boxes are labeled in crayon hate mail
a coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a llama comanche
magnum with a checkered walnut stock overall length nine and a quarter inches
a port o san toilet about seven feet high orange scarred and dented scavenged from a construction site
a snapshot on the bedside table
its a blurry picture of steven holding a cat
steven wears a peaked cap and a shadow falls across his face
next to the picture is a clock radio which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine am
radio announcer begins to speak softly traffic flowing smoothly on the deegan right now but if youre lucky enough to have a ticket for tonights game be sure to leave
early because its going to be bumper to bumper
steven does not stir
tevens loft is in an old squat building on th street near twelfth avenue
the structure looks abandoned
entranceway filled with debris
another day of traffic
traffic everywhere i look
cars stop and move and stop again
people sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts
the shimmering glass facade of the united nations plaza apartments at th street and first avenue
a man visible at a window on one of the high floors a cup of coffee in his hand
day in day out
red light green light
traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins
from his pov we see the traffic below creeping along nearly at a standstill
cars vans taxis trucks limos mopeds bikes and buses
emergency vehicles screaming and wailing
birth and death walk and dont walk
the man takes a sip of coffee
traffic yesterday today and tomorrow
bumper to bumper soul to soul
this is lone eagle over and out
the same man the playwright nicky rogan with his hand in the air hailing a cab
he is forty five vigorous wearing well made sporty clothes
in a corner of the screen stalled in traffic
i used to drive a taxi
where youre going mister
nicky glances at the drivers name plate i used to drive a taxi
i used to be head of neurosurgery
big hospital in ussr
this hospital im not kidding
i opened thousands of brains
what did you find
big mess every time
i loved my taxi
went twelve hours nonstop
stopped only to pee
i peed under the manhattan bridge
peed many times in parks and playgrounds
th street and third avenue
a man is dancing with a life size cloth doll
his tape player is on the sidewalk playing and instrumental version of beautiful dreamer and there is a cigar box for donations
a few people look on from a distance
the man wearing an old cutaway with running shoes and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown
nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly past the dancing man
nicky crosses the courtyard to buchanan apartments
joanna bourne reaching for the door
joanna is fifty ish handsome stylishly dressed
nicky and joanna embracing with wordless abandon
they are in the hallway clutching each other stumbling
the walls on either side are hung with expensive art
they grapple past the living room
fleeting look at the paintings by longo and fischl a poster by the guerilla girls
he edge of the bedroom
nicky is crawling into the room and joanna is hanging on to him being dragged
they are fully dressed except for one of joannas shoes
a lichtenstein a hockney a silk screen of joanna by andy warhol
a jeff koons piece
nicky and joanna roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed
muffled sounds from the bedroom
we track to the maids room
the maid is smoking a cigarette and reading new york magazine
the cover is partly obscured by her hand but we can see a blurry black and white photo of a man hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his
face shielding himself from the camera
over the photo three words visible the phantom who a second line of type is too small to be legible
nicky and joanna are undressing after the fact very slowly and distractedly
joanna stands by a chair near the window
nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes
alan albright called me a handsome woman
second time hes done that
son of a bitch
i hear alans sick
alans very sick
he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
you know about adele
what about her
i talked to her two days ago
apparently it didnt help
you know about peter of course
they found out why he cant remember his lines
theres something living in his brain
a parasite he picked up in borneo doing the movie
can he get through it
theyre watching him closely
theres a special rehearsal set for this afternoon
to bolster his confidence
and thats not all
ive got bigger problems joanna
thats not all nicky
ive been backing your plays for fifteen years
and ive never been more depressed
the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan
hiding his concern look
all i want is a haircut
im not worried about this guy
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
they can send their heartless brilliant boy critic
theres a much bigger thing going on than tonights opening
the red sox you mean the world series
i thought the red sox were winning
three games to two
but if you know their history you realize theres a tragedy in the making
ive been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old
it cant be all that personal
joanna enters the walk in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress
if you have a team youve followed all your life and they raise your hopes and crush them and lift them and crush them do you want me to tell
you what its like
its like feeling your childhood die over and over
j i mean nicky really no
nicky follows her into the closet still in his shirt and boxer shorts
im proud of this play
its so different from anything youve done
this is how weve managed to last
were able to surprise each other
in and out of bed
because were completely mismatched
we dont even like each other do we
nicky walks out of the closet takes off his shirt gets into bed
i used to tell myself
talent is more erotic when its wasted
will i see you tonight
the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since
you expect me to miss that for an opening night
joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets into bed
it makes me so mad
steven schwimmer ready to strike
the exterminating angel
its all worked out
theyll lose tonight
then theyll lose tomorrow
i see it with stunning clarity
its your best play nicky
theyll lose because theyre my team
he will absolutely hate it
steven is just waking up
the radio plays soft music
he reaches over and hits the off button then activates the cassette player
he struggles out of bed and sufi music begins to fill the room
he stands at the foot of the bed a man in his mid twenties hollow chested slightly potbellied wearing rumpled pajama bottoms and a mostly mozart t shirt
he does not remove the sleep mask
the music has a sensuous driving beat
voices begin to chant
steven holds his arms parallel to the floor
slowly he begins to turn clockwise
the beat picks up and he whirls more quickly his mouth coming open
now he begins to whirl about the room
the chanting grows in intensity
although he is blindfolded steve deftly avoids running into furniture and other objects
steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops playing
he is back at the foot of the bed arms stretched wide
nicky leaning toward the driver
i wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil
i ate and drove
i had one of those big checkered cabs
you are going where
very bad today
drivers nameplate i cleaned out the ashtrays religiously
i am sitting here five years in traffic
it is one continuous traffic since i arrive
why must it be
a taxi pulls up alongside
nicky notices the young woman in the rear seat
it is his daughter laurel
he opens his window
laurel stay there
to his driver keep the meter running
and try to stay abreast
nicky leaves his taxi and gets into laurels
nicky pushes in next to her
laurel is eighteen slightly overweight with a pleasant and expressive face
she is carrying books in a nylon haversack
i never see you anymore
where are you all day
i go to college
i thought you knew
do you want to get some coffee
i dont drink coffee daddy
and this is not what we should be talking about
what do you want to talk about
ill talk about anything
nicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag
im seeing your play tonight remember
why do you need a radio
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game
do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer
thats completely crazy
dont talk like that
what are you implying
shes doing like those iranians
i divorce thee
i divorce thee
i divorce thee indicating driver and he hears it the same time i hear it
what happened to family secrets
drivers nameplate mother is totally you know upset
abulhassas well be getting out here
nicky pays the driver
nicky stands alongside the first taxi and pays his original driver
laurel reluctantly exits the second taxi
th street between first and second avenue
nicky and laurel enter the coffee shop they are greeted by the owner a hefty greek named george
nicky you dont come in for a while
youre so healthy and thick bodied i want to punch you in the chest
this is my daughter laurel
just to hear the sound it makes
i saw your picture in the paper
that means theyre getting ready to kill me
thats not what i hear
i have four five actors working here
his best play since yessiree bob im telling you they say it
he doesnt want to hear it
he leads them toward a booth
nicky is launched into a full breakfast
laurel has a tea bag in a cup no water
if lawyers for the mob are called controversial why are divorce lawyers called prominent
because they get outstanding settlements
and mother is determined that this time theres no turning back
i just had breakfast with her
she didnt say a word about this
a young waiter recognizes nicky and unobtrusively points him out to another waiter
because you refuse to believe shes serious
youve always refused
dont be so steely eyed
its that course youre taking in criminology
beat she wants you to stop seeing whats her name
now and forever
do you think thats too much to ask
for a wife of nineteen years
youre too young to be studying criminal behavior
its making you obsessive
she is kicking you out
your mother and i have something between us thats too strong to damage permanently
believe me i know this
thats right nineteen years
and what about the days and minutes
sharing small moments sharing memories raising a beautiful child
were wedded in the deepest and strongest ways
lillian isnt only my wife
shes my best friend
nicky and laurel stand on a short line at the cash register each holding a check
mother wont tell me how long youve been seeing this person
shes embarrassed to tell me
so why dont you tell me
dont call her mother all the time
it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving
what happened to mom
i didnt turn her into mother
this person and i are a thing of the total past
i promise you
nicky takes laurels check away from her intending to pay himself
laurel snatches it back
know what mother said to me
daddys demons are so intense he doesnt even know hes lying
the bank of india banco di napoli bear stearns the bank of new york the chemical bank manufacturers hanover
a sense of real institutions looming over the busy street
the bank names engraved on bronze markers carved in granite incised on glass
a glimpse of the bronze statue called taxi on park avenue a man with and attache case and raincoat hailing a cab
the real people hailing cabs well dressed men and women striding along with briefcases purposeful successful
nicky rides again
its life its taxis
people trying to make contacts make deals meet their lovers
taxis are sexy
you cant have manhattan without taxis
i was proud of my taxi
i kept my taxi clean
nicky shifts his gaze
he sees elliot litvak slinking across the street looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile
he watches elliot enter the lobby of the chemical bank
elliot is at a cash machine making an elaborate transaction
nicky appears approaching the adjacent machine
elliot sees him
i was thinking about you
i went to the preview last night
i dont want to hear about it
nicky attends to his own transaction
whispering a lovely piece of theater
small but important
shut up elliot
nicky takes his cash and begins to move away
we dont appreciate what theyve built for us
were artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of western culture
youre an artist
im a craftsman
press a button and they give us money
ride with me
we need a haircut
stalled between park and madison
the driver has opened the door and is standing just outside the cab trying to determine the cause of delay
whispering how is lillian
i havent seen her
she wants a divorce
dont talk like that
its over finished and done with
that sounds so final
but are we really surprised
im completely stunned
i dont want this to happen
but didnt we know it would happen
dont needle me elliot
tell me how bad you feel
were suppose to feel bad together
this is what friends do
whispering joanna bourne
so rich and crisp
this woman lets you touch her body
you put your hands on her personal parts
nicky hits elliot a token blow to the arm
elliot thinks about it then hits back
they swat each other half kiddingly each of them leaning away from the other to prevent being hit in the face
a whitish brown mist is building the west
there is a sense of scurrying people
the driver re enters
we must abandon
what do you mean we must abandon
ruptured steam pipe
ruptured steam pipe
do not inhale
we must abandon
do not inhale
we must abandon
ruptured steam pipe
we must abandon
do not inhale
drivers name plate nicky pays him
the driver flees eastward
nicky and elliot run across madison avenue
a snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a man hole cover west of fifth avenue reducing visibility to near zero
cars and people are white shadows
the two men with collars raised and hands over heads hurry into a restaurant on th street between madison and fifth
a small narrow room
handsome wall paintings a tuscan hill town
very slow day
nicky and elliot sitting with a carafe of wine a bottle of mineral water and some bread sticks
glancing at menus intermittently
im trying to think
when did you start looking so terrible
you look awful
i can tell you the year the day the night the minute
you used to love life
you dont exude this any more
what do i exude
you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
tonight you find out what it means to suffer
they dont have any carrot soup
you mean because whats his name
you will suffer because he is in the theater
and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
its just a review
it is just a review
do not inhale
whats the fuss
i dont get it
thats what i said eighteen months ago
what happened eighteen months ago
before his broadway days
he reviewed the one act i did at the fulton fish market
we did this play at four am outdoors in the rain
for the fish handlers
and he was there
i memorized every word of this review
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish
a year and a half later
youre still brooding
a patron approaches the table and stares at nicky with a fixed grin of crazed recognition
nickys jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine as the man backs off
you dont know about obscure writers nicky
how we have our anger to nurture and love
our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame money power and sex
the waitress comes by
she is paisley porter attractive in her mid twenties
guys ready to order
i didnt know you were waiting tables
to nicky this is a great young out of work actress
have you been ill
we have a very nice pasta today
say it again
to nicky isnt she great
what did i tell you
the food has arrived
nicky is eating compulsively in contrast to elliot who sips his mineral water dabs his mouth with a napkin looks around the restaurant between bites
when nicky is finished with his food he begins picking among the items on elliots plate
elliot uses his fork to deflect nickys fork and the two men have a brief duel with utensils fencing silently but intently using knives and spoons to vary action
the asbestos mist still clings
men in protective suits and masks move slowly like moon walkers
halted traffic abandoned cars
mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows
a gauzy stillness dreamlike
a slow whirling degree shot
the kitchen area is empty
the door of the portable toilet is open and no one is inside
the makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or five hangers with shirts and jackets
there is no one at the desk or exercise bike
a sound faint but persistent like an intake of air
the toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken away leaving a hole in the floor
brownish water drips from the tap into the wash basin which is indelibly stained
the drip makes a two part sound and it matches the rhythm of the intake of air
the bathtub has been sprayed by a graffiti artist
multi colored swirls and arabesques
teven is sitting on a mat in the tub arms in the air and folded so that his fists are close to his ears
he is in lotus position breathing in serious meditation a deep intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion matching the beat of the dripping faucet
he is still wearing the sleep mask
the kitchen staff is eating at a group of tables pushed together
nickys table has been absorbed by this cluster and he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an espresso with his cigar
elliot paisley and actor waiter stand at the small bar in conversation
next to nicky two kitchen workers talk about the ball game
i got a good feeling about tonight we got ojeda going
he pitched beautiful last time out
plus darryls due for a big game
i hate the mets
when the mets lose they just lose
its a flat feeling
but the red sox here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game
defeats that keep you awake that pound in your head like the hammer of fate
paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen
nicky pauses to watch her then resumes speaking
you can analyze a red sox defeat day and night for a month and still uncover layers of complex feelings feelings you didnt know you were capable of
the pain has a memory all of its own
the parking lot is empty
the stands are empty
a few members of the crew move the batting cage into place for batting practice
the empty visitors locker room
uniforms hang on the doors of the lockers in preparation for tonights game
we see the names henderson stanley buckner
elliot at the urinal
nicky at the hand dryer
an actor waiter standing between them at the sink
quoting steven schwimmer one thing saves elliot litvaks work from complete mediocrity and this is his lack of ambition
it gets funnier
zipping up it gets funnier
they chart the laughs
this from a critic who lives like a fallen monk
whose address is a carefully guarded secret
a critic who has to disguise himself
what do you mean
to go to the theater
wears i dont know what
make up padding
because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business
he has to disguise himself nicky
for his own safety and peace of mind
the waiter squeezes past and leaves
do you want me to tell you what it was like reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing mecca
what was it like
i said im dead
he killed me
elliot standing near the front window in a shaft of sunlight examining a white after dinner candy
he puts it in his pocket for later
aisley eating lunch at the end of the long table looking up to see nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine
he sits opposite her placing the wineglass in front of her
youve worked with elliot
i was in the fish market play
what happened to him
there was a review
i think i remember
so does elliot
not one of stevens finer moments
you know him
and he has finer moments now and then
he has something
a funny little quality i find endearing
elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike
a little drastic maybe
say it again
you know what
one more time
elliot watches nicky embrace giorgio
nicky carries the tabloid hed been reading the daily news
elliot and nicky stand at the door and watch the whitish mist that continues to linger
is it safe
do we care
i think we nought to wait
i say we go
you say we go
do not inhale
im not ready
here we go
they pull up their collars and run outside
the street is deserted
nicky holds the newspaper over his face for protection
each man has an arm in the air trying to hail a taxi
they are standing near a trash receptacle that carries an advertisement for new york magazine
it is a reproduction of the cover that wed glimpsed earlier in joannas apartment when her maid was reading the magazine
a furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper and a headline about a phantom
nicky and elliot do not see the receptacle
a bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad covering its right side
it is the same ad five of them actually five new york magazine covers side by side
elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesnt notice the ad
as the bus bears down nicky steps out of the way removing the newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five photos on the side of
the bus a man concealing his face with a newspaper
nicky reads the text under the logo of new york magazine
learning to hate steven schwimmer nicky stares after the bus
another bus comes along carrying the same ad
nicky watches darkly
this is the diamond district
store signs reading antique jewelry we buy diamonds gold emporium wholesale jewelry all brand name watches reduced
nicky is reading the newspaper
the driver is speaking chinese into his two way radio
squawky replies from the dispatcher in machine gun chinese
the man has taken over my mind
hes not only out there
hes in my head and i cant get rid of him
i cant write a word without imagining his response
im paralyzed as an artist
i dont have the problems that artists have
youve been saying that for years
mockingly im just a professional
a dues playing member of a guild
because youre afraid nicky
thats the darkest part of you
you dont think youre good enough
nicky lowers the newspaper
drivers nameplate about a dozen people gathered together including several diamond merchants in their beards black suits and fur hats
they are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his cloth doll
someone places a donation in the cigar box
from the tape player dancing in the dark
elliot ends up near the gotham book mart on the north side of the street
nicky looks right past him into the bookstore window
he sees something that interests him
where are you going
dont wait efor me
what about the haircut
nicky walks along the main aisle looking at a woman standing in the poetry nook
only a few people in the shop
he enters the back room and gets a glimpse of a woman walking through the opposite doorway back into the main room
he squeezes past a browser and looks through the doorway
someone is just leaving the shop
he walks to the rear of the store where the office is located
the door is open the room is empty
he re enters the main room and sees a woman seated on the top step of the stairway that leads to the basement stacks
her back is to nicky and she is reading a book
he approaches slowly and then squats by the doorway to get a closer look at her
it is paisley porter
nicky and paisley in a corner of the back room
you keep slipping away
how do you do that
i was one of those silent listening children
glued to the shadows
i was all noise
played the radio loud
battled constantly with my brother and sister
here i am world
i hear good things about the new play
so do i
over and over
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously
would you like to meet him
he doesnt want to meet some out of work ingenue
im trying to prolong our afternoon
in case you havent noticed
the fact is i have to get going
is it true
is what true
he wears a disguise
steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy
but youre his friend
youre not building an obsession about steven are you
i understand opening night jitters but youve got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play
th street between broadway and eighth avenue
nicky has been cornered just inside the entrance by the stage manager a small fierce woman named renee simon
i cant take this anymore
he forgets simple lines
he forgets where to stand
we tell him and tell him and tell him
i know hes a sweet man
i love peter
its not his fault
but ive never worked in a show where the leading man has parasites in his brain
nicky sits down in the orchestra looking darkly into space brooding
he surveys the set a working class kitchen behind it a backdrop of dark streets and looming tennaments
a portly well dressed man appears moving along the row toward nicky
this is sidney fabrikant the producer
aybe we ought to postpone the opening
joanna loves this play
she has sunk tons of money
she is completely ncommitted
appreciate that sidney
but our leading man cant remember his lines
and his understudy cant carry the play
nicky looks out at the rehearsal in progress on stage
the director jack haskins and the actor peter redmond confer move about gesturing and blocking
i had lunch with joanna
she said she told you about peter
you werent concerned she said
hat was this morning
so what happened since
youre worried about this kid who writes these reviews
nicky looks across the theatre
paisley porter sits alone tenth row center watching rehearsal with rapt attention
m not worried about this kid
well i am
everybody quotes steven schwimmer
hes here to announce the death of civilization
he kills a play every time he farts
we have every right
all the elements are in place
delay the opening and we lose the theater
ive had three straight washouts sidney
deliciously youre dangling from the last letter of your last name
the actor sitting on the sofa
nicky on one knee leaning towards him in intimate conversation
sidney remains optimistic
i was educated by nuns
i have excellent long term memory
i kissed shirley felder on the teeth
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories
eating my lines
you have to see the words
try to build a mental picture of the script
imagine your lines high lighted with a felt tip pen
what was your favorite color crayon growing up
mine was cobalt blue
this is your history isnt it
all around us
and my parasite is consuming it
i kissed her while she was laughing
i can see her face so clearly
my heart was flying out of my chest with love
jack haskins and renee simon i hear he got the parasite in burma
i heard borneo
why do we blame the third world for our parasites
maybe he got it in denver or minneapolis
maybe he got it in borneo
nicky and peter still conferring
jack and renee approach
i feel shaky about one line in particular
if i can get past this line
i think i can handle the last long speech
which line peter
the son says to the father this could be it
and the father replies
thats the line i cant ever for the life of me remember
i just cant get it
its the same line
the father simply repeats what the son says to him
this could be it
this could be it
i know it sounds easy
but something happens between the time i hear the line and the time im suppose to jrepeat it
this could be it
long pause this could be it
lets work on it
long pause lets work on it
nicky and paisley porter make their way out of the theatre
do you think he can do it
i dont know
hes a very sweet man
where are you going now
someone waiting for you
no ones waiting
theres a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid
is that our steven
if im sleeping with him and i havent said i am then so what
quietly so everything
thats so what
so i begin to hate him
so i want to do him grave harm
but you dont even know me
how can you care what i do with whom
i know you both
how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy
do you want to talk about doing crazy things
they enter lobby daylight squint a little
come on paisley
our steven not only disguises himself
he goes to the theater armed
muted background voices on the lobby pa jack haskins and peter redmond
this could pbe it
this could be it
they look up at the speaker
he feels he has to defend himself if necessary
im actually beginning to enjoy this
wide of the theater
nicky says goodbye to paisley
reverse angle elliot watches them from across the street
icky goes back inside the theatre
paisley walks west on th street
elliot waits for a moment then follows her
the port o san
steven emerges and goes to the stacked cardboard boxes against the wall
his hate mail
he is wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat clothes
he drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair
he sits in the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the early setting sun
he takes a letter from the box opens it reads it lets it fall to the floor
takes another letter opens it there is a knock at the door
steven tenses does not move
he moves warily toward the door
steven its me
will you open please
steven releases the dead bolt lock and opens the door
youve come to me
i wanted to believe you would one day
i havent come to you
but youre here
so you must have come to me
steven is back in the chair by the window
paisley nervously prowls the loft
in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety youve been causing with your reviews
steven its so unfair
of course its unfair
the truth is always unfair
why do you think i live this way
stealing electricity from a lamp post
because people who write the truth are outcasts of society
i cant live openly in a nice clean doorman building with my name on the mailbox
theyd come after me in packs
not if you stopped hurting people
write the truth gently
the truth is never gentle
listen to me carefully
each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams
truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin
it hurts and maims
reaching down to clutch a fistful of letters look how they hate me for telling the truth
its an education paisley
the college of raw nerves
steven contd letters dripping blood
cries of revenge
ive seen your victims
one past and one future
i thought i might convince you to reconsider
and i thought at last shes here she wants me
i dont want you steven
paisley moves towards the door
teach me to be compassionate
im going home to my machine
elliot looks up and sees paisley emerging from stevens building
he crosses the street toward her
hen paisley sees him she seems to freeze
th street between broadway and eight avenue
nicky walking slowly backwards arm raised trying to hail a cab
it is getting dark
he glances left sees a large two panel poster in front of the theater
one half is a black and white photo a younger nicky rogan in a tuxedo holding an award in his raised hand
the other half is all type the new nicky ogan he sees someone enter the theater lobby
it is his daughter laurel
he follows catching up to her at the end of a short line of people at the ticket window
tickets are all set
i double checked
but i just need one
mothers not going
i know why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition
laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk
you also have a rogan lillian
she wont need it
take it yourself
take a date
i dont have a date
i dont want a date
they leave the window with laurels ticket
and you blame me
its because we never talk
i have a class
can we talk later
will you be at the party
im not sure
she is out the door hurrying across the street
nicky stands under the marquee calling out to her
ill find you
after the show
moving very slowly
a man is hit the other day by another taxi
i mean he is flying
crash against the windscreen
right here in my face
blood is everywhere
i never left the garage without my windex
i was barrister in kenya
i said to him get off from here
i cannot drive with your body on my windscreen
i drove twelve hours straight through
ate at the wheel
you have to eat at the wheel
you cannot get anywhere
thats the drama
were waiting for life to continue
where do you pee ibrahmin
under the manhattan bridge
thats where i peed
th street between eighth and ninth avenue
a hotel a high school brownstones with fire escapes
michael nickys father is making an omelette on the old stove
he is pushing eighty slow moving with a two day stubble
knock at the door
michael goes to the intercom inches from the door
into speaker who is it
im at the door
into speaker go way
ill call a cop
pop will you let me in
into speaker where the hell are you
at the door
michael goes to the door and looks through the peephole
what do you want
nicky comes on sundays
where are your glasses
go get them
if its you what are you doing here
im on my way to get a haircut
where does nicky get his hair cut
nicky stands against the door speaking softly into the peephole
across ninth avenue
where youve been getting your hair cut for fifty years
where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut
where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker
it was rummy not poker
but ill take a chance and let you in
michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel topped table in the kitchen
nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator drinking a beer
this is the kitchen that is the centerpiece of the theatre set
the new play is nickys young life
its a constant shock to me how small this place is
how did we do it
five people in these little rooms
get yourself something to eat
nicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator
we must have been heroic
fives not so many
there were families with seven kids
a dimwit uncle
lillian says it once a week
why doesnt he come live with us
you know the answer to that
i do know the answer to that
why dont we watch the ball game later
well go to mannions
theyre only gonna lose
of course theyre gonna lose
well watch them lose
what good is heartbreak if we dont experience it firsthand
the red sox are your problem
i never understood about you and the red sox
everybody rooted for the yankees
nicky is scrambling the eggs
last two games of the season
against the yankees
the sox lost on saturday
then they lost on sunday
first i cried for twenty four hours
then i had fist fights the rest of the week
its one thing for kids
you get older you nhave other things
its all connected pop
its one life
baseball is memory
how do fathers and sons show their love
they go to a ball game together
thirty five years later they sit in the kitchen and remember
but the son is suppose to stop crying
i could have grown up happy
a yankee fan
a divorce lawyer
nicky sees his fathers glasses on a shelf above the stove
he puts them on the table
youll need these
for the play
dont make me sit through one of your plays
i know you dont like the commotion of opening night
but i especially want you to see this play
its new territory for me
and for you too
i have to know what you think
since when did that matter
lets not start that again
my back is killing me
wheres your elastic brace
i cant find it
youre suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble
i lost it
i lose everything
ill go get you another one
you have to wear it
nicky takes a roll off the counter makes a sandwich for his scrambled eggs takes a bite and heads for the door
be right back
take a good look at me
michael puts on his glasses
so i know who im letting in
nicky leaves the apartment
the man in the cutaway dances with his doll
the tape machine plays in the still of the night
the street is completely empty except for the dancer
nicky a small paper bag in his hand reenters his fathers building
the room bears some resemblance to the living room set at the barrymore
michael sits at the end of the sofa weary
nicky is taking an athletic bandage about four feet long and three inches wide out of the package
he sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to michaels end of the sofa so that nicky is looking at his father in profile
why doesnt he come live with us
because everything is here
i know pop
im lucky they dont knock down the building
it could happen anytime
and everything worth remembering is right here
i think the buildings okay
at least for the time being
you didnt think it was okay when you lived here
you wanted to get out so fast i thought you were running a marathon
normal boys ambition
i like coming back
you know that
you tell your friends your father used to work the docks
but you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasnt easy for your mother and me to understand
nicky is gradually unbuttoning his fathers shirt so that he can wrap the bandage around the old mans chest and back
i was in a hurry to do big things make big mistakes
any mistakes were okay as long as it was big
but im trying to see these things clearly and honestly
thats the play theyre going to kill starting tonight
theres a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart
and thats us
who we were and where we come from
so what are you going to do about it
what do you want me to do
show him who we are
nicky takes off the shirt
michael struggles out of his t shirt and we see that he is wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost
he is sitting with his head tilted up eyes closed and is unaware that he is wearing the bandage
nicky takes the new bandage winds it tightly and puts it back in the box
his father has gone to sleep
it is dark and cold
nicky emerges and walks west diagonally across the street to a barbershop on the other side of ninth avenue
lliot is on the stoop waiting for him
nicky sits in the barber chair
elliot pulls up a customers chair and sits with his back to the mirror more or less facing nicky
the barber an elderly hawk eyed man named dodgie begins his preparations for nickys haircut
he carries a gun
then you should carry a gun
he places the sheet over nickys upper body and fastens it at the neck
i used to carry a gun when i drove a cab
where is it
i gave it away
i thought im a writer now
that was a big mistake
you should never be without a gun
in this city
if he carries a gun you have to carry a gun
were making too much of this
no were not
im not a lonely spooky writer like you
nursing a hundred grudges
im a man who loves life
were talking about something deeper than grudges
how do we respond to personal attack
in this city
and you dont carry a gun
how do we maintain our dignity and self respect
in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse
the man is out there ruining lives
its your best play nicky
hell hate it
hell kill it
hell write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief
what happens to your apartment on the east river
your house in connecticut where you watch things grow
dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits
he opens the cabinet door slides out a drawer and removes some hand towels
there is something there he wants nicky to see
an old pockmarked revolver
nicky sees the gun
we were thinking of putting in a pool
quoting the most interesting thing about elliot litvak is that he writes the way he looks fuzzy grubby and shifty eyed
beat im telling you as a friend
there are things that speak to us from the past
in this city you dont walk five feet out the door and there is somebody trying to take whats yours
your truth is locked in your past
know it for what it is
beat shoot him nicky
the american theater doesnt need people like that
shoot him nicky
not that we really mean it
but where does he live
keep going west
last building before the river
how do you eknow
what do you mean
about an hour and a half ago
i saw her come out of a place
she said she was visiting a friend
but she wouldnt tell me who
had to be him
she was very evasive
nicky gets out of the chair
dodgie removes the sheet for him and elliot smooths down his clothes and hair like a pair of grooms attending a warrior
nicky goes to the cabinet gets the gun
he returns to the chair
im enjoying this more every minute
elliot takes an after dinner candy out of his pocket the candy he pocketed in the italian restaurant after lunch
he blows the lint off and eats it
how do you want the sideburns
elegant and refined
crowds of people pouring down the ramps from the train station hurrying late
the umpires room six men nibbling cookies smoking a last minute cigarette adjusting equipment
an unidentified room somewhere in there lower reaches of the stadium
twenty cases of great western champagne stacked and ready for the postgame celebration
he does it symmetrically
a stroke under the left sideburn a stroke under the right sideburn
left side of jaw right side of jaw
steven standing in his shorts applying putty to his jaw to make it square
then a false mustache and a wavy blond hairpiece
then a thick bronze makeup paste
steven in front of a full length mirror near the bed putting on a bulletproof vest which gives him a solid appearance bulking his caved in chest and concealing his
steven putting on black trousers a brash shirt with a bright bow tie which he tips slightly askew
a pair of black and white shoes with elevator heels
then his shoulder holster
steven leaning over the coffee table inserting bullets into the chamber of the revolver
with the gun in his holster he stands in front of the mirror
takes the gun out aims it puts it back in the holster
does a dazzling karate move
steven putting on a metallic rayon sport coat
a long silk scarf
we see a handsome dashing young man
he puts on a pair of dark glasses and heads for the door
pening night crowd

his jacket swings open and toyota sees the revolver tucked into his waistband
eople seating themselves in the orchestra

steven schwimmer in an aisle seat in the orchestra
he sees paisley sitting in the theatre some distance away
house lights go down
two figures hurrying down the aisle
an usher leading a young woman
the woman is laurel rogan nickys daughter wearing her headset antennas
laurel squeezes past some people and takes her seat and steven sitting three rows back watches her with interest
the curtain comes open
cheering from the bar crowd
nicky is a little disheveled
he has finished his dinner and is eating from toyotas plate finishing and watching the game
youre a family man frankie
wife and daughter
my fathers still alive
nicky contd he outlives me starting tonight
because the mets just tied the score
it was only a matter of time wasnt it
an how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy and then in one dumb moment what does he do
i dont know toyota
what does he do
and the people he hurts the most are the people who love him
despite who he is and what he does for a living
were always saying we want to take control of our lives
you dont want to take control
you want to lose control
jesus knows it
nicky is standing again but hes not looking at the tv screen this time
his gaze is directed at someone who has just entered the tavern
a woman stands at the entrance middle aged and somewhat anxious looking for someone
she is lillian rogan nickys wife
its a complicated subject
its a simple subject
nicky gestures that he will be right back
your father said you might be here
two all after six
ive been looking for you because i want to let you know whats been going on before you read about it in a gossip column
we stranded five runners in the first two innings
this will come back to haunt us

dinner has arrived with a bottle of wine
a cigarette burns in the ashtray in front of lillian
opening night lillian

i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding
you understand me
thats always been my problem
and youve been extremely patient
you know why dont you
because i am patient chain smoking lillian
you smoked because i smoked
we were falling in love remember

i had an affair are you sure you want to hear this
this is insupportable
how could you
im a man
shes you know a woman
shes my gynecologist
lillian begins to weep lightly
i am really deeply sorry
it violates so many trusts
it was an animal thing
no real intimacy
i never thought of dr
wetzel as having a sex life outside the office
we did it in the office
she thought her apartment was too impersonal
im glad were having this talk
i feel great
i feel impeccably alive
i love you
moans from the bar crowd

across the street the man in the cutaway is dancing with his doll
the tape machine plays in the wee small hours of the morning
nicky rejoins toyota and matthew
he carries the wine bottle and his glass
red sox are winning
theyre always winning
until they lose
your problem is you take the easy way out
losing is easy
winning is easy
losing is complicated
its a lifetimes work
it may be work but its not honest work
faith is the real work
clemens has a blister
theyre pinch hitting for him
mike greenwell comes up to hit for clemens
two pitches two strikes
hes a twenty four game winner
he pitches seven solid innings
we scratch out a one run lead
of course he gets a blister
of course they put up greenwell even though baylors sitting on the bench
of course greenwell strikes out
greenwell strikes out
you made him strike out
you wished it on him
you want to lose
its too hard for you to believe in something
its hard to have faith
its hard nwork to trust somebody
reciting it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day
youre afraid to risk believing
believe in them
believe in your self
take a risk
it will humanize you as a person
i want to believe
if you believed you wouldnt be walking around with a handgun in your belt
what does that tell me
you want to make the night come down
iew from the wings
jack haskins and renee simon looking on
peter redmond as the father sits at the end of the sofa
the fifteen year old actor who plays the son approaches him sitting on a footstool and leaning close
i always thought a nights sleep is what you get for a hard days work
but these last weeks i lie there helpless
hour after hour
ive come close to praying for the first time since i was your age
pray to god to put sme out
i talked to the doctor again pop
he said shes not getting any better
he wants to talk to you
i think he means right away
how bad is she
this could be it
peter stares at the son a look of desolation slowly entering his face
in the wings renee looks at jack
she is equally desolate
laurel in the audience leans forward waiting for the next line
teven schwimmer watches giving nothing away
eter staring at the son
the son looking increasingly bewildered
sound of coughing in the audience
renee takes a newspaper off a chair offers a section to jack keeps the rest for herself
sound of coughing intensifies
boisterous noise from the bar crowd
two women exchanging high fives
scoreboard after nine innings
nicky is finishing his wine
matthew is next to him standing
say it and youll believe it
life is good
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments
then say it
life is good

life is good
life is good
raucous mocking cries from the bar crowd
what are people
i dont know
people are dependable
i dont know if i can say that
people are dependable
people are dependable
lets see what henderson does
dave henderson stands at the plate to lead off the red sox tenth
a real waiter arrives obese slow moving with hair curling out of his ears and he brings ice cream for matthew coffee for toyota and a stinger for nicky
finally i get a waiter who doesnt know macbeth
but i know you dont i
i seen you on a poster in the theater district
ill think of your name in just a nicky lifts his hand to stop the man
you know hen duuu
then a moan and deep silence
nicky disengages from the altercation and looks at the tv screen
dave henderson has hit a home run and the red sox now lead
toyota and matthew are jubilant and nicky is quick to join them
it is the only lively table in the place
people are dependable
life is good
baseball is life
the red sox push across another run when barrett singles driving home boggs
enjoy your ice cream kid
when youre an old man itll come back to you
the same deep sweet soft toothy taste
and youll remember where you were and what you saw
scoreboard shows red sox mets going into the last of the tenth
he theater is nearly emptied out
a few people still heading toward the exits
laurel rogan remains seated wearing her headset listening to the ball game
she is concentrating deeply fists clenched
only one other person is still seated three rows back
it is steven and he is looking intently at laurel
the house lights dim
toyota matthew and nicky are huddled closely watching the screen
matthew is seated now and nicky leans over him from behind framing the boys head in his hands so that matthews attention will be directed unswervingly to the action on
the bar crowd is somber
nicky drops his mob accent
this is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years
very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see matthew
the red sox win a world series
this is deeply intensely personal
all the mistakes ive made all the envy fear and violence thats encased in this little envelope we call a person all washed away in the next few minutes
and your grandmother knows why
because god loves a winner
he used to love losers
but the laws of physics changed
backman flies out to jim rice
backman flies to rice
its like a beautiful song lyric
hernandez flied out to henderson
all the times i died when the red sox lost an important game they should have won
all the awful things i said to my mother and father
to tmy wife and daughter
because life is good
because faith is rewarded
attendants putting plastic in front of the lockers to prevent champagne damage
camera crew setting up
men wheeling the twenty cases of champagne into the clubhouse
a man peeling foil from the tops of the bottles
all the failures all the fatalism
one more out
carter singles to left
the bar crowd remains silent
one more out
one more out
mitchell singles to center
slight stirring among the bar patrons
a few people about to exit return to the bar
its all right frankie
just a little touch of suspense
life is good
baseball is life
one more little out
a pop up
all year long thousands of outs
we want one more little out
knight singles to right center
carter scores and mitchell goes to third
the score is
the whole tavern is rocking
its a test
its a test all right
theyre bringing in stanley
bob stanley trots in from the bullpen
its the steamer
fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night
what did it say
a thousand things
youre hurting my head
nicky releases his grip on matthews head
the bar crowd begins to chant
mookie mookie mookie mookie
mookie wilson stands in against bob stanley
were still winning
thats what counts
first pitch to wilson he swings and misses
silence from the bar crowd cheers from nickys table
second pitch to wilson he fouls it off
no balls two strikes
sound begins to fade
wilson fouls off a pitch
wilson takes a ball outside
wilson fouls off another pitch
absolute unnatural silence
stanley prepares to throw
the silence suddenly breaks and for the first time we hear the tv announcers clearly
the sox are one pitch away
one pitch away
stanleys getting ready
this could be it
this could be it
nicky recognizing the line from his play
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
nicky is charged with excitement hearing the line as a favorable sign a positive connection between the play and the game
stanley winds up and throws
its a wild pitch
mitchell comes in from third with the tying run
the bar crowd erupts in cheers
shock and dread
its all right
its a tie game
we can still win it next inning
nicky drinks his stinger
mookie mookie mookie mookie
this is the time
trust in people
believe in life
faith is hard work
dont give in
dont give up
life is true
life is real
trust your team
stanley delivers to wilson
sound fades away
action is in super slow motion
wilson swings and hits a bouncing ball toward first base
stanley moves off the mound to cover first
wilson drops his bat and races down the line
bill buckner the first baseman ranges to his left to field the ball
nicky watches as if in a trance
complete silence around him
he is separate from everybody else the only clearly defined figure in a group of shadowy and indistinct people
an image of bill buckner in silvery light expanding out of the tv screen to fill the larger environment
moving soundlessly in slow motion buckner fields the bouncing ball and heads toward the bag
he beats wilson to the base by an eyelash and the inning ends with the teams tied at
frozen moment buckner holding his glove hand aloft the ball securely gripped
in the drama of the moment buckner seems to be crying out a word or name but his face is twisted with tension and exertion and we cant make out
what he is saying
laurel rogan seen from behind is somewhat slumped in her seat
she turns off the radio removes the headset and rises
she moves along the row toward the aisle
she appears to be the only person in the theater
she moves trudgingly up the aisle toward the exit
at the head of the aisle she is startled by a figure standing in dimness
it is steven schwimmer
they look at each other
sound of the cleaning crew in the lobby and then a door opening at the rear of the orchestra
light from a flashlight plays across the seats and walls
the beam hits laurel first and then steven
the beam holds on steven
what laurel sees is a strikingly handsome young man dramatically lighted
he takes off his dark glasses so she can see his eyes
nicky at the washbasin disheveled but happy washing his face
one man at the urinal
second man behind him waiting his turn
nicky drying his face with a paper towel
i still dont believe it
have to hurry back
hurry back to what
zipping up i think youre a little confused
nothing personal friend
what are you talking about
what are we talking about
what are you implying
the second man approaches the urinal
game six is history pal
youre not making sense
were not making sense
did you see mookie hit the ball
of course i saw it
did you see the winning run score
youre not making sense
nicky throws his paper towel at the men
no one moves
they are trying to interpret this action
youre implying i missed something
what did i fmiss
you missed the boat popeye the sailorman
nicky charges the men
he and the first man wrestle each other into the stall
hold him till i zip up tommy
nicky and the first man are grappling in the stall
second man hurriedly washes his hands at the basin
baseball is life
life is good
al three men in the stall wrestling
nicky has one foot in the bowl as someones elbow strikes the handles and the toilet flushes
the crowd is slowly breaking up
a few people still clustered near the tv sets which are showing replays
nicky is standing alone near a small set at the back on the room
his clothing torn and stained
one shoe and pants leg dripping wet
a bruise on his forehead
he is watching a replay
wilson hits the ball
it bounces twice then goes under buckners glove
knight scores from the third with the winning run
a victory for the mets
the main light in the tavern goes out
the tv sets keep replaying buckners error
regular speed slow motion color black and white
nicky stands in the darkness brooding
the condemned building where steven schwimmer lives
the street is deserted
steven and laurel on the sofa
he is unbuttoning her blouse
two sources of light
a candle on the coffee table
the small tv set on the counter showing a newscast with sound turned off
why wont you tell me your name
its only our first date
steven undoes the last button
im willing to tell you my name
names are incredibly intimate
we barely know each other
trust me on this
she decides she will trust him
they kiss softly
you have to tell me what you thought of the play
first you tell me
she begins to remove his jacket
packs an emotional wallop
a flat out hit
together they get his jacket off
are you majoring in theater criticism
laurel sees the shoulder holster and gun
they kiss passionately
if youre wondering about the firearm
this building is not secure
they are all over the sofa working on the removal of stevens shirt
nicky makes his way past the debris
the front door is gone the inner door smashed and battered door knobs gone and locking mechanism ripped out
he starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body
on the sofa laurel is straddling steven whose shirt is almost completely off exposing his bulletproof vest
laurel is blouseless and barefoot with her unzipped skirt still on and her bra dangling from one shoulder
i have this thing where i have to know a person is being honest with me before you know i can feel completely free to be myself
were strangers in the night
the last thing we want is honesty
what do we want
deception isnt something i personally consider sexy
knowing who a person is
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
you wont even tell me your name
whats shocking about a name
steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he and laurel face each other at equal height and at close quarters
even if the truth requires a certain adjustment
steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his naturally shallow chin
he uses laurels hair clip to scrape his jaw clean
then he peels off his fake mustache
and borrows laurels dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent off his face
nicky stands with his back to stevens door
his gun is out
he holds it up near his face muzzle pointed up
he looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend
i used to go to the movies all the time
nicky contd i saw a hundred situations like this
a man and a gun and a locked door
lee marvin or steve mcqueen
and i used to say to lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that i saw because she had seen them and id say
watch him kick in the door with one kick and it might be steve mcqueen or jeff chandler holding the gun up like this and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once and i would say to lillian how completely phony
whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life
i still love lillian
but its not easy to kick in a door
i knew they would lose and they lost so what are we so upset about
they lost tonight theyll lose tomorrow
its written on the wind
laurel is on her feet backing away slightly
steven removed his shoes and stands in his stocking feet noticeably shorter than hed been earlier
he begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest causing laurel to retreat further
these wives named lillian
i used to say to her you dont kick a door once or twice and expect it to open
its only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease
because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way
hes a great player
how could that ball go through his legs
nicky turns steps back and kicks the door
it opens at once
steven and laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open
nicky moves toward the candle lit couple
laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa
she zips her skirt
nicky is trying to understand what he sees then he gets it
nicky holds his gun hand aloft repeating the image of bill buckner with the baseball in his glove nickys hallucination
then nicky issues a cry a sound from the time before humans acquired language
it is the audible anguish of his life from the fetus onward
we hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we realize he is crying out a name
we recognize the look on his face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements wed seen earlier on buckners face when he shouted something as he made
n the third out of the tenth inning
ste vennnn schwim merrrr
laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of stevens identity
she rearranges her bra
nicky stumbles drops his gun
it goes off
steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft his hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster
nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him
steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp
the room is dark now
lit only by the blue glow of the tv
the tv sports roundup which has been showing football highlights has switched to baseball highlights of the red sox mets
nicky reaches laurel
crying out this is my daughterrrrr
steven is wide eyed at the news
i dont think he knew daddy
nicky sees the photo of steven and his cat
he shoots twice blows it away
daddy im sorry
but he was so beautiful
i trusted him
when i saw what he really looks like a voice from shadows am i really so deeply repugnant
go home laurel
tell your mother i will be late
nicky walks toward stevens voice toward the shadows
youre going to die
youre a dead man
he notices laurel following behind him
im sorry you keep running into dishonest men
but youre only eighteen
we can still turn it around
except i wont have a father anymore
ill see you all the time
ill get a place right nearby
he shouts into the darkness
laurel puts her hand on his shoulder
what will we talk about
nicky sees one of the new york magazine ads steven schwimmers face mounted on the cardboard
he fires three times wiping out schwimmers eyes
will i believe you when you tell me something
theres nothing left for me to lie about
nicky starts into the darkness only to see steven emerge from the shadows his gun lowered
oddly he seems distracted by something on another part of the room
he is looking at the tv set on the counter
nicky watches him approach the kitchen area
he follows gun raised
steven sits on a stool to watch tv
nicky approaches warily his gun aimed at stevens head which is blue lit by the tv screen
i see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids
laurel follows at a distance to see what theyre so interested in
nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against stevens temple
i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor
whispering daddy wait
steven is watching slow motion footage of bill buckner missing the slow roller
then they lost
why does it matter
if they lost tonight theyll lose tomorrow
its all over
why do you care
theyre my team
theyre not your team
theyre my team
nicky cocks the hammer
theyre my team too
i grew up on boyleston street
right by fenway park
i went to fifty or sixty games a year
all by myself
i was one of those kids with scabby elbows
i called out to the players
look over here
hi im steven
my parents are divorced
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox
i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game
my wife is from boston
the red sox were my world
i surrendered my existence to a team that couldnt win the big one
if youre such a devoted fan why were you at the play tonight instead of the game
this is important
you could have gone to the theater last night
there was no game last night
because i cant bear to watch
when they lose i die inside
its like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies
i wait for the scores
i still die hearing the scores but its over in a second
i cant survive the game pitch by pitch inning by inning
ive done it too many times
and i cant do it anymore
nicky lowers the gun
i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first
thats when i knew the red sox were my team
pity and terror
when i traveled through asia this summer i went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so i could call up sports phone in new
york and get the scores
i drove through the war in afghanistan calling sports phone like every hour on the hour for updates
what about my play
and no more evasive tactics
its your best play nicky
ive seen it twice
i went back tonight to be sure
its a brave and honest piece of work
an artistry and sensitivity youve never shown before
and youre not saying that because of the gun in my hand
youre out of bullets
nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and pulls the trigger
and peter redmond helped immensely
these pauses were exquisitely timed
he made us wait and wait
he built a gorgeous tension and suspense
we worked very hard on the pauses
nicky places it on the counter
i called sports phone from lhasa tibet
freezing in my little rented fiat
sheep on a hillside
rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years from the time the himalayas thrust up when the plates of india and asia collided
red sox white sox
a moment in the history of the world
nicky takes stevens head and moves it tenderly against his chest
when nicky releases the head he has stevens toupee in his hand
he looks at it briefly then hands it to laurel
a yellow taxi comes speeding past moving eastward on th street
we see it from various perspectives and elevations
it is a large checkered cab the only thing moving in the night
steam comes billowing from funnel vents
the taxi catches every light just before it turns red
nicky is driving his face showing intense satisfaction
laurel sits next to him
drivers name plate the driver sits in the middle of the rear seat looking somewhat nervous
the taxi crosses park avenue speeding past the bronze statue of a man hailing a cab
it approaches first avenue where a road divider bisects the thoroughfare
nicky swings into a sharp turns barely averting contact with the divider and stops abruptly
three doors open
on the empty street nicky hands the driver a wad of bills
then he and laurel step over the divider
he puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue to the glass tower where they live
the sun begins to climb out of the east river
