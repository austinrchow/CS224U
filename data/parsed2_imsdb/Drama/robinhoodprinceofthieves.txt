story by pen densham screenplay by john watson pen densham trilogy entertainment group in association with july warner boulevard warner bros
burbank california all rights reserved the glowing orb ripples like a blood red eye
a face of the ages
dark wrinkled skin
wizened almond eyes
he howls at the sun
his voice echoes across the sky
the moslem call to prayer
hundreds of feet below his tower a mud walled city of minarets and mosques
a human ants nest
scurrying to their devotions
moans of men in pain
the nadir of human degradation
bedraggled white men pows from the crusades caged together with arab cutthroats
jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell
robin of locksley and peter dubois
their appearance reeks of long imprisonment but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces
peter is so frail he can barely walk
torture instruments glow red hot
a massive interrogator scrutinizes the two white men
indicates a rat faced lowlife who points at peter jabbering in arabic
he says you stole his bread
it is a lie
i caught him stealing ours
the lowlife jabbers some more
the interrogator debates
cut off the infidels hand
the jailers haul peter to the chopping block
i took the bread
thats not true
theyre not interested in truth
you are too weak peter
you would not live through it
the interrogator stares into robins eyes
sacrifice for the weaker
as you wish
cut off this ones hand as well
he indicates an arab prisoner who is dragged forward
his struggling hand is laid on the executioners block
show them the courage of allah
the prisoners face braces for the pain
a red hot scimitar flashes down
the hand flips into a basket
robin is next
his composure fails
he flops to his knees crying
the interrogator laughs
the jailers unlash the thongs on robins hand
they stretch it out forcing it down
robin goes limp sobbing
peter catches his eye
drawn from the coals
robin is suddenly galvanized
and this is english courage
he hurls his holders aside
swings upward driving his fast into the executioners throat
grabs the sword
his thongs melt like butter
a jailer leaps at him
steaming the scimitar slices into the mans chest
despite his bindings peter wrestles the interrogator
knife pressed to his throat peter is forced against the furnace
at the last second he flips the man into the fire
thats for five years of hell
a jailer aims a scalding blade at robins back
warned robin ducks away
slams the jailers head into the wall
peter frees himself but they are still outnumbered
while fighting robin acknowledges the man who shouted the warning
an imposing shaven headed saracen
heavily muscled arms and chest covered in tattoos
even his bald head is ornamented
you speak english
the kings own
set me free
for pitys sake
mine is a sentence of death
robin sidesteps propelling a guard into a pit
dont trust him
two more guards attack yelling fury
robin eyes the curved scimitar
what i would give for an english sword
this is a pruning hook
a guard swings at him with a giant axe
shears the axe handle in two
he runs the man through
peter loses his sword
his opponent moves in for the kill
peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand
raised voices and running feet
free me and i will show you a way out
why should we trust you
if you dont you are dead men
he makes a point
the door bursts open
more guards rush in
a good point
he slashes the man free
whatever blood is in his veins he does not deserve to die here
he beckons them to the back
a hidden door leads into a tunnel
they wade through foul water up to their waists
the saracen leads
a snake lashes out for his face
robin lops off its head
you are fast my friend
five years ive waited for the smell of free air
that makes a man fast
guards drop down from above carrying torches
blocking the way
you will need to be yet faster
a narrow opening to their left
they splash through
half running half crawling in the dank water
fire arrows land around them
the orange smoke is choking
hold your breath
flames illuminate the walls alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime
a pursuer descends on him thrusting a blazing torch at his face
the saracen intercepts the blow
grabs the mans neck snapping it with one mighty twist
i misjudged you
save your breath
gasping for air they find the tunnel veers steeply down ward
a slippery granite tube
losing purchase they slide headlong
sharp rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead
robin grabs at the walls to break the fall
theyre picking up speed
he turns his sword crossways bracing it against the sides of the tunnel as a brake
the sword cuts into robins chest
but it works
allah be praised
a bloodcurdling scream
a pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute
the three men press themselves against the wall
the man hurtles by
is impaled on the spikes
a draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel
using the spiked guard as a ladder robin climbs
removes a grating
robins head appears
ducks back down as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him
theyre outside the prison wall
robin helps peter up
god willing we may now be safe
an arrow pierces through peters chest fired from the prison wall
robin leads him under the wall for protection
shouts of alarm
we must hurry
raising his sword peter faces the oncoming soldiers
it is mortal
hold on to my shoulder
peter shakes him off
my little sister
tell them i love them
tell them i died a free englishman
robin looks despairingly to the saracen
his wound is by the heart
we cannot save him
robin knows its true
peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes
thrusts it into robins hand
take this to my sister
swear you will protect her for me
swear it robin
reluctantly i swear it
summoning hidden resources of strength peter charges at the oncoming soldiers brandishing his sword
he fells the first arab
the saracen pulls robin away
do not fail your friend
make his sacrifice an act of honor
they vanish into the night
fighting like a man pos sessed peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers
robin and the saracen catch their breath
god speed you on your way
our way is together
with the speed of allah
this strange man has a sense of humor
i go to england
then i go to england
you saved my life
i must stay with you until i save yours
go your own way
i relieve you of your obligation
only allah can do that
and if i dont want you
you have no choice
unless you think you can kill me
he grins broadly
offers his hand
my name is aslan
resigned robin takes the proferred hand
robin of locksley
you know a short route to england aslan
white light on water
the moon reflected in the moat of a small castle
towers shrouded in night mist
smoke curls from a chimney
fire crackles in an open hearth
hams and a half sheep hang smoking
an old dog snores at the fireside
a bone clunks on the floor waking him
enough of that din remus
i cant think
licking the bone gratefully the dog looks in the direc tion of the voice
lord seated at a table wine goblet in hand he pores over a wonderful illustrated bible
reading to himself for solace and strength
empty chairs surround the vast table
a deep sense of loneliness
he glances at a portrait over the fireplace
the dog jumps
locksley unsheathes a dagger
obscures it in the folds of the bible
the door bursts open
a peasant ragged desperate kenneth
hes bleeding from a face wound
another man grabs him from behind
locksleys craggy faced retainer duncan
older than his master but still strong he holds kenneth back
you must wait
i am sorry you were disturbed master
high anxiety my lord please
it is alright duncan
to kenneth you are kenneth of cowfall
the peasant falls to his knees
theyve taken my gwen
who has taken her
men on horses
touches his wound we tried to stop them
my son is dead
steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger
lord locksley mounts in armor
duncan attempts to detain him
you cannot go alone master
let me ride for help
that may be too late
kenneth lead the way
he kicks his horse into motion
there is an evil moon tonight
good will overcome duncan
trust in that
duncan looks up
dark clouds race across the moon
kenneth checks the ground
they came this way my lord
what is this place
nearby the gregor caves
locksley reacts a hint of fear
they move on
ahead the hillside glows rimmed in eerie light
strange primitive chants wafted on the wind
locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree
parting undergrowth kenneth creeps forward
hes face to face with the maggot eaten skull of a goat
beyond it a gruesome host of half skinned human skulls all arranged on stakes
some male others with rotting female tresses staring eyelessly into the night
kenneth turns to run
a hand grabs him
they are to dissuade the faint of heart
think of gwen
from the crest of the rise they peer down into the craggy valley
a cave opening ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell
before the cave a circle of stones
a miniature stonehenge
a medieval orgy
men and women in masks and loose robes
lord locksley and kenneth watch in horror
i trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago
an unearthly screech
a creature leaps into the circle of stones
grotesque gargoyle head horns fur covered arms and legs
a living hieronymous bosch demon
its clawed hands slash across a revelers back drawing blood in vicious streaks
the creature tastes the blood
the reveler is ecstatic
petrified is it the devil
if it is i have some christian steel that will test his hide
he draws his sword
a crucifix sculpted into the hilt
a girl is dragged from the cave
kenneth buries his head
the demon shrieks dervishing around gwen who is carried onto the central plinth stone
a pagan altar the shape of an elephants head with its trunk raised
a masked figure stands at the head of the altar
the high priest of the dark rite
the girls body shudders as blood red liquid is forced down her throat
the demons voice is husky and hideous
come my virgin flower
hypnotized by the creatures voice and snake like move ments gwen stretches herself out
a single beam of sunlight slices through the mist like a laser
the first light of the rising sun it strikes directly on the altar tracking down towards the girls heart
the demons raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck
gwens eyes are open wide in a trance
the crowd of revelers encircle the plinth
a warriors yell
sword raised locksley thunders in on his charger
the terrified crowd parts
the demon screams like a banshee
the followers throw themselves at locksley
he beats them off
the high priest issues orders to armed guards who run to intercept
one aims a spear
locksley hacks the shaft in half
cuts men down left and right
reaches the altar stone
up girl up
gwen shakes off her trance
the demon launches itself at locksley
talons rip flesh from his face
with all his strength locksley hurls the creature down
in the name of god
his broadsword swings in a mighty arc
slices across the gargoyles skull
clean through half the face
impossibly the demon rolls back to its feet
the head is an elaborate mask beneath are the yellow skin white hair and burning red eyes of an albino crone
screaming vitriol the hag is unharmed
momentarily stunned locksley regains his senses hauls the girl onto his charger
the guards close in
locksley spurs his horse
rides for an opening
the masked high priest stands resolutely in his path
brandishing a burning branch
the horse is freaked
locksley and the girl are thrown
unarmed locksley charges the man
slams him into the cave wall
the mask falls
locksley gasps in recognition
the sheriff of nottingham
powerful build black beard cruel intensity in every feature
you are an unwelcome surprise locksley
the king shall hear of this nottingham
i think not
locksley is surrounded
one by one the men reveal their faces
locksley backs up in shock recognizing them
god help us
one day all england will worship with us
the crone spits venom in his face
i am mortianna
you will die with my name on your lips
locksleys agonized cry fills the valley
on the hill side kenneth averts his eyes
turns to run
five masked figures block his way
a twelfth century french sailboat at anchor
a cross on its sail
a longboat rows to shore
robin stands in the prow in a pilgrims hooded robe
he gazes at the approaching land
unable to wait he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach
he kneels pressing his hands and face into the soil
thank you lord
aslan steps from the boat sniffing the air
the french sailors keep their distance from him
robin takes his hand
my friend you have escorted me home
i beg you to free yourself of your vow
return with the boat
i know how heavy your heart must be this far from your family and native land
because i love them so dearly i cannot dishonor them
a sailor creeps up behind aslan club in hand
i thought youd say that
he nods to the sailor who swings the club down
the saracen sidesteps grabs the mans arm and flips him into the surf
he turns a cold stare on robin
no man controls my destiny
especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic
the saracen remains intense
if our positions were reversed i would have done the same
only i would have succeeded
he smiles broadly
robin claps him on the shoulder
by nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father
an armored foot splinters the door of a farmers hovel
children scream and run
a soldier clubs at them laughing
some on horses others on foot with leashed hounds
guy gisborne an impressive figure on horseback
strikingly handsome except that one of his ears is missing
we recognize his face from the druid ceremony
he coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms fanny
you owe the sheriff three bushels of flax
you starve us
first the drought now you take what food we have left
for starving people you look fat enough
emerging from the hut hes not here sir
none but the woman and children
to fanny where is your mate
the man they call little
he died last winter
is that so
we hear he is very much alive
hiding out in the forest
he probably ran away to escape your scolding tongue
the soldiers join in his laughter
incensed fanny pounds her fist on his legs
gisborne kicks her down
a boy of springs from nowhere thrusting a hay fork at gisbornes throat
twill only make it worse
wulf backs off
nostrils flaring with repressed hate
while two soldiers grab the boy others examine his hiding place
a secret thatched door built into the side of a haystack
a bow and quiver
and a deer carcass
this is lord nottinghams deer
is this how you repay the sheriff for his protection
like a wolf protects sheep
i killed it
we needed the meat
either he dies or you die
my mother lies to protect me
gisborne drags the boy to the carcass
you have deprived us of a hunt boy
he cups his hand in the deers blood
smears it on wulfs face
the hounds know the scent well
he tosses his bloody glove to the dogs
they tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove
like a deer
give us some pleasure before you die
to the accompaniment of the hounds savage howls and the horrified screams of his family wulf runs
nearing home robin is buoyant
the saracen brooding walks two paces behind him
why must you walk in back of me
in your land am i not the infidel
the unbeliever the instrument of evil
our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point
then i trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal
for an infidel you have uncommon clarity of thinking
yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family
those are my burdens
you speak my language
you have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman
i ask again why were you to be executed
the saracen maintains a moody silence
so i must continue with my guesswork
you are highborn
you fell from favor
you broke the law
you were a rival for power
the saracen reacts almost imperceptibly
by the lord thats it
aslan is silent but robin knows hes right
they say there are arab women of such beauty that they can possess a mans mind that he would be willing to die for them
is that not so
ignoring him the saracen stops
examines the darkening sky
it is close to sunset
your people must marry women chosen for them by others right
aslan unfolds a prayer rug
who is she
the mullahs daughter
another mans wife
is there no sun in your cursed country
you painted old dog
what is her name
which way is east
robin folds his arms
is she beautiful
which way is east
aslan throws his rug on the ground
are you sure
i would know blindfolded
im five miles from home
was she worth it
worth dying for
robin stands smiling over him as aslan begins his prayers
baying of hunting dogs
in the distance the boy wulf runs toward them ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch
the other hounds close in
panting with exhaustion wulf swings into the branches
a hound savages his leg
the soldiers surround the tree
the boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch
robin surrep titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers horses
youre not playing by the rules boy
deer dont climb trees
perhaps he thinks hes a game bird
shall we teach him to fly
cut it down
the soldiers hack at the trunk
the tree quivers
i am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it
shrouded in his pilgrims hooded cloak he approaches them
stand back stranger
this is no affair of yours
have we treed the devil himself
let me see
a small boy
a truly dangerous animal
i advise you to move on pilgrim
this is the sheriffs land
this is my land and my tree
therefore whatever is in it also belongs to me
i grow dangerously tired of your wit
chop it down
the man who strikes that tree dies
he glances nervously at aslan whos still at his prayers
the men stop in mid swing
more surprised than scared
gisborne gestures to the largest of them
chop down the hooded fool
backing up perhaps we could discuss this
the soldier raises his sword
robin lifts his cape
shoots from the hip
the bolt thuds through the mans armor
hes dead before he lands
its time to redeem that vow
set the dogs on him
aslan ignores him lost in his prayers
robin lifts the other arm a second concealed crossbow
the bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack
dead or not he soon will be
robin unsheathes his sword
aslan get off your damn knees
i have four of them cornered
the saracen remains head down
or did we see him steal a glance
gisborne signals his men to attack
a wave of flashing steel
i hope theres enough of me to satisfy you all
backed up to a tree he grabs a branch and kicks out
two men fly back
he lunges at a third
his sword strikes flesh
robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump
robin reacts too slowly
blood flows from his arm
his sword falls
gisborne is on him sword pressed to his back
well hooded stranger allow me to know your name before i run you through
a moment of silence
like lightning robin spins kicks out gisbornes legs
slams one foot on the mans sword arm the other on his throat
throws back his pilgrims hood
robin of locksley
on your knees gisborne
robin raises his sword
robin drives the point into gisbornes rear
the man leaps
now get off my land
and tell your cousin the sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people
gisborne takes off colliding with aslan as he folds his rug
reacts in shock at the sight of the strange arab
to aslan furious you worthless savage
you travel ten thousand miles to save my life then leave me to be butchered
i will fulfill my vow when i choose
which does not include prayer times meal times or any time im outnumbered six to one
you whine like a mule
you are still alive
aslan examines robins wound
a flesh wound
why did you let their leader go
after six years of the stench of death i have no stomach for needless blood on my hands
wulf climbs cautiously from the tree
have no fear boy
the boy nervously eyes robin and the saracen fingering a crucifix around his neck
runs off into the woods
laughing the conquering hero returns
it was you he was scared of
aslans humor is infectious
robins anger relents
come my strange friend
beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all christendom
warm hearths hot food real beds
with feather pillows
with feather pillows
warm and soft like jasminas embrace
the moon hovers ominously over the once proud castle
burned to the ground
gutted and deserted
robin stares struck dumb with horror
the dark courtyard
heartsick robin stumbles over debris
his voice echoes around the fallen battlements
aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points
suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse
round the corpses neck
the locksley crest
a paroxysm of rage and grief
he smashes furniture
slams his fists relentlessly into the wall
pained aslan looks on
i should have been here
spent he leans against the wall
in the silence they hear an eerie tapping
robin draws his sword
a hunched old man emerges walking with the aid of a staff duncan
shaking him damn you duncan
why didnt you cut him down
master robin is it you
i thought god had abandoned us
you left my father to hang like a common thief carrion for the crows
look at him
duncan steps into the moonlight
his face crudely scarred
what has happened
they say they captured him worshipping with the druids
he signed a confession before the bishop of hereford
did they have witnesses
kenneth of cowfall
the bishop decreed all the locksley lands forfeit
did you believe the charges
not even when they took my eyes
who did this to you duncan
guy of gisborne
with the sheriff looking on
robin holds the old retainer to his chest
stares into the night in silent rage
a forbidding fortress
cliff like battlements
face like thunder guy of gisborne strides up curving stone steps
a long corridor leads to a guarded oak door
his lordship is not to be disturbed
he shoves the sentry aside
torches illuminate nottinghams face
chilling cruelty in manson like eyes
seated his manicured hand dis tractedly strokes a semi naked girl
she sits at his feet like a frightened dog
when gisborne enters she covers up
who bade you cover up
he smashes his fist into his chair
she timidly uncovers
cousin i trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value
his attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard
unearthly sounds emanate from the black ness
i met a hooded man today
he bade me warn you not to harm his people
robin of locksley
the prodigal son returns
he is a whelp
this girl could best him
this whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye
your men were probably drunk
yet you survived cousin
the sheriff pats gisbornes hand like a childs
the voice from the darkness becomes a loud chant
a wrinkled monkey like figure dances into view wearing a necklace of human fingers
you might think she was a hundred years old if not for her incredible agility
stunned you brought her here
the crones fingers dart into a bag
emerge with a writhing squealing mass
a knife flashes
blood spurts into an ornate sacred platter
the girl flinches in horror
mortianna shakes the con tents of a pouch across the bloody dish
carved bone dice runes
she rattles the platter
the rune symbols dance in trails of blood
eyes vacant mouth frothing she hisses out her incoherent visions
nottingham follows her every move
what do you see
change the seat of power
move the capitol to nottingham
ally with royal blood
put someone on the throne and rule through him
that is not revealed
the idea takes shape in nottinghams mind
ally with royal blood
what else do you see
men and weaponry in great numgers
much blood will be spilled
a dice splashes blood
lands a deaths head symbol
mortianna hammers the platter
the dice spins and lands again
again the grinning skull
the tray smashes to the ground
the hag runs at gisborne
who have you seen
she shakes him
screams spittle in his face
freaked no one
i have seen no one
a painted man
what is wrong
i have seen my death
spins as if fearing invisible intruders
the painted man
he haunts my dreams
locksley has a companion
a dark skinned foreigner
he had the marked skin of islam
mortianna trembles like an epileptic
eyes wide with terror
she throws herself at nottingham for protection
he caresses her
gisborne is thunderstruck
prove to locksley that your survival was his last mistake
frantic and the painted man
kill them both
he continues to stroke her
her trembling subsides
you have done well mortianna
no one shall harm you i swear it
mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl who shrinks away
nottingham gently takes the girls hand
draws it to his mouth as if to kiss it
and bites down viciously drawing blood
the girl screams
now my child mortiannas kisses will seem soft like an angels
to mortianna take her
you have earned her
mortianna grabs the terrified girls wrist
drags her away
it is madness bringing the hag here
fear not for my sanity guy
for in madness there is great power
red shards of sunlight slice through mist shrouded trees
robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave
heads bowed duncan and aslan stand at his side
our last words in this world were spoken in anger
he called the crusades a foolish quest said it was vanity to force other men to our religion
he was right
looks to aslan then back to the grave please forgive me father
he loved you till the end young master
he never gave up hope of your return
i failed him
i should have been here at his side
you must leave head north to safety
gisborne will surely seek revenge
i know what youre thinking
but one man can achieve nothing against so many
you would need an army
he leads the old man away
robin stands drenched at the grave side
aslan watches from the shelter of trees
duncan heats a stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire
he still stands vigil
like a rock
duncan offers half the bread to the saracen
a curse on the saracens
were it not for their ungodly ways he would never have left
this would never have happened
it surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long
i do not recognize the style of your voice friend
are you irish
what manner of name is aslan then
a fine saracen name
he chokes in shock
but eat in peace
i take no offense
glances at robin by the prophet
what is the man doing
robin raises his dagger over his wrist
aslan runs to him
robin slashes the dagger across his palm
rain and blood mingle
streaming onto the grave
i swear by my own blood
i will not rest until i have restored my fathers name
a whisper or until i am dead
ooze sucks at feet
the three men stomp through mud and rain
we make a fine army do we not duncan
a blind man an arab and a fool
a fine wet army
i have never witnessed a storm of such duration
when does summer come to this land
this is summer
then allah truly is great
no food no shelter and weather that would curse the end of the earth
we will all quickly be dead and i shall be rid of my vow
they approach a stone wall surrounding a thatched mansion
you despair too soon aslan
we shall find food and shelter here among friends
what is this place
it is nearly seven years since we left here together
robin pounds on the door
a hatch opens
an old womans face
the hatch slams shut
robin pounds again
the hatch slides back
tell the mistress of the house that robin of locksley is at her door
her ladyship is not at home
she slams the hatch again
robin jams in his hand
he shouts through the hatch over his bruised fingers
is the child marian at home
maybe she is
maybe she isnt
remove that hand
she waits imperiously behind the locked door
robin reluctantly withdraws his hand
instantly the hatch slams
the hospitality here is as warm as the weather
they wait shivering
the door opens a crack
leave your weapons
the three start forward
her bony finger points at robin
portraits of ancestors
creaking footsteps on the balcony
who are you
robin cannot make out who it is
i am robin of locksley
robin is dead
i may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance
but for now i am real enough
step into the light
by heaven am i to dance next
who are you
i am the maid marian
then show yourself child
for we knew each other well
with the king away these are lawless times
there are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of his
you know i am not one of them
besides i am sworn to protect you
laughs protect me
robin of locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully
allow that years of war and prison may change a man
step forward marian so i may see how you have changed
she moves into the light
ugly as sin
the years have been kind
now remove yourself from this household
a figure steps behind robin
sticks a sword in his back
turning away as you can see we are already well protected
the sword is jabbed into his back
robins faces the man clad in back with a metal fighting mask
you are truly courageous against an unarmed man
the figure gestures towards the door
slams an elbow
the sword drops
slides across the floor
robin moves for it but the man intercepts drawing a dagger
robin darts to the wall
rips off an antlered deer head
defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns
the sound of the fight indoors
aslan hurls himself at the door
it doesnt give
chunks of horn fly
robin parries and thrusts
the horns get shorter
left with just the nubs robin hurls the deer head at the mask
gaining advantage he charges
grabs the dagger hand smashes it into the wall
the knife drops
robin wrenches off the mask
long hair tumbles down
a beautiful young woman
the front door caves in
aslan stumbles through
just in time to see the womans knee fly up into robins crotch
the battle is over
the young woman stands over robin
as she was saying we have no need of your protection
robin croaks through clenched teeth
liquid tumbles into a goblet
the three men at a table in the kitchen
the fat girl sarah who pretended to be marian serves
flashes a lusty smile at aslan who glances at robin help
in a gown
an impish grin
i trust lord locksley has recovered from his indisposition
rock strewn hills
sun peeking through clouds
robin and marian walk
anger and anguish in her voice
why would he wish me to be protected by the boy who burned my hair when i was a child
we were together five terrible years in a saracen prison
how do i know you didnt abandon him there to save your own skin
robin hands her peters ring
she is shocked
marian im sorry
i will forward your condolences to my mother
she turns her back
he searches for a way to reach her
on my return i found my father dead
the sheriff denounced him as a druid and took our lands
the people fear the druids so much theyd believe anything
nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property
why do you not join your mother in london
you would be safer there
i will not retreat
besides i have no interest in life at court
gossip mongering and currying favor
here i am my own person
the you must allow me to be your guardian
i do not need a guardian
she turns to face him
my brother is dead
you cannot take his place
robin grabs and holds her
marian i dont want to replace him
what do you want
their eyes meet
a sudden intimacy between them
robin moves closer
marian begins to respond then pulls away
this is wrong
she runs back to the house
robin stares after her
aslan appears in the doorway with duncan
the old man hears horses
he runs to a bluff
a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside
twenty or more
in battle armor
soldiers coming here
is this your protection
i killed some of the sheriffs men
i fear i have placed you in danger
i can take care of myself
there are horses in the stable
aslan runs into the stables
im not leaving
marian ices him with a glare
aslan reappears with two bareback horses
soldiers appear on the crest led by gisborne
with a mischievous grin marian runs to the soldiers
theyre stealing my horses
damn the girl
aslan can you ride
in answer aslan grins
leaps onto a horse
with a single swift move he hoists duncan up behind him and digs in his heels
the mare leaps forward and over the estate wall
he can ride
he heads his horse at the wall
barely clears it
robin struggles to hold on
marian stands directly in gisbornes path
you have been sheltering outlaws lady marian
theyre thieves you imbecile
bring back my horses or the sheriff will know of your cowardice
gisborne knows she is lying
youre lucky he didnt steal your virtue too
to his men a crown to the man who brings me locksleys head
he leads the pursuit
a soldier hangs back
grabs marians hair
a kiss for me saxon bitch
she unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt
jabs the blade into his wrist
try me again if you want to leave a hand behind
shocked and pained the man gallops away
marian looks down at her dagger hand
it shakes violently
water erupts under hooves
aslan fords a stream
duncan hangs on for dear life
robin strives to keep up
half a mile behind gisborne splits up his men
trying for a short cut robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge
his horse balks at the drop
robin flails at his mount with hands and feet
it backs away
damn you animal
aslan shouts from the far bank
treat it like a woman
robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse
closing in the soldiers unfurl their crossbows
a flight of bolts whistles ominously close to robin
he must jump or die
have you never had a woman
of course ive had a woman
come on pretty one
he pats the horse soothingly
the animal edges forward
with your knees
the soldiers reload
robin urges the horse at the steep drop
another wave of crossbow bolts
robin launches the frightened animal into space
scramble up the other bank
robin enthusiastically pats the horses neck
i love you
the first two pursuers misjudge their leaps
their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed
yelling robin of the hood
son of the devil worshipper
what is your pleasure gisborne
it was i who strung your fathers corpse to the castle gate
my pleasure will be in doing the same to you
you survived one meeting
our next will be your last
your father died a coward cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig
thats a lie
incensed he is losing his judgement
shouts come robin
he is trying to anger you into a trap
a shaft pierces the flank of robins horse
it rears in fright
robin clings on
six soldiers the men gisborne split off are climbing the embankment towards him
robin regains control
rides right at them
scatters them and takes off again
gisborne yells at his men to follow
robin and aslan ride flat out
open land turns to scrub
seeing no followers robin pulls up and dismounts
we have lost them
ill lame this mare if i ask her to go any farther
he gently extracts the shaft from his horse
aslan opens his pouch
pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide
rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye
a primitive telescope
robin watches curious
through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind them
here they come
robin puts the device to his eye
the soldiers are close
he reacts in shock
prepares to defend himself
then realizes they are still in the distance
is this arab magic
he replaces the tube in his pouch
how did your uneducated kind ever take jerusalem
robin points towards an endless expanse of trees
we can lose them in the forest
sherwood is haunted master
either we take our chances with the ghosts or become ghosts ourselves
they race into the trees
gisbornes men thunder up
slowing as they enter the forest
peering around them in trepidation they slowly rein in
robin looks back
theyre not following
gisborne curses his men urging them on
come on damn you
there are only three of them
its not the men we fear sir
eerie howling and rattling of bones
aslan draws his sword
they say they fly in your mouth and suck you dry of blood before you can scream
he wraps his scarf over his mouth
wind gusts the trees in angry waves
emits deathly shrieks
the horses whinney
unnerved aslan smites around him with his scimitar
wheels at the sounds striking only air
allah protect us from the evil spirits
duncan clings to his back
aslan slashes out futilely
robin cracks up
cease your mad laughing
i can feel them
robin reaches into the branches
pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes windchimes
dozens of such strings on all the trees
he blows over the hollow end
a low chilling moan
here are your ghosts duncan
a childs toy put to good use
you scare easily my painted saladin
his laughter is broken by a piercing yell
a red jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope
catapults him to the ground
the bushes are instantly alive
shaggy wild eyed men armed with cudgels scythes and hayforks
twelfth century hells angels
the red jacketed young turk will scarlet leaps around robin
singing ring around the rosie
aslan makes no move to intervene
the woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger keeping their distance from him
will kicks at robin who tries to grab him
will skips out of range
we all fall down
beg for mercy rich man
i beg of no man
which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man
yeah bollocks mate
robin looks up
i mean up
a towering figure
seven feet of grinning muscled brute
the giant extends a vice that passes for a hand
hauls robin to his feet
his eyes twinkle with merriment
his whole body shakes when he laughs which is often
what are ya mold cock
he pauses checking the faces of the angry peasants
who are you
bestman o the woods
you lead this rabble
we waste time
for passage through sherwood
i will pay no tax
besides i have nothing but my cloak and my sword
a man who travels with two servants and claims hes without money is either a fool or a liar
grabbing robin little shakes him like a doll
robins fathers medallion
laughing heartily little rips it from robins neck and tosses it to scarlet
and this one is a liar
he bites the metal ahah
the men cheer
john snatches the medallion back from will
that is sacred to me
sacred to us too mush
this herell feed us for a bloomin month
robin draws his sword
you will have to fight me for it
id love to mate
he grins hugely
a boy pushes his way through the throng
i know him
this man is your father
tell him how i saved your hide from the sheriffs soldiers
that deserves some gratitude i believe
he reaches for the medallion
john pulls it away
naw ya dont laddie
you must be robin of locksley
the blackguard who abandoned us to nottinghams plundering
be careful father
he fights like a demon
he walloped six o sheriffs men
is that so
licking his lips in anticipation he lunges for robins wrist
wrenches the sword free
bends it into a pretzel
robin swings a fist into the giants gut
john doesnt flinch
hoists robin off the ground with one arm
cannonballs the other fist into robins stomach
the little rich boy is lost for words
thanks for the taxes locksley
and for the laughs
the woodsmen find this hysterical
they disappear into the tree
will administers one final kick before leaving
robin staggers to his feet
glares furiously at aslan
son of an arab whore
once again your assistance was invaluable
you seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life
i recognized some of the voices
many were from your fathers farms
your avenging army my friend
all they need is a leader
they have a leader
a very large one
defeat him and they will follow you
allah has taken your brains
i hear the voice of a spoiled child master robin
i suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north
you expect me to fight that behemoth
your father would expect you to act like a man
a large tree trunk spans a swift flowing river
the ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge
stop in their tracks
robin stands on the bridge brandishing a long wooden staff
this is my bridge
no one crosses without paying tax
just bugger off mate huh
if you wish to cross it will cost you a gold medallion
aint i hurt you a bloody nuff for one day
if hes in a hurry to end his mortal misery help him
you dont have the courage to face me again john little
or should i call you little john
john grabs a hefty gnarled staff
strides to the bridge
alright mold cock
you wanna nuther good wallopin
his confidence melting robin glances back at duncan and aslan who grins like a fan at a boxing match
john storms at robin
driven back robin connects a blow on johns foot
the giant is off balance
robin follows up
lands a couple to the ribs
john responds with heavy swings which robin blocks deftly
back and forth blow for blow all blocked
john chuckles with every swing
enjoying the time of his life
their staffs lock
its strength against strength
robin is no match
with one mighty thrust john hurtles him into the stream
the woodsmen cheer loudly
aslan watches impassively
robin scrambles back onto the bridge
john waits grinning
lil wet behind the ears mate
dont fool with him
robin fends him off gets in some shots of his own
john swings in a giant arc
john loses balance and falls to his knees
robin allows him time to right himself
john comes at him again pummeling
wood splinters from the impact
brute force versus agility
agility is beginning to prevail when robins staff splits in two
swimmin time again ol chum
the coup de grace
disappears under the foaming water
does not re emerge
the spectators rush to the bank
e were a brave un
suddenly robin arcs up out of the water
his hands clamp onto johns ankles
robin heaves with all his might
john topples headfirst into the water
surfaces in panic
caint bloody swim
he submerges again
robin pulls his head above water
do you yield
the terrified giant sputters
goes under again flailing with arms and legs
robin holds his head just above the surface
do you yield
now put your feet down
john struggles then his feet hit bottom
the water only reaches his chest
ill be buggered
pay me the tax
a tense pause while all wait for littles reaction
robin hood ya got balls o solid rock
he hands robin back the medallion
chuckling loudly he swoops robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank
a bonfire crackles
the woodsmen drink eat argue and fight
john passes robin a jug
made it mself
drinks a fine brew little john
he spits black objects from his mouth
he takes the jug back
sneezes royally spewing all over the brew
oblivious he hands the contaminated jug to aslan
with regrets i decline
an englishmans mead not bleedin good enough for ya
on the contrary
i thank you but my faith prevents me from partaking in such enjoyments
your bloody loss mate
passes the jug on to duncan who drinks heartily
wulf cautiously approaches robin
what is it boy
i wanna thankee lord locksley
i owes ya mlife
you owe me nothing wulf
i am glad i chanced by in time to help
cmon lad drink
twill put hair on your bloomin chest
wulf tries the brew
the impact is instant
he turns green and runs
his father cracks up
tell me about your men john
john points to a short fellow with the build of a tree trunk
this stumpy one eres david o doncaster
we calls im bull
how do you come by the name bull
cuz o my size sire
because you are short
cuz i be so long
proudly he starts to pull down his pants
save it for the ladies
robin turns to the next man at the fireside
your name friend
the mans bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to respond but he stutters too badly to get out a comprehensible word
that be hal brownwell but the lads call im hal hiccup
the others make hiccup and belching sounds and crack up at hals embarrassment
hal strikes out angrily at his tormentors
hal you have the face and hands of a farmer
i wager you are a strong and honest man and id be glad to have you at my side in a fight
the next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me
there is murmuring around the group but no one elects to try it
how is it there are so many of you in hiding
got prices on our eads every man jack
blasted sheriff says we owes im taxes
how do you fare
we get by i reckon
while the sheriff steals your land and your families starve
what in bloody blazesd ya have us do
your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so long my friend
soon the sheriff will hunt you down and hang you
you must fight back
we show as much as a toe outside the forest theyll slaughter us like bleedin sheep
we must organize
win by guile
ya lookin to join us matie
to lead you
i would never be led by the son of a druid
there are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man
i doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror
murmurs of agreement from around the fire
robin turns to will
what is your name friend
count me not a friend locksley
stuff a flippin cork in it will
the mans our guest
will gets up
angrily pushes his way out of the group
that theres will scarlet
pay im no eed

he is right to distrust me
i am a rich mans son
i have done no honest labor
but today i am as poor as any of you
nottingham has stolen all that i own
and when i killed gisbornes men i too became an outlaw
yare full obloody wind an all mate

we can win
and i believe we will
yare a daft bugger robin hood but yare a brave un ill give ya that
drink up laddie cuz tomorrow ya maynt be so lucky
tomorrow i shall best ya an crack that blasted noble head in two
laughing loudly he throws back his head for a long draught of mead
a steady trickle of rain drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping saracen
he wakes cursing
all around him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor covered with rags and hides coughing and sneezing
a sorry mess
robin sits brooding
gloomily i have led you wrong
this is no army
these men live like dogs
they can learn
to build kennels
he sullenly stalks away
robin shakes his head
aslan is right
he rouses duncan who is asleep at his side
the old man groans awake holding his head
seriously hung over
too much mead old friend
what day is it
sunday i believe
do they still give alms to the poor at the mass
these days the need for mercy is greater than ever
then i must ask you a favor
duncan walks alone with the aid of his staff
body stooped clothes ragged a pathetic figure
ahead is the main gate to the walled city of nottingham
fresh horse manure
a mans hand reaches into it and spreads it over his clothes
and his face robin dressed as duncan
robin taps his way through the crowd
past the piercing stare of the armored guard at the gate
robin keeps going
a hand clasps his shoulder
spins him round
do i know you
robin gazes into space trying to look blind
the guard sniffs his soiled hand
my god you stink
pardon my blindness sir
im always falling down
get away from me
he launches a kick in robins rear
robin hobbles away hiding a smile
the guard tries to wipe off his hand on the wall
jesus hangs from the cross
a magnificent stained glass window
in the ornate pulpit the bishop of hereford bedecked in ermine
we beseech thy blessing lord on all your people but most especially on our noble lord nottingham
grant him the wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city
nottingham and gisborne sit piously among the congrega tion of nobles and wealthy merchants
grant him also the strength to bring to justice the lawless men who threaten its safety
help him to stamp out the curse of the dread druids who would seize from us our children even as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers
the rear of the church
standing crushed together the poor and afflicted
old and young
among them robin
the sermon ends
as the nobles file out the poor are galvanized
begging hands reach out
have mercy milady
pity fine sir
for my baby
the rich drop a few mites sparking a mad scramble
church officials roughly keep order
marian passes some coins to the mother of a small child
a hand grabs her wrist
alms for a blind man
for one who cannot see your beauty
recognizing him this is dangerous
so you care for my safety
no for mine
i do not wish to be seen with an outlaw
under the sheriffs law thats a badge of pride
hes put a price on your head
a hundred gold pieces
is that all
i have not annoyed him enough
soon he will offer ten thousand
for ten thousand i would turn you in myself
glances back at the sheriff nottingham is mounting an army
how do you know
he has rounded up every blacksmith in the county
he has them holed up in the castle making swords and armor
what is he planning
i dont know but theres no limit to the mans ambitions
as sheriff heads towards them go
if you need me i will be with the woodsmen
send for me as robin hood
do something for me
take a bath
care to join me
with a grin he slips into the crowd as nottingham arrives
you shine like the sun my lady
he raises her hand as he did the girls in the castle
you have been meeting with young robin of locksley
as she tries to hide her shock my cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses
a most disagreeable experience
i deeply regret it and i promise you he will be brought to justice
for subjecting you to such treatment i will hang him from the walls with his own entrails
that gleam of insanity
robin watches from a distance
i would like to see that my lord
the sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder
my dear a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone
if you would consent to bring your household within the city walls i could give your needs my most personal attention
i thank you lord nottingham from the heart but for now i prefer to stay in my familys ancestral home
my cousin king richard will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare
alas the king has many enemies both abroad and at home
i fear for his safe return
fear not my dear sheriff
he will return
when he does he will wish to reward his faithful subjects
the sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave
marian deflates with relief
the sheriff walks alone towards a side door
robin alms my lord
nottingham makes to shove the man aside
with a swift move the beggar grabs the sheriff in a headlock
slides nottinghams own dagger to his throat and drags him out of sight
a hundred crowns sheriff
you insult me
nottingham starts to struggle
robin draws blood
remember young robin of locksley sheriff
meet robin hood
your avenging angel
if you kill me you will hang
if i kill you i will hang happy
what do you want
i want to give you a chance
a chance you do not deserve
a chance to right your wrongs
from this day forward you will cease to tax my people
you will renounce the charges against my father and you will return his lands to me
why should i
because for every harm you do i swear by god i shall visit on you threefold in return
i am here with a blade at your throat
as long as i live you will always know that i could be here again
a yell from across the church
gisborne has spotted them
robin digs the knife a little deeper
then it will begin
gisborne yells orders
robin hurls nottingham against the wall
robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the sheriffs horse which is held by a stunned groom
he rides through the busy marketplace
a crossbowman tracks him
a sure shot
marian spots the danger
she fakes being tripped and stumbles into the bowman
his bolt flies harmlessly into the air
innocently please excuse my clumsiness
robin charges for the city gate
as he passes he kicks the guard who hasseled him into the wall
men gather around as robin dismounts admiring the horse
a personal loan from the sheriff
furious you should not have left without me englishman
you have not raised a finger to protect me
before i had a choice
it was my choice to do this alone
a foolish risk
if you had been killed i would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge
aslan if i didnt know better i would swear you were worried about me
the sheriff maniacally spits out orders to gisborne
starve them out
slaughter their livestock
i want to see locksleys own people fighting each other to bring him to us
i swear he will not live to see the next full moon
a squealing hog is loaded onto a wagon
soldiers round up the livestock
an old farmer protests
go bless ya sir
leave us the sow
shes with young uns
the next litterll feed us through the winter
youve heard of robin hood
the soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground
then pray he is brought to us before winter
a trail of refugees
women and children carry their belongings into camp
wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings
a contingent of woodsmen confronts robin
you brought this misery on us locksley
we can barely feed ourselves
sheriff hasnt left us a bloody pot to piss in
then we shall take from him and his rich friends
this provokes a barrage of protests
the men are angry
brave talk locksley
i say we take the rich boy in
murmurs of general agreement
will do you think the sheriff will give everything back after i am gone
he will give us the reward and our pardons
you can take me in on one condition
you must fight me
you may use the sheriffs horse and arm yourself as you please
i will fight on foot
if you lose you will accept me as your leader
if you win you may take me in
dead or alive
hands tighten a girth
will confidently jokes with his cronies
woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators
little john and his wife fanny keep to themselves while wulf openly talks with robin aslan and duncan
robin is stripped to the waist his muscled skin ravaged with scars
this man has true purpose
he means to kill you
and you have given him the means
will is ruthless robin
guard your back
i am grateful for your concern friends but i have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds
shouts i am ready will
will bends as if checking the horses legs
secretly grabs a handful of sand
swings into the saddle and digs in his heels
closing in will flings the sand in robins eyes
robin clutches his hands to his face blinded
will spins back to the attack
his sword slashes
reacting to the sound robin rolls aside
the men cheer like a big fight crowd
robins pov is blurred
ducking the blade he grabs wills arm
a blow glances off his shoulder
robin falls to his knees still blinded
will rides right at him to trample him
robin scrambles away
will wheels his horse
a flashing hoof grazes robins chest
robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his lungs
panicked the horse rears whinnying wildly
will struggles to stay in the saddle
loses his sword
robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough
douses his face
yells at will
come on you little piss pot
do your worst
will grabs a spear from a bystander
robin stands his ground
will lunges robin sidesteps
the horse is smarter than you are will
some of the men laugh
will is incensed
robin ducks and weaves easily evading wills repeated charges
robin ducks right under the horses belly
you aim like a girl will
will stabs wildly more and more frustrated
laughter spreads as robin plays hide and seek around the horses legs
grabbing the end of the spear he clowns a tug of war
enraged will strains and tries to kick robin away
suddenly robin lets go
unbalanced will flies back wards off his mount
robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary
the crowd falls silent
the point quivers in the ground below wills crotch
will wriggles in terror
impaled his pants rip open
thank the lord you are not endowed like bull
the crowd is convulsed with laughter
robin catches his breath
does not see will who grabs a heavy staff and runs at him
a strong hand grasps wills arm as he is about to strike
jus bugger off eh
overpowered will relents
with a defiant glance he skulks away
ya got us by the short and curlies robin hood
now lets hear what ya got to bleedin say
robin scans the faces
he has their attention
nottingham has taken from us everything we own
now we are going to start taking from him
ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do that
we are going to tax him
the forest is a mosaic of green gold orange and red
a giant eye in a circle of glass
aslan his telescope raised
here they come
they usually have five
he grabs the telescope
a phalanx of mounted soldiers a cart loaded with barrels and a tax wagon
the wagon is an armored box on wheels with crossbow slits in the side
guy of gisborne commands the escort
this is no ordinary convoy
bull calls up from below where a ragged group of woods men lies nervously in ambush
er about ten
then to aslan why scare them
they cant count anyway
and they call me the barbarian
together they run down the hill keeping low
gisborne eyes the forest
the beer cart is steered by a fat red faced friar raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels
arrows whistle in
the friar yells and drops his jug
a soldier is hit
at the forest edge four woodsmen reload their longbows
dressed in green their faces camouflaged
the mounted soldiers charge them
the woodsmen run into the trees
as the horsemen close in the runners leap into a trench
lift up matted screens of brush and grass
its as if they disappeared
the soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens
more arrows fly
more soldiers fall
the others spin in confusion trying to discern the enemy
more woods men break from cover
run down a narrow path
gisborne urges his men to pursue
they ride in single file beating their way through the tangled branches
the runners dive into the trees as other men haul on ropes raising a giant screen in the soldiers path
the horses swerve on the edge of a twenty foot drop to the river gorge
momentum carries many of them over the cliff
robin and aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax wagon
kick down the two drivers and take the reins steering the wagon off the road
the archers inside are unable to fire at them
little john leaps onto the beer cart sending the friar hurtling back among the barrels
the friar slams his head and drops unconscious
john whips the horse driving the cart after robin
another camouflage screen is lifted into place covering their route
gisborne races back to the road
the wagons are gone
he rides frantically back and forth
searching and cursing
robin climbs onto the tax wagons roof
angry shouts from inside
surrender your weapons
i give you my word you shall go free
in answer a swordblade jabs up through the roof near his feet
ah i feared as much
he signals to aslan who steers the tax wagon into the river
water floods in through the slits
the bowmen scramble out
what they see stops them dead
both banks are men in green longbows aimed directly at them
an axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox
the lock snaps
little john pries open the lid
reacts in astonishment
the trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold coins
the woodsmen press around
cheers of celebration
awestruck ill be buggered
this treasure had a purpose
we must find out what
he turns at the sound of a brawl from the friars cart
the friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies
get off him
hes a man of the cloth
robin drags the men off
the friar clambers to his feet
around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen
the lords blessing on you kind sir
these sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks of st
he indicates his cargo of barrels
it appears to me reverend friar that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person
ignoring him the friar mounts the cart
a thousand pardons sir but duty beckons
i must hasten on
grabbing the bridle a moment my reverend friend
you travel with poor company when you travel with nottinghams soldiers
aye tax him
this sparks a chorus of comments
my men are thirsty and have much to celebrate
lord bless me sir are these your men
i had mistook them for common thieves
kindly step aside
surely the lord has the charity to spare a few barrels to good christian men
the friar relents loosening his grip on the reins
well sir if you wish them to share in the good lords brew
casually reaching under the seat he pulls out a club
smites robin with it
you must best me for it
the friar whips up the horse
dazed robin grabs for the fat mans leg
gets a holy sandal full in the face
the friars horse as obese as his driver slowly raises his head from the grass and ambles forward
robin runs after them and dives at the friar toppling him from the cart
you leave when i say
scrambling to his feet the friar glances skyward
protect me lord
he sweeps his foot knocking robins legs out from under him
hurls his full body weight on top of him
he bounces on robins stomach
robin can barely breathe
the woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle
confess that friar tuck is a better holier and braver man than thou art knave
yield i say
yield to friar tuck
desperate robin bites the friars leg
robin extricates himself grabs for a weapon
smashes the friars head with his drinking jug
he dives onto the friar and hammers his head into the ground
yield to robin hood
tuck holds up a hand in surrender
robin eases off
feeling his head thank you lord for teaching me humility
well friar tuck
we have need of an honest man of god to minister to these men and their families
what do you say
the friar struggles to his feet
he reviews the motley faces of his potential flock
his eyes light on the grinning saracen
id rather roast in hell
he punches robin in the gut
strapped into the traces pulls the beer cart
sweating profusely grunting with strain
his horse contentedly follows
he flicks the reins steering the cart into camp
women and children rush to greet their men
jeer the roped soldier prisoners
the friar checks out his flock
a woman curtsies another crosses herself children touch his robe in wonder
what do you say now tuck
here are the meek of the earth
tuck surveys the hopeful hungry faces
the little hamlet of half built huts
he folds his hands in a moment of prayer
the lord moves in mysterious ways
you will not regret it
aye but you may
a blazing fire
deer carcasses roast
tucks barrels supply the refreshment
robin and aslan pass out coins to each family
buy yourself a new son stephen
little john and bull approach
john indicates the two prisoners roped to a nearby tree
caint get a bleedin squeak outa em rob
theyd be spittin it out good if theyd knowed anythin
reckon the capn knows summat rob but stubborn ol cocker e is
perhaps it is time for some heathen persuasion
stares up at robin defiantly
spare your breath
i know nothing
reasonable i believe you
but this arab here hes got it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than nothing
and when he gets like this hes very hard to reason with
with a hair raising war cry aslan leaps into view
stripped to the waist brandishing his scimitar
the captain tries to back away
robin tries to restrain aslan is hurled aside
snarling drooling at the mouth aslan explores the captains body with his hands
a butcher checking meat
i strongly advise you to talk
he hasnt eaten in weeks
rising terror what does he want
for godsakes get him off me
very deliberately no aslan
not this one aslan
how about this other one
the other soldier who definitely has more flesh on the bone is struck dumb with horror as aslan turns his attention to him
with one swing of his sword aslan slices through the mans ropes
drags him to his feet
little john runs over
urgent no robin no
they be god fearin men
i cannot stop him john
besides if they will not tell what they know then they must pay the price
kill em aye but not like this
blood curdling screams from behind the wagon where aslan has dragged his victim
the captains face pales
the demented arab slowly reappears
blood drips from his lips
he munches the flesh from a long bone on the end of which is the soldiers glove
the mans arm
turning to robin aslan shouts in arabic and gesticulates wildly at the captain
what does he say
well roughly he says that he doesnt care for the way your friend tastes and he wants you
no god no
just keep him away
keep him away
bull holds the other prisoner muffling the mans mouth and trying to suppress his own laughter
beside them lies a large chunk of venison
the man is unharmed except that hes missing a glove
the walls shake with little johns laughter
sure changed the color of is britches didnt e
thanks to our cannibal friend
aslan repeats his wildman act munching on a chunk of venison
gonna laugh my bloody balls off
whyd the sheriff be sendin gold north o the border
to hire mercenaries
the celts are savage tribesmen trained to kill from birth
aye the romans built a bleedin great wall to keep em out
what does e want wi em
since he also has every smith in the country working in his castle we can assume he is planning a little war
the sheriff inspects his weapon factory
his eyes glint with the reflections of the smithys fires
a door crashes open behind him
paying no heed he draws a sword from a furnace
its blade white hot
we were ambushed
in sherwood forest
nottingham tests the sword against an anvil
spanish steel cousin
so much stronger than our native blades
all the men are gone
yet again you are the sole survivor cousin
and the gold
well it er
the sheriff looks at gisborne for the first time
they were woodsmen dressed in green
he places a hand reassuringly on his cousins shoulder
cousin we must be strong
we cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us
without warning he drives the blade into gisbornes belly
and i cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me
turning to the horrified smithy it is indeed fine steel
a small procession
tuck drives his cart bull the tax wagon
both vehicles laden with supplies
wulf and hal pass out flour chickens blankets clothing to the villagers
their weapons are prominently displayed
tuck swigs from a jar passes it to an old villager
god bless you sir
an go bless robin ood friar
they says as ow none o the sheriffs cronies dare go within miles o sherwood for fear o havin their pockets pinched
ah the good lord giveth and the good lord taketh away
unless robin hood takes it first
the procession passes two of the sheriffs mounted soldiers
they glumly watch as tuck raises his jug in greeting
good morrow brothers
water sparkling with sunlight
bursts as robin dives in naked
he luxuriates in the cool water
he attempts to hide
four horses emerge from the trees
bull and hal with marian and her servant sarah sandwiched between them
bull has a black eye
marian jumps down
to robin how dare you
good morning lady marian
in response she starts pelting him with stones
you send men to drag me from my home in the middle of the night like some slave girl
is this the way the famous robin hood treats a lady
er let me finish this bath you wished me to take
then ill explain
i demand an explanation right now
if you will be patient i could spare your propriety by
i will decide when my propriety is compromised
as you wish
he wades bare ass naked out of the water towards her
she casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body glistening with water
how dare you expose yourself to me
she slugs him
robin stumbles backwards into the water
bull grins gesturing to sarah and pointing to his own black eye
the big un did the same to me
an arrow flies into a bulls eye crudely marked on a tree
little john lowers his crossbow delighted at his shot
to wulf right mlad
lets see how close you can git to that bugger
wulf takes aim
his arrow slices clear through his fathers arrow splitting it in two
little john slaps wulf on the back and beckons everyone over
take a gander at this un mates
never seen nuthin like it in my bloomin life
robin leads marian through the camp
the beginnings of a village women doing laundry kids playing men prac ticing archery and swordplay others working on defenses camouflaging a giant pit
marian is impressed but not about to admit it
this better be damned important
robin leads her into a hut
inside is a trove of cap tured loot purses jewelry weaponry fancy coats and
the treasure chest
at robins nod bull throws back the lid
marian is speechless
nottingham robs the poor
we rob nottingham and give back to the poor
do you think hes going to let you get away with all this
the man is without mercy
he will annihilate you
somebody has to take a stand
youre taking a stand with the lives of these people
these young ones
she checks the faces
her eyes meet robins
is there a hint of concern for him also
what do you want from me
nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the celtic tribesmen
we need to warn king richard
nottingham would not dare challenge the king
the king is not in england to be challenged is he
while he is away he may lose his country
marian masks her concern you are richards cousin
you can get word to him
he would believe you
now you want me to participate in your folly
a little girl approaches holding a bouquet of wild flowers
touched marian kneels to accept the offering
protrudes from marians saddle
she is mounted ready to go
sarah giggles as she takes her leave of bull
to marian i am sending duncan with you
give him some warm food and a real bed
i grow tired of his bellyaching
i have endured more hardship in my lifetime than any man here
robin laughs and speaks to marian in a stage whisper
dont tell him i told you but he may be useful to you
there is no one to whom i would rather entrust your safety
duncan you are most welcome
taking the lead rein from duncans horse she rides away
calls after her will you send word to the king
ill think about it
a globule of red liquid
a signet ring
marian seals a letter
the letter is held in the pudgy jeweled fingers of the bishop of hereford
a lavish office
it is a personal matter my lord but one of vital importance
i understand my dear lady
this is my most trusted emissary
he hands the letter to a solemn courier
you will travel to france immediately
you must give this directly into the hands of the king and him alone
the courier bows in acknowledgement
marian indicates sarah
my lady in waiting will accompany you
surprised the courier glances at the bishop
my dear i could not vouch for her safety
the journey is fraught with danger
i appreciate your concern my lord but sarah is an accomplished rider
i must insist that she goes along
a beat as you wish
an informal council of war
robin uses a stick in the dirt
we have to be ready to move camp at any time
the only way we can be attacked is from the nottingham road
we hide lookouts in the trees here and here
if they see soldiers they shoot warning arrows
whistles by day fire by night
wulf runs up to little john in panic
fanny little writhes in agony
john rushes in
tuck looks up from fannys side
the child comes early
john kneels beside her taking her head
yall be fine
s not like tothers john
oh god it pains me so
angrily to tuck yare sittin thar like a fat sow
help her man help her
i am doing all i can
aslan appears in the doorway with robin
whips back the blanket
fannys chest is covered with black squirming creatures
by allah leeches
he starts to pull the parasites off
tuck jumps at him
get away from her
aslan pushes him away continuing his work
blood is like air
if she loses blood she and the child will die
john is paralyzed with confusion
tuck appeals to robin
he is the devils seed sent to lead us astray
fool both the bible and the koran instruct us to preserve life
tuck raises an arm to strike aslan
robin blocks the blow
aslan gently touches the mothers stomach
soothing your baby has not turned
it cannot be born without help
what do you know you damned savage
to john if you will allow me i can help her
it will not be without danger
do not listen to him
he will kill her
if you do not listen to me she will certainly die
and the child too
fanny cries out
john looks to robin pleading for advice
the good friar has done all he can
i suggest you let the arab try
as john is undecided if i am wrong and they die then you may take my life
johns eyes meet his wifes
so be it
then it will be on your head
i have warned you
he storms out
all business aslan speaks to wulf
bring me a needle thread water a skinning knife and burning ashes
wulf runs to obey
john looks horrified
robin eases him outside then returns to aslans side
what are you going to do
the child must be taken out by the knife
i have seen it many times with horses
by the lord what are her chances
after wasting so much blood
now you tell me
wulf runs back in
aslan holds up a piece of wood
to fanny are you ready
bite down on this
robin hold her steady
he lifts the red hot knife from the ashes
little john paces
wulf comes out of the hut
families hover and wait
from inside muffled groans
i tell you the barbarian is killing her
john moves to the hut
wulf restrains him
the mother heaves then drops
is she gone
aslan ignores him keeps working over fannys body
robin cannot watch
aslan mutters something in awed arabic
what did you say
aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant
it is a boy
the mother revives
aslan places the child on her breast
your son my lady
robin hold her skin together while i sew her up
he picks up the needle and thread
robins eyes turn to the womans abdomen
marches among the cheering families holding his newborn child high for all to see
tuck sits miserably to one side
bloody and exhausted aslan appears at the hut door
tuck jumps to his feet drawing his knife
robin appears unsteadily behind aslan
watches ready to intervene
tuck stares at aslan
raises his blade
and slices down across his own wrist
this day god has taught me a fine lesson
he hands aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist
i would be honored
aslan slices his own wrist
the two wrists clasp together in the universal sign of brotherhood
you are a good man my barbarian friend
we shall open a barrel together and i shall do my damndest to save your heathen soul
alas i am not permitted
our god made this brew brother
i merely combined the ingredients
do you dare to insult his works
hooves fly along a track
sarah and the courier
the courier reins in sarah draws alongside
what is wrong
my horse seems to be favoring a foreleg
sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her across the neck
she falls from the saddle unconscious
marian is alone reading
a sudden gust extinguishes her candle
hammering and shouting from a distant part of the house
unnerved she calls out
who is there
marian enters stealthily
a candle in one hand a drawn dagger in the other
something leaps at her
a cat looking for scraps on the kitchen table
she shoos him down
go find mice
she sighs with relief
is grabbed from behind
a masked soldier
we meet again
he reveals a large scar on his wrist removes his mask the man who attacked her earlier
he prods her with his sword
drop your blade
you are still overmatched soldier
she drops the sword
he hurls her against the table
lays his blade against her chest
you owe me favors wench
bare your breasts
or i will do it for you
resignedly she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress
with the other hand she reaches behind her grabs a pepper bowl
flips the contents into his face
screaming he grabs his face
she reaches for her dagger
he slashes with his sword
she backs to the fireplace grabs a spit of roasted chickens
drives the point clean through his chest
he stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast
masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house dragging the servants
duncan is shoved through the door
i am sorry my lady
there were too many
she stares at the invaders with studied calm
is there something you need gentlemen
i remember no masked ball on my calendar
flying low over treetops over an expanse of green intersected by brown roads and tracks
we are looking at a detailed scale model of sherwood forest in
the sheriff and six barons are gathered around the model
these are the men who revealed their faces to lord locksley in the druid ceremony
nottingham toys with a white rat on his arm
forget about locksley
he is no threat
how can we control all england if we cannot control our own county
the people are turning him into a hero
it is impossible to attack him in the forest
we have tried everything
he is cunning
then we will be more cunning
i must be rid of him
we may not be able to intercept his next warning to the king
sounds of commotion outside
the door swings open
framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor
his helmet is the head of a dragon
he slowly raises the visor
deep tribal scars on his cheeks
implacable ferocity in his eyes
i want the heads of the men who stole my gold
we were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men
the outlaws who band with robin hood
my lord nottingham i must protest
it is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners
what can these celts do that we cannot
the chieftain strides across to the fire
grabs a burning log
the baron backs away in fear
the log spits sparks as the chieftain raises it above his head
and drives it into his own palm
he stares unblinking at the baron holding the log to his hand for a full three seconds
an awed silence
nottingham grins delighted with the demonstration
he deposits his white rat onto the model
this rat hood has hidden out in the forest
he resists all our assaults with traps and devices while he robs us blind
we must bring him out and destroy him
the rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees
the chieftain watches impassively then calmly touches the log to the model
the trees ignite
the rat squeals in terror and runs
the chieftain cuts off its escape setting fire to more trees
the sheriff watches the flames fascinated
aslan shrieks a war cry
dervishes round the fire swigging from a jug
equally drunk the friar follows howling mimicking him
robin and the others watch in amusement
tuck scoops another jug and hands it to aslan
come you son of saladin
a toast to all of jehovahs children
the saved and the damned
this must be a truly evil potion to make the soul feel this good
he downs the entire jug in one long draught
come holy man
a toast to all of allahs children
the true believers and the fat infidels
tuck laughs and drinks
aslan sways and topples at the friars feet
heaves up all over the holy sandals
tuck looks at robin
how can these arabs hold jerusalem when they cant even hold their brew
a masked soldier gallops along
hurls a bundle to the ground
the friar and the saracen lie head to head on the dewey grass
robin shakes aslan who grabs for his weapon
the hangover hits him like a mallet
he clutches his temples
the dancing demon
wincing if it was jehovah who created this brew he is truly wise
he built the punishment into the crime
an arrow whistles into a tree
they need help
bull and hal are crouched in the roadway over a body
robin runs up with aslan
he kneels beside them
the body is duncan
robin clasps a dead hand
fighting his emotions
a bloke wearin a mask o the druids rode by
tossed im down
are you sure it was a druid mask
as bull nods damn them to hell
they must have marian
do you know where they meet
the gregor caves i eard tell
we will go there
you stay here dammit
i will go alone
you forget yourself
i am not your servant
then be my friend
there are women and children here in greater need of your courage
considers take my eyes then
he hands robin his telescope
squawking ominously crows burst from the trees
robin rides up the path to the caves that his father took
checks the ground
he dismounts moves cautiously forward
no one visible
smoke rises from ashes
remnants of a recent ceremony
robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone circle
there is blood on the sacrificial altar
through the opening of the cave he spies a womans form lying face down
under his breath marian
he runs forward
turns the body over
skin chalk white from loss of blood
a shadow falls across robin
before he can react a cudgel stuns him into blackness
robins eyes he wakes
squints around him the dark smoke filled recesses of the caves
the walls weave
eerie watery sounds like the cries of drowning men
he tries to stand
a figure in a flowing white robe
floating towards him
he tries to speak her name
reaches out his hand
death is not to be feared robin
her laugh echoes around the cave as if hundreds of lost souls are laughing with her
robin crawls away cover ing his ears
marian lifts his face to hers
weakly robin tries to push away the cup
her hand grips his chin forcing his mouth open
the liquid trickles over his lips
he tries to focus
her features are blurred her voice hypnotic
look at me
listen to me
you belong to me
your soul is mine
you will obey my every word
do you understand
her face is inches from his
he tries to pull away his subconscious sounding alarms
because you love me
you love me
as robin struggles say it
sinking i love you
he gives himself to her
their lips meet
something changes in his vision
her eyes glow red
her face starts to shrivel he is kissing the wrinkled lips of mortianna
he pulls away
strong arms grab him
he shakes his head trying to make sense
through his blurred vision we see he is surrounded by masked men
slurred where is marian
she is with friends
cackles your resistence is strong but useless
as quill is forced into his hand you are a druid like your father
you consort with the devil
your confession will be witnessed by the bishop of hereford
a guard forces robins hand across the page
then cries out clutching his back
an arrow lodged be tween his shoulders
in the cave mouth are wulf bow in hand bull kneeling beside sarahs corpse and aslan
horror the painted man
aslans war cry richochets off the cave walls
a curved scimitar in one hand a straight english sword in the other his arms are lethal windmills
the masked guards are cut down left and right
mortianna retreats scurry ing into the depths of the cave
bull joins the fray charging like his namesake howling in rage flailing at heads with his quarterstaff
wulf stays in the mouth picking off men with deadly accuracy
a furious melee
bull and aslan mow down the enemy like hay battling far superior odds
soon they are the only two left standing
bull peers cautiously into the dark ness
behind him one of his victims crawls back to his feet
a sword is driven through bulls gut
aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile drives him into the cave wall
the mans skull cracks against the rocks
aslan runs to robins side as wulf hurries to bulls
robin is slumped against a rock
aslan runs to the back of the cave searching
wulf is crouched beside bull who murmurs his dying words
ya be sure sarah gits a christian burial
promise me boy
aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse
far be low he sees mortianna clambering down the steep rock
for a second their eyes meet
she hisses venom hatred fear then is gone
aslan carries robin outside
robin is staggering glassy eyed mumbling incoherently
his arm blocks the light from his eyes
they have poisoned you
there are herbs that can alter a mans brain
i know of only one cure
he drops to one knee slams robin violently across the other
slaps him on the back and forces his fingers down his throat
it worked for me this very morning
as robin heaves you will thank me for this later
first wulfs leading another with the bodies of bull and sarah draped across its back
aslan rides the third with robin propped up in front of him
you have fulfilled your vow
now you can leave
your gratitude warms my heart
you ignored my request
it is fortunate that i did
because of you another good man is dead
he urged me to bring him
he was a brave man and i grieve for him
praise be to allah that i do not grieve for you also
or for my broken vow
to hell with your damn vow
i am glad you are feeling better
ahead of them wulf shouts and reins in
he points into the distance
a huge cloud of smoke is darkening the sky
along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire arrows
at a shouted order another wave of flaming arrows ignites the trees
behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback
one is the sheriff in full armor
the other is the black clad celtic chieftain
he sits as still as a rock
acrid black smoke pours across the clearing
coughing screaming confusion
little john vainly attempts to instill calm
yall be jus fine
lil smoke aint gonna kill ya
scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees
running up its burning for miles john
its hotter than hades and them damn screens aint worth nothing
two woodsmen blinded and choking stumble into one of their own camouflaged pits
hideous screams as theyre impaled on hidden stakes
john tries to gather the able bodied men to his side
we must make a stand
most of them keep on running
yare no more use than a load o wet farts
wheres that damn locksley
ill swear he betrayed us
quit yer bloody bellyachin
hal runs to join them stuttering
what the bloody hell ya sayin
pointing behind him gggg
god help us
celts arrayed behind their chieftain
an awesome sight
clad in hides and skins painted arms and faces head pieces the faces of wild animals
standing in eerie silence
a loud clap of thunder
nottingham rides up to the chieftain
i want prisoners
the chieftain does not turn his head
we came to fight
nevertheless i need prisoners
with only a short flick of his head the chieftain spits
nottingham waves his arm signalling his own foot sol diers to advance
the chieftain raises his sword
instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors
they charge forward
the bloodcurdling cry fills the sky
amidst the smoke and chaos little johns small band is gathered at the edge of the clearing
what are we gonna do john
stop ere and flippin well fight em thats what
whadya say lads
half hearted support from about a dozen men including tack
ya best be goin wi the wenches
this holy man believes in doing gods work with his hands
he snatches a quarterstaff
john slaps him on the back
the men are encouraged
lets give em a bloody good wallopin an all lads
aslan reins in
in the valley below the forest is ablaze
the sheriffs armed hordes swarm over the em battled woodsmen
wulf stay here
i need your horse
he climbs onto wulfs horse steers it right at the heart of the enemy
aslan blocks his way grabbing his reins
what are you doing
out of my way
i saved your life
i will not let you give it away for no purpose
out of my way damn you
does the witch still have possession of your senses
if we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help
and do some damage to the enemy
they urge their horses into a gallop
the sheriffs men stomp through the burning forest
from the other side of the flaming trees little johns men pick off shots with their longbows
they retreat turn and fire again
they back into a clearing
the celtic mercenaries charge at them across the open ground
the woodsmen drop their bows
hand to hand combat
woodsmen are being decimated
little john storms and shouts cutting down the enemy inspiring his men
the scotsmen are awed by this giant
tuck is confronted by a wild eyed celt
surely you would not harm a man of the cloth
the man swings tuck sidesteps
then to hellfire with you
he pummels the man to the ground with his staff
the woodsmen are broken into two groups
one group including will is surrounded and surrenders
the others fight on
bleeding from several wounds little john is surrounded by four celts
he spins challenging them spitting out expletives
defiant to the last
suddenly his attackers are hurled aside
robin rides right through them slashing with his sword
bout bleedin time mush
tuck is driven to the ground
his assailant is deliver ing the lethal blow when aslan cuts him down
tuck glances heavenwards
thank you lord
an afterthought and thank you allah
aslan is a wild man
steering his horse with just legs and knees he strikes out with both swords to left and right
the momentum is turning
wulf appears at the edge of the clearing
starts picking off stragglers
his father spots him
git the bleedin ell outa there ya lil bugger
distracted he doesnt see a celt swing at his back
but wulfs arrow pierces the mans adams apple
he freezes in mid air before toppling at johns feet
when john turns back wulf is being dragged away by three of the sherrifs men
he attempts to pursue but is intercepted by two more celts
and struck down
aslan charges between the two celts
slashes down with both swords
both men topple to the ground simultaneously
suddenly all is quiet
the smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies
only four men seem to be alive
robin aslan tuck who is slouched against a tree gasping for breath and hal who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder
robin dismounts and runs to little john
overwhelmed and exhausted he slumps over the giants unmoving form
dont ee start bleedin blubberin or yall make me bloody vomit
robin manages a relieved smile
aslan strides over
all around them lie slain celts and woodsmen
it was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign
a shovel breaks dirt
beyond exhaustion robin digs a grave
the clearing is transformed into a cemetery
tuck blesses the bodies of bull and sarah
aslan drags a celts corpse into a grave
throws the mans armor and weapons into a growing pile
you were an honor to your countrymen today aslan
you fought better than twenty english knights
this war is the god of abraham against the forces of evil
well the war is over
he stares across the desolate clearing
there is too much blood on my hands
a heavy key turns in a lock
bolts drawn back
fol lowed by guards nottingham enters the torture chamber where the captured woodsmen are chained among them wulf and will scarlet
putrid ankle deep water on the floor walls encrusted with dried blood and grime
nottingham walks up to the first man
wry smile would you prefer pain or death
dignity masking his terror
nottingham appears to consider
the man is dragged away by guards
the next prisoner and you
pain or death
pure terror er
you see it makes no difference
you will all be tortured
you will all tell me all you know about robin hood and then you will all be hanged
then we will catch your beloved robin hood and do the same to him
i will kill him for you
nottingham strides up to will drawing his sword
why would i need you
all your attempts to kill him have failed
your army failed
your celtic mercenaries failed
nottingham places his sword point against wills throat
and you can succeed
i am one of his men
he would never suspect me
he knows you always hated him traitor
he is a trusting fool
he will believe me
if he doesnt he will kill me and you have lost nothing
nottingham slides his blade between wills teeth
if you fail i will personally cut out your lying tongue
he withdraws the blade
will tries to smile
and if i succeed
his friends will
to a guard torture him
he turns back to will
a smile of mock apology
it will look better
a winters night
sad figures huddled around a small fire
fanny tends to johns wounds their little ones asleep by their feet
john drinks and passes the jug to tuck who numbly shakes his head
too depressed even to drink
aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to robin who sits alone staring vacantly into the darkness
my pride brought us to this
it was you who gave these men pride
i gave them nothing but false hope
tomorrow we will disperse
these people can move south and start over
you must go home and win your jasmina
i am no longer your responsibility
that is for me to decide
raging damn you arab
i want you out of my life
cant you understand that
go back to your own kind
aslan stares at him then turns away
not the time for argument
robin fingers his fathers medallion
rips it from his neck
damn you too father
you reared a coward and a fool
he hurls the medallion
it catches on a low hanging branch
the focus shifts to the medallion dangling in its center
the last thing robin sees before his eyes close into troubled sleep
the white moon against the black sky
a black circle against a white sky
the round medallion has become a noose
in the noose appears wulfs face
the executioner hauls on the rope and wulfs features contort in the agony of death
another noose another face
kiss me robin
the noose tightens on her neck
as she dies her face shrivels into the cackling features of mortianna
next robins father
he stares accusingly right at us
why have you betrayed me
before he pulls the rope the executioner peels back his hood
it is robin
gloating he hauls on the rope
his laughter blends with that of mortianna in a hideous cacophony
distorted in water
the laughter becomes the sound of a running river
robin is washing trying to drive away the horror
the first streaks of light fight their way through a thick morning mist
out of the mist steps a figure at first indecipherable
aware of his presence robin looks up
i thought you were taken
how did you escape
i promised to kill you
and will you
before will can answer little john runs up
grabs wills throat
ill wring yer scrawny neck will scarlet
id be doin yer a bloody favor an all
quickly others arrive
aslan tuck hal fanny with kids clinging to her skirts
afore ya kill im john ask im if wulf be still alive
will is choking unable to speak
john loosens his hold just enough for will to splutter out
git us a rope hal and well put the bleedin weasel outa is misery
let us hear what he has to say
no bugger scapes the sheriff nless es linin is bloomin pockets
a traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness
will walked in and announced himself
e always did ave balls o brass
string im up
let him speak
john reluctantly moves his hold from wills neck to his shoulders
search im hal
ell ave a bloody blade on im somewheres
will eyes the accusing faces
hal searches lifts wills shirt
his whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and fresh burns
he steps back
ready to listen
i bring a message from nottingham
our men are to be hung in the square on saturday
at high noon
what about my boy
the boy too
ten men in all
fanny drops her head on johns shoulder
their deaths are a warning
anyone who associates with the outlaw hood is to suffer the same fate
man woman or child
even anyone who so much as utters his name
chuckles may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb
the hangings are to be part of the celebration for the sheriffs marriage
what lucky wench gits to play with the sheriffs codpiece
will turns his gaze directly on robin
he takes a bride of royal blood
aye and then with king richard gone he takes the bloody throne
everyone reacts with shock
only robin appears unsur prised
you were to use this news to get close to me and then kill me
sly grin not straightway of course
what is your intention will
that depends on you locksley
ive never trusted you thats no secret
what i wanna know is are you gonna finish what you started
robin is on the spot
all eyes on him
will presses his point
will ya stay and keep us fightin till every man jack of us is dead
or will you run like the spoiled little rich boy i always took you for
you present quite a choice
what would you have me do will
if you run i will kill you
and if i stay will you all stay with me
robin checks the other faces
to the end friend
if my heathen brother stays i stay
he cant get it out
little john covers hals mouth
were all bloody in
theres your answer will
we finish it
ten gallows silhouetted against the setting sun
the black armored celt tests a gallows springing the hatch
a heavy sack dangles from the rope
grim faced peasants watch
among them fanny little
the sound of the gallows echoes inside the damp stone walls
wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings in the floor
wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light high in the wall
the purple sky is turning black
he fingers his wooden crucifix
if it be your biddin that this be my last night o life lord gimme the pluck to die proud
an look ee kindly on my folks an the young uns
the light in the cell melts to total darkness
sunlight glistens on frost laden branches
a cock robin in the troubled human realm tuck says his morning prayer
lord grant us the courage to endure and if youre as smart as i believe you are grant us victory
and the victuals to celebrate it with
aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow powder which is turning black
will you pray with me son of allah
i have prayed for you often my brother
but let us put prayer aside and help our gods in a more practical manner
i must reveal to you the mysteries of the black powder
tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to examine it
aslan snatches it back
before tuck can react robin walks up
will it work
aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel a fire ball rips ten feet in the air
tuck falls on his ass in terror
impressed you are truly a wizard
there is no such thing
but if there was
chuckles i would surely be one
robin reaches out and shakes aslans hand
a moment of bonding
he moves on to the others clasping each mans hand as he speaks
we have no armored knights no glorious banners
but i am honored to be going to battle in this company
today we fight not just for the lives of our friends but to save all england
a moment of tension before will takes the proferred hand
we may be only six men but
she strides towards them from the trees
what in blazes ya doin woman
wheres the little uns
thems safe wi my mother
pushes past little john robin i been to town an seen the scaffold and the guard towers
ya gone bleedin cracked girl

i aint gonna sit aroun an let one o em die neither
ya should be bloody well mindin the other seven
tell er rob
robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a stick
fanny show me the exact location of the scaffold
little john double takes
swathed in a pink glow
a brilliant wintry morning
breath billows from the mouths of the sentries
boots clack confidently down a stone corridor
the sheriff decked in wedding finery
dark smoke filled
foul things in jars
animals in cages waiting to meet unspeakable ends
marian is strapped in a chair flanked by two armed guards
how is my bride
marian smiles as he leans toward her
and spits in his face
you are overwhelmed with happiness
he slowly wipes off the spittle
and slaps her hard
calm uncowed i will never marry you
mortianna emerges from a dark corner bearing the goblet she used at the druid ceremony
marian struggles against her bonds
get away from me you disgusting hag
i will not
the guards viciously restrain her forcing her mouth open
mortianna pours the blood red liquid down her throat
marian fights gagging and choking
until the drug takes its effect
she slumps forward
nottingham watches with amusement
to mortianna when we are married thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king
as you predicted
mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood
clasps the dice like runes
what do you see in the portents
mortianna rocks on her heels clutching her taloned hands to her sides
she chants fingering the bloody stones
the blood of the lion and the house of nottingham
she stares at nottingham her red eyes demented
if there is no union there will be darkness despair death
di not give me riddles woman
we are to be married within hours
how can we be in danger
the blood does not lie
shouting tell me how it will result
i have told you what i know
confound you crone
without my protection the people would hunt you down rip out your black heart and burn it
mortianna runs at him
points her bony finger at his heart
without me you are nothing
you are straw a fleabite a speck
as nottingham laughs laugh fool
i birthed you from this body
i stole a babe in this very castle and killed it so that you might rise in its place
you are my son
nottingham is too shocked to react together we are strong
now is not the time to doubt
now is the time to believe to be bold
the bold will prevail
masses stream in
they give wide berth to a celtic war rior in a boars head helmet
soldiers prod and harness the passing peasants
tuck drives a cartload of barrels
a guard stops him
what you got there father
the lords finest brew for the good nottinghams fighting men
it has a mighty kick
smiling ill warrant
wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out
holds his head high
soldiers hurl abuse the people are too cowed to show support
fanny glances at her son crosses herself and scurries into the castle unnoticed
on horseback encircled by guards the sheriff and his baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel amusement
a yell attracts nottingham
will is being shoved back by guards
my lord sheriff
i have word for you
of robin hood
nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards who rides over grabs will by the collar and drags him to his side
ah the turncoat
did you succeed
i found his lair but alas he still lives
the sheriff strikes down with his armored hand
stretch his neck with the others
hands yank will to his feet
dazed he tries to speak
disinterested nottingham turns away until he catches
will struggles to get free of his holders
call off your dogs
now where is he
i want your word in front of these witnesses
if i tell you i will go free
scoffs we will find him
he is concealed
he is going to free the prisoners and stop the wedding
nottinghams jaw tightens
eyes the prisoners the scaffold
put hood in my hands you go free
with the reward
ten thousand crowns
damn your worthless hide
just tell me where he is
the parade of prisoners reaches them
seeing will wulf charges at him screaming in blind rage
soldiers grab wulf
throw him down kicking and beating
voices in the crowd plead to let him be
someone tries to intervene gets hurled down
to will youll get your reward
where is he
tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his cargo of barrels
the crowd parts unwillingly
out of the way
make way for the lords business
across the square will points urgently in tucks direction
a massive oak stands near the southern wall
a large figure climbs to its uppermost branches
he scrambles from the tree starts to climb the wall itself
he slips frequently
the prisoners are led to the scaffold where the hooded executioner waits along with the chieftain
wulf staggers from his beating
nottinghams men encircle tucks cart
he watches them nervously
fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement
far below john clings to the outer wall
above him its sheer without footholds
the rope doesnt reach his fingertips
he stretches loses balance
desperately grabbing at the rope
he swings clinging by one arm his body smashing into the wall
will leads the sheriff to tucks cart
step down friar
as you wish sire
is there something amiss
this man claims you have outlaws concealed in these barrels
among them the cursed robin hood
tuck glares at will with unconcealed hatred
this man will rot in hell as a knave and a liar
these are libations for the celebration of your lordships nuptials
break one open
nervous why waste fine vintage my lord
a cask is shattered
wine torrents out
there are many barrels only a few outlaws
a drum roll
the sheriffs attention turns to the scaffold where the first victim is escorted up the steps wulf
tense tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes strikes a flame
john strains heaving his giant frame up the rope
he nears the top just as a sentry approaches
fanny blocks the mans view
what is your business woman
aint doin no arm mdear
likes a good angin i do
luvly view up ere aint it
she gestures below
the sentry looks then turns back to her
notices the rope
with all her might fanny rams his head into the stone battlement
he slumps unconscious
wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the noose
a hush falls
except for a rotund old woman who is barging to the front
and a wounded soldier his head bandaged who eases her path striking out with his tree branch crutch
give room for a fightin man and his ma
step aside or ill make ya
i wanna see the bastards walk on air
john struggles over the battlement
bout time ya gurt lug
she wrenches the longbow from his back fumbles for an arrow
we be too late
the scaffold is impregnable
celts and their chieftain guard the platform itself
the sherriffs men surround the base
the executioner encircles wulfs neck with the noose
tuck ignites a fuse cord leading to one of the barrels
a hand tightens the noose
another grasps an arrow
the executioners eyes glint through the slits
nottingham intently watches wulf
the chieftain stands impassive
fingers close on a bowstring
the fuse cord burns
wulf steps to the trap ready to plunge
his eyes close
an arrow flies
slices through the executioners eye slit
the executioner falls
little john celebrates
but the chieftain leaps forward
releases the trap
wulfs body plunges
the rope snaps tight
little john yells
a figure leaps onto the platform
the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch
wulf dangles strangling
his hands wrench at the choking cord
the burning fuse cord reaches the barrel
tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the sheriff
spotting it nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape
the chieftain smites at robin
his blow is blocked
by the celt with the boars head
the gunpowder in the barrel explodes
spewing smoke and wood
screams of panic
amidst the smoke
robins sword slashes through wulfs rope
he hauls him onto the platform
another figure on the platform
the old woman
slashes the ropes of the other prisoners
whips off her wig
he passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm
lets fight em
what happened to your stutter
a guard attacks hal fells him
take that ya mug
no stutter this time
the woodsmen join battle with the guards
the chieftain cudgels his celt attacker across the head
the boars head helmet tumbles
you dishonor the clan
aslan retreats fending off the chieftains shattering blows
john and fanny peer down as the smoke clears
they watch wulf struggle to his feet
a celt sneaks up behind him
grits his teeth
picks off the celt with a shaft
or dont fight at all
robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows kicking out slashing down
sends two celts hurtling down the trap hole
will battles the sheriff
a reprise of his own fight with robin the roles reversed
the sheriff armed and mounted flails at will who unarmed dodges in and around the horses legs
aslan and the chieftain are locked in mortal combat
aslan stumbles back and falls
the chieftain swipes at his head
aslan rolls aside
the sword smashes wood
tuck surrounded rolls another smoking barrel
it the greybeard baron spots little john and fanny on the parapet
no mercy shoot them
crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire
bolts ricochet all around little john and fanny
wulf guards the steps beating back all comers
aslan evades the charging chieftain
drop kicks a soldier takes his sword and whirls back at the chieftain
his blows have no effect on the scots black armor
the sheriff rears his horse
knocking will to his knees
the sheriff lunges
desperate will grasps the sword ignoring the pain
a tug of war
blood pours from wills hands where the blade cuts in
he suddenly lets go
nottingham topples from his horse
will leaps on him
pain or death you butcher
the sheriffs men drag will off before he can choke him
raging nottingham climbs to his feet
will is held by four men
heres another message to robin hood written in your blood
he drives his sword repeatedly insanely into wills belly
its over fool
you can kill my body but you cannot kill our spirit
he finally drops
nottingham heads for the castle
robin attempts to follow
he swings from the noose using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers
as he lands he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men
the chieftain knocks aslan down
aslan loses his sword
i am iron
i am rock
i am your death
aslan spots one of johns arrows protruding from a dead celts back
scrambles over and tears it out
you talk too much
rams the arrow through the chieftains mouthpiece
out the back of his neck
the chieftain grabs his helmet trying to rip it off
he topples his lifes blood gushing from both sides of his neck
aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior
i am not one of you yet i fight for you
against a tyrant
join me now
join robin hood
the onlookers are inspired
grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers many join the fray
nottingham runs through the castle gate
angry peasants pursue
lower the portcullis
a guard winds down the giant gate
nottingham hurls him aside
too slow fool
he hacks at the ropes
the gate slices down like a guillotine pinning soldiers and peasants alike
fighting his way towards the gate robin sees with dismay that the portcullis is closed
weakening he staves off the redhead barons vicious assault
suddenly peasants are swarming over his attacker
the baron is dragged off and trampled down
we must raise the gate
crossbow bolts fly
little john ducks and weaves while spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both sides
come on ya ckicken earted buggers
ya milksops ya bleedin pansies
he cant shoot fast enough
as they descend on him he leaps from the battlements onto a soldiers back
grabs his sword
excuse me m old cock
ya mind if i borrow this
hes backed up against a battlement outnumbered five to one
robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis
the sheriff marches through issuing orders
seal the entrance
guard it with your lives
bring the bishop to my chapel
surrounded by flickering candles marian sits before a mirror
in a white wedding gown
her eyes faraway lifeless in deep trance
mortianna sensuously combs the brides hair with her taloned fingers
the sheriffs face appears in the reflection
it is time for the union
the guards roughly haul marian to her feet
she is oblivious
once christian now blasphemously transformed to the practice of black magic
the crucifix on the altar is upside down
marian stands before it between the sheriff and mortianna
the bishop is dragged in
the battle sounds echo
they are rebelling
we must escape
when i am declared king that rabble will not dare go against us
is is madness to delay
mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the bishops outstretched hands
face them or face me
robin leaps onto tucks cart
light all the barrels tuck
robin snaps the reins steering the rumbling cart across the yard
bouncing in the back tuck lights barrels
fuses smoke and crackle
robin steers the wagon at the gate
at the last second he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horses back
the barrels explode
the portcullis is blown to kingdom come
out of the smoke robin rides the old nag like a charger
leads his cheering ragged fighters through the open gate
fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier
he grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire
desperate she grabs a poker and smashes him over the head
the servants stare in shock
a chef comes at fanny with a knife
hal and the others battle against huge odds
more peasants join them daring to take on the sheriffs hated men
aslans a whirlwind striking out in all directions
each blow for a cause
a door slams back
robin bursts through
alone against three attackers
he swings a soldier around
holds him as a shield using the mans own sword against his companions
in seconds all three are down and robin is off and running
down corridors searching
soldiers and armed servants converge to block his way
robin strikes vaults flings statues
up the stairs
topples a suit of armor down on his pursuers
grabbing a servant where is she
where is lady marian
the man refuses to speak
robin looks up the corridor sees six men guarding the private chapels arched door way
there is my answer
he hurls the man aside
the armed guards charge him
carrying a flaming torch tuck runs down the dark passage ways
before him an awesome sight
dozens of pitiful men in cages
suddenly he is confronted by the jailer
a cruel behemoth of a man carrying a spiked club
pious my son there is a holy war being waged outside
release all these wretches and god shall surely find you a place in heaven
id rather go to hell
tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest
sweating fearful the bishop rushes through the service
your bodies to be bound in immortal wedlock
do you marian dubois take
the chapel doors shatter inward
robin backs in bloodied fencing with four remaining soldiers
he smashes one by swinging the heavy door into him hurtles a pew at another
he springs off another pew taking down a third
its me robin
marian remains immobile
mortianna moves to her side
robin is struck in the thigh
like a vulture the sheriff waits
tiring blood pouring from his leg robin prepares to fight him
i warned you i would find you no matter what
you rush to your death for the sake of a woman
lust has turned you into a fool
recognize this locksley
he raises his sword to reveal its handle
a crucifix sculpted into the hilt
robins fathers sword
appropriate i should use it to kill you with dont you think
a savage accomplished swordsman with fire in his eyes
exhausted robin is driven back parrying desperately
tuck picks himself up from the floor
the jailer is amazed
the lord helps those who help themselves
grinning he pulls open his robes revealing chest armor and a miniature powder keg
he holds it to his flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer
stupified the man catches the smoking bomb
give my regards to the devil
the keg erupts blowing the jailer through a wall
john is in deep trouble but undaunted
ya gutless bloody sissies
someone attacks his assailants from the rear
the tide turns
i told ya to keep outa the fightin
couldnt help myself
well yall get a bloody good wallopin if we get ome
for now lets see how well i taught ya
wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet
a crossbow bolt strikes hal between his shoulder blades
the sheriffs soldiers are regaining the advantage
the peasants are giving up dropping their weapons
he sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards him
tuck leading a barefoot army
dozens of ragged prisoners armed with chains and torture implements
gods avengers are at hand
dying hal manages a weak smile
go bless ya tuck
tuck flails a chain at a celt
the man spins to strike back
the chef raises his knife
fanny appeals to the whole room
outside your countrymen rise against the sheriff
is there one man or woman here who does not hate him
who has not suffered at his hand
to the chef turn that on the sheriff and his bullies
a deadly pause
a woman cook dumps the giant wedding cake right over the chef
suddenly its havoc
flying food and cutlery
a full scale riot
the populace has turned
into the fray comes fanny little leading a rabble of servants and kitchen staff fighting with pots pans brooms knives hooks and bedpans
nottingham slashes maniacally
robin is cornered weakening
you should have stayed away locksley
fools like you never learn
a blow slices robins arm
his sword flies from his grasp
two of his men scramble back to their feet
robin is beat
a war cry
aslan followed by tuck
seeing aslan agh
the painted one
nottingham glances over
a split second opportunity
robin lashes out
kicks the sheriff in the gut chops down his sword hand
his fathers sword clatters to the floor
whirling swords in each hand aslan attacks the other men
robin pile drives nottingham into the wall
the bishop makes his escape
tuck blocks his path
you sold your soul to the devil
no i swear it in gods name
you accuse innocent men of druid worship while you practice the black arts yourself
the bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes
a taloned hand grips a spear
mortianna creeps up on aslan
glimpsing her watch out
screeching mortianna drives the spear into aslans side
he cries out and slides to the floor
nottingham uses robins distraction to regain his sword
back on the defensive robin tries to evade the blows
mortianna drags marian out onto a balcony
robin cannot pursue
in acute pain aslan struggles to his feet
grasping the spear where it enters his side he pulls with all his strength
the bishop concealed dagger in hand approaches tuck
innocently i am sure you would not strike a man of the cloth
without an eyeblinks pause tuck punches the bishop so hard he flies back through a stained glass window
mortianna hauls marian against the battlements
peers down at the battle
she spins in shock at aslans voice
what you fear is not below
he charges at her with the bloody spear
she screams hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest
her madness is superhuman
with strength beyond all reason she crawls up the spears shaft forcing it further through her body in her effort to get at him
clutching screeching hissing
her talons groping at his face aslan strains to the last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle ments
with an ear splitting shriek she plummets to the ground
sword raised nottingham has robin backed against the altar
what can your puny god do for you now
the blade comes whirring down
robin has the altars crucifix in his hand
he swings it again slamming nottingham across the temple
the sheriff hits the floor
robin grabs his fathers sword
raises it two fisted
nottingham tries to squirm away
this is for my father
he drives the sword down like a stake right through nottinghams heart
the man shudders and is still
robin stands over him
tuck rushes outside
kneels at aslans side
robin spots marian swaying on the edge of the steep parapet
robin grabs marian pulling her back
carefully lifts her face
her lifeless eyes suddenly flash
she lashes out
let me go
who are you
restraining her im your sworn protector
any way i see fit
robin emerges from the castle
draped over his shoulder marian is kicking and beating at him
he reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into the freezing water
she leaps to her feet yelling
slips and tumbles back
water streams from her bridal gown
a crowd gathers enjoying the show
oh god is that you
she stumbles out of the fountain
and storms at him pounding her fists on his chest
how dare you
robin grins at the crowd
i think shes feeling better
marian looks about her
the chaotic aftermath of battle
reality gradually sinks in
she folds against robins chest
little john arrives his huge arms enfolding wulf and fanny
we done it mate
we clobbered the buggers
are you urt
it will mend
he spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of aslan
his smile fades
he runs over
cradles aslans head
aslan my friend
im going home the easy way robin
shaking aslan you die on me you son of satan and i swear ill bury you as a christian in st
catherines cathedral with a thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul
you hear me
weakly i have no strength brother tuck
kicking him a fine friend you are
by the grace of allah and jehovah we have won the day and you want to give up the ghost
ill pickle your remains in mead lay you in your grave with a pig for a companion and mark it with a cross as big as this castle
it hurts when i laugh
theres life in the heathen dog yet
laughs here tuck
look after him
you deserve each other
robin stands marian joins him
around them cheering grows till the whole crowd is in unison
a voice echoes from the vaulted roof
a wedding is in progress
by the power vested in me by gods holy church i now pronounce you husband and wife
tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple
you may kiss the bride
the husband draws back the brides veil
robin and marian
we waste good celebration time
they break the embrace turn to the congregation and start down the aisle
they pause at the front pew where king richard and members of his court are sitting
robin bows marian curtsies
may i kiss the bride
who would dare refuse his kings request
kissing marians cheek you look radiant cousin
we are deeply honored by your majestys presence
it is i who am honored lord locksley
thanks to you i still have a throne
they continue down the aisle past the smiling congre gation
waiting by the door is aslan
he and robin embrace
whispers my friend a word of advice
ride her better than your horse
wedding bells peal
robin and marian step out into the sunlight
the crowd cheers
at a signal from little john the ex outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the sky
