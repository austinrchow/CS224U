written by peter morgan from the novel by david peace heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights of elland road stadium home to leeds united football club
sheets of angry yorkshire rain
flashlights pop as don revie late s the most successful manager in english football walks out in front of a pack of newspaper and tv reporters
he is flanked by the chairman of leeds united manny cussins s and several other white haired blazer wearing members of the board
im just going to make a brief statement
caption july th revie stands under a large trophy cabinet filled with the silverware he has won
reporters wait intimidated
revie contd yesterday afternoon at
i accepted the fas offer to become the next manager of the england national football team
a gasp among the journalists
a burst of flashlights
the board members look down at the floor in silence
bereaved fathers losing their favourite son
revie contd obviously that involves me leaving leeds united after happy and successful years which makes me very sad
id like to think i have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family
however when one man goes another steps into his place
i know who i think that person should be the man to replace me and i shall make my feelings clear to the directors
no further comments
revie turns and walks out a volley of reporters shouting questions
were in a car
tarmac passes beneath us
over this the sound of a flat teeside voice singing along with frank sinatra on the radio
fly me to the moon
two young boys stare out of car windows
raindrops on the panes of glass
their father brian clough slick modern cocky handsome
about as big a contrast to don revie as its possible to find is up front
singing and let me play among the stars
when are we there
any moment now
on the right
singing let me see what spring is like
the car turns a bend and suddenly the floodlights and stands of a football stadium come into view
the boys eyes widen
there it is
there it is
the boys smile in excitement
on jupiter and mars
leeds united football club written on the side of the stadium
clough smiles then puts his foot down
the car accelerates past the turning
the boys smiles fade
where are you going
youve missed it
weve something else to do first
wont take long
singing clo ugh contd in other words hold my hand
in other words darling kiss me
the music continues as the car drives on turning into the music of a television program
the calender front title sequence a yorkshire tv current affairs program
were in a tv studio
the presenter is today we welcome brian clough as he starts his new job as manager of leeds united taking over from don revie the most successful manager in the
clubs history under whom leeds have won everything
not quite everything
not won the european cup
but pretty much everything else
not at all austin
looking forward to it
the biggest challenge of your life and youll be without peter taylor for the first time
your lifelong professional colleague
yes petes at brighton now
he had the opportunity to come with me but brighton was his choice
leeds was mine
a surprising choice some might say
because youve been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years
youve accused players of dirty tactics cheating dissent foul play
you called norman hunter norman bites yer legs hunter youve said peter lorimer falls when no one touches him
and i was right
why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long
goodness its going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start
laughter from the camera crew
clough contd football is a beautiful game austin
it needs to be played beautifully
i think leeds have sold themselves short
cloughs interview continues on a tv in a sitting room where it is being watched by don revie sitting in an armchair
theyve been champions but theyve not been good champions in the sense of wearing the crown well
theyve not been loved
but then thats hardly surprising given the type of operation theres been in place there
football clubs are like families footballers are sensitive people
id like to bring a little warmth into the set up
that type of operation
i presume youre referring to don revie
revie continues to watch the tv
who has long been regarded as a father figure in leeds
and now youre coming in as the outsider the enemy even after all the things youve said in public coming in and taking ouver as stepfather
mitchell looks up at clough
dont you expect some degree of resentment to this
i would accept and expect a strangeness initially its perfectly normal
but it wont be long before they realise im a fair man
a kind man
and maybe under me they can experience what its like to be in a happy family after all
how can you be sure they werent happy with don all along
they wouldnt have played football that way if they were happy
don revies eyes burn with indignation
he picks up a telephone and angrily starts to dial
here they are
the leeds players
long hair and long faces
out on the practice pitch
in the rain
some doing warm up exercises
others milling dangerously in groups
their names on their purple track suits
cloughs car pulls up
he and his sons get out
a few waiting press
a few fans with autograph books
where have you been boss
jimmy gordon clough loyal trainer his face creased with anxiety
directors have been waiting more than an hour
jimmy gordon leads clough past the training pitch
clough looks out
lovely yorkshire weather
gestures shivering i tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to majorca
the players stare in silence
squinting in the drizzle
condensation coming from their mouths
johnny giles stares
billy bremner spits and continues talking disrespectfully
clough contd not much of a welcome was it
and not so much as a smile from johnny giles
youre five days late
and did you really need to say that about majorca
beat changing the subject you know he was revies first choice for getting your job
clough looks over at giles who turns away resumes training
clough contd was he now
dons son and heir
his first born
youre never going to get any love from him
bremner a flint eyed scot stares at clough
heres to happy fucking families
jimmy gordon leads clough and his boys down a corridor where countless photographs of don revie hang on the walls
they pass an open door with a sign outside manager
looks at the sign
then pushes open the door
clough walks into the managers office
the empty chair
the bare desk
clough takes a seat in the chair
presently a middle aged matron jean reid don revies faithful secretary for years appears in the doorway
any chance of a cup of tea duck
theyre waiting for you
clough swings his feet on the desk
for the board meeting
let them wait
now how about that cup of tea
clough smiles sweetly but jean stares at clough
she pointedly doesnt move
clough lowers his feet
clough contd all right ill go then
wouldnt want to get off on the wrong foot
clough walks over to the door
looks at the desk
clough contd whos desk is that love
i didnt put it there did mr
lets get rid of it then shall we
the whole bloody lot
think it would be best if there were nothing of his left here
clough reaches the door
clough contd were you his secretary
for thirteen happy years
whats your name pet
in which case no offence duck but theres nothing i want typed on paper from you other than your resignation
clough contd and you can change the locks on your way out
dont want the ghost of troubled don popping in now do we
rattling his chains
scaring my young ones
clough puts his arms protectively round the boys and leads them out of the door
jean reid stares visibly shaken
half a dozen white haired patriarchs sit at a large table
matching blazers and matching brass
manny cussins sam aldermen and rotary club members
masons and businessmen
clough enters the boardroom
indicates to jimmy gordon to look after the boys outside
inside matching curtains and carpets
come in brian
clough sits down at the head of the table
rubs his hands together
no one going to offer me a drink
like an undertakers in here
the directors shoot looks at one another
why did you do it
for yorkshire tv
weve had a phone call
not so much a phone call
they only went and rung him
and ran some of your quotes by him
about how unhappy the players were
what bad champions
looking for a response
shudders to himself bloody got one as well
hes gone berserk
he had it coming
he shouldnt have done that piece in the mirror should he
saying he thought i was a daft choice
hes entitled to his opinions
and im entitled to mine
barks flame on and im entitled to mine
the room falls silent
that got everyones attention
cussins contd i hired you to do this job because i think youre the best young manager in the country
im the best old one too
i also did it under the assumption that youd be coming here wanting the best for the club
for the city of leeds
so why do i still get the feeling this is all about you and don
of course its just about me and don
always has been
but instead of putting frowns on your foreheads o ye elders of leeds in your blazers and brass fucking buttons it should put big white colgate smiles on your big
white faces because it means i wont sleep and wont eat until i take whatever that mans achieved and beaten it beaten it so i never have to hear the name don fucking revie again beat it so the only name anyone sings in their yorkshire ale houses raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths is brian clough
brian clough uber fucking alles
the blazers and brass buttons white haired elders of leeds stare at one another
clough sits glued to a wireless in his front room
ladies and gentlemen the draw for the third round of the fa cup will now commence
cloughs eyes widen he calls out to the others
number twenty two
derby county second division
here we go
peter taylor seven years older than clough his closest friend his only true friend appears breathlessly in the doorway back from a fish and chips run
followed by barbara cloughs wife and the three children
on tv the blazer wearing elder calls into the microphone
against mighty leeds united
clough and taylor cry out in shock
don revies leeds
top of division one
here we bloody come
the telephone rings
clough picks it up
clough contd already knowing itll be what do you say to that mr
its sam longson chairman of derby county s looks like krushchev cue ball head voice like a power drill a tough haulage millionaire
i can hear the cash registers now
happy days sir
youre not wrong brian
take the family out for a meal
go to the mumtaz

clough hangs up the phone
put the fish and chips in the bin
tonights on uncle sam
were going posh
chicken fucking bhuna in town
everyone starts putting on their coats
clough stands with two men in overalls indicating a fading visitors sign
right you two i want billy bremner and johnny giles to be able to read indicates door frames and this woodwork has seen better days
crash the following morning clough bursts through swing doors and into corridors with the cleaners
spick and span understand
wash these walls down
give the floors a proper polish
clough inspects the pitch with the head groundsman
i want it perfect
like a fucking carpet
weve got proper footballers coming
who know how to keep the ball on the deck
well you cant fucking train on it then
the derby players train on a football pitch in a public park
clough turns to taylor
you know hell be making a file on us
prepares a file on every game
leaves nothing to chance
knows every opponents formations
ive heard hes a superstitious twat
calling out ey
help him someone help him
we grew up just a few streets apart you know
in middlesborough close to ayrsome park
hell have known my street valley road probably bought sweets from garnetts factory where my dad worked
heard he wears the same suit to every game
his lucky blue suit
tay lor contd and he doesnt care for ornamental birds
cmon whos covering him
the best manager in the country don revie
played for sunderland like me as a centre forward like me and england like me
shouting out cmon give it and go
peas in a pod me and don
two peas in a fucking pod
clough in early
in shirtsleeves sweeping corridors
straightens photos on the wall
clough polishing the sign visitors on the dressing room door
clough on his knees scrubbing cleaning baths in the visiting teams washrooms
clough puts on his suit
ties his tie
he takes a bottle of vintage red wine from a cupboard
he places the bottles on his desk
then puts two cut crystal glasses on his desk
his and dons
a flicker of jealousy on peter taylors face almost like a wife hurt that his friend is making such an effort for someone else
a knock on the door
jimmy gordon appears in the doorway
a confused look well almost
clough rushes out of the doors straightening his cuffs straightening his hair buttoning his jacket
first out to greet the arriving team
he turns the corner to see the leeds coach a hundred yards down the street the players getting off the coach and walking towards him
what are they doing
theyve run out of petrol
no its that superstition isnt it
every away cup ties revie makes them walk the last hundred yards
taylor mutters under his breath soppy twat
clough cranes his neck
watches don revie s
severe forbidding intimidating in a huddle with his coaching staff les cocker and syd owen
his right and left hand
clough walks towards him
welcome to derby don
pleasure to meet you
im brian clough
but revie walks past without shaking hands without talking without even breaking stride
and disappears into the stadium deep in conversation with les cocker and syd owen
hand still outstretched
he looks over at peter taylor who cant help smiling forget it
taylor and jimmy gordon walk off but clough still stares at revie in disbelief
the leeds players run out onto the pitch hunter madely bremner giles reaney jones in a line waving to the crowd turning north south east west
aa taylor rubs his hands in excitement here we go
but clough is miles away
still cannot let the insult go
he stares over at the visiting team dug out
revie and his lieutenants
whispering among themselves
huddled in thought
huddled in strategy
huddled in malevolence
presently the game starts
a roar from the crowd
beeeep the refs whistle blows
a derby player rolls in agony cries out a terrible cynical challenge
horrified jimmy gordon and peter taylor up on thier feet in protest
clough looks over to revies bench
sees revie and syd owen quietly applauding the leeds player
encouraging more of the same
as the derby player is stretchered off
presently rrrooooaaaarrrrr goes up
revie and his henchmen get to their feet
taylor and jimmy gordon immediately start shouting out encouragement to the derby players new instructions as the game restarts
taylor contd cmon keep your shape
close him down
now sent it out wide
clough doesnt join in
he continues to stare at revie in his dugout
clough leaps off the bench in outrage
screaming on his feel protesting in disbelief
he didnt fucking touch him
he fucking dived
revie shaking hands with his colleagues
smiling amongst themselves
the inevitable roar as leeds convert followed by beeeeeep the sound of the final whistle
clough stares in disbelief
the referee blows the whistle for the end of the game
clough watches as revie and syd owen brush past shaking peter taylor and jimmy gordons hands assuming taylors the manager on their way to the dressing rooms their minds already
on their next game
clough stares as they go
aa the two empty glasses waiting on the table
didnt say good bye
or pay me the respect of staying for a drink
couldnt wait to get away
through the front door we see don revie syd owen and les cocker walking to their bus chuckling to themselves deep in discussion already thinking about the next match
bloody cheats and all
neither of those goals should have been allowed
but clough doesnt hear
just going to have to beat them pete
beat him its the last thing i do
we need to get into the same division first
we need someone with a good head
our lot were like headless chickens out there today
clough turns to taylor
first thing monday morning i want you to go and find me that player
a wise head
taylor opens his mouth is about to protest
clough contd and dont worry about the money
thats my problem
just you go and find him
cloughs face watching the leeds players board the bus
cloughs face staring out at the leeds players waiting on the training pitch
a deep breath
better go and make myself known
clough removes his jacket
jimmy gordon and cloughs sons watch as he walks out onto the training pitch
clough walks out into the drizzle and towards the leeds up beat clapping hands all right gentlemen gather around please
the players truculently gather round
clough watches them notes their mood then
clough contd i might as well tell you now
clo ugh contd you lot may all be internationals and have won all the domestic honours there are to win under don revie but as far as im concerned the
first thing you can do for me is to chuck all your medals and all your caps and all your pots and all your pans into the biggest fucking dustbin you can find because youve never won any of them fairly
youve done it all by bloody cheating
silence from the players
clough contd mr
youre the captain
and a good one
but youre no good to the team and youre no good to me if youre suspended
i need you fit for every game and i want good clean attractive football from my captain
setting an example
clough turns to peter lorimer
clough contd mr
lorimer i hope you were listening because youre as good a footballer as ive ever seen but you know how i feel about the way don let you harangue referees
fall over when youve not been touched protesting and pointing trying to get other players booked
well have no more of that
clough turns to johnny giles
clough contd and you irishman
god gave you skill intelligence and the best passing ability in the game
what god did not give you was six studs to wrap around another players knee
i dont know what youre talking about
clough turns to norman hunter
but you do though bites yer legs
people kick me i kick them back
not with me as manager
do that on my watch youll be fined and stuck in the reserves
to all the players things are going to be a little different around here
might feel a little strange at first
might pinch a little
like a new pair of shoes
but if you want your grandchildren to remember you for being something other than the dirty buggers you all were if you want to be loved as real champions worthy
champions youre going to have to work
nods to jimmy gordon now lets start off by playing some seven a sides
players stare at one another
don never did that
well im not don
and from now on i never want to hear that mans name again
next player who mentions it or what he did or didnt bloody do in the good ol days will spend a week cleaning my boots
clapping hands seven a side
keep it nice and clean and sensible
no fifty fiftys
clough sees that one side is a man short
clough contd right ill play myself
you might learn something irishman
two hundred and fifty one goals in two hundred and seventy four starts
clough skillfully traps the ball between his feet flips it up onto this head down onto his chest then wham volleys it into a distant goal
clough contd like to see don fucking revie do that eh
clough removes his track suit trousers rolls his neck
jimmy gordon quickly divides the players into two teams blows the whistle
the game starts
clough leading by example anxious to prove himself is soon darting about calling out
clough contd clapping hands here son
keep it simple
think and give
on the deck
nice and crisp
yes to me sniffer
clarke passes the ball
but its a fifty fifty
another player bears down on clough
who refuses to pull out
crunch a bone shaking tackle from bites yer legs
clough contd oh jeeeeeesussss
clough is flattened
rolls around on the floor
jimmy gordon runs up to norman hunter
fucking matter with you
he said no fifty fiftys
hunter aggressively steps forward
nose to nose
he is immediately flanked by other aggressive leeds players
crowding the referee
what are you going to do about it
jimmy gordon backs off visibly frightened
clough lies on the floor
holding his knee
clough listens to the players laughing at him
his face darkens
mimicking two hundred and fifty one goals in two hundred and seventy four starts
the sound of coarse cruel laughter among the leeds players
jimmy gordon appears cloughs two sons in tow
ive got what you were looking for
jimmy holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper
cloughs expression changes
what about the petrol
in the boot of the car
clough limps down a corridor
in a thunderous mood
holding the parcel
the door flies open
clough storms into his office
he walks over to the desk
don revies desk
he unwraps the parcel and takes out an axe
cloughs sons watch as their father violently swings the axe down onto the desk
the sickening sound of splintering wood
clough watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside
manny cussins and several directors walk out
they are surprised to see clough by the fire holding an axe
everything all right
sunny waving with the axe fine thank you mr
clough smiles politely then turns and walks to his car
the directors watch
rrrriiinnnggg the phone rings
clough and his family are having sunday lunch
barbara clough looks up
not now love please
the phone rings
clough tries to ignore it
but it might be pete
rolls eyes of course its pete
rrrriiinnngggg clough tries to eat then
but it might be important
to nigel cmon eat your carrots
for your mother
clough gets up
walks out of the room
peter taylor similarly in disgrace with his family similarly unable to go a single sunday lunch without calling clough whispers down the phone terrified of his wife
you asked me to find a player with a good head
whispering furtive ive found one
hes a hundred and fucking fifty
i admit hes not young
hes old as fucking time
but hes clever keeps the ball well
and passes it better than anyone alive
a voice calls from taylors dining room
looks left and right hes the one brian
never been more sure of anything in my life
all right ill talk to longson in the morning
we havent got until morning
hearts have already made him an offer
want him as their manager
apparently theyve already agreed terms
well what did you fucking call me for then
because when i asked bill nick how done the deal was he said ninety nine per cent
meaning he hasnt signed
barbara clough rolls her eyes puts down her cutlery and calls out
all right brian
come back now
barbara tuts to herself
gets up from the table
she walks out of the dining room calling out
barbara contd cmon thats enough
and into the hall
she looks left and right
clough and taylor emerge from a roadside cafe and walk towards their car
theyve missed sunday lunch
so its crisps
happier in one anothers company than with their own families
where would we play him
in the middle of the park
somewhere he can see everything use his loaf and tell the kids what to do
well play him as a sweeper then
eating crisps aye
they climb into the waiting car
wont have to run about too much
and whats all this i hear about a tie shop
hes got a tie shop hasnt he
which he spends two days a week at
clough starts the engine
fucking tie shop
its his nest egg
for the future
no ones going to be wearing fucking ties in twenty years time
clough and taylor both giggle
the car pulls off
clough contd hope his footballing brain is better than his business brain
cloughs car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced road in north london
taylor checks it against the address on a piece of paper
the two men get out of the car
you know its illegal
to sign someone on the sabbath
immediately cautious then perhaps we should just shake on it today
and sign tomorrow
and let hearts in again in the morning
producing contracts im not leaving here without a signature
clough and taylor walk up the garden path
clough contd youd bloody do that too wouldnt you
come all this way then just shake hands
shaking head dear oh dear
what would you do without me
hey you would never have found him if it werent for me
clough stops rings the doorbell
looks at taylor
good job were both wearing ties
snap the door opens to reveal dave mackay a thick set dark haired bull of a man with a thick scots accent
clough smiles ear to ear
clough contd jehovas witness dave
may the lord be with you
who the bloody hell are you
my names brian clough and i once had the pleasure of playing for england against you in an under match
i remember you now
you had a black eye a right bloody shiner
a beat and never stopped fucking talking
what are you doing here
come to talk to you about the promised land dave
land of milk and honey
its a little place up the m called derby
a beat may we come in
clough taylor and jimmy gordon training with the derby players
sam longson late s chairman of derby county approaches visibly angry
you dont look happy uncle sam
what were you thinking
going over my head like that
why didnt you call
because youd have said no
bloody right id have said no
the mans bloody crocked
pete reckons hes good for three more years

thatd be messrs
mcgovern and ohare
almost passing out where did they come from
my old stomping grounds
hartlepools and sunderland
very reasonable too
clough contd just doing whats best for the club
thatd be my club brian
flash dave mackay john mcgovern and john ohare wearing derby strip poses under the derby county sign for photographs with clough and taylor
clough and taylor watch from the touchline as their new team led by mackay plays in a match
clough watches in admiration
youre a genius pete
how did you see it
on the training ground dave mackay barrel chested and older voice like a bullhorn is already bossing about the young players urging them to think
it was just obvious
mcgovern in midfield mackay at the back ohare up front
the skewer isnt it
in the shish kebab
clough watches mackay passing the ball creating space
a thing of fucking beauty
clough grabs taylors head kisses him
over this we fade in the roar from the crowd
clough and taylor leap to their feet
clough and taylor leap to their feet
clough and taylor leap to their feet
of derby winning the championship
of news stations announcing it in the midlands
a large swanky house as befits the multi millionaire owner of a successful haulage business
sam longson brian clough peter taylor and dave mackay are all celebrating with all their families
the trophy is centre stage
clough sings a sinatra classic
love and marriage love and marriage its an institute you cant disparage
to everyones amusement clough sings to peter taylor not his own wife
clough contd try try try to separate them its an illusion
try try try and you will only come to this conclusion
in another corner mackay is amiably ribbing longson
the mans crocked older than time broken more bones than evel knievel
all right i admit it i was wrong
longson starts eating his trademark felt hat
much cheering as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty
suddenly dave mackay looks up sees the television
calls for quiet
on tv a live awards presentation
don revie is being presented with an award
for leeds to win the first division title and for me to be named as english manager of the year
feels like a dream come true
his expression changes
his eyes burn into revies
you enjoy it don
go home put your feet up and fucking enjoy it
theres a good lad
because well be in the first division next season
and were going to have you
loud cheers from longson taylor mackay and clough
over this we fade in the sound of roaring
archive tv footage wembley stadium on charity shield day
the opening of the season
the twin towers of wembley stadium the cathedral of english football on a glorious late summers day
good afternoon everyone its the charity shield the opening saturday of the season and a first chance to get a look at brian cloughs leeds
don revie is being interviewed by a tv journalist in sheepskin coat and headphones
will you be supporting leeds today don
youd expect nothing less having been their manager for years
but the fact is im here today as manager of england
do you have any advice to give your successor brian clough before his first game
a mischievous smile barely perceptible of revies face
the people of leeds are used to winning
clough with the leeds team in the dressing room before kick off
the stink of ralgex
physios bandaging the injured
jimmy gordon massaging one or two players
right the team for today is harvey in goal reaney cherry bremner mcqueen hunter lorimer clarke jordan giles gray
clough folds a piece of paper
a flicker of vulnerability
clough contd obviously all eyes will be on us to see how things have changed
what might be different under me
lets show them some of the things weve been working on
our changes in attitude too
our new outlook
a beat lets see some of you playing with a smile
team talk over the players put on their shoes
make final preparations
the two teams are limbering up in the tunnel
clough takes his place ahead of billy bremner
of course it goes without saying id like you to continue as club captain
bremner continues to limber up
clough contd you know son ive nothing but the highest regard for you as a player
they players get the instruction to walk out towards the roar of the crowd
clough contd in fact i wrote you a card saying as much
did you not get it
the roar of the crowd grows louder
clough contd saying how excited i was to be taking this job
how much i thought we could achieve together
and inviting you and your family down to our place in calla major any time you like
never got it
they walk out into the roar of the crowd
don revie sits in the stadium watching as clough leads his leeds players out
fans screaming and shouting
a stony faced bremner behind him
cloughs face in close up
singing the national anthem
he sees revie in the crowd
all around them archive footage belting out god save the queen
but there might as well not be
its just revie and clough
archive footage the national anthem finishes
a great roar goes up
the game is underway
match commentators can hardly believe what they are seeing we catch snippets of flickering archive footage on their monitors
kevin keegan goes to ground
rolling around on the pitch
that almost looked like johnny giless fist made contact with kevin keegans face
the referees pulled out his book
now a fight has broken out
on the pitch bremner and keegan have started fighting
billy bremner of leeds and kevin keegan of liverpool have come to blows
clough watches from the dug out
unable to believe his eyes
for fucks sake
the referee is talking to his linesman
hes sending them off
the referee is sending off both players
billy bremner walks off angrily removing his shirt
archive footage liverpool lift the cup aloft
delirious cheering from their fans
the leeds coach had pulled up and the players are all having a piss break
among them clough
over his shoulder because losing wasnt enough was it
you only had to be the first englishman to be sent off at wembley
our camera widens to reveal billy bremner pissing in line with norman hunter and johnny giles
through gritted teeth not fucking english
there i am making a big song and dance to the media about our new approach
our new attitude
our new ethics
and you turn the place into fucking verdun
clough shakes himself dry
clough contd what am i going to do if they suspend you
youre my best player
i tell you ive a mind to fine you two weeks wages
you cant do that
revie always paid all our fines
well hes not fucking here now is he
no hes not
bremner giles and hunter turn
walks back towards the bus
bremner contd mores the fucking pity
don revies face he watches through a window in elland road as
the derby coach arrives
hydraulic brakes hisssssss
boots shoes walk down steps
brian clough peter taylor and the derby army disembark
cloughs face as he looks up at the writing on the side of the stadium
leeds united f
some players getting dressed
clough taylor and jimmy gordon massaging others
right last time there was a whole division between you and leeds
today were here as second division champions and equals with leeds
john mcgovern and billy bremner equals
kevin hector and johnny giles equals
alan hinton and peter lorimer john ohare and paul madely
now cmon chins up
we can take this fucking lot
the players clatter out studs rattling down the tunnel into the roar of the crowd
clough and taylor in a deserted bar
a television plays in the corner
don revies face on tv
obviously its a terrific achievement for derby being promoted to the first division but the truth is leeds united have an unfortunate habit of reminding them just how far they
still have to go
but hes right
they made us look like fools today
and what was john ohare doing
letting madeley bully him like that
clo ugh contd push him around
madeleys half his bloody size
ohare needs to toughen up
hes from scottish dockyards isnt he
and what about john mcgovern
he was useless in the middle
whos idea was that
he was all over the place
like the wandering jew
giving the ball to anyone but his own
we need a ball player a natural in midfield
wholl hold onto it
were giving it away too easily
someone like colin todd
sharp intake oooh now youre talking
lovely pair of feet
ive heard he wants out of sunderland too
theyre all jumping ship up there
clough thinks for a moment then
well go on then
longsons already told us
clubs in debt
bollocks to that
ive not brought us all the way to the first division just to sit there mid table and be cannon fodder for sides like leeds
sign the man
hang on hang on careful
ill handle bloody longson
clough is working a session with the derby players
a car screeches into the car park behind
a red faced apoplectic sam longson gets out
a hundred and seventy grand
for colin fucking todd
correction the almighty colin todd
the best technical footballer in the country
a salary of three hundred quid a week
you cant pay a footballer that
thats the way things are going uncle sam
footballs all about money now
i told you never to go over my head again
had no choice
windows opened up
you were in the bloody west indies
you mean there were others
gemmell and hennessy
two players turn and wave to longson
eyes popping apoplectic for fucks sake
let me ask you a question uncle sam
what did you come into football for
to support the football club in my home town
the club ive supported all well im sure we all admire your loyalty
what i didnt come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the north east
but the way i see it theres no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best and be the best and thats all the people of
to see their team on top of the tree derby derby uber alles and if its really their interest you have at heart not just impressing your friends in the
directors box i suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques theres a good lad
leave the running of this football club to the professionals
but professionals dont run the club brian the chairman does
and if its true that football is all about money and thats the way its going thats suits us chairmen just fucking fine
because were the ones whove got it
sam longson lights a cigar and walks off
the leeds coach pulls into the derby car park
don revie and syd owen disembark
followed by the leeds players
long haired assassins one and all
clough and taylor watch from an upstairs corridor window
see theyve driven all the way into the car park this time
its not a cup game is it
clough and taylor look at one another nutter
an atmosphere of expectation and excitement
outside the sound of the crowd
the sound of tannoy announcements
clough goes to john mcgovern
you know what your job is today
stay in position
keep the shape
stop being the wandering jew
and enjoy it
you deserve to
youve worked hard this week
clough moves to john ohare
clough contd clear about what youre doing today
any chance i get flatten paul fucking madely
he bullies you you bully him back
and near post for the corners we worked on
clough moves to another player
his new signing colin todd understand what i want from you today son
smiles i should mr
its simple enough
go on lets hear it
to be colin fucking todd the best technical footballer in the country
laughter in the dressing room
there how could you forget that
now come on
clapping hands up and at em
clough holds the door open shaking each and every one of the players hands as they clatter out into the tunnel
clough sits in his dug out
while jimmy gordon and taylor are calling out instructions to the derby players on the pitch
clough stares at revie and his lieutenants in their neighbouring dug out
cloughs view and our frame is filled by two wheel chairs carrying disabled learning difficulties fans wearing rosettes
the wheel chair fan looks at clough for a beat then violently shakes a rattle
cloughs face shocked
then all of a sudden
rrrrroooooooaaaaaarrrrrr a roar goes up
revie and his henchmen leap to their feet delighted
the wheel chair fan screams with delight
makes a wanker gesture in cloughs face
cloughs face darkening like thunder
the derby players sit in the dressing room
trying to hide find shelter find protection
already fearing the rocket they will get the lash of his tongue
presently the door opens and clough walks in carrying a bottle of brandy remy martin
that was as perfect a half of terrible football as ive ever seen
the plan youve obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat so you deserve a little celebration
clough pours brandy into a tea cup gives it to a player
clough contd you do want me to get the sack
then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player johnny fucking giles
i didnt see him
clough turns to another player john ohare pours him a shot of cognac
you want me to get the sack mr ohare
that open goal
looked like a deliberate fucking miss to me
a miss to get your manager the sack
clough turns to a third player colin todd hands him a cup
clough contd you do want me to get the sack mr
the amount of bloody money i paid for you i must have been out of my mind
you cant even keep on your feet
clough turns and faces the room
youve all done a terrific job of getting me the sack
so im not letting you out of here for the second half until youve finished the bottle
the players stare at one another holding their drinks
clough contd the players nervously down their drinks
clough walks out to see peter taylor and jimmy gordon waiting who were listening through the door
you cant do that
just you fucking watch me
clough storms off
peter taylor is left alone
momentarily holds his chest
you all right
taylor indicates jimmys cigarettes
taylor contd giz a fag
the derby players run out belching watched and encouraged by peter taylor
jimmy gordon emerges from the dressing room holding the empty bottle of scotch
to taylor wheres he gone now
clough pacing in his office
unable to watch
like an expectant father
presently the building reverberates with a large
but scored by whom
derby or leeds
clough looks up at the clock
the clock on the wall shows its
visibly anxious clough starts pacing again
presently another deafening
the building is almost brought to its foundations
clough looks up
desperate to know
derby or leeds
but its only
game still not over
not by a long way
clough carries on pacing
walks from one side of the room to the next
left to right
right to left
then another stadium shaking
clough looks up at the clock
this is intolerable
the game must be over now
clough cannot bear it a moment longer
he opens the door
clough walks down a corridor
then checks himself
but still walks as fast as he can
clough turns a corner to the dressing rooms and the tunnel then sees peter taylor up ahead entering the tunnel from the pitch with several derby players
taylor looks up
their eyes meet
words are not necessary
taylors smile says it all
clough runs towards taylor
the two men embrace
oh brian you should have seen his first
turns bremner inside out nutmegs madeley for good measure
it was beautiful
youd think hed been born in rio de janeiro not aber bloody deen
clough and taylor walk off down the corridor
taylor contd what made you go for the brandy
they were just nervous
you could tell
youre a bloody genius
i tell you what bri if we can beat this lot we can go all the way
derby win against ipswich town derby win against sheffield united derby beat huddersfield town a newsreader announces that derby county have won the first division championship
the derby players celebrate in a communal bath holding the trophy drinking champagne
spraying one another with water
clough taylor and roy macfarland hold aloft a large trophy travelling on board an open top bus through derby
the whole town has taken to the streets
clough still celebrating and still surrounded by players and fans derby county winning the championship is a victory for decency for honesty and for football
because they dont pull shirts or nudge people in the back in the box
clo ugh contd they dont protest every decision chop hack or bully unlike some teams i could mention beginning with the letter l
clough contd if you ask me the best thing for british football the quickest way to clean it up would be fore dirty sides like leeds to be sent down
for a spell in division two
don revie speaking to journalists outside his home
i havent personally heard mr
cloughs comments but they have been reported to me and our solicitors are looking into them
if i could offer mr
clough some advice
i think hed be better off keeping his opinions to himself
some of these allegations against leeds united and his fellow professionals are an absolute disgrace
clough appearing on half a dozen tv shows
quick controversial charismatic witty
a natural media star we intercut our actor with the genuine archive footage don revie
shudders playfully dont mention that name to me
its really like the other house of commons
you hate to mention him
i hate to mention him why
because hes a very talented man and i dont like him
the audience laughs
clough contd hes a very very talented man and his record is unsurpassable
but i just happen not to like him
and i dont like the way he goes about football either
football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who dont like the way you do your bit
aa and er
it makes the game go round
half the country dont like a labour government
it just happens that the other half do
why dont you want me to ask why you dont like him
because i cant tell you
wed get closed down david
john sadler pipe smoking football journalist sits in a television studio calender
brian youve been called big headed arrogant brash the lot by your profession john yeah
and a whole of it right too
and a whole lot of it wrong
ill concede that
so how would you define your approach to management apart from being brilliant
laughing rubbing eye good lad
thank you for the compliment
its very very difficult when you get asked a question like that
david coleman black and white footage speaking into a bakolite telephone
youve achieved something here that most managers struggle for years to achieve this
its come to you very young
are you surprised
ab clough sits at home his son on his lap
but more than surprised delighted
its nice isnt it
for the good guys to win for once
which for you was the most important match to win and the best performance from your point of view
beating leeds united obviously
always a particular pleasure that
brian youve also done it on comparatively small gates which i know has niggled you a little bit during the season
niggled me david its absolutely made me blazing
to be honest i know what i want to achieve i know what the people of derby want us to achieve but when youve got a chairman not wanting to
put his hand in his pocket
michael parkinson the highest rating talk show on tv
clough contd you ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking id love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally i believe the very sight of them
brings the game into disrepute some clap in the audience
and every time they open their mouths it kills it
because the very thing theyve given me a lot of stick about over the years about talking too much and going on television too much there are the very people
who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man or men can stop me talking to people like you
i love football
its deep it goes right down through
its in every nerve vein you name it
it consumes me
and when i have to come and talk about i like the passions of football to come out
because there are not enough in the game
clo ugh contd i like a bit of the honesty i like a bit of the truth
i accept without any shadow of a doubt that i talk too much apart from on this show
how do you react when someone says boss youre doing it wrong
i say how do you think it should be done
we talk about it for twenty minutes then we decide i was right
the world knows who i am
the world knows i talk a lot
moh ammed ali con td but theres some fellow in london england named
audience laughter anyway i heard all the way in america they say hes another mohammed ali
well theres just one mohammed ali
i want you to know
jabbing finger clough
you are not taking my job
im the talker
clough and taylor surrounded by friends and families with flowers telegrams bottles of champagne boxes of cigars
watching the mohammed ali on television
are you going to stop it
no i want to fight him
they roar with laughter
cheers and celebration

billy bremner and brian clough
william bremner your conduct in the charity shield match was deplorable and cannot be tolerated
we understand leeds are taking disciplinary action against you internally however the football association has to be seen to make an example
we have therefore decided to impose a fine of five hundred pounds
cloughs face a victorious look
and a suspension until september th
bang he brings down a gavel

disbelieving laugh what
thats more than a month

the sound of a familiar voice at the other end

taylor freezes hearing the voice we intercut as necessary for the remainder of the call

clough stares at the sign as he parks his car in the space beside it
a stab in his heart
clough walks along a corridor
sees the players training outside
to one side mcgovern and ohare
clough looks out at them
he winks discreetly at them
they look back and nod
then get back to work
the sound of laughter
the camaraderie of a family
what a contrast to leeds
clough walks along a corridor with photos on the wall
framed photos of his victories
clough walks into the office to see dave mackay behind his desk
who gets to his feet
extends his hand
well look who it is

mcgovern and ohare

clough driving his car
clenching the steering wheel in fury

clough sighs and goes
mcgovern and ohare roll their eyes
mackenzie stubs his cigarette and hurries after them
flash photographs are being taken by press of the three new signings duncan mckenzie john ohare and john mcgovern all wearing leeds shirts
pull back to reveal they are being watched from a distance by several leeds senior players
clough walks through a corridor brushing past johnny giles billy bremner and several other senior players
an intimidating atmosphere
what the hell did you buy them for
waste of bloody money
duncan mackenzie scored twenty eight goals last season
john ohare and john mcgovern are both internationals
weve got two strikers alan clarke and mick jones theyre internationals too

the leeds players trudge in after the game
heads hung low
begin to strip off
caption qpr leeds
visibly gutted by the result but nows not the time to show it
clough walks round the dressing room shaking hands individually patting players on the back
clough contd you were robbed out there today
broad bloody daylight
that was never a penalty
cloughs tone is sensitive
clough contd stan bowles
diving like that
mans a disgrace
but several of the leeds players refuse his hand
or freeze at his touch
turn away from him
clough contd ive spoken to the referee already
given him a piece of my mind
and come monday morning mark my word i shall be taking this further
the leeds players stare at one another
shoot one another looks
clough contd anyway i want you all to know im not in the slightest bit critical of your performance today
not a bit of it
you were terrific out there
norman hunter spits in contempt
giles turns and walks out into the showers
clough contd i couldnt ask for more effort
tailing off passion
the leeds players follow
finally ohare and mcgovern too
a deathly silence
clough is left alone in the dressing room
over this the sound of a ringing telephone
a gruff voice answers
its the middle of the night
clough speaks into the phone visibly the worse for wear from alcohol
you must be loving this
loving every minute
don revies face half asleep
he sits up in bed
a stout yorkshire matron wakes beside him

sam longson stands by the window looking out into the car park
he sees the leeds united players
reads their mood
their murderous intent
a flicker of concern on sam longsons face
he thinks then calls out to his secretary
get me todays team sheet will you
he lets the curtain fall
sam longson walks through corridors of elland road carrying the team sheet
walking towards the dressing rooms
he turns a corner and runs into clough
whats up uncle sam

hinton ohare todd mackay

would you prefer i sent out the apprentices
were at juventus mid week
semi final of the european cup
biggest night in the clubs history
couldnt you just field
a weaker side
am i hearing right
is the chairman of this football club seriously asking his manager to lose
you know what i mean
against their biggest rivals
the chairman of this football club is asking his manager to be pragmatic
manage his resources
weve embarked on a huge program of refurbishment and improvements
we need a good run in europe to pay for it
im going to pretend i didnt hear a word of this
clough turns to walk away
longson calls after him
checking watch weve still got twenty minutes before kick off
id reconsider if i were you
i wouldnt want my employer to be unhappy
chairman of derby county
and chairman long before you ever showed up
you were chairman of derby county before i came here
i remember that
when derby county were at the fucking foot of the second division when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of sam bloody longson ever
and thats where youd still fucking be if it wasnt for me at the foot of the bloody second division where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you
there would be no derby county without me no league title no champions of england not without brian clough
a door opens and peter taylor walks out in time to hear
im going to give you some good advice brian clough
lon gson contd no matter how good you think you are or how clever or how many fancy new friends you make on the telly the reality of footballing life
is this the chairman is the boss then come the directors then the secretary then the fans then the players and finally last of all bottom of the heap lowest of the low the one in the end we can all without is the bloody manager
longson turns and storms off
taylor looks at clough
what have you done now
clough doesnt answer and storms off in the opposite direction
taylor is left alone visibly anxious
clough watches from the touch line as the game is in progress
crash a leeds player scythes into a derby player
beeep the referee blows his whistle
clough and leaps off his bench in fury
youre a bloody disgrace
you should be in the book for that cherry
beeep the referee blows his whistle
revie smiles to himself as a derby player is carried off on a stretcher
clough contd youre an animal
a fucking animal hunter
sam longson watches from the directors box
he closes his eyes
peter taylor witnesses this
crunch another brutal tackle another whistle
another derby player hobbles off the pitch
blood streaming from a cut to his head
clough contd ill see you in fucking court lorimer
cloughs eyes meet revies eyes along the touchline
afterwards the leeds and derby players file off the pitch
bremner brushes roughly past clough
under his breath good luck in europe
clough turns what
bremner giles hunter lorimer carries on walking down the tunnel
laughing to themselves
clough is joined by taylor and jimmy gordon
afterwards the derby dressing room looks like the emergency room at a hospital
at least half a dozen players are injured
some on stretchers
clough stares in horror at the wreckage from the doorway
sam longson appears beside him
stares at clough
you fucking idiot
longson turns and walks away
clough turns to survey the carnage in the dressing room
like a battlefield

the most important night in derbys history as the derby players arrive in turin to play against mighty juventus
barbara clough and the children
huddled together round the television
watching the juventus game on tv
theres dad look
barbara and the kids watch intently
but juventus score one goal
the final whistle
barbara contd pity
barbara gets to her feet
barbara contd all right
everyone clean your teeth
on tv clough is in the tunnel
speaking to a television disappointed
not a bit
my players were heroic out there tonight
effectively we were playing the italian champions with a reserve team
that many of our first team are injured
peter taylor stands beside him visibly pale stressed
its what happens if you have a chairman who authorizes a multi million pound refurbishment of the directors box and hospitality suites before he pays for a proper squad
suppose it depends on your priorities
players or prawn sandwiches
i know which id prefer
i know which honest working class derby supporters would prefer too
a commotion breaks out
tv journalists ask questions sensing a great story
clough continues answering as beside him unseen by anyone else
taylor is white faced holding his chest
clough pouring brandy into a glass
duncan mackenzie john ohare and john mcgovern sit in front of him
billy bremner boss
what are they saying
this falls to mackenzie who knocks back his drink
that youre never here
a beat that theyre worried about the future
a beat that youre just going to fill the place with more derby players
and that all things considered they were all a lot happier under
cannot find the words
clough contd don revie
mackenzie mcgovern ohare avoid his eyes
clough contd is that what they say
that hes the boss
the capi di tutti fucking capi
and that they miss the bingo
and the carpet bowls
carpet bloody bowls
it helps them relax before a game
mcgovern and ohare stare at one another
that it boss
can we go now
clough stares lost in thought the three players go
the door closes
clough is left alone
then he gets up and in a terrifying flash of rage picks up his glass and throws it against the wall
clough walks out into the car park then he stops in his tracks when he sees
johnny giles billy bremner and norman hunter among others with their girlfriends and wives and kids being shown brand new cars by a sponsor
clough takes jimmy gordon aside
whats all this
complimentary for the senior payers
clough sees bremner giles and hunter trying out the sports cars
his smile fades
he walks up to the rep from the car nice to meet you pet
now you can take your lovely sports cars and put em back on your transporter
what are you talking about
these are ours
youll have complimentary cars when you deserve a compliment
right now you dont deserve a complimentary bicycle between you
clough takes the keys and gives them to the representative
clough contd complimentary cars when youre not suspended
indicates bremner and when you lot start winning some games
indicated giles and clough goes back to his own car
clough contd if i had my way youd walk to the ground and back every game
clough gets into his car and roars out past glowering bremner glowering giles glowering hunter glowering girlfriends and wives
cloughs car pulls up outside his house in derby
he closes his eyes
breathes a private sigh of relief
surrounded by people who love him
clough walks into his house
what are you doing here
arent you supposed to be in that hotel in leeds
i couldnt stand it for another night
clough takes off his coat
so you drove all the way
what time will you have to get up in the morning
clough bends down
kisses his wife
clough contd you smell nice
forgotten what a woman smells like
barbara strokes his head
not like bloody men
thats for sure
clough looks into his sons room
the eldest is fast asleep but the youngest says dad
you still awake
you should be asleep
tell us a joke dad
theres this bloke walking about in london when all of a sudden the city gets hit by a russian a bomb
clough sits down strokes his sons head
clough contd and all the buildings have fallen down
and all the people are dead
and now this bloke is the only man left in the whole of london
clough continues stroking his sons hair
clough contd and he suddenly feels very very lonely because theres no one else to talk to
nobody else but him
cloughs son falls asleep
clough doesnt notice
clough contd so he decides that hes had enough that he cant bear being this lonely and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing
the post office tower
and then he jumps off
and hes falling down down and down and down the sixteenth floor the fifteenth floor the fourteenth and thats when he hears the phone ringing
clough looks down
and gets two unexpected shocks
the first is that his son is already asleep
the second is there is a tear running down his own cheek
the leeds players clatter off the pitch
covered in mud
walking in silence
heads hung low
jimmy gordon is waiting for clough
the chairman wants to see you
said it was important
cloughs face already fearing the worst
clough walks along the corridor
past the photographs on the wall
the trophies in the cabinets
the pictures of a smiling don revie mocking him
clough shoots his cuffs
rolls his neck
a boxer on his way to the ring
a gladiator on his way to the circus
he knocks on the door and walks in
manny cussins sam bolton and a third man
about bloody time
where you been
i was about to send out a search party
cussins i know its not been the best of starts but in my defence there are a couple of things id like to say
this is martin hughes
he runs mercedes here in the north
double takes what
we hear thats what you like to drive
what i used to drive at derby
well we cant have leeds united being outdone by derby county can we
so martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted out
they begin to walk to the door
cussins puts his arm round cussins contd also we figured if you were sitting in a spanking new car yourself you might be a little more bloody lenient with your
senior players whove kicked off as you can imagine being denied whats rightfully theirs
never come between a footballer and his motor
especially not billy bloody bremner
clough smiles nervously visibly relieved
is that it then
you look white as a ghost man
cussins tightens his grip again arm round clough
cussins contd what did you think wed asked you up here for
the air crackling with menace and intent
clough visits peter taylor in a large crowded ward of old infirm dying people
its a shock
heart attack eh
had it three weeks ago they reckon
taylor contd they ran all kinds of tests
asked me about my diet and my family history
tay lor contd i told them the only thing they needed to know was that i share my professional life with brian clough
that seemed to satisfy them
clough manages a smile
taylor contd im only half joking you know
have we still got jobs
longsons tried to put a gagging order on me of course
mimics any further utterances in public or appearances in the media by brian clough will be met with instant dismissal
well i hope you take notice
and act accordingly
would you like to hear my contrite reply
clough pulls out a letter
clough contd due to the complete breakdown in communication with the chairman peter taylor and i find it is impossible to continue our good work for derby county
we therefore wish to tender our resignations with immediate effect
horrified what do you think
i dont want to resign
nor do i
dont worry theyll never let us
we just won them the championship
but it will strengthen our position and force them to get rid of longson
oh no brian
theyll never do that
i cant do it pete
i cant work with my hands tied a chairman telling me what i can or cannot do
youre picking the wrong enemy
the enemys not longson
and your obsession with leeds
dont be daft
we won the league pete
were top dogs in derby now
and longson cant stand it
thats the problem
no its not
this monster in you
this mad ambition
it comes and goes
sometimes its good
a fire that stirs everything up and then theres this
this thing that takes you over
and destroys everything that is good in your life
taylor contd please tell me this letter is just a draft
you havent sent it
because ill be out in a couple of days
let me talk to them
crash door fly open
clough storms down a corridor
bang clough crashes into the boardroom
when they see clough voices fall silent
what are you doing
you werent supposed to accept our resignations
shouldnt bloody well offer them then
clough turns to the other directors
i only did because of him
points at longson you cant get rid of us
itd be a disaster for the club
for the whole of derby
you cant keep shooting your mouth off the way you have been
or issuing these ultimatums
the board stare at one another avoid eye contact
longson contd with great reluctance your resignations have been accepted
you cant do this
the decision stands
and dont even think of a settlement
youre getting nowt
were going to create a footballing dynasty here
derby could be one of the greats alongside united liverpool leeds
clough stands in the middle of the room
car keys on the table and out
clough stares in disbelief at the other board members
does none of you have the guts to stop this
and dont show your faces here again
clough stares in disbelief at the assembled board members of derby county
roy kirkland robertson king keeling sam longson et al
blazers and brass buttons
the sound of clearing throats
news footage prime minister ted heath announcing blackouts due to the oil crisis
britain is plunged into power cuts
and total darkness
three days a week
taylor walks through the open door
a meeting is underway in the clough house
in the hall cloughs three children stare through banister railings
the smoke filled front room is packed with friends newspapers are strewn over the table
clough sits in the corner being given counsel by solicitors
jimmy gordon reads out a letter from the derby players
to the directors of derby county football club
we the undersigned players are unanimous in our support and respect for mr
clough and mr
taylor and ask that they be reinstated as manager and assistant manager of the club
cheers and celebrations
clough is congratulated
jimmy contd signed by john ohare roy macfarland colin todd archie gemmill kevin hector alan hinton
but not dave mackay
all voices stop
taylor contd whos just accepted the job
the crowds part
clough sits up and stares
its in the evening paper
i signed that fat fuck saved his professional life
gave him two more years as a player as my captain
a beat he wouldnt fucking dare
clough sees the paper
mackay to be derby manager
why did you do it
i love this place brian
im happy here
so are you
its not over yet pete
the lawyers are issuing a writ tomorrow
the players are calling a meeting
theres talk of them coming out on strike
theres protest marches scheduled for this week end
why couldnt you just have kept your mouth shut
well never find anywhere like this again
at that moment barbara sticks her head outside
holding phone mike bamber on the phone
whos mike bamber
manager of brighton and hove albion
someone who wants to offer us a job
over this the sound of a referees whistle
with a loud roar the game against luton gets under way
clough takes his seat alone in the dugout
unseen by him in the stands behind him
don revie arrives shaking hands taking a seat
immediately as soon as they see revie the leeds fans start cheering theres only one don revie
clough turns to see revie
acknowledging the crowd
the leeds fans chant theres only one don revie
in the directors box manny cussins notes the reaction of the crowd
in the press boxes the journalists and tv commentators also note the reaction of the crowd
cloughs face stinging with humiliation
and as if that werent bad enough
rrrooooaaarrrrr luton score a goal
in the directors box manny cussins face
afterwards clough and the players walk down the tunnel to see manny cussins and sam bolton waiting
players lounge brian
clough opens his mouth is about to reply but cussins has turned and walked away
clough walks in as several players walk in too
clough takes a seat
cussins calls for quiet
this is the worst start to a season leeds has had in twenty years
four points from five games
second from fucking bottom
whats going on
as far as i can i see theres no relationship no understanding between players and management
not a healthy one anyway
players heads low
avoiding cloughs eyes
perhaps if mr
clough were to step outside we would all feel a little more like speaking our minds
clough cant help smiling
under his breath you bastard
of course cussins will reprimand him
refuse his request
cussins looks at woodward and bolton
if you wouldnt mind brian
just for a minute or two
clough cannot believe his ears
he gets to his feet
as you wish
clough walks out of the room
duncan mackenzie watches
clough closes the door behind him
he stands in the corridor outside
from inside we hear
no one likes him
the atmosphere in the dressing room is non existent
were not allowed to mention mr
hes banned us from doing all the things we used to do
like playing bingo and carpet bowls
tactically hes never prepared never tells us how he wants us to play
you know hes just itching to bring in a whole lot of new players
clough looks out of the window to see don revie signing autographs shaking hands with adoring leeds fans outside
whats going on
clough turns to see jimmy gordon
the last two words of every story ever written is whats going on
the fucking end
what i want to know is why after all the thing hes said about us did you appoint him in the first place
im about to go home and work out how much i want in severance pay
dont worry ill make sure your job is safe
im not staying here without you
no bloody way
then i suggest you go home and do the same
what me and the lads are trying to say mr
cussins is that compared to mr
revie hes just not good enough
clough a dagger in his heart
clough turns leading jimmy gordon away then he stops
having seen something through a window
outside don revie walks down into the car park and towards his car cheered and clapped every step of the way by leeds the messiah of west yorkshire
cloughs car pulls up in a hotel car park
he and peter taylor get out on a road overlooking the sea
clough looks around at his surroundings
the old people
the retirement home feel
singing oh i dont like to be beside the seaside
cmon just give it a chance
brighton and hove albion
have you seen where they are
bottom of the third division
and we can get them out of there
we did it with hartlepools
we did it with derby
we cared about hartlepools and derby
were from the north pete
what do we care about brighton
look where we are
were almost in france
hey theyve got money this lot
and get a lungful of that air
itd be good for my health
you cant manage a team thats not your own people
not what you know
anyway the protest movement in derby is still in full flow
we could still get our jobs back
no we wont
its over brian
theyll never take us back
what about proper clubs
like manchester united
or england now alfs gone
wouldnt you fancy that
no ones rung have they
youve scared them all off
its only been a couple of weeks
just listen to them
mike bamber and harry bloom brighton chairman and vice chairman likeable men for the first time not in blazers and brass buttons sit opposite clough and taylor
sign today ill give you a bonus of seven grand
yhear that brian
plus a salary that exceeds by twenty percent what derby were paying you
very generous mike
but those are first division wages
first divisions where i want this club to be
are you sure you can afford it
are you sure youre worth it
bamber offers his hand
clough stares at it
clough contd were going to need a holiday first
take as long as you like
bamber doesnt even flinch
ill even throw in the bloody trunks
clough and bamber shake
taylor beams with delight
over this we fade in the sound of classical spanish guitar
packed sandy beaches
were in a resort in southern majorca
red faced brits
sausages and chips
beer and sun tan lotion
on the beach barbara clough is playing with the three clough kids in the shallow water
they wave over to brian
clough sitting in the sand sunning himself
reading a newspaper about don revies flirting with the england job
a blazer with buttons
a red faced official looking man in his mid s being pointed onto a beach by a hotel employee
red faced perspiring archer nods
starts walking onto the beach
keith archer walks across the beach the scalding sand sweating under the merciless sun
until he finds clough
archer takes out his handkerchief mops his brow
youre a hard man to find mr
my names keith archer
secretary of leeds united football club
clough looks up cant help smiling
then what are you doing here keith
because from what im reading in my paper and from what i hear on the jungle drums youve got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting
with the england job
hes not flirting
indignant pointing to newspaper ey it says it right here
hes taken it
clough turns squints in the light
archer contd which bring me to the point of my visit
barbara and peter taylor look over from the beach concerned
keith archer smiles nervously politely raising his hat
two tiny specks on the beach in the distance arguing
silhouettes against the setting sun
but we hate leeds
its the top flight pete
the first division
but weve given brighton our word
and theyve paid us the money
we can pay back the money
bollocks to bloody brighton
laughing now a dismissive wave id go mad
wed all go mad down there
give it a year
give it a chance
itd be death
death for us all
mike bamber is a good man
oh do me a favour
he had faith in us offered us a job when no one would
he offered us a job
and now someone else has offered us a better one
and not just anyone
the best team in the country
cmon pete you know what that means
itd be the charity shield at wembley in a months time
the european cup after
yes but even if we won them it would always be revies achievements
aaa tay lor contd fretting i cant do it
i gave brighton my word
and youd sooner fester down there
with all those fucking tories
in that blue rinse retirement home by the sea
yes brighton is a small club
but at least wed be together you and me
we could build them up
make them our own
like we did with hartlepools
like we did with derby
and then what
bottle again as soon as it comes to the big time
thats always been the trouble with you pete
and thats the trouble with you
too much ambition
too much greed
too much everything
you knock it but its done you proud over the years
without me youd still be stuck in burton albion
on the arse of the footballing earth
but without you id still have a job in derby
a job and a home that i love
a beat yes brian youre the shop window ill grant you that
the razzle and the bloody dazzle
but im the goods at the back
and without me without someone to save you from yourself youre not just half
tapping brain youre nothing
taylor starts to walk
clough calls after him
dont make me laugh
so what does that make you taylor
youre half of nothing
a big fat pilot fish that feeds on nothing
a bloody nobody
the forgotten man
historys fucking afterthought
taylor walks off leaving clough
well lets see shall we
the leeds board members faces manny cussins sam bolton keith archer sydney simon percy woodward etc lets be honest
its not working is it
whats not working
i havent been here five minutes so how can anything be working yet
the players arent happy
were not happy
so what do you want to do about it
if its not working then well have to part company
itll cost you twenty five grand
the leeds board members choke
for six weeks work
plus three and a half grand for jimmy gordon
and an agreement that leeds united will pay both our income taxes for the next three years
the leeds board members choke
thats bloody criminal
no whats criminal mr
cussins is the way you as chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the players
going behind my back like that
i admit that was wrong
and you can throw in the merc and all
might be a bit flash for a man out of a job but the truth is ive grown to like it
who the bloody hell do you think you are
brian howard clough
no danger of me forgetting that name in a hurry
clough and his sons are packing together cloughs belongings in a couple of boxes
a knock at the door
duncan mackenzie comes in in track suit a cigarette in hand
ready for the days training
just wanted to say its not right
they should have given you more time
not just me that feels that way either
the sad thing is it wont work
you cant change a manager like a pair of socks
itll happen once to me and never again
clough shakes clarkes hand
rrrrinng the phone rings
clough turns and picks up the phone
he listens then
clough contd into phone all right
but youll have to make it quick
clough hangs up
looks at his sons
clough contd something we have to do on the way
wont take long
clough sits in make up
the door opens and austin mitchell the same presenter as earlier sticks his head round the corner
thanks for agreeing to this
clough contd go easy on me though
theres a good lad
clough is led into the studio and onto the calender set chatting to the sound man
cloughs microphone is fixed he is shown to his seat beside the presenters
then clough notices a third empty seat beside his
we expecting guests
then clough looks up to see a distinctive blue blazer with gold buttons approaching the set
cloughs face falls as don revie and austin mitchell turn the corner in conspiratorial conversation and out to the seats
its a set up
clough looks over at austin mitchell and the crew who shiftily avoids cloughs eyes
clough contd you bastards
revie is put in the seat beside clough
avoiding cloughs eyes
revie rolls his neck crosses his legs
vast intimidating revie
ready for battle
suddenly the theme music plays the floor manager counts down
five four three
the presenter looks up
tonight the football world was stunned by the news that brian clough has been sacked as manager of leeds united
well be talking not just to brian clough but also to the man he replaced whos success he couldnt emulate don revie
mitchell turns to clough
mitchell contd to brian clough first of all
whats your reaction to being sacked in this fashion
obviously austin my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with revie
not so easy to make accusations when its to someones face
but in answer to your question six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job
i would hope revie would get a lot longer time in his
do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes don revie
to replace you
being very very honest i think it was a difficult job for anyone to do
but i do feel brian clough i wont call him clough because i wont take him down like that
i do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have
how did i do that don
shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were
well you were dirty don
thats not true
the last four seasons weve topped the charts for entertaining football
and before that you also topped all the disciplinary charts
you should have been docked points and sent down to the second division
and in fact you went on record and said so brian clough
again and again
that leeds should in fact be relegated
and i was right
do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them
of course it did
the things he said
why did you take the job in the first place
because i thought it was the best job in the country
of course it was the best job in the country
i was taking over the league champions
aa you were
you were taking over the best bunch of players youd ever seen
and i fancied winning the league and winning europe and doing it better than you
theres no way you could win it better
but thats the only hope ive got
i only lost four matches
well i can only lose three
no no no no
and still play attractive clean football
see there he goes again
listening to you i am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both
its more than that
am i right
well were very different people don and i
we have different styles
in football and in life
im a warm man
i do believe in faeries and that is my outlook
don is different
theres a hardness to him
maybe hes not even aware of it
but hes a cold person
you dont know me
and that lack of warmth
that coldness was there
permeated the club when i arrived
i totally refute that
the atmosphere at leeds was like a family
a happy family
you ask any of my players
i signed most of them personally
knew their backgrounds
i was a father to them
in that club every morning
massaging those boys
did you do that for them
they would never have let me
did you try
you didnt even try
i soaped those boys down with my own hands
you just went to leeds with no thought for the club no thought for the players
just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me
well are you surprised
what else was i going to do
after what you did
what did i do
you know exactly
clough contd th march
i even remember the date
you came to derby county the third round of the fa cup and you refused to shake my hand
austin mitchell looks up
the cameramen look up
matter of principle
i always shake the other managers hand
you shook peter taylors hand and my trainer jimmy gordons
then i probably didnt see you
no you saw me don
but considered me beneath you
looked down on me
and dismissed me
just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country
never would i knowingly refuse to shake a colleagues hand
the truth is i probably just didnt know who you were
a knowing smile didnt know who i was
pull the other one
its the truth
blurts out well you certainly know it now
all heads turn
that came out unintentionally loud
oh we all know it now
a beat we know you as the man whos constant outbursts his defaming of fellow professionals have brought this game this beautiful game into disrepute
who had one of the best jobs in the country at derby and managed to get the sack
who had one of the best partners in the game in peter taylor and threw him away
who was given the greatest gift in british football leeds united a team that in ten years hasnt finished outside the top four and took them to the bottom of
the first division
yes its fair to say we all know who you are now
austin mitchells eyes widen
ok gentlemen were going to have to leave it there
well lets see where we are in a years time donald revie
dear oh dear
lets see where we both are in five
thats it for tonights show
id like to thank brian clough and don revie for joining me
thank you austin
the show wraps up
theme music starts playing
revie removes his microphone turns and walks out
clough is left staring hollow eyed
wishing the ground would swallow him up
leeds united football club written on the side of the stadium
cloughs car driver past
inside the car clough drives staring at the road ahead
talk on the radio of cloughs dismissal
do you think your old man is a fool
he bloody is
clough continues to drive
clough contd who is the least mature person in this car
who most needs to bloody grow up
whos been making a right arse of himself the past few months
the boys cant help laughing
clough contd who fancies a trip to the seaside
to see uncle pete
me and all
cloughs foot hits the floor
cloughs mercedes heads south and accelerates into the distance
peter taylor is working in the garden
he looks up to see clough standing in the gate to his house
taylor looks at clough
their eyes meet
a poignant moment
theyve kicked you out already
so how long was that
forty four days
taylor strains not to show his satisfaction
taylor contd so what are you doing here
dont make this difficult for me pete
you know why im here
and i wont bloody grovel
taylor shrugs please yourself
turns and starts walking inside
clough contd all right
im on my knees
sees clough on his knees
begging for forgiveness
i apologize unreservedly for being a twat
i apologize for being a twat
through gritted teeth unreservedly
because i cant do it without you
because i cant do it without you
im nothing without you
im nothing without you
please please baby take me back
clough tails off realizing he has no option
clough contd please please baby take me back
cloughs sons watch from the car as peter taylor opens his arms and the two men fall into an embrace
but in the clench taylors smile fades his expression suddenly becoming serious
taylor holds clough tight and whispers
youll only fuck me up again wont you
i love you yknow
but it wont stop you
clough thinks then
would you sooner go through it all without me
taylors face freeing and condemning himself at once
our camera slowly pulls back over the brighton landscape as clough and taylor disappear into taylors house
