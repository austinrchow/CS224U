written by evan daugherty john lee hancock hossein amini story by evan daugherty inspired by the brothers grimms little snow white november nd from high above we see the castle
gardens covered in a blanket of snow
we hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful woman in a fur lined cloak heading towards an unseen object
once upon a time in deep winter a queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold
the rose looks miraculously red
nearby a raven looks on
the queen gazes at the flower then bends down
reaching for it she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell
boom with the impact of an artillery shell a drop of blood lands in the snow
followed by another
the queen startles then calmly touches her stomach
and because the red seemed so alive against the white she thought if only i had a child as white as snow lips as red as blood hair as black
as a ravens wings and all with the strength of that rose
a beat then we hear the piercing cry of a new born baby we find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of midwives and physicians
moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of water dirty sponges astrology charts and protection charms until we see a baby girl in the arms of her happy mother
soon after a daughter was born to the queen and was named snow white
with a radiant smile the queen offers snow white to her proud father king magnus
the babys cries grow louder as the king cradles her gently in his arms turning towards a mirror
and she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty
a wounded magpie is twitching in a puddle of water
snow white aged now steps towards it hesitantly looking concerned
pick it up william
her companion william also braces himself reaches down then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly
he tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable
it doesnt want to be touched
snow white ignores him approaching the bird herself
she kneels down hesitates then reaches out and strokes the magpie calming its flapping before she picks it up
high up on a tree another magpie looks on
snow white runs cupping the wounded bird in her hand william dashing after her
the sun is out and the fields and forests are lit up in all their glory
the children sprint through a beautiful seaside village thatched homes with flower gardens happy farmers and fair village maidens hurry william
they run down the dunes waves crashing the sand gleaming in the sunlight until they see the beautiful castle up ahead a single apple tree stands in the middle of
it stands out
snow white and william dash past it into the castle
snow white bursts into her parents chamber
the king and queen turn from the window
two physicians are in attendance
snow white is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mothers smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken
we found it in the woods
the queen takes the wounded magpie from snow white
the king looks on sadly as she pulls a ribbon from snow whites hair and carefully binds the magpies wing
william watches from the doorway noticing how frail the queen looks
the magpies flapping gradually calms its pain easing
it will heal in time
snow whites eyes are fixed on the little bird
ill look after it
the king watches snow white hiding his sorrow behind a smile
so does the queen holding back her tears
you possess a rare beauty my love
she touches snow whites heart never lose it
hold it dear
you will need its strength to one day become queen
snow white and william with a small toy bow strapped to his back climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister gardens
william picks a distinctive red and white apple and offers it to snow white
he makes a point of the offer holding it out nodding
just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a huge bite himself grinning
snow white shoves him off the tree and they fall to the ground
and now we pull back to reveal the king and williams father duke hammond watching from the throne room balcony
my daughter will need your sons friendship more than ever duke hammond
as will i yours
we are here to serve you your majesty
as the king watches his daughter erics voiceover resumes the next winter was the harshest in memory and snow whites mother passed away
gardens castle day
a the garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now
king magnus walks with his arm around snow white heartbroken
a single tear rolls down snow whites cheek
palace onlookers and mourners fixed on her face feeling what she feels move aside
a year went by but the king was inconsolable
taking advantage of his grief dark forces gathered on the kingdoms borders
from above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a clearing
at the head is king magnus with duke hammond by his side surrounded by a line of the kings army
they are frozen as they look at across the battlefield horsemen in a line
the riders are silhouetted on a misty plain a vast shadow army of faceless warriors
king magnus and the duke trade a look from what hell comes this army
a hell theyll soon revisit
king magnus screams a blood cry kicks his horse and rides forward with blind courage no longer caring what happens to him
the two lines of warriors race pell mell to the center of the battlefield
when they meet hand to hand combat at its most brutal
king magnus swings his great sword and a shadow warrior all down the line the same is happening shadow warriors shattering evaporating
duke hammond shatters an opponent as well and as loud and furious as the battlefield was only moments before it is now that quiet
the king and the duke watch in amazement as the rest of the shadow army melts away dissolving into the morning mist until all that is left in the field
is the unholy army was defeated leaving king magnus with the spoils of victory
a caged prison wagon
not even sure how it got there
king magnus moves toward it with a little trepidation
when hes close he gets off his horse walks closer and dares to look inside
inside the cage a woman cowers her face hidden behind a veil
king magnus stares at her through the prison bars then with a mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters
you are now free
you have nothing to fear from me
duke hammond watches from outside the cage a bit wary as the king kneels beside the terrified woman
what is your name my lady
slowly the woman turns
for a moment the king wonders if its his beloved queen behind the veil
gently he lifts her veil
its not his wife but the most beautiful woman hes ever seen
my name is ravenna sire
the king is speechless now gazing upon the face of an angel
so struck by her beauty was the king that he forgot for the first time his broken heart
his gaze is so intense that ravenna looks down for a moment
when she lifts her head a int
gypsy wagon flashback day
l a young ravenna her face reflected in a small hand mirror
ravenna as a child beautiful but poor looks into the mirror
her mother a gypsy woman in tattered clothes moves the mirror closer
this is all that can save you ravenna
the young ravenna looks away distracted by shouts and commotion outside
gypsy camp same day
b a little boy finn runs as fast as he can through the snow toward the gypsy camp
behind him the kings riders advance on the camp
ravennas mother tries to keep her daughters attention b continued b ravenna
still as a statue and even more beautiful as cheeks are powdered eyebrows plucked and lips painted by several sets of hands
her eyes stare straight ahead unblinking her mind elsewhere
attendants are preparing ravenna for her wedding to the king
youre so beautiful
ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of snow white reverential standing a few feet away
ravennas face softens as she looks at the face of snow white
ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out her arm come
as snow white steps forward the handmaidens withdraw until only one is left weaving beautiful flowers in ravennas hair
that is kind child
especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom
snow white doesnt quite know how to answer this
a warm smile would you like to be dressed up like this and married one day
snow white nods
i hope youll invite me
snow white smiles enchanted by her new friend
i know it is difficult child
when i was your age i too lost my mother
a king tore me from her arms dressed me in lace and stole my innocence
snow whites smile dies a bit confused
i can never take your mothers place but i feel that you and i are bound
touches her heart i feel it here
snow white mimics touching her own heart and smiles at ravenna
it should be a touching moment but something in snow whites face the way her smile lights up the room gives ravenna pause
ravenna in a stunning dress
walks down the center aisle
all the nobles in the land are present
ravenna looks at them on either side of the aisle
they are all smiling nodding appreciation
but they arent really looking at ravenna
she follows their gaze to snow white behind holding the folds of silk from the wedding dress
snow white looks up adoringly at ravenna
as the bride and groom reach the altar king magnus turns and smiles the happiest man alive
king magnus lies on the bed drunk half with wine and half with lust
his eyes fixed on ravenna in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace holding a goblet
staring a seductive hole through him
she starts slowly toward him never taking her eyes off him
he licks his lips cant wait for her to arrive
gazing at her lustfully who are you
the bane of kings
when she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed rolls him on his back straddles him and offers the goblet
sup my lord
king magnus drains the goblet tosses it and gropes her body
now you are mine
her eyes gleam in the firelight
magnus tries to playfully wrestle her off but she grabs his hands and holds him down firmly
i will destroy you
indeed you will
she rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the lips
he cant believe how good she tastes
as my people were destroyed
as my family was destroyed
as i would have been destroyed
he is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show discomfort
but when a woman stays young forever no man can resist her and the world is hers
he suddenly starts to choke his eyes widening in surprise
as he struggles for breath
first i will take your life my lord
then i will take your throne
she reaches beneath the sheets pulls out an ornate dagger and brings it down through him a ext
outside royal bedroom a several guards line the hallway
the door opens and ravenna emerges
as she moves past them
the king has laid down his sword for the night
their eyes take her lustfully in as she strides away and disappears around a corner
gypsy wagon flashback day
b ravennas mother takes ravennas hand and holds it over a bowl of white liquid
you must trust me my love
with a small blade she nicks ravennas wrist
three drops of blood fall into the white liquid boom
finn ravennas brother blasts through the door
the kings men
ravenna chokes it down
and with it the ability to steal youth and beauty
for that is your ultimate power and only protection
finn steps forward
i will protect my sister
ravennas mother reaches out and touches her sons forehead closes her eyes an incantation of sorts
so it shall be finn
ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a lantern
a portcullis opens and dark figures emerge from the shadows entering the castle
leading them is a tall pale eyed warrior finn
he looks at ravenna devotedly
we see the shadows of the invaders sweeping through the corridors putting the kings sleeping soldiers to the sword
snow white lies asleep when she hears a bell ringing
at first she thinks shes dreaming but then she hears cries of alarm
she sits up curiously then climbs out of bed theres panic and chaos outside courtiers and soldiers running for their lives
snow white stares in confusion then runs too snow white rushes towards her fathers chamber and sees ravenna at the end of the corridor
relieved she hurries towards her stepmother when suddenly she notices her fathers lifeless body lying on the bed
finn and his knights appear beside ravenna
it takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in tears of shock welling in snow whites eyes before she turns and flees the chaos has spread to the courtyard
duke hammonds knights struggling to hold back the invaders
snow white hurries out dazed by the sight of battle then sees william pull free of his fathers guards and run towards her william grabs her protectively when strong arms
reach down and lift them both onto the back of separate horses
duke hammond and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle before the portcullis closes
the duke rides under the portcullis with william
his bodyguard is about to follow when an arrow from finn strikes him in the back and both he and snow white are thrown off their horse
but the portcullis is down separating snow white and william
the last thing he sees is snow white struggling in finns arms being hauled back into the castle
ravenna walks from statue to painting to urn toppling and tearing them from the walls
ravennas soldiers deliver a large object then leaving her alone
a beautiful mirror rests against the wall
ravenna stares at it
mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all
s a brief silence then the surface of the mirror ripples
liquid spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of the mirror man
his body is a veil of reflective bronze but his face is a distorted version of ravennas own
it is you my queen
yet another kingdom falls to your glory
is there no end to your power and beauty
ravenna smiles moves to the center of the room raises her arms and drunk with power screams
the scream becomes a ext
gypsy wagon flashback day
a young ravennas scream as she is ripped from her mothers arms
finn throws himself into the mix but is backhanded to the ground
ravennas mother moves forward ready to attack
the guard holding ravenna pulls a dagger and puts it to ravennas throat which stops her mother
ravenna is dragged away and tossed on the back of a horse but be warned ravenna by fairest blood it is done and only by fairest blood can it be
ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to the sword
finn struggles free and chases after the kings men as they gallop away
b all the wedding guests and nobles stand held there by guards with swords and daggers
ravenna stands at the top of the stairs
so kind of you all to stay over
what shall we do with these
she eyes the noblemen and guests from left to right
their eyes beg for mercy
there is none
to the sword
b continued b there are gasps and screams as the guards move the guests away
ravenna notices finn off to one side his dagger at the neck of snow white who stares defiantly at ravenna
finn stops his exit with snow white and turns
ravenna stares at the little girl not sure where she stands with this one
lock her away
one never knows when royal blood may be of value
the spell ravennas mother placed on her gave her the ability to steal youth and beauty and indeed all things good for her own evil purposes
but for every life there must be a death for every gain loss and under the reign of ravenna nature turned on itself and people turned on each other
and all this time she kept snow white in a cell in the north tower
ravenna in the shadows sits perfectly still
though its been years she looks the same
the object of her gaze is snow white who has changed
she is now a woman lying in a darkened cell
around the corner finn secretly eyes his sister who doesnt notice him
ravenna just outside the cell doesnt blink entranced by snow white
snow white opens her eyes and sees ravenna
this is not the first time this has happened
their eyes locked
ravenna doesnt answer just stands and walks away
a chill wind whips through the woods
lying sprawled on the ground we see a man eric who looks like hes dead
its only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the empty flagon of grog by his side and realize hes drunk
his eyes flicker as a womans scream cuts through the woods
sara beautiful in pain
a patch of blood blossoms on her dress
her mouth is open screaming but no sound comes out
erics eyes flicker and begin to open then he hears it again
he rises to his feet unsteadily his head pounding from a hangover then grabs two throwing hatchets and slides them into his harness on his back eric runs past trees
and ducks under branches crashing into a few still drunk
as he arrives at a clearing he sees a beautiful girl rose fighting off a huge tattooed warrior lay a hand on her and ill take your head
broch turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised
ale given you courage again huntsman
wont take much courage to split your skull from here
aye but first youd have to see straight
broch advances with a grin drawing his own axe
trying to clear his vision and steady his aim eric hurls the hatchet and misses the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened gretas head broch is on eric
in an instant swinging his huge battle axe
eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows his natural skill and dexterity slowed down by all the ale hes drunk
rose looks on terrified as broch drives eric towards the trees
he corners him against an oak and swings his axe only for eric to duck at the last moment the blade buries itself deep in the tree stuck
we realize now from erics dark smile that he lured broch into the trap
he draws his second hatchet but instead of using the blade cracks broch over the head with the handle knocking him out
rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through brochs pockets
rose sees how handsome he is
eric stares at her thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin examining her pretty features
rose doesnt seem to mind looking back with an inviting smile
i dont know how to repay you
eric stares at her a moment then suddenly picks her up and tosses her over his shoulders
dont worry somebody else will
and now we see a rickety prison wagon full of beautiful girls just like rose staring out furiously from behind bars
eric and a slave merchant haggle over rose who is bound and gagged looking just as furious as the other women
her nose is on the large size and her chins a little weak
your eyes are dim
ill give you two gold pieces
after all the business weve done together
rose curses behind her gag as eric pulls her away
four gold pieces and thats my final offer
eric doesnt even bother to turn around
ill peddle my wares elsewhere thank you
the slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out ten gold pieces
eric hesitates but its not from a guilty conscience hes just considering the price
then he smiles turns
they have a deal
we get our first good look at grown snow white as she shaves wood for a fire
shes done this every day for years
her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and blows on the kindling
a omitted a the fire is now burning and snow white warms her hands on it
she hears approaching footsteps
she jumps up gets in her bed and pretends to sleep
a guard opens a cell opposite snow white
a few seconds later the door clangs shut
as soon as the guard is gone snow white rises walks to her cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell
whats your name
rose sitting in a dark corner goes to her cell bars and looks out
i am rose
snow white smiles a friendly face
ravenna stands attended by maids in a black gown open in front
appropriate in private but not when ravennas generals and finn stand across from her
the generals avert their eyes made uncomfortable by her near nakedness
the general uses a pointer to make his presentation while another holds a map
there are scattered rebel groups on the fringe of the dark forest but they cause little harm
she dips her fingers into a bowl of dead songbirds plucks out a tiny heart and eats it as she listens not happy
and what of the duke
we have pushed his forces into the mountains but his stronghold at carmath holds firm
lay siege to it
the mountains and fortress provide impenetrable protection my queen
then lure him out
burn every village that supports him
poison their wells
if they still resist put their heads on pikes to decorate the roads
chooses words carefully they have taken the fight to us
rebels harry our supply lines and rob our pay wagons
we have just captured two of the rebel leaders
they will be put to the sword
i wish to interrogate them myself
she drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath
she lowers herself into the white liquid
her face disappears beneath the viscous liquid then she rises like a porcelain statue
bathing chamber moments later a ecu a small songbird its chest open revealing a small heart
ravennas claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it to her mouth
she is dressed now and stands at a window finn at her side
outside the window a crowd of starving peasants at the foot of the castle fight over the milk pouring from her bath
i wont go back
she is lost for a moment then
finn do you remember when we were children begging for scraps like those wretches
yes my queen
am i not kinder
rose and snow white converse
all the girls in our village were taken
i was trying to reach safe haven at duke hammonds castle when i was caught snow white bursts with hope the duke
he still fights in my fathers name
rose stares at the feral girl now realizing who she is
youre the kings daughter
the night the evil ones reign began we were told all in the castle were put to the sword
how were you spared
what about william
the dukes son
is he alive
i dont know princess
rose shakes her head still gazing at snow white then hears the distant cries of other female prisoners
what will they do to me
ravenna sweeps into the great hall
the generals and finn snap to attention
she stops and stares at two men the captured insurgents
thomas a grizzled old rebel looks badly bruised and beaten while his handsome son lain is unmarked
they both stare at her defiantly
ravenna faces the two rebels
a soldier steps forward
my queen these two were captured leading an ambush of our supply caravan
ravenna seems intrigued steps forward eyeing them
you left your home your family the bosom of my protection to aid my enemies
because under your rule we have lost everything
we will not stop until this kingdom is free
she moves to iain right up to his face
obviously a debt owed to your wife
she reaches out and touches iains strong jaw
he struggles against the guards that hold him back
there was a time i would have lost my heart to a face like yours and you would have no doubt broken mine
in a flash iain grabs a guards dagger and rams it into ravennas chest
she makes a pained face looks down at the dagger then up to iain
you would kill your queen
she pulls the dagger out there is no wound no blood and drops it on the ground
iain and thomas are shocked
admiring to iain you have beauty
but how strong is your heart
she smiles almost regrettably then places her hand on his chest
we hear his heart start to hammer louder and louder
he grimaces in pain as she squeezes the hammering filling his ears until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead
thomas falls to his knees in horror trying to revive his son
finn draws his sword to behead him when ravenna raises her hand
let him return to the duke and speak of the generosity of his queen
with that she sweeps out followed by finn
its only now that we see the lines on her face
finn takes her by the arm as she falters
are you alright
ravenna pulls her arm away furiously
the general and the others stare alarmed
they quickly exit all save finn who watches concerned as ravenna leans against the wall for support
she pulls herself together looks at finn
magic comes at a lofty price
and the expense grows
this is about as much as ravenna can confess
finn watches as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber
then he turns and claps his hands twice
a guard appears and finn nods
mirror chamber royal palace a ravenna walks into the room
eyes the mirror afraid to look at herself
i have something for what ails you
she turns to see finn with rose
ravenna almost smiles
rose holds her gaze defiantly
ravenna walks over admires her face smiles then takes her by the throat and lifts her off her feet
rose opens her mouth to scream but instead of sound energy pours out
ravenna opens her mouth devouring gretas youth and beauty
like a flower blooming her lines vanish
like a flower wilting rose ages until shes as old as the scullery maids
snow white hears approaching footsteps and watches as a guard opens gretas cell and tosses someone in
the guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away
snow white peers through the shadows
cant quite make her out
ravenna stares into her mirror now rejuvenated
mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all
the bronze ripples
the mirror man pours out and reforms
my queen you have defied nature and robbed it of its fairest fruit
but on this day there is one more beautiful than you
more beautiful but she is the reason your powers wane
she wont live to see tomorrow
who is it
give me her name
ravenna is shocked by this staggers a bit
back to mirror i should have killed her as a child
she is my undoing
she is also your treasure queen
it was wise to have kept her close for the innocence and purity that can destroy can also heal
hold her heart in your hands and you shall never again need to consume youth
you shall never again weaken or age
immortality without cost
ravenna laughs overjoyed
finn appears out of the shadows
all he sees is his sister laughing giddily into her mirror no sign of the mirror man as if it exists only in her head
snow white paces in her cell frantic
two magpies appear in the window
she looks at them and watches as they flap their wings
like theyre trying to tell her something
she moves toward them
they jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside the cell window hovering there
she is confused but notices a roofing nail right where the magpies hover
snow white reaches a hand out the window and touches the loose nail
her fingers move it back and forth as it bit by bit breaks free
she yanks hard
at the nail almost has it when the magpies flutter again and blast away as if afraid snow white hears footsteps down the hall
she steadies herself yanks once twice and the nail comes loose
she jumps down lies in her bed again just as finn unlocks her door leaving the key in the lock and walks into the cell
he stands there until she turns her head slightly to him
she doesnt move grips the nail in her closed hand as she tries to lure him closer with her eyes
did i wake you
snow white shakes her head gently
are you always awake when i watch you
she looks away
youve never come in before
my queen wont allow it
she wants you all to herself
im afraid of her
not of me
he cant help himself reaches out and touches her arm
its alright princess
you will never again be locked in a cell
what does she want from me
his finger move from her hair to her cheek stroking it gently and then to her chest
with his free hand he reaches back for his dagger
your beating heart
snow white grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks at him
as he leans closer she notices his off hand the dagger and she slashes him across the face with the nail
finn reacts grabs his face in pain yells and snow white kicks him and runs for the door locking it behind snow white hurtles down the steps to gretas cell
she is shocked by what she sees
rose now an old woman looks to her
snow white fumbles with the keys
rose holds out both her hands
snow white takes them looks into her eyes
finn stumbles to the cell door clutching his face
snow white tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away
snow white runs down the steps into a corridor and sees armed guards appear at the other end
she hurries into another tower bolting the door shut behind her and charges down the steps
snow white bursts outside into the light
she almost hyperventilates at all the air the sky
then she runs through the courtyard toward the portcullis
the magpies fly right into her face then away telling her to follow
she does and heads straight for the small opening at the base of the castle wall the entrance to the sewers
as the magpies rise she slides on one hip plunging into the darkness below
the guards follow but cant squeeze through the opening running towards the portcullis instead
snow white splashes through the deep stinking sludge
the old rebel thomas with his sons body draped over a mule looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling open the gates
the princess has escaped
he stares in surprise as riders gallop out
snow white is swept out of the sewers into the sea
seaweed wraps itself around her limbs pulling her deeper
into the depths but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface gasping for air
snow white swims ashore
she looks up and sees a maze of large rocks stretching out
she sets off in one direction when the two magpies reappear urging her to follow them in another direction
she scrambles after them and sees a white mare waiting for her on the beach lying on its side allowing her to climb on
the mare raises itself and is away in a flash
galloping hooves skim the surf riders pursuing snow white
snow white rides towards the village only its unrecognizable now most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or boarded up
a group of people including children skeletal hungry desperate see her approach and move out to greet her
she stops her horse for a moment gazing past tears at the devastation and the state of villagers all around her
at first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer their faces reveal dangerous desperation and she gallops off looking back to see the queens men giving chase
the fields and woods are even more devastated than the village
farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down
all around snow white the world is stubble and ash
snow white crests a hill her mare rearing as she sees the dark forest a vast wall of primordial trees
a mist seeps from the forest like an evil miasma
snow white hesitates then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on shadows everywhere
the mare charges into the misty bog then suddenly loses her footing
she rears throwing snow white onto the safety of solid ground
snow white tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away not wanting to endanger her life
she tries again but the horse backs farther away from her
slowly theyre separated by the swirling fog as snow white sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear
reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest the riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick in terror
one guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog frightening off the others
despite their concern for snow white the magpies are also too afraid to enter the forest
snow white hurtles through the trees a ghostly fog rising up all around her then trips over a root landing face first in a patch of large mushrooms that unleash
clouds of pollen
she coughs trying to fan the pollen away but its too late
she hurries on but the hallucinations come thick and fast now the trees look almost human hooded figures peering at her through the haze
she sees owls without eyes
black oil oozing out of tree trunks
a hanging vine reaches down and touches her like a hand and now she runs more terrors rage at her from the swirling mist
she stumbles again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the trees
huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark descending on her until she finally passes out
from high above we see the unconscious snow white as mist whirls in a circle
castle beach night
d n a vicious waves crash into rocks
natures anger on display
from above we see ravenna striding furiously in a circle of her own
she is livid a whirling dervish
shes fairly spitting as she barks at finn who stands in the middle of the room his face bleeding
how is it an innocent young girl makes a fool of my brother
armed only with a nail
if shed had a sword shed have taken the whole castle
were in front of her behind her on her face on her feet she picks up the pace as well as the volume you swore to protect me
do you not understand what the girl means to us
this is my future
this is everything
more az there is no one i can trust in this place
there is no loyalty
and then she stops on a dime turns to him marches right up to finn and belts him
he staggers a bit then picks himself up looks at her
she was chased into the dark forest
shes likely already dead
she screams and slaps him viciously
shes no good to me there lost
i must have her heart
you have failed me
finns had enough he erupts at her have i not given all to you
she takes this softens unexpectedly and almost smiles
have i not given you all
she raises her finger and touches his face
his wound heals instantly and his face grows calm
indeed my queen
dont fail me again finn
i have no powers in the dark forest
bring me someone who knows it well
someone who can hunt her
a omitted a finn speaks to a group of people assembled by his men
the queen demands the services of someone to navigate the dark forest
the villagers stay mum shaking their heads
no one goes into the dark forest
you will be compensated
still no takers
an old timer stares right at finn steps forwards
theres one man
where might i find him
in the inn
the sound of smashing wood
they turn to see eric flies through the inns wall and lands in a heap on the ground
appears hes finished
he tries to focus as broch strides through the same hole and stands over him
you owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl
i have it right here in my pocket
if youll just help me up
eric holds his hand out
broch walks over suspicious
when hes close eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in brochs chest
broch flies back then strides to eric and kicks him in the side
i want my money
actually i seem to have drunk it all
youre welcome to it when it comes out again
broch hauls him back up to his feet
he takes a swing but somehow the drunken eric dodges the blow swinging back at him
everyone has come out of the inn to enjoy the fight
eric lands a body blow to broch who doubles over
eric comes in for the kill winds up and swings missing broch but hitting a horse on the ass
it kicks its legs sending him flying
he lands in a heap and drops his head back
hands lift him and drop him in a horse trough
hes underwater for a few seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head eyes still closed
he opens his eyes to see finn gazing down at him
that explains it
the queen demands your presence
cant you see im having a bath
ravens perch on the ledges and lurchers scamper about
eric still drunk filthy damp clothes face bruised enters the room eyes the ravens then looks at ravenna on her throne
she watches him curiously
hes more interested in the aged scullery maids including rose who are staring at him accusingly
he has no idea who they are or what hes done wrong
finally he comes before the queen sizing her up like a tavern beauty
my brother tells me you are a widower a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest
finn looks on standing nearby
one of my prisoners has escaped there
then hes dead she
she shoots finn a pointed look then looks back at eric
then she is certainly dead
bring her to me
eric holds her gaze uneasy at the request
ive been to the dark forest enough times to know im not going back
you will be rewarded handsomely
coins no good to me if im lying dead with crows picking at my eyes
ravenna steps off her throne now approaching him
there may be more than gold in the offing
why is her life of such value
that is none of your concern
ill determine what concerns me thank you
she smiles moves even closer to him
you will do this for me huntsman
and if i refuse
ravenna nods to the guards who pull their swords
dying to cut him to pieces
eric eyes them then looks to her and in complete honesty do me the favor
i beg of you
so you wish to be reunited with your beloved
eric reacts instinctively grabbing her by the throat
the courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their swords but ravenna holds up her hand
my wife is none of your concern
something about her face the fact that she enjoys his hand on her throat makes eric queasy
he releases his grip stares right at ravenna
ravenna holds his gaze
you miss her
his eyes say yes he misses her horribly
what would you give to bring her back
eric stares at her curiously
you know of my powers
bring me the girl and i will bring back your wife
nothing will bring her back
ravenna moves even closer looks him right in the eye
she is incredibly persuasive as she says i can
believe me huntsman
erics eyes say he wants to believe
needs to believe
a life for a life
mist drifts across the moors the primordial trees looming up ahead
finn and eric ride side by side four guards following
you fought in the west
against the armies of the five kings
eric nods without looking at him gazing at the forest
you must have seen a great deal of death
death is everywhere
come now youre being modest
there is a difference between gutting a deer and gutting a man
how many did you kill
its not something i counted
with a smile nor i
but i recall every face
there is no greater delight than battle
eric finds this unseemly but prefers not to engage
come now huntsman what do you feel when you watch a man die
this takes finn aback not an answer he was expecting
after a beat
and what of them
at the tip of your sword
what do they feel
id enjoy knowing
eric looks at him realizing from finns face that it is an honest question
only difference between you and i is i never found a wife to save my soul
youll need one
he stops his horse and nods
they are all stopped at the entrance to the dark forest fifty meters ahead
the guards gulp back their fears
finn tries to hide his own
even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up
vines and roots have grown over snow whites body as if the forest is trying to devour her
she opens her eyes sees her wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror struggling to free herself of her bonds
we pull up up up until we can see the full scope of the dark forest
eric and finn have tethered their nervous horses and stand at the entrance to the bog
do exactly as i do
eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is on them
the others catch on and follow stepping on stones of their own
once theyre across the bog and onto dry land finn takes a step forward but eric grabs his arm
exactly as i do
eric puts a cloth to his face gesturing for finn and his guards to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field pops of pollen misting all around
eric stops bends down spotting faint footprints in the dew
he walks faster now finn watching in admiration
snow white finally shakes free of the vines jumps up and senses shes being followed
she looks up at the trees but all she sees are vague shadows
the wind picks up ghostly voices howling in the breeze
shes rooted to the spot for a moment then loses her nerve and runs aext
dark forest day
a eric finn and the guards move through a dark copse of trees
voices and whispers call to them from the wind
eric stops looks around
a continued a pay them no mind
one of the guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he sees a ghostly reflection gazing back at him
he stares in surprise leaning closer
suddenly a barbed tail shoots out of the water skewering him and drags him into the depths
the others turn as they hear a scream but theres no sign of their companion now just the bubbling water
only finn looks unconcerned
eric stops senses something holds up a hand
then darts ahead leaving them flat footed
finn makes a decision to follow and waves for his guards to go ahead of him
they reluctantly follow eric
eric moves quickly then stops listens we see his hunting skills as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the distance he blasts away moving like lightning
snow white feels like the whole forest is pursuing her
running out of breath she hides in some bushes
as she stares into the mist she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze
eric stops and looks around sensing his prey is close
snow white stays low trying to quieten her breathing
eric studies the forest floor
he sees snow whites footprints then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth
snow white peers through the bushes and sees the huntsmans boots approaching
she looks around for something to defend herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades
she cant see anyone now
she looks relieved when suddenly strong hands she fights to get away but he pins her with a foot reaches down and turns her over
his first look at her gives him pause
her face her spirit her youth
she slaps at him he pulls out his knife with one hand while he pins her with the other
then grabs lifts her
let me go
she bites him
he grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts trudging back
shes going to kill me
he ignores keeps moving
sure she is
her brother tried to cut out my heart
he stops looks at her
i swear it
he somehow believes her
eric looks up to see finn and his men approaching
snow white gasps at the sight of finn
hes the one
he came at me with a knife
eric holds her tight one arm around her neck
well done huntsman
hand her over
you cant trust him
what do you intend to do with her
why do you care
finn nods and the guards approach
eric grips her tighter
you want her
give me what i was promised
come now huntsman you did your job well
keep your word and hand her over
hell betray you shut up
hell kill us both i said shut up
he puts his knife to her throat to quiet her
ill keep my word when the queen keeps hers
finn shakes his head and laughs
you are a drunk and a fool
my queen has many powers she can take life or sustain it
but she cant bring your wife back from the dead
his face tells us how much eric wanted needed to believe
the guards keep inching toward eric
eric still with a knife to snow whites throat starts slowly backing up
finn pulls his own sword and approaches
four against one
as they burst toward him he tosses snow white to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife into the chest of one of the guards who crumbles
eric reaches behind grabs both hatchets and faces off with the others
they all rush at once
eric fights off the guards as he raises a hatchet throws it right into finns chest
just like ravenna no blood no wound
finn pulls it out laughs and throws it at the huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree
snow white terrified races off into the forest
they notice her exit but keep fighting
eric fights on three sides now holding his own until finn manages to plunge a sword in his side
eric grunts and falls back
finn races forward to finish him off but eric lunges and flips finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms
eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other guards who look from finn who is dazed to eric who is hurt
finn struggles to his knees shakes his head hallucinating a bit
the guards also trying to cover their noses move forward
eric has a decision to make
and hes injured
eric decides in an instant grabs his knife out of the dead guard as well as his hatchet from the tree and runs after snow white snow white crashes through
then a hand grabs her shoulder eric
he slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth
dark forest finn same a finn is on his feet but still hallucinating stumbling about
the guards are spooked as they look all around
this is not finished
the words echo through the dark forest
dark forest eric and snow white same b eric removes his hand from snow whites mouth
at once she punches him with all shes got
he steps back licks his bloody lip
she takes another swing
this one he manages to grab
get your hands off me
she draws his dagger
he backs off
eyeball to eyeball b continued b get away
who are you
what the hells going on
get away from me
why does the queen want you dead
she wants us all dead
all of us then what makes you so damn valuable
you should know
youre the one hunting me
he backs away
b continued b never get involved in the queens business and what do i do
get involved in the queens business
without warning he walks off
leaving her alone
she follows him
where are you going
away from you love
i need to get to the dukes castle
theres an army there
ill be safe
ive seen sheep with more fight in them
desperate she takes a chance
take me youll be rewarded
isnt that why youre here
youre dead if you return without me
and im dead if you leave me
he turns exasperated with her
then wearily just for arguments sake
shakes his head how much
how much is enough
eric reluctantly prices up the job
well its a long way through the forest and that
thats a dangerous road i couldnt even consider it for less than thirty gold pieces
deliver me safe to the duke
i give you my word
b continued b deep quandary
who are you
she looks at him levelly
maybe thats a question you should have asked the queen
do we have a deal
i dont trust you billy goat
ive given you my word
he spits on his hand
she puts out her hand
he shakes it
i still dont trust you
i dont trust you either
she wipes it on her skirt
behind them a commotion
they run off
c omitted c a ext
dark forest day
a tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light
the mist closes in
snow white looks around the forest unnerved by the haunting silence and the deep shadows
reluctantly she focuses on eric trying to take her mind off the terrors around her
he sits on a log for a breath
well stay the night here
you havent answered me
i dont recall a question
where are we going
he takes a stick draws in the dirt
theres a village
she takes the stick points to a different spot in the dirt
im going to the dukes castle
he grabs the stick back
youll go where i take you
youll take me to the dukes castle or ill go alone
a continued a snow white contd beat looks around as soon as you get me out of the forest
youre rather demanding and not all that endearing you know
a continued a theres a reward that awaits you
there are noblemen there an army
the duke fights
he hides behind walls
i know sheep that have more fight in them
after a beat how much
off her look reward
just for arguments sake
how much do you want
eric considers this not sure how or if to negotiate
two hundred gold pieces
do we have a deal
more a lot more than he was expecting
ill deliver you to safety m lady
i swear beat
its one of my better qualities
shes not sure what to make of this but
he moves to a spot to lie down and gathers leaves
snow white seeks her own spot and comes upon the rib cage of a dead deer a host of beautiful butterflies feeding on its bones
she is shocked
ive seen far stranger things in here
she sits looks to eric
somethings been bothering her
do you think
will they follow us
theyd be foolish to
good news bad news
she looks around
a continued a how far have you travelled into the dark forest
we passed it a few miles back
he opens his flask and takes a healthy pull
were moving over high mountains and valleys now approaching duke hammonds castle
grim faced commanders look on as duke hammond comforts a sobbing man in the firelight
we recognise the old rebel thomas whose son was killed by ravenna
she killed brave lain with only her palm and pulled a dagger from her chest without blood
she cannot be killed
duke hammond has heard enough turns to leave
there is more
the princess has escaped the castle
where is my son
flaming moss is thrown into a puddle of oil and a massive fire lights up the night
william rapid fires his bow at close quarters into a line of the queens supply wagons and the fight is on
a violent his companions are as wild and hot headed as he is roaring with delight as the queens men finally flee
war room duke hammonds castle night
a william enters
you asked for me father
a continued a i have news of the princess
william stares in surprise the princess
ravenna has kept her all these years
she escaped the castle and into the dark he turns to leave im going after her
we dont know if she survived duke hammond grabs him by the arm
you ventured beyond the walls tonight disobeying my orders
we are all thats left william
i cannot afford to lose any more of my men
then i will go alone
and i cannot afford to lose my only heir
you do not know the dark forest
then ill find someone who does
william pulls away
i will not abandon her a second time
william gallops away from the castle walls under the cover of the breaking dawn
moved to a a motley crew of woodsmen stand side to side
finn is eyeing them sizing them up picking a crew
which of you knows the dark forest
a powerfully built yakut tracker aldan and broch both nod
hes selected aldan broch and points to others
as we move down the line we see william hat low trying to look tough
finn selects a few more
load and prepare
you ride for bounty
into the dark forest
the rest of you
as they disperse
william sets his jaw and heads off
the men ride out of the village
suddenly they stop
standing up ahead is william blocking their path
he calls to them
you need a bowman
finn calls back
i have a bowman
william stands unblinking
i said away damn you
william doesnt move
finn turns to the bowman
the bowman smiles draws his bow
before he can loose an arrow two arrows strike the bowman in the throat lifting him off his horse stone dead
william lowers his bow
i said do you need a bowman
finn studies william with dead eyes
village road day
a in the pouring rain a group of fierce bounty hunters ride on horseback when another rider appears blocking their way
a continued a clear the road
but william doesnt budge
one of the other mercenaries grins then rides towards william drawing his sword
he raises it when william unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse
broch draws his enormous battle axe about to charge when finn rides forward and stops him
finn sizes up william
youre quick with a bow
i want to ride with you
you are paying well and i need the coin
have you traversed the dark forest
then what use are you
as you said im quick with a bow
he nods to the guy on the ground groaning with arrows in his thighs
and unlike him i have two good legs
finn considers for a moment then smiles nods to the guy on the ground
william looks at finn gratefully
finn studies him with a curious smile then rides on
from high above we see the dark forest stretching out
dark forest day a snow white approaches a stream kneels splashes her face and brings a handful of water to her lips
i wouldnt do that if i were you
not unless you want your bowels to rip apart
eric has been snoozing on a rock with one eye open
she releases the water stands and faces off with eric who offers his flask of mead
she reluctantly takes a sip spits most of it out hands it back
he smells something walks a few steps bends down and examines a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground
what is it
a continued a a what
you want me to call it by another name
he doesnt need to
its an animal dropping
snow white winces as he kneads it between his fingers and takes a long sniff
a continued a she catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the woods
he moves away though the trees tracking prey
he hears the wind call his name
he stops looks to an outcropping of rocks surrounded by dense forest
from out behind a tree steps an apparition of sara
she hears him call out and follows his tracks
sara holds out her hand
am i dreaming
touch me and see for yourself
eric shakes his head looks around tries to fight it but
her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the rocks
you werent there to save me eric
i called for you but you never came
snow white appears behind and sees eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of lupine eyes await
but eric only sees sara and he continues to move toward her
she opens her arms to him and steps backwards luring him
where were you eric
come to me now
protect me now
a continued a sara im so sorry
forgive me please forgive me
give me peace
he takes another step toward her and buckles thwack
snow white hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood
he hits the ground and she drags him away
he fights back and she jumps on top of him staring right into his face
shes not real
do you hear me
he does and calms
she gets off him and he sits up fatigued by the experience
a low point for him
he reaches for his flask pours the last single drop into his mouth
he tosses it aside
a lost soul
snow white watches him with some compassion
he catches her look gets up and walks away
dark forest open area day b snow white catches up
who is she
the one you bargained for
the one that spoke to you
who is sara
a name youll not mention again
he tosses a knife to her
shes surprised but catches it
feel its weight
one hand to the other
she shakes her head but does so
now hold it business end pointed at me
why are you
he lunges at her and she raises the blade
which is your lead foot
b continued b what do you mean
b continued b he jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward knife in right hand pointed
he starts to slowly move toward her
one step at a time
now stay back
youre too small to attack
you have to parry use your opponents strength against him
raise your opposing forearm
he comes closer
with it you block and deflect an opposing thrust
youll lose meat but you wont die from it
wait until im close
he steps forward
watch my hands not my eyes
he moves even closer
not until you can feel my breath
he moves right up to her
their faces are inches apart
drive it through me
to the hilt
now look in my eyes
dont pull it out til you see my soul
their eyes are still locked
why do i need to learn how to kill
he looks at her
theres a lot you need to learn lass
eric backs away
she nods now focused on him in a way other than as an instructor
he turns and walks away
b continued b where are you going
a single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree
ravenna looking weaker than before stares at it quietly as if she were gazing at snow white
she reaches out and crushes the blossom in her hand turning it into ash
her look is one of conviction
finn reacts as if he heard ravennas words
they have that kind of connection
spooked he continues on
the other trackers follow william looking tense
at the back of the group one of the mercenaries slows down sensing something in the forest
william is still watching finn when they hear a bloodcurdling cry behind them
the mercenarys horse gallops out of the trees without its rider a gaping wound in its side
william and the others look shaken but finn doesnt even turn around riding on
dark forest day
a eric pulls snow white along
beyond a bridge we see open fens the bridge leads out of the dark forest and birds circling on the distant horizon
snow white looks relieved as she follows him down a slope
they hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly eric stops
what is it
it cant be this easy
he quietly unsheathes a hatchet
is this the end of the dark forest
not paying attention uh huh
a continued a how far to the dukes castle
he ignores follows tracks then stops as he sees the stone bridge below leading out of the dark forest
snow white stares at it too relieved
beyond the bridge there are open fens
they hurry down together and start to cross the bridge
theyre half way across when suddenly we see the stones start snow white turns to see a huge creature rearing up troll
eric and snow white are slammed off the bridge and land in the shallow creek below among the carcasses of slain animals
the troll roars and comes after them swinging its giant stone fists
eric grabs snow white and runs as the troll catches up with them eric shoves her out of the way and draws his hatchets
snow white turns and flees
eric runs at the troll
he ducks as a mighty arm sweeps over him darts between the trolls legs and hacks at its leg with his hatchets
the troll falters a bit then a swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the creek
snow white looks back to see eric lying stunned on the ground his wound bleeding again at the trolls mercy
she hesitates still terrified then runs back
the troll towers over the huntsman
it raises its stone hands to crush him when snow white arrives screaming like a banshee
the troll looks around in surprise
so does eric
a beat then the monster turns away from eric striding towards snow she stands her ground fighting her terror pulls her knife
the troll looms over her but she doesnt retreat
she raises an arm just as eric instructed
a continued a eric stares in surprise watching the twenty foot monster towering over the tiny girl
a continued a snow white stares into the trolls eyes seeing something almost gentle in its monstrous gaze slowly losing her fear
the troll stares at her too confused then slowly pacified until it finally turns and strides away
eric stares in disbelief
snow white is rooted to the spot also confused but strangely moved by whats happened
eric rises to his feet painfully and heads over taking her by the arm
i told you to run
if i had youd be dead
a thank you would suffice
its clear he sees her in a different light
she stares back at him
eric holds her gaze struggling a bit then
the sun glints through the thinning trees
eric wades through the deep sludge snow white following in his steps
eric looks at her a moment then suddenly turns away as he sees her expression change ghostly backlit figures emerge on the banks of the marsh now holding bows and
eric looks around for an escape route but everywhere he turns more figures appear
he draws his axe when a figure in a hooded cloak anna appears clutching her bow like a goddess
they say only demons or spirits can survive the dark forest
which are you
eric unsure pulls his hatchet and steps in front of snow white protecting her
which are you
perhaps you are the queens spies
were fugitives from the queen
snow white steps forward into the light
we mean you no harm
anna sees snow white clearly now raises her hood
snow white sees a deep scar running down her otherwise beautiful face
and then a smile
the fenland village is made up of mud huts elevated on stilts to protect them from flooding
where are the men
anna paddles a boat as they approach the village
eric and snow white speak quietly
the boat stops and they get out
the women of the village move from their hut to greet them as they walk into the village
more women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers no men in sight
they all have scarred faces
all the women have assembled alongside the group watching with awe as they pass
they stare at snow white and murmur
they cant take their eyes off her
some even reach out to touch her sleeve or dress
sotto to eric why are they looking at me like that
i dont know but keep smiling
a beautiful little girl lily moves away from her friends and offers her hand
snow white stops looks down at the girl trying not to stare at her scar
a omitted a b ext
banks of the lake fenland village day
b eric sits by the lake anna bandaging his wounds
you have travelled far huntsman
with a heavy burden
snow white is playing with lily
they are making little dolls from straw
ive had worse jobs
and anyway shes not that heavy
you do not know who she is
his eyes narrow
what do you mean
he looks over
aa b continued b who is she
snow white draws eyes upon the doll
snow whites eyes fill with tears
my father showed me how to make them
but hes gone away
lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar
she hands it to her
b continued b shes beautiful
lily smiles and runs off to play
behind her eric appears
its very peaceful
but it makes me very sad
why didnt you tell me
because id think it too fell a task
youd be right
she looks at him
shakes her head
thats not why
its because ive never said the words
she looks at lily playing
im not sure i believe it myself
i never felt like a
alone in a dark cell
fighting to cling to memories
what he looked like
the kind man with the big arms and the wonderful smiles
he wasnt the king
he was my father
eric doesnt know what to say
in time he reaches in his pocket
what is it
ive carried it a long time
what is it made of
gristle from a stags heart
off her look b continued b the stags the most timid animal in the forest but theres a bone in its heart that gives it courage in its hour of
need and makes it the bravest in of all gods creatures
its a protection charm
or so they say
they share a look
was it hers
its the most honest and emotional hes been with her
thank you huntsman
he looks at the sky
its getting dark
he walks away
b continued b snow white lies in her bed
nearby sleep anna and lily
shes so beautiful
that is not a kind thing to say in these times
youth one cannot alter
we have sacrificed beauty to raise our children in peace
and you your sacrifice will come princess
snow white looks to anna surprised
outside the hut same a eric exits and pauses looks back through the flap can see snow white
he walks away

inside the hut same
b you must prepare yourself my dear
for a time soon comes when you must deliver that sacrifice
will you be ready
anna suddenly stops
as if something has disturbed her
she gets up and leaves
what is it
sleep my dear
you must rest
c eric makes his way along the perimeter finding a path through the trees
suddenly he stops
twenty feet away
how can you desert her now you know the truth
aye i know the truth
and thats exactly why she should be as far from me as possible
shes the only one that can save us
she needs you
im the last thing she needs
im bad luck
everything ive ever cared about was destroyed
theres good in you huntsman
i can see it
people have made that mistake before
he heads off into the night
a omitted a snow white awakens
looks around no eric puts it in her pocket
then smells smoke walks outside and looks up to see the sky blazes with burning arrows all raining down on the village
woods same night
a eric moving away from the village spins to see the arrows lighting up the sky behind him
he races toward the village
b omitted b snow white re enters the hut just as a flaming arrow pierces through the thatch and sticks next to lilys sleeping head
snow white pushes lily away from the fire and grabs the arrow
anna screams because a mercenary races into the hut
on impulse snow white backhand stabs him in the leg with the flaming arrow and he tumbles flames burning his clothes
snow white stares at him for a moment his face his pain
anna shakes her out of the moment and they all race out
finn and his hunters scour the inferno on their horses
run rats run
william looks around the burning village in panic
llla omitted llla snow white runs with lily and anna when she sees a fearsome mercenary leap off his horse and stride towards them
snow white faces off with the mercenary
she does as shes been taught waits for him to approach
when hes close enough to grab her slashes at him with the knife
the huge mercenary knocks her to the ground and advances on her
when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder
he falls revealing a young warrior holding a bow
snow white stares at him through the flames with a mixture of recognition and uncertainty
its as if for a moment everything stops as she comes with something from the past
almost like a ghost
or a vision
he nods to her in recognition
she stands perfectly still
anna pulls snow white away as they move through the smoke and the fire
william starts to follow a curtain of smoke swirling around him
eric arrives to see the village in flames
he rushes to the centre of the village pulling a mercenary off his horse and running him through with his own sword then fighting and killing two more mercs as
he makes his way forward
aa finn sits astride his horse like a demon king in the firelight
he spots william in the distance searching for snow white and rides toward him
snow white looks back through the distant flames as she runs when suddenly powerful arms grab her
she flails with the knife but its only eric come on
we must help them
anna sees snow white fighting off eric and shouts you will
eric holds her firmly pulling her away against her will
william jumps on his horse again looking for snow white through the clouds of billowing smoke
finn and aldan ride up
have you seen her
no my lord
finn spits fury and continues to race around frantic
eric pulls snow white onwards the blazing fires from the village lighting up the marsh
he sees a lake up ahead when a figure appears blocking their way
its the giant broch
grinning he unstraps his huge axe ready to face eric one more time
eric doesnt even slow down letting go of snow white and unstrapping his own hatchets
it looks as if its going to be an epic fight but as broch swings eric ducks and drives both hatchets into the giants ribs killing him instantly
they escape into the darkness
ravenna walks up the spiral staircase
she passes an old woman who glances at her
she walks past a few steps thinks she hears a whisper then turns on a heel
what did you say
then shes right in her face the old woman just stares at her shakes her head
theres something in the womans eyes that terrifies ravenna
she backs up retreating then scurries away
ravenna sits alone naked
her spine stretches through her taut skin
in front of her sits the crown on a dark cushion a matted tuft of hair caught on the gilded edge
she stares at it then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of her hair
the word echoes in the palace finn surrounded by smoke and fire is beyond frustration
he screams to the heavens in despair
eric and snow white are far down river
they make their way to the bank drenched and exhausted
snow whites hands shake distraught over the violence at the village
eric looks at her guiltily
why did you come back
i led them there
i am to blame
snow white looks at him with empathy
hes in pain too
i will take you to duke hammonds
snow white slowly nods
eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the trees
it dances on his face and then a huge shadow blots out the light
before he can react fists and boots lay into him
as he protects his face we catch glimpses of brutal figures in battle masks
eric kicks a couple of them away but more of them swarm over him pinning him down in leg locks and choke holds
snow white is treated just as roughly powerful arms and legs pinning her down
she bites one of her captors and he twists her arms behind her back
a noose is slung around erics ankles and hes hauled up hanging upside down
snow white also tied up sits on the ground beside him
a line of dwarves stand before them and pull up their grotesque battle masks
the dwarf leader beith glowers
well well well
the miscreant huntsman
come on beith
is this how you treat a friend
the dwarf leader beith glowers
no you horn beast this is how i treat a friend
he smacks eric with a gnarled stick
woods later day
a snow white and the huntsman are still trussed up like chickens now
the dwarves are grouped together arguing and occasionally throwing angry glances toward eric
as they bicker the dwarves slap and bite at each other like animals
a continued a what did you do to them
i tried to collect the bounty on their heads
a few times
is there no one you havent wronged
eric nods at her
but theres always tomorrow
shut it you hedge pig
the dwarf confab breaks up and they approach
this is my lucky day the puttock i loathe most in the world lands in my lap
it is your lucky day beith
ive got enough gold to keep you in ale for a year
cut me down and ill nion beiths right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist clips eric around the ear
shut your ugly mug huntsman
you had any pennies they would have fallen out your pockets by now
back there in the woods
a short distance
they get the reference dont like it
nion slaps eric again
pull the other one you lying dangler
tell them the truth huntsman
the youngest of the dwarves gus is beaming at snow white with his dirty teeth
what are you looking at
a continued a nothing miss
you been the prettiest thing i ever did seen
he smiles almost sweetly disarming her
snow white looks at her other captors now noticing a blind dwarf muir who sits with his son quert also gazing at her
a continued a just tell me what ive done wrong
tell me what youve done right first
i saved this girl from the queen
out of the goodness of my heart
snow white gives him a look
he calms her with a look of his own
doesnt sound like you huntsman
people not ruttish swine
nion gives eric another smack around the head
quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to snow white
he touches her face and something happens in him
his demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on his lips
so whats the verdict
leave em to rot
or skewer him and leave her to rot
that would work too but my ways cleaner
note coll and duir have this at each other but were comrades relationship
coll also has an incessant cough
a beat for emphasis she is destined
they all trade looks
muir is the spiritual leader of the group and they dare not speak against him even beith
a continued a she is
do you hate the queen
hates a strong word
but not strong enough in this case
my father was king magnus
this carries weight with the group
no one listens to me
if you accompany us to the dukes castle you will be paid handsomely
we dont need their help
you were already lost seeing that you found us
your weight in gold
each of you
the dwarves trade glances literally sizing each other up
thats more than you offered me
goodness of your heart eh huntsman
whispers to coll i get more than you
true but because of your size you eat and drink more which costs more so
a continued a alright well take you but the huntsman can hang both of us
eric looks surprised by her loyalty
so do the dwarves
suddenly duir calls out riders
the dwarves look round to see a dozen silhouetted horsemen appear on the crest of a distant hill
those are the queens men beith better decide quickly
one dwarfs worth a dozen tallsters ill take my time thank you he suddenly stops as dozens more riders appear on the hill
you were saying
cut him down
nion roughly cuts the line and the huntsman drops to the ground as gus gently lifts snow white
they all hurry down the hill
the dwarves and their captives arrive at a rocky outcrop
duir and coll pull back a large root exposing a cave entrance
ah a short cut
all dwarf heads spin at him pissed off
enough with the short jokes
nion raps erics knee with the flat of his dagger
gus cuts snow white loose
nion hesitates then reluctantly frees the huntsman
duir and coll lead the way into a cave
gus pulls snow white to safety just as the enemy riders appear
from their hidden vantage point eric snow white and the dwarves watch the riders searching for them
some gallop on but a small troop remain behind
realizing they have no choice but to retreat further duir and coll signal and the dwarves follow them deeper into the cave system
a shaft of light pours through the cave roof high above bats circling
the dwarves move effortlessly down the labyrinth but snow white and the huntsman have to squeeze through the cracks
snow white and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight
its like a mirage
the air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange humming noise echoes like music
for snow white its the most beautiful sound shes ever heard
next to her nion snorts blasted fairy music
wish i had some wax to stuff my ears
theres plenty of moss
gort scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear plugs sticking them in his ears
snow white is still mesmerized by the fairy music and the shimmering haze
what is this place
the huntsman looks just as dazzled
they call it sanctuary my lady
the enchanted forest
its the home of the fairies
and slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest as different to the dark forest as one could imagine life grows everywhere lush grass proud trees covered in
snow white sees tiny figures flying behind the trees almost too fast to spot the pollen following them in long trails fairies
of the other dwarves only the blind muir seems to appreciate the beauty around him enjoying the vibrations on his face
set up camp
hearty soulful singing
seated among the ruins the dwarves sing a celtic ballad as old as time gus playing the fiddle
coll and duir sit away from the others gazing out with the thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans
that song takes me back to the battle of tylweth gate
a small horde versus an army
pickaxes against swords and spears
them were the days
what happened to your quailing cough
coll shakes his head dunno
the two of them smile then join in the singing
a drunken gort takes a swig of ale and staggers over to gus
play louder you whey face i can still hear those harpy fairies
he takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice out of tune trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies
snow white and the huntsman look on smiling
legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth
not just gold and precious stones but the beauty in peoples hearts
ask me theyve lost the art if they ever had it
when the queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride
and as if to prove it gort and nion sing and share from a flask of rum before they tumble to the ground near muir as the song ends
eric notices the tumble and chuckles
what are you pribbling at longshanks
nothing half wit
im half of nothing
you canker blossom
sing the one
perched on his stone quert nods sings a more cheerful song
eric watches as snow white walks over to muir
before she can say anything
that seats not taken if thats what you were about to ask
she sits on the log beside him
gort and nion eye her
thank you so much sir
its only a log no need to praise me
for defending me
your father was a good man
the kingdom prospered
our people prospered
there were more of you
and that is all muir will say on the subject
gort fills in
one day the group you see before you went down into the mine for a month long shift
gus was only a boy
when we came back to the surface
the land was black everything everyone
we searched but
gort surprises himself by choking up a bit
muir helps out
that was the month your father died
im so sorry
as am i princess
as am i
gus walks over to snow white
i know im a bit spongy to look at miss but would you care to dance with a little un
id be honored
snow white gets up and dances with gus as the song picks up
nion and gort watch her dance with gus
nions not impressed leans in to gort
i dont trust her
and i dont believe in her no matter what muir says
gort is still melancholy
just you and me
do you think there are any of us left
do you think perhaps they were merely banished
as long as the queens in charge well never know
well maybe thats the point isnt it
beat out of the blue i feel funny
hows your gout
nion rubs his leg
gorts look goes from nion to snow white
you dont think it has anything to do with
how much have you had to drink
the huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when beith approaches sitting beside him gruffly
fleecing us of all our rum eh huntsman
what do you say we let bygones be bygones
not yet nut hook
whats in it for you
off erics innocent expression im talking about the girl
is it really just the gold
eric watches snow white dancing with gus then shrugs
im not sure beith
if i had any sense id have abandoned her long ago
beith eyes eric as he watches snow white dance
muir says shes destined
question is huntsman for whom
gus and snow white are still dancing
as snow white treads on his toes you dont mind me saying you got two left feet for a princess
i dont mind at all gus
i havent danced in a long long while
she feels eyes on her turns to see the huntsman watching her with a slight smile
she smiles back and breaks away
do you mind gus
not at all
snow white walks over to the huntsman holds out her hand
youve taught me to fight surely i can teach you to dance
eric trades a look with beith who nudges him on
eric stands and they proceed to dance with her teaching
palms up head straight look me in the eyes
the huntsman moves better than youd imagine
his face even softens as they both enjoy the dance
beith looks on with a smile
a omitted a eric and the dwarves are asleep
flowers have grown around them as if theyve been asleep for months
cull and duir sleep sitting up back to back at the ready
muir also awake and smiling sits against the log his hand rubbing his sons sleeping head
snow white sits amazed drinking in the sights and sounds
animals emerge from the forest squirrels beavers foxes birds
slowly they make their way towards the ruins gazing at snow white
snow white feels the light on her face and to her surprise she sees the two magpies who watched over her at the castle
two beautiful fairies with the deer eyes slip out of the magpies bodies beaming at her
as snow white sits up they direct her to the woods where a dazzling light shines through a tree
as she walks animals fall in alongside her
a little way away gus snores in his sleep
the golden light crosses his face and he wakes up
as he opens his eyes he stares in wonder then quickly wakes the other dwarves
they all stare in amazement now even the blind muir
eric is the last to wake up wondering what the fuss is all about
they rise and follow to she stands beneath the giant tree facing a majestic white hart
the air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden light
no ones ever seen it before
the excited muir grabs his son quert by the arm
the white hart bows before the princess father
sure enough the hart lowers its head before snow white
muirs face is lit up in the golden light his blind eyes shining
its blessing her
what are you talking about
you have eyes huntsman but do not see
you who have been with her the longest
eric doesnt understand
she is life itself
she will heal the land
she is the one
so youre saying she is destined
muir can only shake his head
no one listens to me
cant you feel it
are you ailments not gone
gold or no gold where she leads i follow
the other dwarves trade looks
nion the last shrugs
as snow white strokes the harts neck the golden light brightens engulfing her
the hart roars in pain and bolts
the fairies and animals scatter in all directions now their sanctuary violated
eric looks up to see aldan the yakut emerging through the trees on horseback notching another arrow to his bow
a fierce wind rips through the sanctuary now shadows spreading where there was once light
eric sees finn appear on horseback looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness
the huntsman grabs his axe
so do the dwarves pulling on their battle masks
william emerges through the trees to see aldan aiming his bow at snow white
he rides into the yakuts horse knocking him off balance just as he fires the arrow narrowly misses snow white thudding into a tree
gus grabs her by the hand
he runs with her into the forest
aldan turns on william furiously drawing his curved sword but before he can swing the dwarves attack both men eric only has eyes for finn
they stare at each other in the roaring wind then finn gallops into the forest after snow white eric runs in the same direction william fends off the furious dwarf
attack then rides off in pursuit of snow white aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against coll and duir to give chase all around the forest the shadow of death is spreading
gus runs dragging snow white behind him
galloping through the trees william spots them up ahead riding faster
bow and arrow at the ready eric runs after finn
all around him the forest is darkening
he follows the sound of galloping hooves when suddenly they stop
he stops too notching an arrow to his bow peering into the gloom and listening
theres a tense silence then suddenly he hears a noise
he spins around ready to fire when he sees its only finns riderless horse galloping past he realizes too late that its a trick finn explodes out of the darkness
catching him a glancing blow with his sword coll and duir leap up at aldan trying to drag him off his horse but hes a ferocious fighter driving them both back william spots snow white up ahead
she disappears into the trees and he rides faster
she erupts from behind a branch and pulls him off his horse
gus races over and raises his axe gus no
guss axe stops inches from williams eyes
snow white recognizes the young warrior staring at him in surprise
i saw you at the village
william looks up at her out of breath its me
snow white stares in disbelief tears of surprise welling in her eyes
gus looks even more confused lowering his axe
william slowly rises to his feet gazing back at snow white when they hear a twig snap gus hears it too spinning around to see aldan with an arrow notched
to his bow gus launches himself and takes the arrow meant for snow white
before aldan can load another arrow william fires an arrow of his own striking him in the chest
the yakut topples over dead at last but still astride his horse
snow white falls to her knees in anguish cradling the dying gus
he smiles weakly holding her gaze then whispers i shant leave you miss
eric charges into finn with a cry of rage
finn deflects the blow and hurls him back into the trees
driven by fury eric charges again but finn uses his anger against him ducking under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own eric crashes into another
his eyes are still full of hatred but his body is weak
finn smiles in contempt from a few yards away
i captured many girls but your wife was special
she fought and then she begged
for her life
you should know she called for you
how do you know her name
eric is shocked desperate
she told me
just before i slit her throat
eric notices a fallen tree trunk behind finn dead branches sticking up like spikes
finn steps toward him
now you can look for her in the other world and beg for her forgiveness
finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow when eric lunges
he throws himself at finn his momentum carrying them both into the dead trees spiked branches the branches pierce finns body their tips digging into erics flesh
finn howls in agony finn writhes fighting to pull himself free of the branches but eric holds him down even as the spikes dig into him forcing finns wounds to
stay open unable to heal
sister heal me
the shadowy energy swirls around finns wounds but as the branches keep the wounds open they cannot heal ravenna sits at her desk she is small and alone in the
vastness of the hall
she stares off into space a quill in her hand parchments laid out before her
then suddenly her body convulses the bottle of black ink spills dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto the floor
she falls to the floor writhing
she fights hard at first but then begins to weaken her power fades as she ages
then she stops
forgive me brother
finn gasps as he feels ravenna cut him off
reacts in horror and heartbreak as his wounds stop trying to heal
finn twitches for a moment looks to eric
then the light goes out of his eyes
he is finally dead
slowly eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his flesh
she has broken their connection
we pull away from her
ravennas head is down depleted forlorn
ink pools around her bony hands
but when she raises her head we see conviction hatred and determination
you will pay
you will pay
still bleeding from his wounds eric hurries back through the forest until he sees snow white and the seven dwarves gathered around guss body chanting a low prayer
eric stares in surprise then notices william
who is this
beith is about to reply when william answers for himself
my name is william
i am duke hammonds son
you look familiar
eric dodges a bit with what is the dukes son doing riding with the queens men
i was looking for the princess
to protect her
the princess is well protected as you can see
and who are you
the man who got her this far your lordship
im grateful for your help but i will take her from here
youll have to wait for your voice to break before you give me orders william draws his sword in indignation and eric draws his axe
anyone can draw steel boy
it takes a man to use it
william is about to react when snow white turns
leave him huntsman
hes our friend
he glares but his eyes glisten with tears
snow white is still bowed over guss body sobbing mourning
the prayer chant ends
nion spits with anger and walks away
we need to convene
they all follow him a few steps away where they have privacy
what is it nion
this is what happens when dwarves mix with men
we always come out worse
we have big hearts and well fight for any cause but for what
for some new queen to call us runts and turn us out of our homes again
ive nothing against the girl but im not willing to risk my life for her either like poor gus
beith considers quietly the other dwarves listening too
whispers to coll does this mean were not fighting the queen
not sure yet
what about the gold he promised us
what use is gold if youre dangling by your bony neck you jackdaw
aye the queen will flay us alive for helping her
the white hart blessed the girl
nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes but beith listens
even our own legends speak of the redeemer who will heal the land
that little mutton
all the lions and wolves in the kingdom have tried to defeat the queen and failed
why not a mutton
the dwarves stare at him incredulously
gus lost his life because of her
he gave his life for her
as will i if necessary
look at us
look at what weve become
they trade looks
they know where hes going with this
we were once proud now we pilfer and drink and dream of when we didnt
i am willing to die for a chance at becoming the man i once was
and that is the last word
quert puts his arm around his father and kisses his forehead
beith and gort trade a nod and a smile
quert sings a celtic melody of loss as gus is laid out on a funeral pyre
all around him the bright colors of the enchanted forest have faded and there are no animals and fairies to be seen
its as if ravennas shadow has passed here too
the tough battle hardened dwarves shed tears like children
snow white looks heartbroken as beith lights the pyre
as the flames rise a haunting lament carries us into the next scene querts song continues as the group make their way across the barren hills and into the mountains
william walks alongside snow white glancing at her tentatively
he waits until the others are out of earshot
im sorry i left you
she looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes
if id known you were alive i would have come sooner
we were children william
youre here now
they reach some steep rocks and eric turns around offering snow white his hand
she takes it and he helps her up the slope
william looks on feeling jealous
beith follows duir and coll up to the summit of the hill then looks at the surrounding peaks
well rest the night at the top of this hill
mirror chamber royal palace day
a from above ravenna stands in the center of the room surrounded by ravens
she raises her arms and they take flight circling above her
she lowers her arms and their swirling pattern lowers until she is completely surrounded by them a tornado of ravens
she has become them and they her
a fire crackles
the dwarves have set up camp
coll and duir sit on a rocky outcrop coll braiding duirs hair while duir sharpens his axe
thats not how you sharpen an axe
you sharpen downward
my father taught me how to sharpen an axe
well he taught you wrong
he raises the axe only half in jest
you want to test it
william watches snow white warming herself by the fire then heads over to eric who is also keeping watch
its not my place to give you orders
i misjudged you
eric looks up
he shakes williams hand
and i you
william looks over to where snow white is
we shared a childhood together before she was taken away
she hasnt changed
she has that same light inside her
surely you can see it
eric looks at her
youd be blind not to
if we can just get her to the castle the people
the people will see it
shes our only hope huntsman
well get her to the castle
dont worry about that
ive thought about her constantly
every time i closed my eyes
i can hardly believe ive found her
you should tell her
shed appreciate it
im afraid to
not telling someone how you feel and living with the regret is a lot worse
a snow white sits on a rock away from the camp reflecting quietly
she stares out at the surrounding mountains and valleys when she suddenly senses a presence behind her
she turns in alarm but its only william
william smiles back gently and whispers
walk with me
they walk into the silver birches
up here its as if nothings changed
the world looks beautiful again
it will be
when you are queen
snow white turns surprised by his words
the people of this kingdom hate ravenna with their very fiber
its strange but
i feel only sorrow for her
william is taken aback by this but pushes on
once people find out youre alive they will rise up in your name
snow white stares back at him uncertainly
it takes more than a name
i an not my father william
you are his daughter
and rightful heir
a continued a he steps closer gazing into her eyes devotedly
if i had a choice i would take you far from here
and keep you safe by my side
but i have a duty
and so do you
they hold each others gaze snow white still ridden with doubt
a continued a how do i inspire
how do i lead men
the same way you led me when we were children
i followed you everywhere
ran when you called
i would have done anything for you
she looks touched by his words smiling softly trying to make light of them
thats not how i remember it
they gaze into each others eyes close enough to kiss
i remember we were always arguing
she trails off lost in his gaze
he stops leans closer and kisses her gently
they stay like that a moment then william pulls away holding something in his hand
snow white smiles as she sees that its an apple
with a mischievous smile william holds out the apple for snow white just like he did when they were children
i remember this trick
with mock innocence what trick
snow white holds his gaze then snatches the apple from him before he can take a bite raising it to her lips with a smile

silver birch trees mountains day
a snow whites limbs are petrified frost spreading across her cheeks but her eyes are open taking in everything
ravenna leans over her smiling
you see child love always betrays us
a sigh escapes snow whites lips condensing into steam
by fairest blood it was done and only by fairest blood can it be undone
you were the only one who could break the spell and end my life and the only one pure enough to save me
she draws away unwrapping her sacramental dagger
you dont realize how lucky you are never to know what it is to grow old
a continued a she raises the knife about to cut out snow whites heart and now we see the huntsman standing there axe in hand the william blasts with a
sword at the screeching birds eric goes after her now swinging his twin hatchets
the ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them fiercely william joining in until the shrieking birds finally take to the sky and vanish on the
eric and william rush to snow whites side now
the dwarves arrive too hurrying through the snow
william cradles snow white in his arms trying to revive her but its no use
eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison drain the color from her lips
he kneels down and gazes at her
william turns to the dwarves
what are you looking at
the dwarves stare back at him gravely but dont respond
hes desperate now irrational you are dwarves healers save her
he grabs the blind seer muir shaking him
muir stares back at him with his empty eyes tears glistening in them
william collapses in prayer the light in snow whites eyes almost gone
eric looks over sees williams grief is as great as his own and finally stops fighting
snow white looks up at william as if she wants to say something then the light in her eyes goes out
the dwarves are heartbroken
eric looks dazed
william leans down and kisses snow white gently on the lips
he pulls away
hoping against hope
and then nothing happens
she lies there lifeless and white as the falling snow
on all the faces realizing that she is truly gone
a continued a what do we do
a continued a what we promised
a flock of ravens whips across the sky swooping into the ravens burst into the mirror room and crash to the ground
their swirl becomes ravenna on all fours looking worse for wear surrounded by dead ravens
the effort depleted her
she growls as she crawls toward the mirror
what must i do
where is she
where have they taken her
the mirror just reflects ravennas weary and aging face
ravenna releases it all looks up and quietly pleads
there is nothing more pathetic than grovelling desperation
you sicken me my queen
the mirror starts to ripple distorting ravennas face into something even more awful
plains near castle day
a a wide shot as the group carries snow white toward the castle
snow whites body is wrapped in a shroud laid out on a funeral board
william leads it with tears in his eyes
eric and the dwarves walk alongside the body all lost in grief
duke hammonds castle day
a crowds move in to see and mourn the processional
eric is careful to lower his eyes a bit to keep from being recognized
funeral chamber duke hammonds castle day
b torchlight flickers
snow whites body is laid out on a funeral bier her face angelic in death
tent flaps open
william stands before duke hammond and his council of lords arguing his case with fierce passion she died for us
for our cause
we cannot hide behind these walls and watch this land die with her
your grief clouds your judgement my son
my grief makes me see clearly father
funeral chamber duke hammonds castle night
a eric steps from the shadows up to snow whites body flask in hand
here you are
where it ends
dressed up to pretty
he takes another pull from the flask
like youre asleep about to wake up and give me more grief
am i right
the he touches her arm
feels the fabric of her funeral dress
looks at her face and breaks a bit losing the drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still alive
you deserved better
and then he answers her
she was my wife princess
that was your question that went unanswered
sara was her name
when i came back from the wars i carried with me the stench of death and the anger of the lost
i wasnt worth saving
but she did so anyway
i loved her more than anything or anyone
and then i let her out of my sight and she was gone and i became myself again
a self i never cared for
you remind me of her
and now you too are gone
you both deserved better
and im sorry to have failed you as well
a continued a snow white lies pale and motionless on the bier
eric reaches down and gently brushes a strand of hair off her face
you will be a queen in heaven now
he leans down and kisses her lips
and sit among the angels
he finally turns and leaves the chamber tossing the flask aside disgusted with himself
as we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on snow whites beautiful face
for a long time she stays perfectly still her lips part ever so slightly and she lets out an almost inaudible whisper of breath
a continued a snow whites eyes open gazing up at the ceiling her thoughts far away
theres a strange calm about her now a quiet acceptance as if she knows what she must do
a omitted a eric carrying all his gear eyes down strides toward the gate and a clean getaway
open the gate
hes been recognized
percy catches up to him
they share a look and eric sighs
yes i recognized you
we have no quarrel with you
you returned the princess to us
and for that
he hands over a heavy sack of gold
eric takes it weighs it in his hand
god does he need it but
keep your money
he hands it back and turns for the now open gate
he exits the castle and as the doors begin to close shouts of joy
eric spins wanders back to see what the commotion is all about
a omitted a the council session continues
duke hammond stares at william gravely
my duty is to protect the people who come to me for help
i will defend them with my last drop of blood but i will not abandon these walls
i cannot afford to believe in miracles
he suddenly stops as the shouts outside the tent get louder
he goes to the flap opens it to see snow white still dressed in her white funeral robes stands at the top of the stairs that leads down into the
courtyard duke hammonds castle a everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath snow white
her heart pounding she makes her way down the stairs
all are riveted by the sight of her as if theyre looking on an angel or a living miracle
eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he too is stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd
its a miracle
duke hammond embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of her walks up the stairs to greet her
several generals follow him but stay a few steps below them
hammond takes her by the hands as they speak
he cant believe his eyes we thought you
no my lord
william below stares at her in joy while his father still looks dazed
a continued a you must rest i have rested long enough
her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction
i am ready to ride by your side my lord when you face the queen in battle
the duke looks speechless for a moment
there will be no battle your highness
the best thing you can do for your people is stay safe behind these walls
that is all i thought to do when i escaped
but i have come to learn there is no peace while others suffer
have you not learned that
the queen cannot be defeated
she cannot be killed
and therefore there can be no victory
snow white hesitates her heart pounding then replies i can vanquish her
i am the only one
she told me so herself
duke hammond starts to object but snow whites eyes and now her feet lead her down the stairs to her people
when she reaches the last step now at their level she speaks
i have been told that i represent you that it is my place to inspire you
that is wronct
i am not a queen not a leader not a warrior
absolute silence in the courtyard as people lords knights hang on her every word
you represent me who ive become your hopes your courage your will inspires me
i have also been told my place is not to fight but to stay here safely behind these walls
i will not
a continued a snow white contd i hold life sacred even more since ive tasted freedom but ive lost my fear of death
a continued a heads nod people murmur approval
she has them in the palm of her hand
if ravenna comes for me i will ride to meet her
and if she doesnt i will ride to meet her
looks back at generals alone if i must
back to people but if you would join me i will gladly give my life for you
for this land and its people have lost too much
eric and the dwarves couldnt look prouder
duke hammond stares at her for a moment then bows
a beat then william follows then all the lords and knights
his eyes fixed on snow white eric bows too
then muir and his son quert
then coll and duir
and finally even gort and nion
snow white stands alone overwhelmed by the faith of the kneeling warriors and the responsibility on her shoulders
mirror chamber royal palace night
b ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror
yes my queen

old and lying on the floor
ravenna smiles girding herself for the fight to come

snow white in full armor sits astride a white horse her coat of chain mail glittering in the torchlight
she looks like an angel bearing her fathers standard
eric rides up next to her
she is happy to see him
back from the dead and instigating the masses
so the huntsman fights for something other than himself
only if you have need of a brutish soldier
she smiles moved
he turns his horse to full back but before he leaves
you look fetching in mail
a bugle sounds and c ext
c the dukes army pours out of the great gate their torches blazing in the night
from above it looks like a river of lava coursing through the valley
duke hammond roars at the top of his
voice urging his riders on and now we see their vengeful fire spreading across the plain
ravenna and the general on the balcony
all around soldiers and guards scurry to look busy lest they draw her wrath though some cant help but notice her aging appearance
ravenna sweeps away a map held out to her
i dont need a map to see youve failed me fool your face is map enough
yes my queen
where are they now
a half days march away
every hour their numbers grow
rebels peasants and deserters rally to them wherever they deserters
yes my queen
black knight general contd they say the kings standard flies again
and now ravenna understands snow white
let them come
let them break their hearts and skulls on these castle walls and bring my prize to me
you must not harm her
i need her heart still warm with blood
as she strides away
to soldiers victory comes
plains wide dawn
a hammonds army thunders toward the castle
and then they arrive at horses crest the hill
and now all around snow white we see her army not just duke hammonds men but rebels peasants women all willing to follow her
eric and william ride nearby
one of the dukes commanders arrives to brief him
my lord we only have a few hours before the tide comes in
not long enough to breach the castle walls
well either be completely exposed or drowned by the ocean
is there any other way in
no my lord
gloom descends on the gathering
if we are at the portcullis when the sun clears the horizon it will be open
they all look at her
an unmistakable brown sludge pours out of a sewage tunnel into the sea
it is the same sewers where snow white escaped
we hear the sound of splashing oars and grumbling we look out at the faces of the dwarves peering inside
were promised gold and volunteer for manure
how low has the dwarf race sunk
hi ho boys
off to work
and they begin to crawl inside
ravenna stares out
on the distant cliffs she sees the banners of the rebel army
a ray of sunlight pours through the clouds lighting up the tiny figure of snow white
come to me
coll and duir wade through the sewage their axes held up in front of them not a flicker of emotion on their faces
seven dwarves against an army
i like them odds
behind them beith covers his nose from the stench gort and nion look like theyre about to be sick and muir and his son bring up the rear the brown
slime almost at querts mouth
times like this i wish i was taller
crashing waves break against the rocks washing over the sand
duke hammond stares at the rising tide in concern
we dont have much time
then we should ride now
theyll have the portcullis up by the time we arrive
duke hammond considers then raises his sword
snow white glances at the huntsman
he breaks rank and rides closer to her
theres a tense silence then the duke brings down his sword and his riders charge down the dunes
ravenna stares out confidently her eyes still fixed on snow whites distant banner
the trap door in the courtyard rises and we see beiths head pop up his expert eyes scanning the courtyard until they spot the portcullis
ravennas guards hurry past without seeing him taking their positions on the battlements
beith slips back down into the sewer
the gatehouse is fifty yards away to left
half a dozen guards and fifty armed soldiers
archers on either side
pulling out a huge knife give us a couple of minutes
snow white rides across the dunes
all around her riders gallop along the surf waves crashing around them
ravennas castle comes into the view the portcullis still down
coll and duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard so small and fleet theyre almost invisible
ravenna looks on as her archers take their positions and her artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets
snow white suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle walls
eric realizes what they are and rides faster
the pinpoints of light soar up in the air growing larger and brighter until we realize theyre fiery missiles
eric forces snow whites horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards from her
fire rains down on the dukes army now panic spreading in the ranks
snow white takes her fathers banner and holds it aloft rallying the men and riding on
two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse
before the other guards can react coll and duir are on them moving fast and hard the assault over in seconds
beith sees coll and duir signal from outside the gatehouse
waves crash over the rocks
fireballs explode in the sand
snow white sees men falling all around her tears welling in her eyes but she never falters
as william rides on he sees the castle walls through the smoke the portcullis still down
the guards in the gatehouse look over as the door splinters and the dwarves come crashing through in their battle masks
even though theyre outnumbered the seven fight like demons until the enemy are subdued
on the castle walls archers replace the trebuchets
snow white holds up her shield to protect herself from the sea of arrows
up ahead the portcullis is still down duke hammonds forces circling back as theyre trapped against the walls
you must turn back
i gave my word i would stand with them
a huge pulley controls the portcullis
beith gort and nion draw their pickaxes while coll and duir tie up the guards
now lets see how this works
with a mighty blow of his axe beith shatters the chains holding up the pulley
the counter weights go flying down and the portcullis comes shooting up then suddenly stops jammed
the dukes army are still circling the gates stones and hot oil pouring down on them from above
arrows slam into snow whites shield but she still refuses to retreat
beith peers down at the jammed counter weights in frustration when he hears a fierce cry
gort jumps on the counter weight trying to bring it down
nion follows yellingatthetopofhis voice
duir puffs up his proud chest and leapsontoo snow white sees the portcullis shoot up now the dwarves hanging onto the counterweights for dear life
smiling in relief she gallops through the open gates with eric and william
the dukes riders charge into the courtyard
archers fire at them from every corner of the castle but they raise their shields and leap off their horses forming a defensive wedge
from her balcony above the portcullis ravenna watches her own men being slaughtered she enjoys the spectacle ravenna does not care one bit about those men
her eyes are locked on snow white
let her come to me
ravennas soldiers are merely there to hold snow whites army back
she has planned the whole thing calculated every move
like a spider waiting in her web with no concern about her soldiers situation ravenna remains calm and calculated
ravenna turns around and leaves the balcony to the throne room
snow white rushes into the castle
as soon as she passes the door a dozen of ravennas men come outside closing the trap
now eric william and their men have to fight the road block
in the courtyard ravennas men are losing more and more ground
snow whites army will win
eric and william fight like demons twice as fast twice as strong
they must pass
a omitted a b omitted b snow white storms into the throne room
she is breathing heavily a mix of fear and determination
the raven claw ring taps resonating through the halls
ravenna stands at the top of the stairs the mirror room behind her
snow white approaches
it ends today
i have come for you
my rose has returned looking at gus small sword with a thorn
a omitted a a continued a a int
throne room day
a eric william and a dozen men rush in
ravenna smiles raises her hand
ill show you thorns
in a terrifying tremor the black ceiling of the throne room starts to shatter into millions of shards
snow white turns back to see william eric and hammonds men the shards fall down like razor blades
the men try to protect themselves
some are caught out and skewered to the stone floor
ravenna looks down at them in complete satisfaction
the millions of black shards circle around eric and his men completely blocking them and keeping them away from snow white
avenge your father who was too weak to raise his sword
the millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven foot tall razor sharp creatures
the dark faeries ravennas ultimate soldiers
snow white looks at eric and william unable to help her
a continued a eric william and the other men are completely surrounded by these creatures they move so fast
eric tries to step away from them
to no avail
one of the creatures rises in front of william
william tries to slash the creature
his sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right away
the dark faerie opens its mouth and screeches
william gets smashed aside saved only by his shield
the dark faerie grabs the soldier right behind william and sends him crashing into the wall
snow white walks up the stairs torn and powerless
she looks at eric one last time
eric looks back as he fights off a dark faerie with his two shields
he knows he does not have much time left but he is ready to make the final sacrifice
mirror chamber day
b snow white braces herself and promptly follows ravenna into the mirror room
now snow white is exactly where ravenna wants her to be
the two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers
ten years you locked me away
ravenna seems to relish this
and every day every hour led you to this moment
it burned inside you
it drove you forward and here you are
listening only to her heart snow white lunges towards ravenna and tries strikes at her with her sword
ravenna steps aside and with very little effort throws her to the other side of the room
fight for your land
for your loss and for hope
b continued b snow white slams and slides across the floor she stops under the archway at the top of the stairs
she is dazed
ravenna treads on her back then grabs her hair pulls her head up to see william and his men being massacred
watch them die
you gave them hope and they believed you
you have lead them to their deaths
how foolish your followers
throne room same day c eric is trying to stay alive
he rams a faerie into a pillar
shredding the stone the faerie explodes in shards and reforms immediately behind eric
grabbing the first man in sight the faerie throws the poor soldier to the other side of the room
on the opposite side another faerie slides faster than the blink of an eye grabs the man in flight extending its cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death
it is like carnage in slow motion
d omitted d e moved to b e william is being overrun by a school of shards
the shards shape up into a faerie taking william up high
in a violent arm blow the faerie projects william onto the banquet table six feet lower
the table shatters in splinters william bouncing like a rag doll
spinning around on its way down the faerie skewers a soldier and impales another one into a pillar
the faerie drags him ten feet up tearing and digging deep into the stone column
enraged snow white jolts her body and frees herself from ravennas grasp
she swings her sword at ravenna
she parries every attack with her bare hands
snow white is breathless
one more strike
but ravenna blocks it again and this time she doesnt let go
face to face with snow white you were never ready for this princess
snow white struggles to get out of her lock
ravenna is too strong
snow whites wrist is twisted
she holds her sword tight but cant use it
ravenna forces the twist
her fragile bones crack
snow white screams in pain
the sword drops on the ground
i am the only
ravenna back hands snow white sending her crashing to the wall
cuts on her face
ravenna looms closer through the fire in the middle of the room
she stands in the fire unaffected
for snow white it is a vision of pure hell
so much power so much hate
i have lived many lives
ravaged entire kingdoms i have been given powers you cant fathom
you cannot defeat me
you are but a child
ravennas skin blisters and heals
ravenna raises her arms and black shards start to cover the walls behind her
entombing them in darkness
the trap closes
but you are right
it is over
ravennas laughter pierces snow white like a dagger
she feels powerless and lost spitting blood and exhausted
what else can she do
snow white stands up stumbles her right arm limp blood dripping down her face
she stares at ravenna she wont back down
she will never back down
william stumbling upon the dead bodies of his comrades sees the shards starting to obstruct the entry of the mirror room
he runs towards it
eric sees him and goes for it too
behind william and in front of eric a dark creature shapes up
william doesnt see it
the faerie claws william from behind through his armor stopping him still and sending him backwards against a pillar like a stone ricochet
the faerie spins its head degrees and goes from turning its back to eric
to facing the huntsman
eric stops and tries to pull back
the faerie powers up gathering shards from another creature doubling in size and density
like a fire hose of black shards the dark faerie unloads a stream of razor blades at eric
eric digs his heels in
slowly grinds and slides on the floor double shields up
the shields are being shredded
one shield gives way completely torn slicing erics arm
eric has one shield left
he kneels down
it is a matter of seconds
ravenna approaches and grabs snow white by the throat squeezing hard
snow white is chocking
i will never stop
i will give this wretched world the queen it deserves
ravenna slams snow white down onto the stone floor next to the mirror altar
snow white stretches for her sword as ravenna approaches
ravenna un sheaths her dagger
for a life
snow white tries to reach her sword with her left hand but it is too far
she tries to drag herself a little closer
still too far
ravenna straddles snow white raises her dagger above her head smiling relishing the imminent death blow
the black tomb has closed in around them
eric watches despair wrought on his face as the knife falls
in a spell incantation by fairest blood it is done
in the blink of an eye snow white blocks her strike reaches for her dagger and plunges it into ravennas chest just as the huntsman taught her
ravenna gasps locks eyes with snow white
whispers to ravenna by fairest blood
it is undone
ravenna looks down
three drops of blood fall onto snow whites armor
ravenna stares in shock and disbelief
she pulls out the dagger her face starts to age
ravenna is aging at an incredible pace
her body gives way and she slumps to the floor below the mirror
she looks at the mirror above her gasping reaching out her pale eyes looking for a friend a miracle
the black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and fall to the floor
william is on the ground out of strength and has given up the fight
a dark creature is slowly close to reaching williams face with his sharp claws as william tries to hold the creatures arm with his bare hands severely bleeding
the faeries have slowed down dramatically
eric grabs a sword on the ground and slices the faerie in front of him
the faerie shatters
william looks at eric in desperation begging for help
the two men lock eyes
a silent understanding
eric throws his sword and blows the other dark faerie in pieces releasing william
a silent pact has been made at this moment between the two men
the remaining dark creature freezes
eric and william are barely alive
snow white approaches ravenna and kneels beside her ravenna is weak
she ages dozens of years within seconds her face shows no anger no hate just a strange understanding
why all of this
snow white overwhelmed by compassion places her hand on ravennas chest
ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on snow whites
she gently taps on snow whites
in a strange and affectionate motherly way
eric and william exhausted and battered climb the steps of the mirror chamber
it is over
ravenna stares up at snow whites face in a shining halo of light above her from the ceiling
whispering to snow white see child
we are bound
whispers to ravenna calming it will be all right
ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile on her face
the clouds move in the disc of light above snow white
the light falls over ravennas face
the light fades out of her eyes and she dies
in the cloister gardens a blossom flowers on the apple tree and the world is born again in death ravennas beautiful blue eyes are wide open fixed on the halo
of light that surrounds snow whites head
backlit in a golden hue
a crown is placed on her head
packed for the coronation
duke hammond and bishops surround her
snow white smiles and looks out at all assembled her subjects her friends the people shes come to know and love meeting the eyes of rose looking young and beautiful
again anna and lily the seven dwarves who all wipe away tears
she sees william off to the side smiling looking on adoringly
but her eyes continue through the crowd looking eric in the very back of the cathedral near the door
their eyes meet as if theyre the only two in the room
this lasts several moments until hail to the queen
and then the huntsman smiles and leaves
the land was healed and the rightful queen brought an age of peace and prosperity
we drop down from the castle to find the huntsman on horseback heading toward us
as for the huntsman
eric goes under the village arch back toward the forest
he returned to the forest where he belonged
