he is anxious to be a real father to jim but has never learned how
jims mother tense and immature she has never found the husband she married

because of his wounding mother he anticipates destruction in all women
and yet he wants to find a girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness
judys father a junior partner in a law firm
boyish attractive and debonair
because he is frightened by the adolescence of his daughter judy his only recourse is to criticize her
judys mother self centered and frightened by the coming of middle age
she feels that judys blossoming youth is threatening her wifely position as the desirable object of the husbands attentions
judy the victim and the result
at sixteen she is in a panic of frustration regarding her father needing his love and suffering when it is denied
this forces her to invite the attention of other men in order to punish him
beau judys brother

plato son of a divided family an absent father and a traveling mother he feels himself the target of desertion

warmth he needs and cannot find
buzz a sado masochistic boy of seventeen who acts out aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order to hide his real sensitivities and needs
he was probably rejected by both parents and must constantly court danger and must constantly court danger in order to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth
helen crunch moose goon chick cookie mil all searching for recognition in the only way available to them all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at home all creating an outside world
of chaos in order to bear the chaos they feel inside
they are soldiers in search of an enemy
a deep night sky
camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight
on the final note of the bell camera is full on the milky way and there it rests just long enough for a burst of easter singing to arise
the hymn is sung by the crude unmatched voices of children
camera pans down to include spire of a church
camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing
camera pans off window to show long shot
suddenly revealed crisp and sparkling with lights
camera pans down and over a lonely street full of parked cars
the singing diminishes but a thread of it remains
a car has just parked
the headlights snap off
a man emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat
he slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows
he must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights
as the man walks by the lot still whistling a group of figures rises silently from the grass figures who have been lying in concealment until now
they step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the man
at the sound of their boots the whistling stops
the man glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him filling the pavement
a street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young
the man moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases
he begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too
suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures
they are upon him and around him quickly
nobody speaks for a moment then one of the boys grins
his name is buzz
he is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity
friendly cool that was pretty what you were whistling
whistle some more
the man whistles a nervous phrase trying to make a joke of the situation which he doesnt understand
continuing suddenly you got a cigarette
oh i think so the man fumbles in his pocket finds a pack and drops it in his nervousness
the figures wait until he picks it up
he offers one to buzz
continuing filter tips
smiling encouraging you smoke it
smoke it dad
smiling uncertainly the man puts the cigarette in his mouth
buzz still smiling takes out a packet of wooden matches
continuing ill light it for you dad
buzz ignites a match and holds it near the mans face for a second searching it
then he ignites the whole box under his nose
the man shrieks and his packages fall
buzz slaps him sharply his smile gone
the camera pans away as the figures enclose him and holds on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its wrappings
it begins to dance madly on the pavement then runs down
the feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey
then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared
there is a moment of awful stillness then we see a boy coming down the street alone
he is quite drunk and he slips once
this is jim a good looking kid of seventeen with a crew cut and wearing a good suit
the spilled packages on the pavement stop him
he bends down to see what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the wreckage
he smiles and winds it up
he sets it on the sidewalk and sits down
he watches it dance for a moment happily
a siren is heard distantly growing louder
jim pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and releases it for its dance
superimpose title rebel without a cause starring as siren rises piercingly close and jim looks up we close shot
throbbing light of police car
the siren screaming wildly then dying
the sound of brakes
camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the entrance of a precinct station
two officers dismount bearing between them the struggling jim
they bear him up the steps and in through the double doors
inside precinct station
a large open space onto which several corridors converge
in the middle is a sergeants desk really a quadrangular counter in the center of which the sergeant stands
there are a few glass walked interviewing rooms which open off the area and several benches lining the walls
the scene is one of confusion activity and waiting
the arrested pass in custody of officers
present among others at jims entrance are judy who is blonde and sixteen
she sits on a crowded bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness
on a bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty little mexican children without shoes or socks
the oldest is a boy of four who is protecting his little sister who in turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her
standing at a corner of the desk is a docile undersized boy of fifteen named john plato crawford
he is shivering
with him is a large negro woman his maid
jim comes through the doors and is led to the desk
one of the officers presents a brief report to the sergeant who examines it
mixed up in that beating on twelfth street
this says he was picked up there
they had him on the carpet for an hour at headquarters
all right you want to lean him against something
stand him over there
the officer leads jim to judys bench and stands him against the wall beside it
jim is frisked a look of prayer on his upturned face
the officer finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take it but when jim asks to keep it the officer hands it back and moves away
another officer enters and leads the prisoner who is sitting next to judy into another room
jim sits beside her
he smiles at her but receives only a chilling look
he winds the monkey up and sets it dancing on the floor but she is not amused
camera pans to show others reacting to the monkey with pleasure
we see plato look up and smile a little
camera stops on the mexican children who are smiling too
a bald juvenile officer named gene squats before them smiling
you going to tell me your name now
the little boy shakes his head
touching genes bald pate wheres your hair

sympathetically aw gene laughs as another juvenile officer enters and pauses to look at the children

inside small office as judy comes in ray following
he indicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk

he makes you feel pretty unhappy

well see if your dad will come and get you
judy looks up hopefully
unless you really dont want to go home
silence would you rather stay here
camera moves close on judy
she looks up and speaks very quietly
the wail of a siren is heard
judy looks off through the glass wall toward jim
ray is heard dialing
jim sits with his head back eyes closed
as the siren mounts louder jim opens his mouth and imitates it a long forlorn wail
shot plato and negro woman
plato smiles faintly and moves out toward jim negro woman following
camera pans with them
plato sits by jim
she stands over them
jims wailing continues
jim plato negro woman
an officer moves into shot
jim continues for a moment
thats enough static out of you

the officer moves out
the negro woman bends over plato who is shivering violently

plato shakes his head
jim notices him

plato wants it but shakes his head no
ray and judy seated as before
judy is still gazing through the glass
your mother will be down in a few minutes judy clearing what

startled my mother
ray signals to a woman officer just outside and leads judy to the door
outside door as ray turns judy over to the woman officer
shes being called for

judy doesnt answer
ray goes back inside as camera leads the woman officer and judy past jims bench
camera stops on jim plato and the negro woman
jim stares at judy and whistles but gets no reaction
gene enters and comes to the john crawford
come with me john
plato rises and goes with gene the negro woman following
jim is alone
he closes his eyes throws his head back and gives another siren wail as camera moves close on his face
jim looks up suddenly scared
then he smiles mysteriously and staggers to his feet
jims parents and grandma framed in the doorway frozen
they are all dressed in evening clothes
the mother is a very chic but rather hard faced woman
the father is an unfeathered man
the grandma is the smallest also very chic and very bright eyed
jim as he faces them
where were you tonight
they called us at the club and i got the fright of my life
where were you tonight jimbo
he says nothing
father laughing uncomfortably
you think im funny
jim turns suddenly and walks to the glass wall of the office behind which plato the negro woman and gene are visible
he looks through the glass partition which separates him from plato
continuing why didnt you take my jacket
jim is seen through the glass
he moves away
plato is still shivering cracking his knuckles
do you know why you shot those puppies john
silence is that what they call you or do you have a nickname
a murmur plato

plato looks up as jim and his family move into the next office
jim smiles at plato who returns it feebly then looks away embarrassed
you know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist
smiling a bit head shrinker
laughing oh mrs
crawford dont believe in them
well maybe she better start
jim his parents grandma and ray are gathered in the small room
jim is humming the ride of the valkryies to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in what is happening around him
ray suspects this is something more than mere disinterest so lets the humming go on in order to discover its real purpose
grandma watches everything like a tennis match reacting with soft little sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy
no one pays any attention to her
for a moment no one talks
ray watches jim as he hums
then the father shakes his head and looks up
i dont see whats so bad about taking a little drink
i definitely dont
i did the sa hes a minor mr
stark and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink
chuckling say listen to jim in intimate half humorous disapproval jim dont hum
jim merely rolls his eyes at her then away but continues his humming
i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too
when was that

jim stops humming and shrugs

silence jim is fighting his emotion but his eyes grow wet
then what is it
i cant even touch you anymore but you pull away
i want to understand you
whyd you get drunk
you must have had a reason
jim stares straight ahead trying not to listen
was it because we went to that party
silence you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into its no place for kids
a minute ago you said you didnt care if he drinks
he said a little drink
exploding youre tearing me apart
stop tearing me apart
you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back thats a fine way to behave
smiling well you know who he takes after
ray pushes him out the door firmly and into office vacated by plato and gene
excuse us a minute
very overwrought sure
ray and jim alone
someone should put poison in her epsom salts
jim turns away from ray
hang loose boy
im warning you
wash up and go home
big tough character

how come youre not wearing your boots
suddenly jim flings himself at ray who deftly flips him past and drops him near the desk
continuing too bad you didnt connect

you want to bug us till we have to lock you up
leave me alone
i dont know why

jim starts crying

i dont know what gets into me but i keep looking for trouble and i always i swear you better lock me up
im going to smash somebody i know it

jim smashes his fist against it letting loose for a moment
ray watches then sits near him
that why you moved from the last town

and they think they are protecting my by moving
you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there

ray just nods
continuing he called me chicken
and your folks didnt understand
they never do
so then you moved
they think ill make friends if we move
just move and everythingll be roses and sunshine
but you dont think thats a solution
jim is silent he picks at his nails
continuing things pretty tough for you at home
she eats him alive and he takes it
jim stares at his family through hole in door
what a zoo
he always wants to be my pal you know
but how can i give him anything when hes i mean i love him and i dont want to hurt him but i dont know what to do anymore except
pretty mixed up
if he could if he could what

its easier sometimes than talking to your folks

you calmed down enough to go back now
smiling you serious
ray smiles and opens the door
rays office as jim comes towards his mother and forces himself to kiss her
all right darling
she rises and takes his arm
they start out through the door into the hall followed by grandma and father
to ray this was all very unfortunate but he made a mistake and hes sorry so were not going to have any more trouble
hes always been a lovely boy lovely
grandma if you tell another lie youre going to turn to stone
offering ray three cigars have some cigars
no thanks i dont smoke
go on give em to your friends
no thanks very much mr
frank he doesnt want any
jim grins at ray who nods
they all leave
ray looking after them shakes his head and lights a cigarette
we see jim and his family pass through the main door
waiting to enter in the custody of some uniformed police are buzz and the kids we saw at the opening sullen and truculent
as they march into the lobby and jim grows smaller in the distance the music comes up and out
a rabbit comes running down the alley followed by a group of young kids screaming with pleasure
as camera pans with the group the littlest a boy of five stops near us looking after the disappearing group
the shouts of the children wane
judy rushes out from a backyard beyond him
she is carrying school books and a bag lunch
she wears a polo coat against the winter wind
the boy who is her brother beau looks up but doesnt move
judy stops at her gate
a car careens down the alley past him
judy and beau seen through a window in jims house
jim is in f
looking out through the curtains
yelling what are you trying to do get yourself killed

jim turns from window and passes camera
full shot jims dining room
the mother is just settling a plate of eggs at jims place

jims backyard as jim comes out of the kitchen door into the early sunshine

jim blinks pauses and sees judy
he takes off his tie and puts it in his pocket
then he starts across the backyard camera panning with him to full shot
the alley with jim coming out his gate judy and beau visible beyond
he stops again
all right go to school alone
she starts down the alley
beau skips after her and starts tightrope walking the gutter gravel
judy glances at him briefly but continues
jim follows a few yards but on his side of the alley
continuing hey didnt i see you before some place
judy ignores him but something self conscious happens to her walk
jim runs across the alley
judy stopping as jim enters

an auto horn stuck in the distance

jim and judy as the car horn blowing wheels into view above them and comes careening into the alley
judy sees it and moves a step away from jim
ill bet youre a real yo yo
yelling over horn goodbye
yelling im not so bad
judy is moving toward the car
car full of kids as it comes to a jolting stop near judy
the boys wear suede coats leather jackets black peggers boots
their clothing is not uniform it is the air they assume which is uniform swaggering self conscious piratical
someone is always combing his hair
the driver is buzz whom we recognize as the leader of the stomp gang we met on easter
he wears a leather jacket
with him are chick a slight bespectacled lad crunch buzzs first lieutenant cookie a hanger on goon a character and the girls helen and millie
the kids are screaming as buzz jams on the brakes

during this jim has gotten his car and has driven up

pointing right that way
pointing left that way
pointing up that way
simultaneously the kids laugh wildly
the radio blares
judy lays her head on buzzs shoulder and his arm goes around her as the car zooms away
jim looks after them a moment then follows
wheels spin in one after another and drive straight into their slots
as the nearest bike moves in med
plato just getting off his motor scooter
he comes forward passes camera which pans with him then stops as the school is suddenly revealed
music starts with a crash and keeps mounting through the following
plato sighs and moves away from us to join the parade of students filling the main approach
parking lot as cars scream into their places noisily
jim gets out of one and comes forward
a motorcycle roars by just missing him
jim stares off and starts to move as camera pans with him to another angle
another crash of music
jim moves toward the parade
mid way down main approach
a number of kids pass gossiping happily as they greet each other for the first time since vacation
camera searches over them and stops upon our special group moving toward us buzz judy and the rest all abreast
others must park at their passage or be elbowed out of the way staring resentfully but not daring to challenge the groups priority
plato runs forward past them
door from within bouncing from hand to hand as students enter
plato moves through the door and disappears in a milling of kids
judy enters with her group and moves on with them
monitor inside corridor
the monitor is an athletic letter sweater boy with an arm brassard that bears the letters hc
kids pour past him
hi can you tell we where i go
im just starting here
pointing at brassard mr
hell tell you where your home room is thanks a lot
jim moves out
shooting past a row of steel lockers
the clash and slam of doors as kids throw in coats pull out books and primp for the day ahead
plato comes to his locker which is the nearest and opens it
jim moves toward us from the distance
crowded at the entrance to a classroom in f
are judy and her pals
they are sneaking a smoke passing the cigarette from one cupped hand to another
as jim comes near judy sees him
so do the others
they fold their arms across their chests and whistle we are the girls of the institute all but judy
jim glances at her and continues on past camera
a bell starts ringing crazily over the music
he is straightening his tie in the mirror
above it pasted to the locker door is a still of alan ladd
in the mirror we can see jim moving past
plato sees him too
he wheels around and stares
to himself hi
the strident music of the students diminishes
the ringing of the bell stops
there remain only jims footsteps
jim moving off down the corridor
plato is in f
looking after him
he slams his locker and starts after jim moving at the same speed and hovering near the wall
the footsteps of the two boys echo stonily
they are alone
jim stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the corridor
plato stops too
jim looking at the notices
plato drifts in several yards away and hangs near the wall watching jim who doesnt see him
jim reads insert bulletin board attention all juniors and seniors planetarium field trip pm sharp
jim and plato as jim turns from bulletin board and starts away
clearing his throat hi
you remember me
i dont think so im sorry i made a mistake
jim starts toward camera as plato after another look turns in the opposite direction and walks away from us smashing his fist against the wall as he goes
jim stops full in camera
his face clouds trying to remember
he turns full around to look after plato then turns back and continues on his way
the footsteps fade
planetarium seen from the parking lot a great dome crowns it the city lies below
camera picks up jims car maneuvering through the crowded lot
a few other late comers are dashing up steps to planetarium
jim drives into a small lot behind observator parks then runs to observatory entrance
lobby as jim runs through opens door of theater and passes inside
sky full of stars seen past jims head
this is not our sky
it is a replica of it projected onto the dome of the planetarium
the stars slide their tentative ways in an ever changing pattern
one of them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as we watch
music of the spheres is heard a high threatening tremolo
for many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star increasingly bright and increasingly near
jim looks around for a seat and passes down aisle
seen beyond him is the projector moving slowly its great dumb bell head sparkling with pin points of light
jim takes a seat in front row
plato in the row behind him moves over a seat to be nearer
they exchange looks
normal students watching intently
as this star approaches us the weather will change
the great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide and the seas will turn warmer
a dry elderly man in a stiff white collar
he is seated at a desk the light from the reading lamp spilling upward onto his face
the last of us search the heavens and stand amazed
for the stars will still be there moving through their ancient rhythms
some watching some taking notes
an old lady teacher in f
taps the heads of two kids in the row before her
they stop their whispering
she smiles at them
the familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed eternal unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planets birth and its
plato staring upward
orion the hunter
plato looks off
jim from platos angle
jim is seated in the row ahead of plato
his lips are parted as he looks up
leaning forward what
surprised once you been up there you know you been some place
gemini the twins
judy and buzz
buzz has his arm around her
he is nuzzling her ear
she is blandly watching the dome
continuing cancer the crab
buzz pokes judy who looks at him
he curves his wrist toward her opening and closing his first two fingers like the pincers of a crab
im a crab
so do the others
jim plato behind
seen from judys angle
jim turns at the sound of the laughter and smiles
taurus the bull
in good imitation moo
he waits for approval
judy buzz and group seen from jims angle
he is in f
they are staring at him
flat yeah moo
thats real cute
hey hes real rough i bet he fights with cows
they turn from him
jim withers and looks front
judy smiles a little and looks away so the others cannot notice her amusement
sagittarius and aries all as they have ever been
plato leans in and touches jims shoulder lightly at first then harder
jim turns to him
you shouldnt monkey with him
hes a wheel
its hard to make friends with them
i dont want to make friends
he turns back unhappy at having revealed himself
judy buzz crunch
jim seen in b
the kids are whispering among themselves and pointing at jim who looks up and notices
he is getting uncomfortable
and while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance full shot
the star rushes nearer looming larger and larger
the music rises in tension and volume
has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came
jim and plato staring upward cringing back into their seats as the light on their faces increases
music is up loud
the dome seen past platos head
the heavens grow brighter as the star plummets near
music at crescendo
destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire
the sky is blasted by a wild flash of light
music reaches explosion
the stars appear again
faces of normal kids watching seriously very impressed
continuing the heavens are still and cold once more
in all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond the earth will not be missed
jim and plato looking up
through the infinite reaches of space the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed
and man existing alone seems to be an episode of little consequences
plato ducks his head down on the back of jims chair
jim looks at him
thank you very much
the lights go on
the rustle and confusion of kids stretching after sitting too long
jim rises and ruffles platos hair
hey its over
the world ended
plato looks up at him
what does he know about man alone
lecturer as he reaches over and turns a dial
morning song by grieg comes on softly
old lady teacher rising
she stares around at the bustling students and claps her hands sharply but the noise is barely heard above the tumult
shrill may i have your attention
may i please have your attention
classes will meet at the busses outside
may i have your attention
to herself the heck with it
she picks up her coat and bag
planetarium parking lot
school busses and autos some new and some heaps are parked in f
beyond is the dome of the planetarium
kids mill about some already driving off in their cars
one bus already full pulls past camera
front of bus seen from within
driver in f
kids swarm up the steps and enter
plato is among them but keeps looking back for jim
plato boards the bus and pauses near the driver to peer through windshield
his face clouds
judy and group
seen from platos angle through windshield
they are standing idly in a loose line near buzzs car
they are looking back toward planetarium
front of bus seen from within
plato turns suddenly and pushes his way past the kids who are boarding
bus in f
beyond it judy and the group are visible
plato squeezes out
john where you going
i forgot something
ill get a hitch
plato moves quickly past the teacher who climbs in
the door slams the bus moves away
plato stops and looks after it
the last cars are clearing the lot
only jims and buzzs remain
plato looks at the small waiting group
the group seen from the rear
plato in the distance facing them
what you looking at
plato wild eyed with fear
he runs off camera panning with him
his goal is the planetarium entrance visible beyond
he races toward it frantically
the group looking off after plato
buzz nearest camera pulls a switch knife from his pocket and pops the long blade open
judy stares at it then looks up at buzz apprehensively
crunch sits down on the bumper and lights a cigarette
planetarium as plato rushes in out of breath stops and looks around
in distance he sees jim leaning over the pendulum pit smoking quietly
plato doesnt move
jim hasnt even looked up
screaming as if he were yelling fire
whats your name
a little quieter plato
its a nickname
plato goes over to him camera following until they are close together both leaning over the rail
listen i told you not to fool with them
now theyre waiting for you
thats why i came back
i just dont want trouble
he has a knife
i saw it
gee look at that thing swing will you
do you think it never stops
its perpetual motion
oh i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it
go go go
plato walks cautiously to the door and starts outside camera following
kids corner of observatory with plato leaning out of door seeing them pulling back quickly
inside display lobby as plato pulls back through the door
jim seems to have disappeared
plato stares around frightened
jim is looking at another exhibit whose mechanical voice is heard
coming with him theyre still there
they watch the exhibit a while longer
jim do you think when the end of the world comes itll be at night
in the morning
plato looks up questioning
jim smiles and shrugs
i just have a feeling
they start moving camera leading
if you dont want trouble i know a place we can go jim looks up at him
its a big mansion and we could sneak around there and they wouldnt even know
you could be safe they turn a corner quickly
doors to balcony from inside as jim and plato come to them from behind camera fling the doors open and step outside
balcony as jim and plato come onto it lean on the parapet
plato points off
there it is
high long shot
it is falling into elegant ruin casting long afternoon shadows on the great lawns and promenades
closeup plato looking urgently at jim
should we go
jim and plato
platos back is to us
jim looks past him and sees something
quietly the shadows are getting long
plato turns to look too
long high shot
jims car is where he left it
into the driveway like logs driven before a sea the shadows of the waiting kids appear and advance until the kids themselves come into view
they pause there a moment then look up
smiling le soleil tombe dans la mer
the kids scatter along the wall at the foot of the balcony stairs
buzz goes to jims car knife in hand and stands silently
jim and plato staring down from balcony parapet
at last jim moves out past camera
jim and plato
judy in f
the two boys walk down the stairs
camera pans with them as they reach parking lot level and start walking past other members of the group
jim and plato coming forward
buzz from jims angle
as camera moves in toward buzz standing alone at the car he suddenly bends down and slashes jims tire
there is the hiss of air escaping
buzz straightens and smiles past camera
jim inhaling sharply in shock and suppressed anger
full shot over jims car
group in b
jim and plato approach the car
jim stops and looks down
buzz stands smiling and puts away the knife
the tire slashed the wheel rests on the ground
shooting between group and buzz toward backs of jim and plato who are looking down at car which rests on its rims
jim turns and moves toward group
he stops looks from one to the other and smiles nervously
then he looks straight at buzz
wearily you know something
reproachfully you watch too much television
the group and jim
judy has come to buzz stands on the wall above him
hey hes real abstract and different
im cute too
suddenly goon starts clucking softly like a chicken
one by one the others pick it up
buzz the last crows
the group and jim
the group gives a quick short laugh
jim as he takes off his glasses smiles
shakes his head disapprovingly
you shouldnt call me that
plato watching anxiously
buzz with judy watching above him
jim enters shot until he is close to buzzs face
he looks up at judy
camera closes in until we are tight on the three
the heads are nearly touching
softly to judy you always at ringside
you always travel in this rank company
buzz clutches jims hair and jerks his head up
he cracks jim smartly across the face with the palm of his hand
judy looking at jim
her eyes clear in recognition
the group and jim as jim tears free and comes at buzz slugging
but buzz with a laugh leaps onto the parapet and turns the knife in his hand again
jim stops short
the group and plato move in around him
i thought only punks fought with knives
this is the test man
its a crazy game
les jeux de courage
he is smiling
his arms are around the shoulders of the kids who flank him
wetting his lips machismo
somebody find him a knife
plato seen between heads of mil and cookie
cookie holds up a switch knife and tosses it over into the circle
circle as the knife falls at jims feet
jim stoops and picks up his weapon then faces buzz
then he springs his blade
you know the action
just sticking jab real cool
buzz hops from the parapet
they begin stalking each other
buzz slides his knife from hand to hand trying to hypnotize jim
suddenly he pokes out and pricks jims shirt
the group sighs ole
jim makes no effort at self defense
buzz pricks jim again ole
as he maneuvers what you waiting on toreador
i thought you wanted some action
jim cuts out half heartedly
big brave bull
come on fascinate us
i dont want trouble
furious suddenly you crud chicken
youre wasting our time
buzz viciously slaps jim across the face
jim lashes out and misses
buzz hops back
yeah thats pretty close
how about a little closer toreador
cut off a button and you get to join the club
outside entrance of parking lot
a uniformed guide of middle age stares past camera
cries of ole are heard in the distance
the lecturer appears running
he stops short at what he sees and blinks in the sunlight
theres your audience
oh i dont think so
from the school
jim is covered with sweat and about to drop
he is getting the worst of it still refusing to defend himself
he is looking on in despair
suddenly with a cry plato pushes through
inside circle as plato comes through
his eyes are wild
he holds a tire chain in his hand
hes got a chain
smiling as he sees plato hey
buzz trips plato quickly and kicks him while hes down
crunch grabs the chain
all right you want it you got it
suddenly jim transforms
he bores forward expertly pricks buzz again and again
cries of ole greet him
buzz is surprised
we hear only the breathing of the combatants
beyond we see the guide approaching swiftly
the lecturer trails at a safe distance
he looks up
his smile fades
group as they look off and see the guide and lecturer approach
buzz and jim are both breathing hard
plato is getting to his feet
split for what
couple old poopheads
he folds up his knife and puts it away
so does jim
you satisfied or you want more

the guide bursts in among them
the lecturer remains on the fringe
all right all of you start moving

whats the matter with the nice man

whynt you go suck on something sweet
you think youre tough
i got a son twice your size and i can still handle him
dont lose control mr
i think if we just explain explain to these
they think they own the world
the world is round
the world is flat
all the worlds a stage
there is wild laughter from the kids as they close around the guide and start edging him away up the steps toward the planetarium balcony
the world goes round the sun
goodbye proud world
i got the world on a string
the worlds my oyster
a fish eater
they are gone
the lecturer looks after them then comes to jim
jim looks down at his shirt
there are spots of blood
plato opens it spits on a handkerchief and starts to wipe the blood away
smiling wanly to jim sometimes the world is too much with us isnt it son
what was the disturbance
are you all right
i scratched my mosquito bites
im fine thanks
jim impatiently closes his shirt
are you really going to meet them
whats a chickie run
a single light is burning
jim steals in from the kitchen peers cautiously into the living room then starts up the stairs
a crash is heard above
jim stops undecided whether to go or stay then moves quickly up the stairs no longer trying to be quiet
jims house as jim rises into view at the top of stairs
he sees a figure on hands and knees mopping something off the rug
leaklight from the staircase dims details
an apron is tied around the figures waist and its bow sticks bravely in the air
the figure straightens and turns around smiling
it is the father
he is neatly dressed in his business suit but wears a mary petty apron
jim leans against the wall shaking his head and trying not to laugh
the father laughs unhappily trying to make it all seem a joke
you thought i was mom
its just this get up
the girls out and i was bringing moms supper
giggling and you dropped it
laughing too yeah
i better clean this up before she sees it
he starts dabbing among the spilled dishes with a wet cloth
jim watches him
let her see
what could happen
the father continues dabbing
dad the father looks up at him
jim touches his fathers elbow bringing him to his feet
they look at each other a moment then jim goes to his bedroom
the father goes back to mopping up the mess
inside jims room as he comes in shuts the door and throws himself miserably on his bed
he writhes as if the pain he feels were physical
outside radios are heard in the night tuned to different stations
he feels under his jacket and holds up his hand to the moonlight
there is blood on it
he reaches up and takes his alarm clock and is setting it as camera glides to his window and holds over the rooftops
judy stands near camera looking up at the moon
the radios seem louder out here
one breaks through
time now for the seven oclock news
friends the next time you go shopping
she wheels around
the father standing erect on back porch silhouetted against a window
what are you wishing for judy
she hasnt moved
softly i wasnt wishing
i was looking at the moon
backyard featuring the father
we see him now as a tall and handsome man
there is something boyish and appealing about him
singing lightly man in the moon how came you there up in the sky where you are shining floating so high in the frosty air
oh say man in the moon
judy comes forward stands below him on the step
her look is adoring
astonished how did you know that
we used to sing it in school
smiles dont look at me with such horror
they had schools in those days
but the same song
i think its fantastic
we were romantic then too are you and mom home tonight
nothing only itd be nice to spend an evening together for a change
with us old creeps
come on we have to eat
rising daddy he looks at her
he turns away and goes into the house
she hesitates and then follows
something in the moods has changed
he has neglected to hold the door for her
judys house as the father comes to the head of the table and takes his seat
three places are set
she stands above his chair looking down at him as he drinks his tomato juice
quietly afraid didnt you forget something
judy doesnt answer but leans down and kisses him quickly on the lips
continuing shocked whats the matter with you
judy freezes frightened
he collects himself a little
continuing youre too old for that kind of stuff kiddo
i thought you stopped doing that long ago
very hurt i didnt want to stop
the mother enters briskly from another part of the house an attractive brittle woman of thirty five
didnt want to stop what
i was talking to dad
i didnt kiss her so its a big thing
calling to kitchen bertha
you can serve the souffle
to father fish souffle
to judy you dont have to stand there darling
drink your tomato juice
judy slides into her chair reluctantly and unfolds her napkin
i guess i just dont understand anything
im tired judy
id like to change the subject
id like to thats all
girls your age dont do that
you need an explanation
very low girls dont love their father
since i got to be sixteen
she half rises to kiss him again
stop it now
suddenly the father slaps her
even as he does it he is as stunned as judy
the mother stops eating
she has never seen such a display and is shocked
he tries to control himself by buttering a piece of bread
there is a terrible silence into which beau enters in his pajamas
he runs to his fathers chair then halts looking from face to face
the father puts an arm around him hugs him almost savagely
thickly hi rascal
judy rises weeping
may i please be excused
she starts out
the father rises and follows after her
softly hey hey glamorpuss
she leaves the room interrupting the joke he was going to make
he turns back to the table and sits down
the mother rises and comes to him
continuing i dont know what to do
all of a sudden shes a problem
the mother stands behind his chair
she tips his head back against her body and kneads his neck and shoulders
shell outgrow it dear
its just the age
in a sudden burst the atomic age
the door slams
kissing her husbands hair its the age when nothing fits
inside jims room
we see him lying on his bed as before
his eyes are open
the alarm clock goes off
jim starts as if shot then stops the wild ringing
the time is seven forty five
he makes no move to leave the bed
there is a light tap on the door then it opens and the father is there seen in light from the hall and still wearing the apron
listen i took a steak out of the freezer
i thought we could have a real old fashioned stag party just the two of us what do you say
im not hungry
the father turns away
hey i want to ask you something
happily shoot jimbo
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous where you have to prove something you need to know a question of honor
would you do it
laughing is there some kind of trick answer
what would you do dad
evading i wouldnt do anything hasty
lets get a little light on the subject
the father turns on the light and looks at jim who is now sitting on the edge of the bed
he removes his jacket and the bloody shirt is revealed
the father stares
howd that happen
what kind of trouble you in
the kind weve been talking about
can you answer me now
listen nobody should make a snap decision this isnt something you just we ought to consider all the pros and cons we dont have time
well make time
wheres some paper
well make a list and if were still stuck then we ought to get some advice he goes out to the study next door
what can you do when you have to be a man
well now just give me a direct answer
pause you going to stop me from going dad
you know i never stop you from anything
believe me youre at a wonderful age
in ten years youll look back on this and wish you were a kid again
now dad i need an answer now
i just want to show you how foolish you are
when youre older youll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important during this jim has kicked off his shoes and put on his boots and jacket and goes
living room featuring stairs
jim comes running down the stairs and out the kitchen door
will you listen
you cant go out till we jim
the father comes down the stairs goes to the front door and calls jim
he goes to kitchen door calls again gets no answer comes back into the living room sees he is still wearing the apron
he rips it off and throws it down then starts for the stairs
wind shrieks over the exposed plateau which is several hundred yards long
it cuts into the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air
a dozen cars are scattered about defining a sort of runway in the center
there are twenty kids present but very little talk
most of them belong to buzzs group but there are a few whom we have not met before
they stand in small clots murmuring and smoking
the atmosphere is strung tightly like the moments before a dawn attack
near the cliffs edge are two cars of similar make and model
they face away from camera toward the edge of the plateau
there are no headlights anywhere
moose a boy in a leather jacket and cheap yachting cap stands guard between the cars his back to us
his hands are on his hips
his legs are spread
some girls drift in
plateau featuring plato as he wanders through the crowd searching for jim
he passes buzzs car where buzz judy and the rest are eating hamburgers
they have all changed into fighting wardrobe
calling out hey chicken little
he beg off
hes not scared of you
to goon goon
you seen that adolescent type anywheres
he wont show
well you going to wait all night
im getting nervous man
we got to do something
looking off hey buzz
buzz snaps on the spotlight again and swings it off
jims car as jim gets out and plato runs to him
howd you get here
boy i bet youd go to a hanging
my personalitys showing again
should i leave
lets see what were driving
jim gets out plato starts to follow
the two boys move away
plato looks after them hurt then goes to side of judy and stands
jim and buzz as they come forward
what you say your name was
glad to meet you
they shake hands briefly as they walk
they come to moose and stop
got some goodies for you buzzie boy
moose produces one and hands it to buzz who goes to one of the guarded cars motioning jim to come too
buzz jim and moose seen as hood is raised revealing their faces beneath it
buzz explores the motor with the flashlight
clean as a whistle
they both got plenty breeze
look good to you
he closes the hood
group moves across to other car
judy and plato
the other kids are behind them
judy looks to see that their attention isnt on her then speaks quietly to plato
is he your friend
my best friend
whats he like
oh i dont know
you have to get to know him
he doesnt say much but when he does you know he means it
well thats the main thing dont you think so
maybe next summer hes going to take me hunting with him and fishing
i want him to teach me how and i bet he wont get mad if i goof
his names jim
its really james but he likes jim more
laughing people he really likes he lets call him jamie
want to finish my hamburger
i only took a bite
jim is close in f
at wheel of his car
buzz is beyond at wheel of his
both boys are gunning their engines listening critically
jim lets his idle
judy goon and group
they watch in silent anticipation
plato starts away from them
plato hurrying away from the group
he stops looking off
jim and buzz
plato in distance
better try the doors
jim opens his door
no quick man
you got to break quick
jim shuts his door and tries again
so does buzz
then both boys walk forward to the edge
neither says a word
buzz puts his hand on jims shoulder
the edge of the bluff process
jim and buzz are directly below us
under them the plateau falls steeply away in a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the ocean below
jim and buzz
jim is staring below
he is beginning to perspire
he lights a cigarette
without taking his hand from jims shoulder buzz borrows the cigarette from his lips takes a drag and hands it back
jim takes another puff then tosses it into the abyss
quietly this is the edge boy
this is the end
i like you you know
what are we doing this for
still quiet we got to do something
jim and buzz with plato in f
jim and buzz appear to him as two close friends
suddenly they break and go without speaking further to their cars
they back up to the opposite end of the plateau headlights dark
plato follows them with his gaze
goon and others looking up as the cars glide by
judy waiting as buzz and jim move into starting position next to her
judy goes to buzz
jim is in b
give me some dirt
she bends out of sight for a moment as buzz goes on talking then hands him the dirt
he rubs it into his palms
we head for the edge
the first guy who jumps chicken
judy and buzz kiss without much interest
good luck buzz
she starts out without kissing him again
calling softly judy
jims car as judy comes to him
she looks at him a moment then bends and hands him some dirt
their heads touch for an instant
she breaks the look and hurries away
they are lined up in two rows headlights facing each other
judy comes into shot
when she gets near camera she stops and turns back to face them
hit your lights
suddenly the headlights of all the cars come on full
she is in the center of the glare
behind her we see the other kids filing out of their cars hurrying toward the edge of the bluff
the sound of the two motors revving then dying and revving again
inside jims car
jim grips the wheel firmly relaxes his hands to rub his palms together and crack his knuckles
he grips the wheel again
steps on the accelerator winding his engine into a roar
he lets up looks tensely at buzz in his car
his chin juts forward
he lets go of the wheel starts to comb his hair
slow pan shot
spectators staring off at the cars
a boy has his arm around the girl in front of him his cheek against hers
both are looking off
some of the kids smoke
all are involved in the blasting of engines
plato among the spectators near edge of the bluff
he is chewing his lip
camera pans down to show that the fingers of both his hands are tightly crossed
judy staring tensely into the glare
suddenly she raises her hands high above her head
jim sweating it out
he leans forward squinting ready
he puts his comb between his teeth and clamps it hard
he settles himself for the run
the cars are in close seen from the rear
judy is a small distant figure arms stretched high
the exhaust blasts
now she drops her arms
the cars leap ahead
she whirls to see the cars snap by then begins running up the center of the plateau between the lines of spectators
shooting over their shoulders as the cars approach and scream past
as they approach gaining speed and thunder over the camera
inside jims car
he is tense
inside buzzs car
his hands hard on the wheel
the comb is still between his teeth
he begins edging toward the door on his left
moving close shot
judy biting hard on her finger as she runs forward
both hands cover his mouth
the fingers are still crossed
inside jims car
as he edges to his left
he is driving with one hand
he opens the door gets set for his jump
inside buzzs car
he reaches for the door handle and misses
as he raises his arm to reach again the strap of his windbreaker sleeve slips over the handle
he looks down in panic then back at the drop ahead
he tugs but cannot get the sleeve loose
he shuts his eyes tight and keeps them shut
shooting at backs of the two cars as they race through the row of lights toward the edge
inside jims car
his face is soaked
he looks once toward buzz then ahead
his eyes widen in fear
he shoves left and flings himself forward and out
outside jims car as he sprawls forward into camera
inside buzzs car
buzz leans way forward now
he seems to rise in his seat
his mouth opens and the comb falls out
full shot spectators staring in disbelief
suddenly a youth ducks his face into the neck of his girlfriend so he cannot see
at the same instant in a single breath oh
edge of the bluff as the two cars go over
there is no human sound
jim as he stops rolling
buzzs car in flight
the car soars through the night the vehicle of a terrible journey
surprise has gone
he rides lightly on the thrill of his last moment then suddenly his face twists in a spasm of protest and loss
the kids staring at his flight
jim unaware of the disaster glad he made it
edge of the bluff
with headlights blazing both cars dive down
judy standing frozen as the spectators shove past and around her
edge of the bluff as spectators swarm to it stand looking down
jim on hands and knees trying to rise
legs rush by him knock him onto his face
both cars plunge into the ocean below
jim at edge of bluff
he is pushing through spectators
a harsh whisper wheres buzz
plato working his way through the crowd
crunch looks up as he hears jims repeated cry
jim enters behind him continuing blindly on his way
tight fury down there
down there is buzz
jim looks over the edge
a siren wail approaches
the kids wheel and scatter panicking past the camera
looks at jim
jim seen between legs of hurrying kids
the sirens and the pounding of their feet on the hard turf
jim is sitting on the edge of the bluff
plato rushes in stops short as he sees him
come on jim
we got to get out of here
jim doesnt move
plato grabs his arm and yanks
plato pushes him
they start away plato still pushing from behind
she is standing alone in the wind on the emptying plateau
jim and plato move past in the distance
jim sees her and stops
she is shuddering violently but there are no tears
she seems not to see or hear or be aware of anything around her
jim and plato watching judy
jim moves toward her camera panning with him and leaving plato behind
jim stands before judy until she notices him
he shakes his head for all the sorrow he feels but no words come
tentatively he offers her his hand
after a moment she takes it
she knows only that help is being offered and that she will accept it with trust
jim leads her away toward the car
high long shot
there is no movement anywhere
in the house bordering the street a few lights still burn
jims car approaches out of distance and slows when it reaches the alley
jims car as it slows and stops
jim judy and plato in the front seat
judy has the door open before the car even stops
she is shaking agitated and withdrawn
hardly audible this is fine she gets out and starts away leaving door open
calling quietly judy
will you be okay
plato looks at him
jim raises a hand to her in a shy farewell
she smiles vaguely then hurries away from them
near jims backyard alley
jim and plato
i got to go in
you better get home too
touches plato hey what
why dont you come home with me
i mean nobodys home at my house and im not tired are you
i dont have many people i can talk to
if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to pauses then excitedly as though an idea had
suddenly struck him gee
if you could only have been my father
you flipped or something
you better take off
suddenly pleasantly o
i got to pick up my scooter
see you tomorrow
plato turns walks up the alley to the street
jim goes into his kitchen door
three doors open onto it one is closed this is judys room another leading into beaus room is open but the room beyond is dark the third also open reveals
the bedroom of judys parents
as judy comes into the hallway the parents who are reading in their beds look up
judy hesitates then starts toward her own room
quietly hello little cute sister
beau appears at his door in white pajamas a small ghost
judy looks at him
hello darling baby pie glamor puss sweetie judy touches beaus head and tries to smile
calling from his bed beau
you belong in bed
judy turns without another glance at her parents and opens the door of her room
inside bedroom of judys parents
as judy slams her bedroom door o
the father reacts
perhaps he wishes she had given him a chance to say goodnight
the mother who use reading glasses looks up at the slam
then she looks over at her husband shrugs when she catches his gaze and goes back to her magazine
inside jims living room
the television is on but only a hum comes from it and the screen is a flickering gray
the father sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace still dressed but with his collar open
the sound of jims step in the dining room makes him open his eyes
fear of facing his son makes him shut them again
the boy comes in a bottle of milk in his hand
seeing his father there he stops short his impulse is to flee
instead he comes in and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids fluttering in the fathers masquerade of sleep make him seem to be having a dream
jim is torn between his desire to leave and his need to speak
he turns off the television quietly then lies down on the couch across the way
he mumbles the things he would say to his father and the answers he feels he would get
the old man opens his eyes once sees the boy there head banging upside down from the couch
then he shuts them again
upside down long shot
room jims viewpoint
suddenly inverted in his vision the mother appears at the head of the stairs in bathrobe and nightgown
she pauses a moment then runs down crying hes home
youre all right
the camera rights itself suddenly
jim as he completes his turn pulling his head up and sitting
father as he pretends to awaken with a start
full shot room as the mother hurries to jim holds him inspects him kisses him
what happened darling
we were so worried
i was going to take a sleeping pill but i wouldnt till i knew you were home
i have to talk to someone mom
i have to talk to you both
and dad this time you got to give me an answer
im in terrible trouble
you know that big high bluff near miller town junction
sure there was a bad accident there
they showed the pictures on i was in it
it doesnt matter how
i was driving a stolen car do you enjoy doing this to me or what mom im not and you wanted him to make a list
will you let him tell it
she never wants to hear
she doesnt care
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you that shows how much i dont care
just relax please relax
i told you dad it was a question of honor
they called me chicken you know chicken
i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again
so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other
we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff
i got out okay but buzz didnt
he was killed
i cant keep it to myself anymore well just get it off your chest son
thats not what i mean
ive never done anything right
ive been going around with my head in a sling for years
i dont want to drag you into this but i cant help it
i dont think i can prove anything by going around pretending im tough any more so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another
youre absolutely right
are you listening to me
youre involved in this
i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight
did anyone see you there
i mean did they get your license number or anything
i dont think so well what about the other boys do you think theyll go to the police
whats that got to do with it
why should you be the only one
far be it from me to tell you what to do but theres are you going to preach now
are we going to have a sermon
im just explaining what you mean

suddenly jim loosens his hands and rises
he looks swiftly at each of them moves a few steps toward the door looks back at them again then rushes out of the house
the parents stand frozen
outside precinct station
jims car comes to a stop at the curb
jim gets out and approaches the flight of steps leading up the entrance
a bare bulb on either side is the only illumination
as he mounts the first step the double doors above him swing open revealing several people
jim stops short
so do they
crunch moose and their parents
jims back in f
the boys stare down at him
jim from the boys point of view as he stares up at them
mooses father takes his arm and starts him down the stairs the others moving too

jim starts forward up the steps
crunch grabs him
this place appeal to you or something
they move down the steps as jim breaks away and continues up
he goes through the doors
inside doors as jim comes through and stops
he looks back through the glass
we see the group reach the curb where their cars are parked
there is a brief discussion which we cannot hear then crunch and moose move off to mooses car
jim turns back
he looks worried as he passes camera
crunch and moose
they stop at mooses car and look back at the entrance
the parents are seen beyond them getting into their cars
crunch is near tears with anger

mooses father jumps into his car
he steps on the starter but nothing happens just the empty whirring over and over
finally it starts but the boys have gone

jim turns away notices a phone on the wall puts in a coin asks for a number
bedroom of judys parents
through an open door we hear a radio playing a late disc jockey show for teenagers in which numbers are dedicated by request
judys mother and father are in bed father has phone in his hand
who wants her
never heard of you
he hangs up phone looks at his wife
she rolls over in bed
the father turns off the bed lamp then sits up worried in the dark
it is her radio we have heard
she turns off light opens the door a crack and looks out toward her parents room
he is coming up the walk to his house
when plato has come a few feet somebody whistles
plato and camera stop
short quiet whistles come from the boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk
plato turns and starts to run camera following
he gets to his door tries the key but in his panic it will not go into the lock
suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around
crunch stands above him
goon closes in from the other side
all very tense and hotted up
what do you want
you know what we want
we want your friend
we got eyes for him

crunch sends plato spinning into the house past her
yelling what you doing

she swings at crunch who faces her challenging

they turn and move past camera
plato gets up off the floor
we hear the sound of a heap starting
the negro woman closes the door
inside platos foyer as negro woman bolts the door
why you like to mix with bad boys like that

he starts up the stairs
she follows him heavily
you not going anywhere
you staying home while your mamas away
bedroom of platos mother a lacy affair with imported dolls on the pillows
plato rushes in opens the drawer of the night table and pulls out a gun
he checks to see that it is loaded
the negro woman appears in the door and stares at him turns on the light which illuminates the bed lamp
what you doing with that
you leave that be
put it down before you hurt yourself
but plato moves past her and out of the room
she turns after him
you stay home
the slam of a door is heard below
judy waiting inside
jims car pulls in a radio going softly
he turns the motor off and is about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer coming up now another request this time from the boys down at
annas pizza paradise a new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues

jim stares at the radio then turns it off

i cant go back into that zoo
im never going back
i know a place
plato showed me before
an old deserted mansion near the planetarium rises would you go with me
you can trust me judy
i feel as if im walking under water
they start out
the water is running in the sink and jims father is fixing a stomach settler
gradually he grows aware of a heavy pounding which insinuates itself above the splash of water
the father pauses then turns off the tap
the pounding continues
jims mother appears at the bathroom door
she is seen in the mirror tying her robe
whats that pounding
i dont know
first i thought it was jim but hes home
i heard the car
are you going down there
look just relax will you
the pounding ceases
i still think you should go down
he goes out of the bathroom into the hall
jims house as the father comes down the stairs turning on the light as he comes
he reaches the door and pauses
the mother stops midway down the stairs
through the door whos there
silence anyone there
low at balustrade open it
the father opens the door and looks up sharply
fathers head in f
as he stares at it
nailed to the door by its outstretched wings its head hanging in an attitude of crucifixion is the freshly killed carcass of a chicken
low whistles are heard from outside
the father frightened looks out into the night
front lawn and street
shooting over the fathers head
the whistling continues
hoarsely whos out there
wheres your son
wheres your baby boy gone to daddy
we want him
suddenly the father slams the door and rushes past us into the house
foyer as the father rushes to the bottom of the stairs
look in his room
the mother disappears
the father dashes into the living room then into the hall again and down through the kitchen door
back yard as the father comes out
he closes the door quietly and calls in a low voice son
he stares around the yard then hurries to the garage
jims car is missing
he looks up suddenly
judys father seen across the alley wall
he is standing in his own back yard
is anything wrong
im your neighbor
he smiles feebly
oh no thanks
i just wanted to to be sure my garage was closed
jims father closes his garage door and walks back toward his house
is he there
no hes not here
he starts for the house again after a quick look in the direction of judys father
judys back yard
judys father watches mr
stark disappear then
the alley by jims house
plato drives up on scooter
he checks the garage sees jims car is gone is about to take off in confusion hears door slam in jims back yard shuts off engine fixes tie combs hair
goes in the fence gate to jims back yard
jims back yard
jims father is coming toward him
jims father and plato simultaneously say what are you doing
i dont know
do you do you know where he is
no i dont
plato remembers about the mansion then almost to himself i know where back to full shot
father and plato
hope i didnt bother you
he runs to scooter
hey come back here
who are you
split screen montage
it begins with a telephone ringing alone in the corner of the screen
as camera moves back we see that the phone is in an office at juvenile hall
ray is standing by trying to make sense out of the incoming reports
the other part of the screen lights up and becomes bedroom of platos mother where the negro woman is speaking hysterically into the phone
bedroom of judys parents
the father is on the phone
beau has awakened and is crying
his mother tries to divert him
jims father sits disconsolately on the bed the phone in his hand
he is talking earnestly
during this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a deep rising riot of sirens whose wail
mounts higher and higher until full shot
a lone siren wails in distance
aside from this all is very still
camera pans past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on a hill nearby
stone balustrades drop down to sunken gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless fountain
a mediterranean villa with a large domed solarium which is connected to the main building by a low enclosed arcade
a crash and the falling of splintered glass is heard
shooting through pillars of the main entrance portico down the long promenade outside arcade
two figures seen in the distance are disappearing through a window
camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a broken window through which jim is just disappearing
when he gets inside he reaches back and takes his leather jacket which has been spread on the sill to protect them from splinters shakes it out and puts it
running footsteps are heard approaching
jim looks out nervously
plato bursts in out of breath
howd you find me
theyre looking for you
crunch and goon and everybody
i think theyre going to kill you
they think you told the police on them
they whos in there
help me in
jim gives plato a hand over the windowsill
jim and judy are seen in an entering shaft of moonlight
plato hits the floor and disappears into darkness
hey whered you go
come out come out wherever you are
are you nuts
a match flares and lights a candle on an antique spanish candelabra
plato is revealed bending over it
he lights the other candles through the following were safe here
holds up candelabra what do you think
gazing around wow
well now there then
his wonderment is justified
the floor of the arcade is marble and there are marble benches and neo roman busts lining the walls
isnt it crazy
wowee ow wow
lets take it for the summer
no come on
should we rent or are we in a buying mood dear
laughing you decide darling
remember our budget
dont give it a thought
only three million dollars a month
oh we can manage that
ill scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone
why dont we just rent it for the season
you see weve just oh you tell him darling
im so embarrassed i could die
well were newlyweds
theres just one thing
what about children
well we really dont encourage them
theyre so noisy and troublesome dont you agree
and so terribly annoying when they cry
i just dont know what to do when they cry do you dear
drown them like puppies
see were very modern
shall i show you the nursery
its far away from the rest of the house
if you have children oh i hate the word
or if you decide to adopt one they can carry on and youll never even notice
in fact if you lock them in you never have to see them again much less talk to them
talk to them
nobody talks to children
they just tell them one thing and mean another
its wonderful that you understand so well and so young too
you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery
theres only one key
well take it
plato leads them away from us down the arcade the candelabra casting wild shadows on the walls
they are laughing as they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their laughter echoes stonily
a street and an alley
night seen through the windshield of a police car
its radio is on low
two officers are in the front seat
one of them drinks coffee from a container
suddenly mooses heap moves past on the street ahead
in it are moose goon and crunch
the street as mooses heap continues up the empty street
the police car slides out of the alley where it has been concealed and follows at a distance
its headlights are off
crunch goon and moose process
they are in the front seat of mooses heap
what time is it
we got all night
that maid saw us
she could identify us too
you still want to go home moose
then shut your mouth before your guts run out
inside glass solarium
a swimming pool lies at the center
there is no water in it
framing the pool is a flagstone walk with marble benches spotted here and there
the great glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical foliage
but now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead with lack of care
at the edge of the pool near the deep end a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon it
in its mysterious light our three kids are revealed jim bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board judy on the blanket nearby plato on the pools bottom
all three are laughing hysterically when suddenly jim starts to lose his balance
fill the pool
jim falls in
plato rushes to him
lets see how long we can stay under
man youre schizoid
in another outburst of laughing im what
you cant talk underwater
gargling i bet you hear everything i say
gargling isnt he schizoid
how bout that
they laugh again
jim swings up the ladder and goes to judy
havent you noticed your personality splitting
they all sit on the blanket
how do you know so much about this junk plato
i had to go to a head shrinker
i only went twice though
my mother said it cost too much so she went to hawaii instead
jim lies back with his head in judys lap
she strokes his hair and smiles at him
plato looks away
whats your trouble
plato hesitates a moment then leans back cuddling between the two of them
i dont know but whatever it is its gone now
i mean im happy now
jim puts his arm under platos chin
i came here before
when was that
when i was here
when i ran away
i used to run away a lot but they always took me back
mom and dad
i used to be in my crib and id listen to them fight
you remember that far back
boy i cant even remember yesterday
plato wheres your father now
he was a hero in the china sea
you told me hes a big wheel in new york
well he might as well be dead
whats the difference
its all right
plato closes his eyes
judy hums a lullaby as she strokes jims lips with a finger
he snaps at it
then he kisses her hand looks at her palm
continuing you have a long life line
she takes his palm and examines it
so have you
she kisses it holds her cheek against it
ever been in a place like this before
its certainly huge
how many rooms do you think there are
i dont know
should we explore
she looks at plato
jim shrugs tests to see if the boy is awake but there is no reaction
carefully they crawl to their feet
jim supporting platos head with his hands as they do so
jim takes the other blanket and covers plato with it
judy kneels on the other side and tucks it in
they look at each other across him and smile
then suddenly judy bends down and kisses platos cheek very softly
judy and jim rise
jim takes a candle from the candelabra and leads judy along the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond
silence except for their footfalls on the flagstone
in the distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through
when they close again a sob comes from plato
high angle closeup
plato lying as they left him but his eyes are open and he is crying
camera booms up as plato throws off the blanket and looks after them
camera booms higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure sitting by himself
the pool echoes his weeping
the door opens slowly and jim appears with the candle
judy lingers at the door
the flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room paneled in oak
there is a tapestry couch empty bookcases some dim portraits a leather table and several chairs around a great stone fireplace
will you look at this room
looks behind him judy
she comes forward
jim drips wax on the table top and sticks the candle on it
his hand shakes
judy sits on the couch
continuing want to read any books
take your pick
sits beside her isnt this the craziest
he takes her hand
she looks at him and smiles
your hands all wet and its shaky
kisses it youre so funny
i dont know you just are
leaving a light for plato
that was nice
maybe hes scared of the dark
jim snuffs out the candle
they are left in moonlight
singing here we are out of cigarettes juniors in the nursry see how late it gets you dont need to do that
theres something i should tell you judy
i know already
we dont have to pretend now
laughing what a relief
he leans back relaxed at last
she snuggles close to him
is this what its like to love somebody
mussing her hair funny jimmy
youre so clean and you this is silly
you smell like baby powder
so do you
i never felt so clean before
its not going to be lonely judy
not for you and not for me
i love somebody
all the time ive been looking for someone to love me and now i love somebody
and its so easy
why is it easy now
it is for me too
i love you jim
i really mean it
she kisses his lips gently and looks into his face
he returns the kiss
their arms go around each other
i mean it too
he kisses her again full shot
road near planetarium
mooses heap crawls up and turns left
a moment later the police car appears and does likewise still holding its distance
the mansion as mooses heap moves past on the road below
suddenly it stops
inside mooses heap
crunch looks off curious
what you stopping for
you scam a car up there
nobodys lived in that hunk of junk for five six years
he switches on the spotlight
it illuminates jims heap
well what do you know
i feel a kick coming on
he turns off all the lights and gets out
the others follow
it has halted
one of the officers gets out and draws his gun
the other makes radio contact in a low voice this is unit
come in unit
we just zeroed three kids in a heap
crest drive and observatory
looks like house breaking
send us some help
they may be armed
plato asleep on the blanket
only a single candle burns in the candelabra
the same low whistles heard earlier come from all around him and rise in volume
suddenly his eyes open
he doesnt move but he has come suddenly awake
plato lying in f
next to his face are a pair of booted feet
he looks up
camera pans up to show crunch
he is smiling
he holds a tire chain in his hand which he swings
the swimming pool
goon and moose are behind crunch
they too are armed with tire chains
they all laugh
plato rolls away from them and runs toward the deep end of the pool
take the steps
the other side
the boys run to their assigned places
plato sees no exit
he flings himself down the ladder and into the pool
he feints this way and that the boys responding as if they were fencing
crunch swings down the ladder and his boots make a loud report as they hit the pool
moose advances down the steps at the shallow end
goon climbs onto the pool bottom at the opposite side
the feinting continues wordlessly as the circle closes around plato
the only sounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to distract him from side to side and the animalistic grunts they make to scare him
suddenly plato sees an opening and plunges past moose pushing him over and stumbles up the steps
lets make it
they stream out of the pool after plato
he reaches the glass doors first streaks though and bangs them shut behind him
platos face is visible only when the moonlight strikes him through the passing windows
the sound of running steps behind him
a pattern of moonlight on the bare floor as plato dashes in and through it
he falls over a piece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera wheels around on hands and knees to face the door
the boys plunge into the moonlit square and stop
plato tries not to breathe
a match is struck
crunch looks around but can see nothing
that match goes out
the boys start up the stairs whispering
immediately plato crawls forward under the piano
he hears a murmur of voices from behind the oak door of the library next to the piano
he moves to it stealthily
close shot plato at door listening through it on hands and knees
his confusion mounts
he shakes his head to clear it
then suddenly he rises and tries the knob
the door is locked
he beats on it
the boys run across the room
as they hit the moonlit square
plato spins and fires
somebody drops and starts moaning
jim opens the door
shrieks what you run out on me for
what you leave me alone for
there is a rush of boys coming forward
with hate i dont want you for my father
plato fires at jim
jim leaps at plato with a cry and knocks him down
in rage you crazy nut
you crazy crazy nut
screaming get away from me
he rolls away from jim and runs to the main door
main door from inside
plato falls upon it fumbles with the bolt and swings the door wide
he steps out into the waning moonlight and we see him running down the lawn
jim rushes into the doorway and stops short
the officers are moving away from us toward it
plato runs wildly toward them
plato stops confused
continuing come here
jim runs out on the promenade and starts over the balustrade
his face is working desperately in growing panic
come here son
just walk over here quietly now and there wont be any trouble
plato runs out
jim as he screams
main doorway as judy rushes out followed by goon and moose
they all stop dead at the balustrade
jim seen in f
plato bolting toward the woods in the direction of the planetarium
the officers have both hit the ground in the distance
they fire again
jim hesitates a moment then rushes after plato
the officers fire again
jim as he runs after plato
officers as they rise to their feet
take the house
ill head him off
front of mansion
judy flies down the stairs and rushes past camera
another part of town process
ray is driving
jims father is beside him
the mother is in the back seat
located at summit drive the planetarium
snapping on mike the planetarium
one kid inside five housebreaking in area
turning to jims parents there are some kids in trouble youll have to go with me
perfectly all right
edge of woods as jim hurtles in from the open ground beyond
he stumbles against a tree and sinks down
traveling shot in the woods as plato rushes through the moonlit trees sobbing
jim at the base of a tree
he is whimpering shaking his head
judy crashes through the brush and drops beside him
did he hit you
she is on the verge of hysteria
we have to go back
i got to find him
he starts to rise
after he tried to shoot you
he didnt mean it we shouldnt have left him
he needed us
he needed you maybe
so do i
there is a sound of distant gunfire
both kids freeze
he needs you too
judy breaking into a run follows after him through the brush
you should have heard him talk about you tonight
like you were the hero in the china seas
he was trying to make us his family
theyre killing him
jim runs ahead blindly and disappears in the trees
judy rushes after him a few steps then stops
judy and jim running
shooting from the bridle path and panning to the building
plato reels in and goes to the front door
door to planetarium
plato clutches the handle
the door is locked
he whimpers once in frustration
policeman running up same path plato has followed
plato at door to planetarium
he smashes the glass with his gun and dives through
inside planetarium as plato lands
he is cut and bleeding
come out of there
plato wheels and skitters backward across the floor of the observatory on his hands and knees until he comes to the door of the planetarium theater
seen from inside
the officer in b
plato in f
the officer appears in the entrance then moves quickly to one side to be less of a target
he reaches in to unlatch the door
youre making it tough on yourself kid
come out quietly now
you didnt kill anybody yet
plato fires at him then opens the door of the planetarium theater and runs inside
the door swings shut behind him
the officer is hugging the outside wall
another siren wails and a spotlight catches the officer who runs out into the light
running need a little help here
parking lot as the chiefs car wheels to a stop
it is followed by a civilian car and a cab
we heard firing
he get anybody
we got a cookaboo inside
he wounded some kid earlier
howd he get in

leaving down in back
bushes bordering planetarium as jim climbs through them and stops short staring in amazement
judy is in b
jim seen in f
hiding in the screen of leaves
beyond we see the full activity the crowd the cars searchlights playing on the planetarium entrance police moving in under direction of the chief
loud on speaker silence

there will be emergency vehicles coming through
this warning is for your own protection
rays prowl car come in
jims parents climb out curious
ray hurries to consult with an officer who briefs him then hurries to the chiefs car
several patrol cars now line the parking lot
the negro woman in her nightgown and overcoat pushes forward from a cab and accosts an officer

i am speaking to the boy inside
this is ray framek from the juvenile division close up jim as he reacts to rays name
he rises and looks off

jims father standing by rays car gazing off with interest
his wife comes out and stands beside him looks at him questioningly
over speaker come outside
clasp your hands over your head and come outside quietly the fathers gaze has traveled over the scene
suddenly he sees his son followed by judy run into the planetarium
goes over to ray that was my son
i think i know my son
the father moves behind the crowd camera trucking with him until he reaches the bushes at the edge of the parking lot and stops gathering himself
meanwhile rays voice continues over over speaker jim stark
im addressing jim stark
nobody will harm you or your friends if you follow these instructions
we are here to protect you
drop your guns and come outside
nobody will hurt you if you do as i say the father starts forward along the bushes as if stalking game
each step is carefully placed and quiet but his heart tugs him along like a kite dragging an anchor
another boy and girl just ran into the planetarium
we do not know if they are armed
hold your positions until further instruction
inside planetarium as jim comes dashing in spins around staring
a siren is heard outside growing shrill
over speaker ambulance
ambulance is coming through
clear a passage
will you people make way there
floodlights strike the door and illuminate the lobby dimly
jim moves cautiously to the door of the planetarium theater
judy hangs back
another siren is heard approaching
more floodlights strike the door
continuing calling softly plato
plato you in there
silence hey im going to open the door now
youll be able to see me and you can shoot me if you want but just remember one thing plato youre my friend

jim opens the door slowly
darkness except for the splash of light from the door where jim stands in silhouette
he lets the door close
boy im blind as a bat
you got a match
im going to break my neck in here
where are you
ive got a gun
light a match will you

another siren is heard outside
jim has reached the lecturers desk and just as the match goes out he throws a switch
the stars appear on the dome and the projector starts its slow revolution
you think the end of the world will come at nighttime jim
i just have a feeling
where are you

i cant talk to you if i dont see you
hey look at the stars plato

plato rises from behind a row then jim continues thats fine
jim approaches slowly

jim opens the door for plato then follows him out
judy joins them
observatory as jim judy and plato come to the entrance
plato sees an officer
just a guard
i shot at one of them
but you didnt hurt anybody
outside observatory as plato and jim come forward into the early dawn
plato stops and looks off scared
slow pan shot
it has grown enormously
there are armed officers everywhere all waiting alert
her eyes are moist
her lips move in silent prayer
the father looking on anxiously
the mother is crying against the car
jim and plato
those arent my friends
make them go away
tense calling past camera ray
will you tell these guys to move back
suddenly plato bolts
jim wheels after him
dont be a fool
planetarium as plato dashes to the stairway leading to the balcony
jims father and mother
their faces reflect panic as they see plato running in jims coat
shooting down the stairs as plato rushes up
jim closes behind him
camera pans with plato as he climbs the ladder to the ledge of the small dome
jim stops at the foot of the ladder
keep away from me
i dont believe you anymore
he raises the gun as if to shoot jim
an officer drops to one knee and fires a shot at plato
plato drops like a stone to jims feet
screaming wildly but ive got the bullets
the gun was empty
negro woman as she screams a handkerchief in her mouth
she sobs once and runs up steps
jim staring down at plato
crouches over plato plato
there is nothing
he rises and faces the crowd shaking his head in wonder and reproach
quiet what did you have to do that for
full shot the roof
parents and officers
the negro woman is hysterical
ray shoves past her followed by jims father and mother
they rush toward camera
they spring into action arrive with stretcher
jim is at platos side
a couple of officers rush forward to take jim
the father comes in and pushes them aside
let him alone
ill take care of him
ray who has witnessed this motions to the officers
its all right
its all right
the father stares down at jim for a moment
then he kneels beside his son puts his coat over jims shoulders
he speaks very gently
for a minute
breaks off then you couldnt help it son
reaches out gently but firmly you did everything a man could do
he takes jim by the elbow and starts to bring him to his feet
the boy suddenly resists and remains kneeling
stand up jim
ill stand up with you
let me try to be as strong as you want me to be
a faint hope appears in the boys face
he no longer resists as the father helps him to rise
but he still keeps his back to him
the ambulance attendants start putting plato on a stretcher
jim moves as if to stop them but the father still holds his shoulders
he depended on me
and you can depend on me son
whatever comes well face it together i swear
jim feels for the first time the love and security he has always wanted
he clutches at his father crying unashamedly
the fathers arms envelop him
plato through his death has helped these two find each other
judy and ray watching
negro woman as she bends over platos body
as they lift plato onto litter this poor baby got nobody
as he is carried past her she follows
from below as jim supported by his father comes down
ray is behind them
they pause for a silent meeting with the mother at foot of the stairs
she kisses jim and starts wiping his tears away but he is weeping soundlessly and it does no good
jim looks back up at the dome
the ambulance attendants are bearing platos litter down the last few stairs followed by the negro woman
the ambulance attendants come down the last few stairs followed by the negro woman
jim steps forward suddenly and adjusts the blanket covering plato
judy comes to jims side
the litter passes camera and we hold on two shot of jim and judy seen against the lightening sky
to judy half to himself he was always cold
judy moves to jim and touches his arm lightly
he looks down at her
jims arm is around judy as he leads her firmly towards his mother and father
his voice is warm brimming with the new found pride he takes in his parents as he introduces judy to them
mom dad this is my friend
her name is judy
the parents nods warmly and smile at her
she smiles shyly in response happy at being accepted
there is a warmth emanating from the tight little group
changes have happened to them
old things have been shed and a new start has been made
camera booms pulls back high to high general shot
planetarium jim and judy father and mother threading their way through the crowd as the camera continues to pull back
