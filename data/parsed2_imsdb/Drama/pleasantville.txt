href b b pleasantville by gary ross october a fairytale by gary ross october he was part of my dream of course but then i was part of his dream
lewis carroll through the looking glass a college counselor stands at the podium lecturing the high school seniors about their future
for those of you going on to college next year the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate
entry level jobs will drop from thirty one to twenty six percent and the median income for those jobs will go down as well
there is some rustling in the audience
obviously my friends its a competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through
by the year two thousand
a different teacher lectures a different class of students
the chance of contracting hiv from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty
the odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty five hundred
beat now this marks a drastic increase
from just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level
by the time you are twenty years old average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees
even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons floods widespread drought and famine
they stare back in stunned silence
one of them david wagner sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth
chipper classroom tone okay
who can tell me what famine is
birds are chirping
the sun is shining
all the hedges are neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured
a sweet stillness hangs over the suburban street which is bathed in beautiful black and white
honey im home
george parker enters the front door and hangs his hat on the coatrack
he sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer with a huge smile on his face
its a frozen smile that doesnt seem to be affected by too much in particular like a tour guide at disneyland
george parker betty enters untying the back of her apron
she is a vision of s beauty with a thin figure and concrete hair
betty crosses to her husband and hands him a fresh martini
she kisses him on the cheek
how was your day
you know mr
connel said that if things keep going the way they are i might be seeing that promotion sooner than i thought
oh darling thats wonderful
an adoring gaze i always knew you could do it
david wagner sits on his couch watching this entire action on a sleek new sony t
he stares riveted at the set with a big smile on his face
david wears black shoes black pants black t shirt and a black baseball cap not a nerd exactly he reaches next to him into a huge bag of doritos never
taking his eyes off the show
whats that smell
sniffing is that your meat loaf
by rote it might be
shy smile it might be
he leans over and kisses her again on the cheek
you sure know the way to this mans heart
there is a loud and inappropriate laugh track
david smiles wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips when his real mothers voice rings out from the other room
bullshit barry that wasnt the deal davids mom paces the room with the phone in her hand
between the plastic surgery and the make up its hard to fix her age
no you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend
pause i dont care if yesterday was the thirtieth this is still the first weekend
her words drift in from the kitchen while david stares at the show
no i cant bail you out im supposed to go to la costa
beat well if i want to get a mud bath thats really my business isnt it
he reaches out and turns up the sound
pleasantville plays at an unnaturally high volume
where are those kids
reciting a little louder right behind you father
right behind you father
the parkers son and daughter bud and mary sue enter the foyer together
mary sue wears her hair in a pony tail
bud has on a lettermans sweater
bud has a little surprise for you
whats that bud
bud hesitates for a moment then folds up a shiny blue ribbon
first prize at the science fair
there were lots of swell projects guess mine was just the swellest
darling thats wonderful
except theres no such word as swellest
well gee whizz mom
lt wasnt the english fair
there is another jarring laugh track
he smiles right along with it
david stares transfixed at the set despite the continuing conversation in the other room
well sure they can stay by themselves barry but thats not the point
you said youd take them
beat well fine theyll stay by themselves then
quietly whats a mother to do
oh whats a mother to do
he grabs another handful of doritos staring at the t
a cacophony of modem life
beepers and nose rings blue hair and tattoos
dissonant boom boxes compete with one another
the hormones are running crazy
lt is a large open area alive at lunchtime
groups of kids hang out together divided by their various cliques
the music pounds in the background
he stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link fence
beads of sweat form on davids forehead as he speaks to someone in front of him
a very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him
its a warm welcoming smile
you probably dont think i should be asking you this
i mean not knowing you well and all
she smiles wider at him inviting him to continue
i mean i know you everybody knows you i just dont know you
she nods at him
well i was just wondering cause i see you all the time in algebra and i heard you humming that van halen song and i really like that song too
pause anyhow i dont know what youre doing this weekend but my moms leaving town and she said i could use her car so
she positively beams
the girl flicks her blonde hair and stares back at him adoringly
instead of smiling back david just stares then looks at the ground
for the first time we see that she wasnt talking to him
david stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to face with a much cooler boy
he has a cell phone and a very hip haircut
david watches as the girl throws her arm around the boys waist and heads out of the playground
david and his friends are all gathered around the plastic picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon court
the chess club meets at one end and there are some teachers at the other
all the cool kids are on the other side of the fence but david and his friends eat lunch at the same table every day
okay whose window did bud break when he was playing with his fathers golf clubs
what job did mr
howard looks at him puzzled
what did bud and mary sue name the cat they found in the gutter
they all nod and murmur with admiration
okay heres one why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake
cause bud didnt answer the phone and they were worried about him
its quiet for a beat
youll win this thing for sure
when is it on
marathon starts at
contests tomorrow at noon
weighing it a thousand dollars
and its on all night
of course it is howard
thats why they call it a marathon
davids sister jennifer hangs out with her friends in the parking lot
all the girls are dressed in the exact same uniform blue jeans beeper on the belt white v neck t shirt car keys in their hand
even the girls without a car hold car keys in their hand
jennifer is by far the prettiest and thus is the leader of the group
they all look toward the luncheon court where david and his friends are hanging out
omigod its so mortifying being related to him
i cant believe youre like only on my parents side
i know but youre like
twins and stuff
beat you must be from like the cool side of the uterus
a group of very hip boys strut through the parking lot
they bop up and down with the self confidence of all cool sixteen year olds
the girls freeze when they see them
omigod omigod here they come
dont do anything
just dont like do anything
cooly hi mark
he pauses then looks over at her
jennifer slides sinuously off the fender of the car flicking her hair like a young racehorse
she has a perfect year old body and the whole parking lot knows it
mark heads over to her followed by his lackies
the two groups meet at the tail gate of the nissan pathfinder like a small summit conference
to jennifer hey
right back hey
to jennifers lackies hey
back to them hey
saw you at the mall yesterday
saw you too
everyone nods for a moment or two
no one says anything
so you watching pearl jam on mtv tonight
beat jennifer pauses weighing the next statement
my momll be out of town
kimmy and christin positively gasp while marks lackeys mumble and glance around
the import of the thing isnt lost on anybody
mark bobs up and down a little faster
maybe we could uh
nodding faster cool
everybody bobs and shuffles for beat when mark nods summoning his flock
lt is a south westem version of leave it to beaver
the uniformity of suburbia has been washed in earth tones
there is a red tile roof gracing every home
all the houses have the same anemic palm tree
its a urban planners version of hell
i know i know hes just like so fine
im still like omigod
lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before
maybe more so at night
jennifer crosses through the living room with the cordless phone attached to her ear
it was amazing daph
im like well my momll be out of town
and hes like well then maybe we could you know
and im like yeah sure
and hes like well cool
beat i know hes just so smart
i dont know
maybe that black thing i just got
it is not slutty daph its cute
hes not coming over here to study
beat i know
well im jealous of you too sometimes
lt is studious and academic not joyless but not colorful either
david stands at his bedroom window staring outside with a cordless phone in his hand
hes not homeless howard they just dont say where he lives
well its a silly question
because nobodys homeless in pleasantville
his mother loads the final louis vuitton bag into her mercedes
because thats just not what its like
she fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway
listen howard its almost six thirty
i gotta go
the huge black tv sits like a monolith in the middle of the room
all at once david comes bounding down the stairs making a b iine for the couch
jennifer enters just as quickly from the other direction fiddling with her clothes
they hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at exactly the same moment
both of them freeze then look up at each other in shock
stunned what are you doing
what are you doing
neither one moves
they clutch the remote together
david cut it out
mark davis is gonna like be here in five minutes
the pleasantville marathon starts at six thirty
almost reverently yeah
every episode ever
getting hysterical omigod i dont be lieeeeve this
hes gonna like beeeee here
you can watch tv upstairs
there isnt any jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote
david yanks back and before they know it the remote goes flying out of their hands crashing onto the hardwood floor
lt smashes into a million tiny pieces
breathless oh my god
sinking to his knees scooping up the remains oh my god
david stop stressing you can like turn it on normally
no you cant jen
its a new tv
it doesnt work without a remote
david cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade when the doorbell rings behind him
oh my god
jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door
david just stares in shock at the shattered plastic
jennifer reaches the front door and wets her lips
she fluffs her hair quickly sticks out her chest then swings it open
jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile but it isnt mark davis on the other side
dick van dyke stands across the threshold in a tv repairmans outfit
jennifer looks at him puzzled
he steps forward flashing her a chipper grin toolbox in hand
beat tv repair
smiling wider well here i am
he glances out the front door toward a weird van parked at the curb
it says tv repair on the side but looks like something from a medicine show
the antenna on top resembles a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy family from the s gathered around their tv set
everyone wears a smile including the dog
the hand painted motto reads robs tv repair well fix you for good
david looks back at dick van dyke who smiles at him then crosses to the living room stepping nimbly around the ottoman
he heads toward the tv
seeing the smashed remote holy cow
look at that
had a little disaster didnt ya fella
setting down the toolbox well get you fixed up in no time
he pops the top of the tool box while jennifer and david just stare
its a strange looking box with the same happy family painted on the side
dick van dyke pulls out another remote
i know how id feel if mine went out
almost like losing a friend
tentatively you know we didnt call any tv repair
well that makes it a lucky day for both of us hunh
jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living room
you think you could do this like soon
its almost six thirty
whats the rush
cutting her off the pleasantville marathon starts at six thirty
at that moment there is a huge fork of lightning and a booming clap of thunder
it literally rattles the walls of the house as dick van dyke turns toward david
david recoils slightly
dick van dyke flashes him a smile
gosh i loved that show
watched it for years
thats not the reason
ive got a date at six thirty
ignoring her leaning closer to david hey who did muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles
stunned her father
and how did she dress him
still staring like prince charming
studying david nodding nice
ive got like a social emergency here
ignoring her remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was sposed to be watching him
what department store did they go to
remember sings for the very best in mens attire head right down to mcintires
stunned thats right
he stares at david speechless for a moment then smiles fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit
say why dont you take this remote instead
its got a little more ooomph in it
big beautiful set like this you want something thatll put you right in the show
quickly well take it
he flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age
its a strange combination of an early transistor radio and flash gordon ray gun
dick van dyke extends it with pride while jennifer and david stare at him warily
beat how much does it cost
oh couldnt charge you for something like that
big fan like yourself
its the least i could do
there is a second clap of thunder even louder than the first
the house rattles for a moment then is quiet
well i better get going
your shows almost on and
smiling at jennifer its almost time for your date
he places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and smiles at them
dick starts across the living room when he suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and tumbles end over end
he rolls on the carpet executes a perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing position
david and jennifer stare at him stunned when he looks back at them and smiles
grinning take care now
there is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the doorknob
david and jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a thud
its quiet for a second or two before there is another clap of thunder
david cocks his head
david glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table
it looks a little scary
slowly very slowy he reaches down and touches it
nothing seems to happen so he picks it up
david points the remote toward the tv set with an apprehensive look on his face
he winces a little then pushes one of the buttons
the tv set turns on
oprahs face fills the screen as an angry housewife screams at a transvestite
it ail seems normal as he pushes another button
this time the channel changes
he continues to press the button flipping through the channels
jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote
lemme see that
he continues to flip through the channels coming to rest on the pleasantville marathon
buds voice fills the room
on tv gee whizz mary sue why cant i borrow your transistor radio
on tv i promised betty jane she could use it over the weekend
bud and mary sue clutch either end of a small transistor radio
they seem to be in the exact same position as david and jennifer who are struggling over the remote control
she tugs the remote while david yanks in the other direction
do you mind
this is like the most important moment of my whole life
forget it jen ive waited a year for this
on tv but i told mr
miller id bring a transistor in to electric shop
on tv and i told betty jean she could have it for the picnic with roy
yanking at it god david
just give it to me
yanking it back get lost
you get lost
she tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands
david pulls in the opposite direction as they point it a huge white light emanates from the contraption like their own atomic blast wave
the entire room is filled with a blinding aura for a second or two before it actually gets sucked into the tv
it is suddenly empty illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube
david and jennifer are nowhere in sight
david and jennifer are standing in the middle of the s living room dressed in bud and mary sues clothing
they still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts
david and jennifer glance at one another then look horrified around the room
the world has turned to black and white
a whisper oh my god
im not sure
george parker bud and mary sues father enters from the landing whistling a happy tune
hes dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt and a dark gray tie with little gray dots
as if to his own children hi sport hi muffin
better get a move on youre gonna be late for school
he continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen
desperately what did you do
i dont know
examining her black and white skin uchh
look at me
im like so
he glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in his hand
david frantically presses the buttons but nothing happens
all at once there is a voice behind them
they whirl around to see dick van dykes face smiling at them from the tv set in the comer
its an old s set with a big round picture tube
they run over to him as he smiles
his face is the only color in the room
beaming told you it was your lucky day
bet you thought i was just a fan or something
they stare stunned at the tv set
see every time i thought id found someone theyd turn out to disappoint me
theyd know the early episodes but they wouldnt know the later ones
theyd know all about muffin but they wouldnt know about bud
to the tv set what the hells going on
cant talk like that now
smiles you know
david glances around at his black and white surroundings
his mothers voice rings out from the kitchen
breakfast is on the table
were in pleasantville
grinning dream come true hunh
panicking this isnt funny
i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
well you dont have to worry about that anymore
all at once the scene on the tv changes and dick van dykes picture gives way to a wide angle shot of the wagner house
mark davis is standing at the front door banging on the brass knocker
he checks his watch shifts restlessly for a moment or two then turns and heads down the flagstone walk never looking back
under his breath bitch
jennifer flings herself at the screen as dick van dyke appears all over again
you you gotta get us out of here
recoiling slightly why would i do that
because we dont belong
oh sure you do
mcintires department store
their father dressed as prince charming
that was gorgeous bud
my names david
wailing on the floor oh god
a little snippy you know this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation
look we appreciate it
we really do
we just we want to go home now
hurt but you dont know how long ive been looking for someone like you
a long face slowly descends on him
im very disappointed
deep breath in fact
im starting to get a little upset
david moves toward the screen
dont get upset
snapping back weil wouldnt you
you look for someone for years
you pour your heart into it
this is a privilege you know
shakes his head i dont think i better talk about this right now
where are you going
i dont think we should discuss this until im a little bit more composed
turning his back maybe in a day or so when im not so emotional
dick van dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as the screen goes completely black
it cuts out entirely as jennifer and david just stare
david grabs the remote and starts rapidly pushing buttons
dropping the gizmo oh god
whats going to happen
i dont know
its not possible
looking at her is it possible
your breakfast is getting cold
it cant be possible
betty their mother sticks her head into the living room wearing her black and white apron
she has a great big pepsodent smile
well come on kids
youre not going off to school without a hot breakfast inside you
they just stare at her
they exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to their feet
jennifer waits for david who forces a smile then starts toward the kitchen
i just love you in that sweater mary sue
its so flattering
david and jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze agape at the spectacle in front of them every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the
there are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs
pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham
the table literally sags under the weight of the food
george parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children
once again morning kids
better get a move on or youre going to be late for school
they nod stunned and wander forward into the room
bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside
david and jennifer stare straight ahead as their mother adds some waffles to the heap
under his breath i dont believe this
neither do i
david and jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two heaping plates at their places
neither one moves
to jennifer i put blueberries in them just the way you like
actually im not real
big smile oh nonsense young lady
youre going to start your day with a nice big breakfast
she takes jennifer by the shoulders and guides her into the chair
jennifer looks down at a huge plate of gray waffles
oppressively chipper here
why dont you have some waffle cakes
beat and theres sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon
beat and a ham steak
betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge slab of butter
and of course a nice big bowl of oatmeal
jennifer hesitates then glances over at her mother who looks at her expectantly
she glances at david who just looks stunned
jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a forkful of the oozing mess
he stands facing the camera in an actual kinescope from
the backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the background singers are all white debutantes
he wears a lettermans sweater and button down shirt
tooty fruity oh rooty
tooty fruity oh rooty
he continues his homogenized version of little richards nasty hit all the nastiness gone
it becomes a slow and lilting melody
tooty fruity oh rooty
the music continues as the camera cuts to image after image of this strange utopia
the effect is a weird sanitizied version of mtv as if ronald reagan had shot a music video
there are men tipping their hats and women walking their dogs cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen
a wap bop a loo bop a wap barn boom
the camera cranes down in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find david and jennifer walking up the sidewalk holding their stomachs
im gonna hurl david
i swear to god
just take deep breaths
all that animal fat
i feel it in my pores or something
jennifer clutches her stomach but davids glance darts from side to side totally absorbed
i still dont see why were doing this
were supposed to be in school
were supposed to be at home david
were supposed to be in color
wailing oh god
a man calls out from across the street
hear your dad got a new car
you know him
owns the hardware store
okay now you listen to me
i dont know whats going on but youd better fix it
i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear
we just gotta play along for a little while
till that guy shows up again
then ill talk to him and
bud parker and youre
um mary sue
ripping the barette from her hair no
im not gonna do it
if i dont dress like this for mom im sure as hell not going to do it for you
we dont have a choice jen
were stuck until he comes back
why cant we just explain it
jen looks around this cheery little street and the horror starts to dawn on her
at that moment they hear a screaming siren and a bright gray fire engine comes racing up the block
jennifer and david step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck grabbing the ladder on the back
they work in perfect precision
two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front
they go tearing across one of the lawns in full emergency response anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree
he emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the tree
jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by them petting it gently as he goes
oh god we are
were stuck in like nerdville
shakes her head i always knew youd pay a price for this
i knew you couldnt be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like really tragic consequences
voice wavering but its just not fair
i mean im starting to get really popular
debbi russell transferred to another school and my skins been great since march and mark davis is starting to come around and
hello mary sue
jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old driving by in his convertible
he is extremely handsome with jack armstrong features and a lettermans sweater
despite her crisis jennifers jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl
biff martin flashes a huge pepsodent smile
the guy is a dreamboat
whats all the commotion
wheres the cat
biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck with the kitty in his arms
smiling at her again well guess ill see ya later mary sue
he takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his really keen convertible
jennifer gapes as he disappears around the corner
captain of the basketball team
still gaping does he you know like me
as a matter of fact he does
flicking her hair hunh
streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double doors
all cheery and very pleasant looking
it looks like a leni riefenstahl movie
david stands beside jennifer looking at the entrance to the school
three girls huddle together by the front steps
those are my friends
peggy jane lisa anne and betty jean
staring at them can we do any better
i dont think so
seeing her mary sue
youre gonna be late for geography
she flicks her hair back cops a first day of school attitude and heads across the street like she owns the place
it looks like a propaganda film from the eisenhower administration
the boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve button down shirts
the girls all have lacy dresses buttoned to the neck
everyone stares straight ahead at the blackboard
miss peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in her hand
she indicates a diagram that spans the length of the blackboard
last week class we discussed the geography of main street
this week were going to be talking about elm street
can anyone tell me one of the differences between elm street and main street
its not as long
jennifer looks stunned as several students nod
thats right tommy
its not as long
also it only has houses
so the geography of main street is different than the geography of elm street
she glances around at several students who seem to be nodding in agreement
all at once she thrusts her hand into the air
whats outside of pleasantville
the teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her face
she looks vaguely troubled
beat i dont understand
outside of pleasantville
whats at the end of main street
the class lets out a knowing groan as if to say oh
we get it now
boy what a stupid question
miss peters gives a kind but condescending look
oh mary sue
you should know the answer to that
the end of main street is just the beginning again
miss peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and down
jennifer stares straight ahead dumbfounded
there are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the gym
each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks with a pleasantville jersey
he stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his hand
not exactly an athletic image
david lets go of a jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net
he looks a little surprised
he stares at the backboard slightly intrigued
david retrieves the ball and fires again this time chucking it up blind
the ball sails through the hoop again hitting ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the hoop
all of the shots sail through the hoop none even nicking the rim
the boys retrieve their shots as the coach claps his hands
thats it men
keep it up
big game tomorrow
he gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely
david flings the ball wildly over his shoulder
it bounces off all the walls of the gym then glides through the net as smoothly as the others
he stares in amazement
biff martin the boy in the convertible approaches from the other side of the gym
he is a classic all american hero somewhere between h club member and a future astronaut
a little nervous hi ya bud
hi ya biff
he fidgets nervously for a moment looking down
can i ask you a question
if i was to ask your sister
what i mean is if i was to go up to mary sue
are we in that episode
i dont believe it
whats the matter
you want to ask her out tonight right
and then you want to give her your school pin
howd you know
shaking his head lucky guess
beat look biff
i dont think its a real good time for that right now
biffs expression falls
he stands crushed in front of david
what i mean is
mary sues been a little different lately
stunned she wont go out with me
i didnt say that
its just that right now
i dont know what id do if she wouldnt go out with me
all at once biff takes the basketball hes been holding and hurls it toward the hoop
the ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim and then amazingly pops out
play comes to a halt
all the players turn and stare he retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to biff
david pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other side of the gym
under his breath look im sure well work something out
ill talk to her or something
biff looks at him troubled
itll be fine
biff nods a little confused as david pats him on the back
david stands off to the side with his sister while class pours out around them
one date jen thats all im asking
if you dont go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack
its too weird david
this place is giving me the creeps
did you know all the books are blank
i looked in the library
they got covers with nothing inside them
what were you doing in a library
i got lost
beat oh here
look at this
she reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches
jennifer tries to light a kleenex on fire
you know why those guys just get cats out of trees
cause nothing burns around here thats why
they dont need any firemen
sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant
trembling i like really need a cigarette too
putting his arm around her ill get us out of here
i really will
but if we dont play along we could alter their whole existence
we may never get home
she looks over at him slowly
you really think anybodys gonna like notice if i dont have a chocolate malt with this guy
at that moment three of mary sues friends come tittering around the comer
they skitter up to her like a group of wind up toys
high pitched rapid fire you wont believe what we just heard
biff martins going to ask you out
and thats not all
no thats not all
hes going to give you his pin
they explode in a torrent of titters all over again
jennifer looks over at david
a lone streetlamp glows in the foreground
jennifers voice plays os
you sure im supposed to wear this
jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a poodle skirt
under the sweater she wears a s bullet bra that turn her breasts into lethal weapons
looking in the mirror i could like kill a guy with these things
its in your closet
examining her profile ive worn some kinky stuff before
he wont notice anyway
what do you mean
they dont notice that kind of thing
so whats the point
ive got like three pounds of underwire here
just go with the program hunh
im late for work
the flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink
underneath it the swirling script spells soda shop
johnny mathis drifts out into the evening air
david comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get his breath
he adjusts a little soda jerks hat then plunges inside
johnson the owner and proprietor is wiping down the counter
he is a pleasant looking man in his early forties wearing a white apron and black glasses
the strains of misty get louder as bud lets the screen door slam behind him
looking up bud
i had to help my folks and then i couldnt find my hat
he stops wiping for a moment holding the towel in his hand
i didnt know what to do
he stares at the rag a little troubled
well i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries
but you didnt come so i kept on wiping
he looks down at the towel clearly disturbed
david pauses for a moment then starts toward him
he crosses to mr
johnson who has polished one section of the counter right down to the wood
david takes the towel out of his hand and folds it neatly in front of him
gently you know if this ever happens again you can make the fries even if i havent put out the napkins yet
im so glad youre here
biffs convertible rolls up to the curb with pat boone playing on the radio
he runs a comb through his short blonde hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and heading up the walk
biff rings the doorbell and a moment later jennifers silhouette appears in the doorway
the place is really hopping now
all the spots in the parking lot are filled with vintage jalopies and several patrons are streaming through the door
the same johnny mathis song is still playing on the juke box and the neon ice cream soda sign blinks against the sky
david is trapped behind the counter furiously working to keep up with the load
several clean cut teenagers pepper him with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots
its clear he isnt used to this
frazzled peppermint shake chocolate soda two orders of fries and a split
peppermint soda two chocolate shakes order of fries and well split it
david nods quickly wiping some sweat from his brow
he scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as mr
johnson comes up beside him
there arent any cheeseburgers
well usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce
listen to me
johnson recoils slightly
do you have the lettuce
have you cooked the burgers
well you can just put on the lettuce finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along
johnson stares at him
the screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a lettermans sweater
a moment later jennifer sashays through parading her new jane russell profile
her girlfriends titter from the comer as biff rushes up to a table and pulls out a chair
she sashays into it brushing against him as she goes
he stares motionless at the spectacle concerned and apprehensive
david holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all over his chest
biff stares across the table at jennifer with the wholesome devotion of a labrador retriever
he looks like a cross between troy donahue and a mannequin
haltingly i sure am glad you said youd come out with me tonight mary sue
full blown mary sue well gee whizz biff
i sure am glad you asked me
he guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again
i dont know if i ever said this to you before but well
i think youre just about the keenest girl in the whole school
all sarcasm gosh
i hardly know what to say
what can i get you two
he stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper and a pencil
jennifer looks up at her brother and almost bursts out laughing
he wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty angle with large white apron tied around his neck
oh i dunno bud
guess ill have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke
more goony laughs
david turns to jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance
oh i dunno bud
guess ill just have a salad and an evian water
he shoots her a dirty look
jennifer just smiles at him
cheeseburger it is
he glowers at her all the way back to the counter
david posts the order in the little carousel clip board keeping an eye on the table the entire time
biff gazes across the table at jennifer with an adoring look on his face
his hands are properly folded in front of him
shes still trying to do her best mary sue
see the whole time we were in civics together i really wanted to sit next to you but you were always sitting between peggy jane and lisa anne
there is some tittering behind her
jennifer doesnt respond
and you always seemed so smart and everything
like that report you did on our town hall
i didnt know what id talk to you about
well sometimes talkings over rated
dont you think
goony laugh oh right
he still doesnt understand
biff guffaws for a moment or two then glances down at the table top
there is a momentary break in the music as johnny mathis misty starts up all over again
its enough to make you shoot yourself
so i know i havent been steady with anybody but i just dont want to rush it
you dont want to make a mistake with something that important
oh gosh no
i mean theres kids that are even holding hands already but i figure theres plenty of time for that kind of thing later on
oh you bet
beat will you excuse me for a sec
jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom
he freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister practically stumbles through the bathroom door
of course there arent any toilets
jennifer gropes her way to the sink and leans against the counter
she turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a dumbstruck look on her face
jennifer shakes her head for a moment or two when the door to the bathroom bursts open
overlapping did he give it to you
did he give it to you
i bet he gave it to her did he give it to you
straight ahead i dont think he knows how
they titter away even though they dont get it either
it sounds like an aviary
i bet hes gonna take her to lovers lane
i bet he is
i bet he is
i bet hes even gonna hold her hand
they titter some more as jennifer shakes her head
david is standing beside their table as she retums from the bathroom
chipper couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes
pointedly if you need anything ill be right over there
mary sue gee whiz bud what could we possibly need when we have each other
she flashes him a sweet smile then reaches out and touches biffs hand
both boys jump slightly as jennifer gives her brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves bye bye
david just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the soda fountain
i really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but
you want to get out of here
you wanna get out of here
you wanna leave
confused but where would we go
shrugging lovers lane
swallow lovers lane
there is an audible gasp from the booth behind them
jennifer ignores it
you up for it
he just stares at her with his mouth open
jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand
david is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he sees jennifer leading biff by the hand into the parking lot
everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert when david lets out a blood curdling scream
he vaults over the counter making a bee line for the door
everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance
biffs car is just pulling onto the street when david sprints into the parking lot
he takes off after the car sprinting down the street
the tail lights recede in the distance as david slows to a jog and then finally a walk
he pauses winded in the street then looks up toward heaven with a pissed off look on his face
to god thanks a lot
it is a beautiful tree lined pond with a lush willow tree in the foreground
the moonlight glistens silver across the water
several cars are parked in a row with their occupants holding hands
biffs convertible is parked at the end
he sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead
jennifer is draped languidly across the seat beside him making the most of her mohair sweater
she stares at biff in a not so pleasantville kind of way
he glances over at her and swallows
sure is pretty
staring at him oh yeah
to be honest mary sue
i didnt think youd want to come here until wed been pinned for a little while
you can pin me any time you want to
she leans back a liftle more draping her arm across the top of the seat
her tits point toward the sky
breathy or maybe i should just pin you
he looks over at her a little confused then breaks into his goony laugh
oh thats silly mary sue
how could you possibly pin me
he is still guffawing when he looks over at jennifer and suddenly freezes
biffs eyes widen
david comes sprinting up to the porch then doubles over catching his breath
he clings onto the porch swing when the door opens behind him
his mother and father come out onto the porch
david catches his breath then forces a smile
son whats wrong
have you seen mary sue
shes still on her date with biff
is something the matter
still panting a little no i
i was just
worried about her
his mother and father exchange a knowing look
george rests a hand on his shoulder
oppressively paternal bud your sisters a little older now and shes naturally going to start going out with boys
beat in fact pretty soon shes even going to get married and make someone a good little home maker like your mother here
smiles at betty inside joke thats if she can learn to bake
but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about
the low gutteral moans of two coupling animals drifts out over the evening air
it is raw and primitive and desperate
the camera begins to track behind all the other cars their occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette
it finally comes to rest on a convertible at the end with a girls leg sticking out the window
a lettermans sweater hangs over the door
the windshield is completely fogged
jennifers sweater is draped over the backseat
the car is rocking
they are clenched in a mad embrace all arms and hair
biff pulls back for a moment gasping for air
his face is covered with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye
hes stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings desperately to the steering wheel
some terror i think i better go home now mary sue
she holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard
more terror i think
i might be ill
he glances down at his lap a little confused
a whisper i think somethings happening to me
he looks at his crotch then back at jennifer
she reaches up and grabs a handful of his hair
its sposed to happen biff
he looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down and out of frame
a single light is burning in the kitchen window
do you want some more cookies
david is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his face
there are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs all over the table
sick oh no
how bout some marshmallow rice squares
there is a knock behind them at the door
david springs up
now who could that be
he crosses into the foyer ahead of his parents
david swings open the door revealing mr
johnson standing on the porch
you took off so quick
i wasnt sure if you were okay
had to get home early
johnson leans in closer and speaks in a confidential tone of voice
sotto you know how when we close up i close the register then you lower the shades then i turn out the lights then we both lock the doors
proud well you werent around this time so i did the whole thing myself
johnson has a strange look of manly pride on his face
his shoulders square back
his chest puffs out a little
there is a sudden sparkle in his eye
more confidential not only that i didnt even do it in the same order
first i lowered the shades then i closed the register
he looks at david with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him
oh hello betty
neither one says anything but neither one has to
david looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with mr
johnson and his new found virility
quickly well look thanks for coming by
really appreciate it
he turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as biffs convertible pulls up at the curb
she looks sweetly over at the drivers side of the car out well gee thanks biff
i had a really wonderful time
he sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his face
biff stares stunned at jennifer like he just got hit with a couple of thousand volts
she leans over and kisses him on the cheek
then she bites his ear lobe gently and flashes him a big smile
biff smiles back
she climbs out and shuts the door
jennifer nods to mr
johnson as she heads up the walk
sweetly hello mr
oh hello mary sue
she is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch
david grabs her arm
urgent whisper what did you do to him
she starts up the staircase
david follows her and the camera follows them both
what do you mean nothing
thats not nothing
she reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him
we had a really nice time
mock yawn now im really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so
she flashes her brother an evil grin
she shuts the door softly in his face
david stairs at the gray wood in front of him
biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in his eye
the car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or two before he glances over to his right
the stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement there against a gray picket fence on a black and white street in a black and white neighborhood a single red
rose it would be a stunning vista if it wasnt in black and white
the church steeple gleams in the sunlight
the perfect little houses look like a row of pretty toys
david sits parked in front of the tv furtively turning through the channels
he flips the dial frantically
no sign of dick van dyke
its in the morning
are you watching television
he gives her a sheepish grin and sighs
it is the same configuration as earlier
everyone wears their pleasantville lions jerseys white sneakers and black socks
david enters the gym a little groggy
he hasnt had much sleep
he looks up and stops
david cocks his head to the side staring across the gym
they are huddled at the far end each holding a basketball under his arm
biff is in the center of the group animatedly describing something that is holding their rapt attention
quietly oh no
biff continues his story while they stare at him with their mouths open
the coach blows his whistle
come on men
big game next week
the huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander toward the hoop
ten shots go up at once but not one comes even close
several clang off the rim a couple hit the edge of the backboard
one slams into the side of the gym
everyone stares in disbelief
oh my god
david stands face to face with his sister in mid conversation
you cant do this jennifer
i warned you
so whats the big deal
theyre like not good at basketball anymore
like omigod what a tragedy
you dont understand
youre messing with their universe
well maybe it needs to be messed with
did that ever like occur to you
beat you know they dont want to be like this its just that nobody ever helped them before
walking past ms
how you doin
how you doin
relishing her new word kewl
jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by
you have no right to do this
well if i dont who will
theyre happy like this
david nobodys happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set
you like all this dont you
david recoils slightly
i mean you dont think its just like dorky or funny or something
you really like it
shudders oh god
i am just so personally horrified right now
i just dont think we have the right to
david let me tell you something
these people dont want to be geeks
they want to be attractive
theyve got a lot of potential they just dont know any better
they dont have that kind of potential
you want to like take a look
jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked in an intimate conversation
the girl wears bobby socks and the boy wears a lettermans sweater but the conversation is sexually charged
they speak to one another in a close whisper their faces inches apart
all at once the girt gets shy and glances away
she blows a big bubble with her gum but the bubble is bright pink in an otherwise gray frame
what kind of gum is that
he looks over in shock as she sucks the brightly colored bubble gum back into her mouth
jennifer flicks her hair
i gotta go
im meeting biff at the flagpole
it is the exact same shot as before the camera starts its long slow track behind the vehicles except this time all of them are rocking
various limbs and articles of clothing hang out the open windows
moans of pleasure waft out over lovers lane as the pond glistens in the distance
it is a typical s family practice right out of norman rockwell
there is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter and a jar of lollipops beside them
lisa anne mary sues best friend is being examined by dr
her mother sits at her side
let me see it again
lisa anne opens her mouth and sticks out a bright red tongue
everything else in the frame is black and white but her tongue literally gleams with color
examining it well
i dont think its anything to worry about
itll probably just clear up by itself
to lisa anne cut down on greasy foods and chocolate
no french fries that kind of thing
aside to the mother its just a teenage thing
it is really rocking now
more cars are lined up along the edge of the lake as the real and nasty version of tooty
got a gal her name is sue
she knows just what to do
the pleasantville lions lose a game late in the second half
the scoreboard reads to
david examines the back of the tv set
a large group of customers is huddled in a circle staring at an item on the display floor like it is the monolith in
they seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as the camera pushes in to reveal a double bed
david sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a brillcream commercial plays in front of him
a wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom
he heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat but hes clearly disconcerted
david stops and stares at a bright red hot rod parked at the front door of the restaurant
he shakes his head
the place has been transformed
what was cheery and benign a couple of days before has gotten a little bit dangerous
the letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets
the pat boone and johnny mathis have given way to real rock and roll
there is a james dean marlon brando edge in the air
somebody has played the flip side
he enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat
a young couple makes out passionately in the doorway all tongues and hands
when they break david sees that the girls cheeks are flushed with red
he stares at her for a beat as they return to normal
david shakes his head
he crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad of paper
various things have already gone to color around the room the juke box
the coke sign
the naugahide stools
david crosses to one of the booths where his sisters arm is draped over biffs shoulder
whatll it be
still chipper as ever gee whizz bud
guess ill just have the usual
cheeseburger and a cherry coke
bud has already written it down
he glances over at his sister
it seems so fattening
before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind the counter
bud posts the order and turns to mr
two cheeseburgers two cherry cokes
staring straight ahead there arent any cheeseburgers
i thought we talked about this i thought we said
oh whats the point bud
looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness in his eyes
david grabs his arm
he pulls him along the counter toward a little office storeroom in the back
he yanks him inside and shuts the door
it is just as cheery as the rest of the place
there is a small table with a telephone on it
a texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their rambler
what did you say
johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion
im not sure i see the point anymore
what are you talking about
you make hamburgers
that is the point
no i know
i know i do
he pauses then looks up but its always the same you know
grill the bun flip the meat melt the cheese
it never changes
it never gets any better or worse
just listen to me
not hearing him like the other night when i closed up by myself
that was different
forget about that
beat lower but i really liked it
bud takes a deep breath
he stares at mr
johnson then tries to speak softly
look you cant always like what you do
sometimes you just do it because its your job
and even if you dont like it you just gotta do it anyway
exasperated so they can have their hamburgers
this sounds stupid even to david
he shakes his head
like a secret you know what i really like
warily whats that
david rolls his eyes
johnson leans closer speaking furtively
see every year on dec i get to paint the christmas decorations in the window
and every year i get to paint a different thing
beat one year its the north pole
the next i do santas workshop
here ill show you
he pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens it for david
thats pretty good
continuing but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year
and then i thought gee
that seems awfully silly
that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment dont you think
david looks at him speechless
well dont you
i think you should try not to think about this anymore
ill try that then
the barber pole spins in three shades of gray
several men are gathered around the two chairs in the front of gus shop
besides being the barbershop it is the bastion of all male life in pleasantville
bud and mary sues father george sits in one of the chairs
big bob mcgee owner of the drugstore supermarket and chevy dealership sits in the other
he has a crew cut thats getting shorter
have they ever lost before
no they sure havent
just feels wrong thats all
there are several murmurs
maybe thats where they get that saying cant win em all
thats a good point ralph
they do have that saying
but they do win em all gus
theyve always won em all
thats true too
more murmurs everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure
the womens bridge club has assembled in the parker kitchen like it does every wednesday afternoon
four women are seated around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix between them
betty is sifting next to marge jenkins the woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctors office
dealing the cards he said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets
well that makes sense
except its spread to her lips now too
oh i dont know
a third woman and you say its just red
well like red only
i know what you mean
thats like the front of bill johnsons shop
i was going by it the other day and it looked green only greener
she looks up quickly then grabs some bridge mix
lowering her voice have you seen him lately
the man doesnt look like himself
i was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring
wasnt looking at anything in particular just staring off into space
that is strange
betty reaches out and grabs her cards
she fans them out in front of her when her eyes go wide
they are all hearts and all bright red
it looks like a fistfful of valentines
she puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath
betty keeps them like that for a moment or two before lifting them up and taking another look
betty its your bid
she swallows trying to keep her composure
they murmur at the strength of the hand
the sound of the television plays os while a warm light burns in the window
jennifer and betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes
betty washes while jennifer dries and its clear whos more used to this
jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places a dish in the drying rack
rinses out a pot
can i ask you a question
she pauses for a long moment
what goes on up at lovers lane
turning toward her what do you mean
well you hear all these things lately
you know kids spending so much time up there
she looks over is it holding hands
that kind of thing
beat that and
she stops herself
it doesnt matter
i want to know
glances toward the living room lowers her voice sex
betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning
a beat goes by
jennifer looks over at her stunned but betty just looks at her with a blank curious expression
you sure you want to know this
she crosses to the kitchen door and closes it
the sounds of the tv in the living room disappear
jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her
you see mom
softer and with understanding when two people like each other very much
betty looks at her and nods
the tv keeps flickering in the window
the camera pans across the kitchen table where there is a full quart of milk and some uneaten co kies
it finally comes to rest on jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table with a concerned look on her face
she nods shaken but fine
betty stares long and hard at the plate of chocolate chip cookies
shes far away
softly its just that
looking up your father would never do anything like that
she bites her lip weighing her next sentence
leaning forward oh
whisper woman to woman well mom
theres ways to enjoy yourself without dad
she looks across the table perplexed
george crosses from the dresser to the two twin beds in the middle of the room
he wears long sleeve pajamas that are buttoned up to the neck
george puts his glass of warm milk on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed
it is barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering
you coming to bed
there is no answer
she stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub
her dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well
calling out yeah
im just going to take a bath first
she swallows once as she stares down at the tub then reaches for the spigot and turns on the water
bettys heart beats a little faster as she hears the water thundering down
betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top of her robe
she slips it off and lets it drop to the floor standing naked in the middle of the bathroom
betty glances toward the mirror and then quickly glances away
she takes a deep breath and steps into the tub
betty slides down into the warm water breathing in the steam and closing her eyes for a moment
she lingers like that for a second or two before settling a little lower in the tub
betty opens her eyes but they only half open
there is the slight trace of a smile
her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently
the water continues to thunder down as she arches her back
bettys breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all over again she stares in amazment
beads of sweat form on bettys forehead as the world goes to technicolor
the thundering water pounds in the background but beneath can be heard the beginnings of a faint low moan
her eyes dart around the room
her breathing quickens faster
the huge elm tree across the street suddenly bursts into flames
fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing clouds of black smoke fill the air
bright orange flames david is staring at the television set when he notices a weird orange glow
he glances behind him out the living room window
oh my god
david comes racing out of the front door and down the walk
a small crowd has gathered in front of the fire
they dont seem frightened just sort of amazed
the street is still black and white but it is now bathed in a weird orange light
the flames leap higher and higher
he takes off down the block as fast as he can run
the crowd continues to stare as david turns the corner at main street
he races in the front of the building screaming at the top of his lungs
there is no sign of life on the ground floor
david races up the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story
all the firemen are sitting around playing gin rummy when david rushes in the front door
they can hear his voice from down the hall
entering they still dont move
all the firemen just look at him from their bunks with a perplexed expression
beat all at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets and their yellow slickers
they race to the landing just outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole
the fire has spread to an adjoining tree as the fire engine comes screaming toward the house from the top of the block
david sits in the front of the truck next to the fire chief who drives the vehicle at break neck speed
the fire engine screeches to a halt
the fire chief looks around
where is it
david shoots him a look then glances at the inferno
he shakes his head and leaps from the truck
he races around to the back where the other firemen are standing just as confused
david grabs one of the hoses and begins to pull it from the truck
grab this nozzle
but wheres the
just grab it
he strips out about fifteen feet of hose then grabs the fireman and pulls him toward the curb
david parts the crowd and positions the man right in front of the flames
now point this right at the flames like this
the fireman nods and does as he is told
david opens the valve sending out a huge flume of water
beat so thats what these do
a huge smile breaks out across the firemans face like a man who has suddenly found his purpose in life
he beams from ear to ear dousing the flames while david runs to get another hose
fading in in honor and in recognition of your heroism
david stands at a podium receiving a commendation from big bob mcgee the man from the barbershop
he holds a large plaque up for public display while davids whole family beams in the background
and with great appreciation from the citizens of pleasantville
a huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps
there are lots of balloons and bunting
i am pleased to present you with this special commendation from the pleasantville chamber of commerce
he hands the plaque to david as the entire town bursts into david walks away from the center of town looking down at his plaque
he takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge when a young woman comes up beside him
she is margaret anne henderson the prettiest girl in school and one of the most popular
margaret wears a frilly polka dot dress that only accentuates a bombshell s figure
nonetheless she seems the image of girly innocence
that was sure swell
smiling i baked you my oatmeal cookies
vaguely remembering an episode oh no
you baked those for whitey
i baked them for you
you baked them for whitey
low and gutteral no
i baked them for you
all at once margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up against him
her breasts shove up against his chest
her mouth is inches away from his
david can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and freshly baked cookies
he stares into her eyes for a moment unable to speak
margaret flashes him a not so pleasantville smile
she turns and heads around the comer while david just watches her dumbstruck
david heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat
the buddy holly music has given way to hip s jazz
dave brubeck drifts out of the soda shop as david pauses for a moment takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie and heads inside
the place has morphed even more
if it was a teenage hangout before it has become almost a bohemian coffee house now
brubecks take five plays in the background while several patrons talk intensely in their booths
david walks into the building and pauses
next to him one of the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz on a bongo drum
there are several coffee cups on the table
jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him
in a whisper i had nothing to do with that fire
quietly its okay
not directly anyhow
david glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing
all the kids are staring up at him with a weird expression of awe
still under her breath um
they like wanna ask you a question
i didnt know how to handle it
he crosses to the booth where biff and two others look up at him
its like elvis has entered the building
how you doin
they keep on staring
several glances are exchanged back and forth like theyre sharing a secret
howd you know about the fire
howd you know how to put it out and all
david hesitates weighing his words
well where i used to live
thats just what firemen did
this sends a murmur through the shop
the boy leans forward
and wheres that
outside of pleasantville
this sends a much louder murmur rifling through the kids
its like electricity
they glance excited at one another
a hush descends
whats outside of pleasantville
look it doesnt matter
its not important
what is it
david stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word
its really not important
whats outside of pleasantville
margaret henderson the girl with the cookies stands in the doorway staring at david
she hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others it just means so much more
hungry for knowledge cmon
she stares right in his eyes
shes ten feet away but might as well be touching him
there are some places where the road doesnt go in a circle
there are some places where it keeps on going
theres an excited giggle
they lean forward
an exotic concept keeps going
well it all just keeps going
from the back like the mighty mississippi
he moves forward extending a book
the cover reads the adventures of huckelberry finn
david opens the first page
there is printing inside
quoting it was big n brown n kept goin an goin as far you could see
turning to jennifer i thought the books were blank
he looks over at her
quickly okay look this like wasnt my fault
they asked me what it was about and i like didnt remember cause we had it back in tenth grade but i told them what i did remember and the
next thing i knew the pages had filled in
the pages filled in
but like only up to the part about the raft because i didnt read any farther
david flips through the book and sure enough only the first chapter has print
the pages are blank after that
do you know how it ends
hesitating well yeah
breathless so how does it end
she has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of feet away
its silent in the soda shop
theyre both running away huck and the slave
they go up the river
but in trying to get free they sort of see that theyre free already
david looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book that arent blank anymore
rows and rows of fresh new type materialize in front of him
he turns to the back of the book that is complete with a color illustration
quietly oh my god
do you know this one
he shoves another book in front of david
looks down at the book oh yeah
well this is great
beat see holden caulfield is like this really lonely kid
the camera pans down from the public library sign to find the front door
a long line of kids waiting to check out their books stretches onto the sidewalk
several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to the spinning barber pole
they watch the spectacle for a moment or two as teenager after teenager exits with an armful of books
i dont know phil
its pretty strange
ill say its strange
big bob mcgee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut
i mean goin up to that lake all the time is one thing but now theyre going to a library
i mean whats next
oughtta be havin an ice cream soda
thats where they oughtta be
from the shadows of the town hall up the block david watches the stream of kids emerge with their books
they cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound treasure
george sits on the edge of his barka lounger across the coffee table from big bob mcgee
even sitting down the man is a looming presence
besides owning the market auto dealership hardware store and gas station he also owns the insurance agency where george works
george sweats into his collar
want some bridge mix
oh no thanks
bettys making some pineapple kabobs
im fine but thank you
george nods as bob takes a belt of his martini and leans forward
george youre probably wondering why i asked if i could come over today
george shrugs then nods then shrugs
im sure youve noticed the same things we all have certain changes going on in the town
beat you know what i mean by changes
takes a belt of martini and its not just the fire or big stuff like that
its little things
beat did you hear about bill miller
wife wants him to get one of those new beds
one of those
oh my gosh
whats he gonna to do
i really dont know
beat ben millers son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market
said he didnt want to do it anymore
just took off his apron in the middle of an order
thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter took em four hours to sort the whole thing out
bob takes a belt of his drink
george everyone likes you
and it isnt just cause youre a great bowler
they respect you
heartfelt thank you very much
and its important for them to see someone they respect stand up for whats right
if you love a place you cant sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it
of course not
big patriarchal smile and thats why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce
stunned moved oh my gosh
i hardly know what to say
smiling why dont you start by saying yes and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs
calling out betty
there is no answer
louder this time still no answer
george turns around to see david standing on the landing listening to the entire conversation
their eyes lock for a moment
ill get her
he moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him
david gets a couple of steps in and stops
he looks across the room to see betty standing at the kitchen sink just staring out the window
her back is to him
she grips the formica kitchen counter
approaching slowly are you okay
she doesnt answer
david moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder
are you alright
betty turns around to face him
her face has turned she has a natural blush in her cheeks
in fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face
fighting tears what am i going to do
david moves closer and looks at her
her lip is quivering
trembling i cant go out there
how can i go out there
she looks right up at david
quieter look at me
he stares at her for a second
big green eyes full of fear and confusion
david pushes a reassuring smile
have you got any make up
in my handbag
he crosses to the counter and grabs her purse
david sits betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact
he finds it along with a wadded up kleenex
okay first well dry you out a little
he dabs at the tears while she smiles at him in gratitude then david opens the compact and takes out the large gray powder puff
it is a truly amazing sight
as david smears on the makeup she returns gradually to black and white
the skin tones disappear
the flush of her cheeks goes
david takes out a dark gray lipstick obliterating the bright red of her lips
he works on her for a second or two then takes a step back
all at once david seems to wince the life is gone from her face
in an instant betty has gone from three dimensions to two
she stands in front of him the fictional version of herself all over again
off his reaction what
david shakes his head and forces a smile
he hands her the compact so she can examine herself
betty holds it up to her face turning her head first right then left
beat does it look okay
looks just like it did
and they wont be able to tell
even quieter no
they wont be able to tell
betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair
she grabs the plate of pineapple kabobs and heads for the door
just before she goes in she pauses then plasters on a big wide stewardess smile
turning back what
he wants to say something but doesnt
david shakes his head
she smiles again and balances the tray in front of her
he watches as she opens the door and marches in the room extending the little tray of hors doeuvres in front of her
johnson is all alone in the shop setting up the napkin dispensers
he whistles brubecks take five when the screen door slams behind him
johnson looks up with a start
arent you a little early
quietly i brought you something
from the library
he has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three feet long
johnson looks at him a little intrigued as david crosses to the counter
its an art book
oh my gosh bud
johnson reaches out and opens the cover
after a beat his eyes widen
i just thought since you liked painting it might help to
its quiet and subtle but its still a gasp
david looks over at him but hes lost in the pages
massacios expulsion of adam and eve leaps off the pages in vibrant tortured color
the beauty of the garden is offset by their agony and their shame
he turns the page
titians venus to utano
soft fleshy in a rich golden light
she is utterly real and entirely nude
the folds of her flesh almost seem to glow
rembrandts self portrait
dark reds umbers blacks and browns
he looks back at mr
johnson with pain and wisdom
theres a brilliant light on his hair
faintly almost imperceptibly the sound of a rich aria begins to underscore the images
its so faint you cant be sure you even hear it at all
like youre hearing it with your eyes
he turns the pages faster
tumees steam train
johnson shuts the book
they sit like that for a beat
its beautiful bud
he looks up at david troubled
ill never be able to do that
oh well youre just starting out
i mean you cant do it
no thats not it
johnson shuts the book gently
where am i going to see colors like that
what can he say
david looks over at mr
johnson who just smiles and shrugs
must be awfully lucky to see colors like that
i bet they dont even know how lucky they are
he just stares for a second
margaret walks up the center of main street toward the camera with her books pressed against her chest
she passes the drugstore then the hardware store
far off in the distance a young man comes racing out of the soda shop pulling off his little paper hat as he goes
he comes running up behind her as fast as he can
he takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting
turning lighting up oh
pause look i probably shouldnt be asking you this not knowing you that well and all
margaret stops in the street and turns to him
its just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said i could use their car
moment of truth abandoning his speech you want to go out with me tonight
he wants to turn away but doesnt
david forces himself to stare at her and all of a sudden she beams
its the whitest pearliest smile in the world
where would we go
swallows lovers lane
david comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation
he vaults over a parking meter swings around a lampost and leaps off the bumper of a parked car
david hi fives into the air at no one in particular and sails over mr
simpsons hedge almost decking him in the process
calling back sorry
he races across the street bobbing and weaving like an all american fullback
david bounds up his front steps two at a time flinging open the door
oh when the saints
go marching in
he lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack
david starts up the stairs when he hears a mans voice coming from the living room
he pauses a second and glances back
he peers into the living room
david goes a little grayer
dick van dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the tv screen
he seems to have a bit of a stubble
stage whisper well cmere young fella
david crosses slowly over to the tv set
big smile you know ive been thinkin
i might have been a little hasty the other day when you asked to come home just took me by such surprise ya know ha ha
he gives a goony laugh
david just looks at him
so even though i cant make any promises well i figured if you asked me real nice i might just be willing to talk about it again
quickly i cant
talk about it
right now i mean
i got to
the look turns suddenly dark and ominous
bud i thought you wanted to come home
its just that i told my dad id clean out the rain gutters and mr
johnson wanted me to
to change the tape in the register
getting testy ill be honest with you bud
im getting sorta concerned about what im seeing in some of these re runs
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey
losing it a little those arent your cookies bud
oh i know theyre not
but i mean theyre just cookies after all
well theyre not just cookies
i mean theyre great cookies
look id love to get into this whole thing but im really running late
why dont we hook up tomorrow
ill talk to you then
he swttches off the tv sending dick van dyke to electronic limbo
david stands in the middle of the living room breathing hard
she sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a book
its an alien experience
jennifer is just about to open it when she senses something and glances toward the door
bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her
he seems to be out of breath
he keeps breathing hard in the doorway
david holds the remote in his hand
he takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly stops
glancing at the book yeah
cant believe you started such a dorky fad
she holds up the cover
you ever heard of him
seemed kinda sexy
i read pages
still stunned thats great
he just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift
so what is it
out of the blue can i ask you a question
remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me
well did she really like me or were you just making that up
she really liked you
you werent playing a joke
she woulda gone out with me
gone out with you
she woulda like rearranged your tonsils
he looks at her amazed reliving the missed opportunity
can i ask you a question
how come im still in black and white
back to earth what
well ive had like ten times as much sex as these girls and im still like this
they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly theyre in technicolor
oh i dont know
thinks its not just the sex
looking up quickly what
she stares at him wide eyed like someone who has just heard their name called
jennifers eyes dart around like shes calculating a math problem
after a moment or two her expression changes a vague look of recognition
no its not just the sex is it
she glances down at her book
its a big book
jennifer takes a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand
after a second or two she looks back
david looks at her for a beat
david gets out of his dads convertible carrying a dozen gray roses
he takes a deep breath and heads up her front walk
david sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with margaret henderson by his side
he concentrates hard on the road holding the wheel at and as he steals a glance to his right
its not quite evening yet and late afternoon light makes her glow
margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm wind that swirls inside the convertible
he studies her for a moment or two then suddenly swerves to avoid a parked car on his right
they pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads main street turns into a winding country road as they leave the town behind and head off into
they wind through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a second sign appears much like the first sure enough the town emerges in front of them again
completing the dimensional circle
david looks confused
you gotta turn off main street
he looks over at her and smiles
margaret turns on the radio
sam cooke sings for them as david turns from main street onto a smaller unmarked lane
the car starts to rise up a small hill with dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road
it continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the crest in the hill
david looks over at margaret who takes a deep breath shutting her eyes
he glances down at the seat between them
the roses that were gray have suddenly turned to color
they sit next to him on the seat a deep rich red
david looks up and out the windshield
the same thing seems to be happening around them
many of the dogwoods have started to turn pink
not all of them but at least fifty percent of the petals have bloomed in some weird false spring
the road twists and turns on its way to the top as they finally reach a crest in the hill
there sitting in front of them is a whole world gone technicolor the lake is bluer than blue
the weeping willow is greener than green
the dogwood petals all turned now over the car radios cupid draw back your bow
slowly david rolls the convertible forward
many of the kids have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by the edge of the water
a few of them have books open
it almost looks athenian
david looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly cocks his head to the side
whats that smell
margaret looks at him and smiles
she leans well out of the convertible and plucks a gardenia from a bush that is blooming beside the car
arent these great
david takes the flower then puts it up to his nose
he takes a long deep breath then all at once his posture seems to relax
as the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like some strange narcotic is washing over him
david lowers the flower
betty is walking down main street with a shopping bag on either hand
from a block away she looks like any other homemaker in pleasantville
you dont even notice the gray make up
she nods to mrs
filmore in the bakery and smiles at don in the post office
betty is just about to turn on elm street when she glances up and suddenly stops
there in the middle of the block sits mr
johnsons soda shop
the whole scene is still black and white except for the large cubist painting that fills mr
it is rendered in bright pinks yellows and oranges and looks like a braque or a picasso except for the unusual subject matter
upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene with a cubist santa hovering over the roof tops
she stares at it mesmerized for a moment then starts to wander across the street
its late afternoon and the business district is empty
betty crosses in the middle of the block staring straight ahead
the door opens and she sticks her head inside
most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store
betty glances around
the little bell jingles as she enters
were closed right now
he sits in front of a small easel near the back staring at a board which doubles as a canvas
johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes betty in the doorway
turning to leave im sorry
come on in
he gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door still holding the palette in his hand
betty stares at the cubist christmas in the window
i just thought
their eyes lock for a second
sort of a clutzy silence
johnson motions toward his easel
i was just trying to do one of these still lifes
he sighs and looks behind him
next to the easel is a bowl of having kind of a tough time
i think it looks nice
shrugs heres what its sposed to look like
he leads her over to the table and points down at the art book
its open to a cezanne that nearly burns off the page
they are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book
neither one of them moves
betty almost disappears into the pictures drawn by a strange new world
look at this
he turns to kandinsky a massive swirl of color
the image is nearly electric
breathless whered you get this
bud brought it to me
heres my favorite
he turns the page near the back to one of picassos weeping women
the woman is rendered in pink and red and green
her head is a large sphere laying peacefully on her own shoulder
what do you think
she doesnt answer
isnt it great how shes resting like that
faintly shes crying
johnson looks down at the painting
no shes not
yes she is
he looks up at her
a single tear is running down bettys cheek
she senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away but instead of just wiping the tear she takes off a huge swath of gray make up
a long strip of pink flesh is revealed underneath
he stares up at her in amazement
she senses something and glances down at her hand
her fingertips are covered in gray make up
betty turns and bolts for the door
following her wait
ive got to go
he stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall
johnson touches her shoulder
let me see
he reaches up and gently touches her chin
johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek
she freezes like that for a moment then slowly haltingly turns toward him
the color of her real flesh is revealed underneath
betty stands there exposed
a whisper its beautiful
she swallows not sure what to do
betty glances down
you shouldnt cover that up
johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on the counter and pulls one out
he leans forward and dabs at the tears beneath bettys eyes
then slowly gently he starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek
she recoils a bit tensing up then just looks at him
johnson is gazing at her true color with wonder and acceptance
she hesitates for an instant then seems to make a decision
betty slowly turns her face to the side exposing her flesh all the way down to the neck
johnson continues to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge
she lies on her bed reading the same book she was browsing earlier
jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the pages lying on her stomach scouring every word
after a moment or two she gets restless and shifts position lifting the book
the cover is plainly visible lady chatterlys she doesnt have enough light so jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to her desk
she sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her
jennifer is deep into the plot and doesnt even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp
she could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk
she flips the page and peers more intently
her hair is bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony tail
after a little while her eyes begin to get more tired and she looks up and blinks a couple of times
jennifer notices something across the desk
a pair of mary sues glasses are neatly folded in front of her
jennifer reaches out puts them on her head glances back down at the print
she can see much clearer now
jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesnt even realize that she has mimicked the photograph of mary sue that sits beside her in a silver frame
the face is the same but thats to be expected
so is the pony tail the glasses the posture and the studious look on her face
jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud tap on the window
she rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain
jennifer slides open the window
biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window
mary sue cmon
leaning out the window what are you doing
jiggling in anticipation its six thirty
we were gonna
he jiggles some more
remembering i cant
she glances down at her book
surprised with what
she hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk
her own image in the silver frame stares back at her
the hair is pulled back in a pony tail
the glasses sit on the front of her nose
turning to biff im studying
she thinks about it for a moment then suddenly smiles
biff stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as jennifer reaches up and quietly closes the window
david and margaret sit on the edge of the grass looking out across the water
even in the moonlight the colors are vivid
david still clutches the gardenia in his hand taking a long hit like an opium addict
do they have those
where you come from
beat i dont know
you dont know
margaret laughs like that isnt even possible
she shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee
it reveals a long tan leg beneath it
david watches as she kicks off her shoes rubbing her feet through the long cool grass
so whats it like
a whisper out there
she clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves
david thinks for a moment
she leans forward
well its louder
and scarier i guess
and a lot more dangerous
you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming took off all their clothes
david looks at her in amazement
do they have an ocean
ive heard about the ocean
whats that like
well its big
and its blue
as if realizing it for the first time its really really blue
its hot up here
suddenly and without warning margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater
she slips it off arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and david just stares at her breasts
she wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette
she lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it
you want some berries
she unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in i picked them myself
they grow wild up here
eating one mmm
looking at them they just grow like that
looking straight up oh yeah
theres a lot of stuff
currants and strawberries
ill show you
she hops up and scampers across the grassy bank kicking her heels behind her
margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb stretching out her body like a piece of statuary
she picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him hiking up her skirt as she goes
margaret sticks out her hand offering him a bright red apple
its brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight
he hesitates just looking at it
margaret speaks in a whisper
she is lying on her stomach now and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage
margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground
david reaches out and takes it
for this instant they seem alone in the garden
he looks down at it then glances over at margaret
david hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple
george heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a happy tune
he smiles at mr
simpson and swings the attache case as he turns and heads up his front walk
george opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs like he always does
he hangs his hat on the hatrack his coat on the coatrack and beams as he hollers his nightly greeting honey im home
there is no response
he looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again honey im home
there is more silence
george looks around a little confused when there is a booming clap of thunder
betty sits in a comer of the shop next to the gray bowl of fruit
she holds her head to the side sitting gracefully with her chin in the air
johnson sits behind his easel painting her portrait from a few feet away
betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup the warm pink of her flesh tones lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb
she looks over at mr
johnson when they hear the booming clap of thunder
each of them freezes
there is another louder the cubist snowscene lights up brightly illuminated by the sudden flash of lightning behind it
betty leaps up from the chair and crosses to the window looking out
frightened what is that
i dont know
betty looks back at mr
johnson and suddenly sees the painting
she flinches for a second
her eyes go wide
it is cubist like the rest of his recent work but that isnt the shocking part
even though she sits in front of him fully clothed mr
johnson has painted a beautiful sensual nude
betty just stares at the canvas stunned to see herself revealed like that
the colors are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows like some fauvist celebration of summertime
there is another even louder peel of thunder
she looks over at mr
johnson and he glances down
after a moment or two he looks back at her but she doesnt turn to run
betty just stares at him then without even realizing it moves slightly closer
david and margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss
at first they dont separate when they hear the booming clap of thunder
it is only when they hear the second one and the rain starts to fall that margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky
what is that
he is still in an amorous daze and doesnt even feel the increasing rain
it starts to pound harder and margaret looks to him in terror
whats going on
you dont have rain either
she looks at him frightened
of course you dont
he puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the grassy slope
a dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank looking in terror at the water falling from the sky
what do we do
reaching the car well just put up the top
he goes fishing around the boot of the car looking for the catch to release it
david leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder
he looks back at her
no top either
david smiles drenched in rain and puts his arm around margaret who is starting to shiver
he leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together
they look at one another terrified as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock
theres nothing to be afraid of
they look a little reassured and margaret looks up at him positively adoringly
she clings to his shoulder as the storm howls a few feet away
she stands at the window looking out at the driving rain
jennifer still holds the d
lawrence book in her hand
there is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of thunder
she flops back down on the bed and continues to read
george wanders through the empty and darkened house completely perplexed and utterly disoriented
he looks around for his family but all he can find are the darkened rooms and the sound of the driving storm
a little frightened a little petulant honey im home
he still cant find her and he crosses into the dining room
the lights are dark there as well and he looks around confused
baffled wheres my dinner
he sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking smells
george flings open the door to the kitchen but thats empty as well
he crosses into the darkness
wheres my dinner
george comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer
he slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going
insistent wheres my dinner
its really blowing now
the rain is coming down in heavy sheets being swirled and driven by the wind
the front door opens and george wanders out onto the front porch still dressed in his shirtsleeves
wheres my dinner
he stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete confusion
the rain pounds against his body and within seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin
over the storm a tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling through the torrent
george reels down elm street screaming skyward in the distance
he turns on main street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works
george howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store the gas station the bakery
finally he pauses outside the barbershop
its empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain
george lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop
his voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering
plaintively wheres my dinner
he wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk
the regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across three lanes
each wears a pleasantville bowling shirt sponsored by one of big bobs businesses
the noise from the crashing pins is deafening and there arent any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed
he picks up a split and claps his hands in delight
he starts to cross back to the scorers table when he looks up and suddenly stops
george is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold and shivering
his shirt is soaked through to the skin
his hair is drenched and dripping
he doesnt answer
george clutches his body and keeps shivering
the men stop bowling and rush to georges side
he blinks a couple of times still soaked to the bone
are you alright
looking at him what is it
beat real rain
bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm
a huge fork of lightning lights up the sky
oh my god
he turns back to george
we had no idea
burt was rolling a and
beat are you alright
george shivers and bobs leads him over to one of the benches and guides him into the seat
still shivering well i
i came home like i always do and i came in the front door
and i took off my coat
and i put down my briefcase and i said honey
they all nod in recognition
only no one was there
a murmur goes through the men
so i went into the kitchen and i yelled it again
honey im home
but there was no one there either
they all gasp
so i went to the oven you know because i thought maybe she had made me one of those tv dinners
the men nod and lean forward
george shakes his head
but she hadnt
she was gone
a louder murmur moves through the crowd
george lowers his head and just shakes it from side to side
big bob moves up and puts a hand on his shoulder
gently the patriarch its gonna be fine george
george looks up at him helplessly
bob pats him reassuringly on the back
what do we do bob
well well be safe for now thank goodness were in a bowling alley but if george here doesnt get his dinner any one of us could be next
it could be you gus or you burt or even you phil
they murmur again
bob gathers a little steam
like a wwii movie thats real rain out there gentlemen
this isnt some little virus thats going to clear up on its own
theres something happening to our town and i think we can all see where it comes from
they nod in agreement
were gonna need a town meeting
phil how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop
couple of hours
gus why dont you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks
big bob turns to george and smiles
its a warm patriarchal smile
he claps a hand on georges shoulder
soothingly and the first thing youre gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt
the rain still pounds out the window
betty and mr
johnson are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through mr
johnsons snow scene in the window
betty is in soft radiant color now
almost the whole frame seems to glow pink
you cant go out there
but i really should get home
but you cant go out there
there is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of thunder
shes past struggling
betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the roof
once you get used to it
there is another flash and a loud boom
betty smiles this time
like a drum
thinks or like sprinklers in the summer
they both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little
the rain pounds harder on the roof as betty nestles down in the booth a little closer to mr
they just sit there listening for a moment or two
betty starts to smile
david huddles with margaret under the rocky ledge as she nestles against him with her head on his shoulder
she lies on her bed still reading the book the spitting image of mary sue
her hair is up in a bun now
the glasses have slipped down her nose
there is another fork of lightning and the loudest thunder clap of all
jennifer smiles slightly and pulls mary sues afghan over her shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page
drops of moisture cling to the petals as it gleams brilliant the rain is gone now
the town glistens in the sunlight complete with a huge rainbow arching across the sky
literally all the colors in the rainbow shine against the black and white of the town
it looks like a greeting card
betty and mr
johnson are asleep in the booth lying in each others arms
sunlight streams in through the window warming mr
johnsons face which has now turned to color
he opens his eyes and looks outside
seeing the rainbow oh my gosh
birds are chirping
david and margaret also lie asleep in each others arms beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang
margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow
she has turned to color as well
awed oh my god
she has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest
jennifers hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears mary sues glasses but her face has returned to its rosy pink hue
she blinks open her eyes feeling the sunlight and looks out the window
looking at the rainbow oh my god
the men are all passed out across the various lanes and scoring tables
it looks like a ymca shelter
after a moment or two big bob yawns and stretches and glances out the glass doorway
he sees the rainbow and freezes in shock
horrified oh my god
david comes gliding up maple street in the sunshine with a huge smile on his face
he has that special grin and faraway look that a boy only knows once in his life
perplexingly he is still in black and white
bud turns on elm street and starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly freezes
there tacked to the bark is a hastily scrawled public notice he looks up at it for a moment
george and betty stand face to face in their suburban kitchen
he is black and white
she is in full color
i told you where i was
i got caught in the storm
you were gone all night too
the ultimate defense i was in a bowling alley
betty turns glances out the window
sudden smile look
lets just forget about it
lets just go to the meeting and
i told you george
im not going
bigger smile sure you are
no im not
she turns to face him
george flinches slightly
look at me george
that meetings not for me
look at my face
youll put on some make up and
i dont want to put on some make up
georges eyes widen
its a watershed moment
protesting it goes away
itll go away
gently i dont want it to go away
he suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his chest
the s patriarch okay now you listen to me
beat youre gonna come to this meeting and youre gonna put on this make up and youre gonna come home at six oclock every night and have dinner ready on
softly no im not sweetie
his expression leaves as quickly as it came
betty moves closer to him
half whisper theres a meatloaf in the fridge
you just put it in the oven and turn this little knob up to three fifty
if you put the pie in forty minutes later itll be hot in time for dessert
georges eyes widen
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags
much quieter im gonna go now
where are you gonna go
im gonna go now
she turns and starts out the kitchen door when george calls after her
betty dont go out there like that
theyll see you
beat theyll see you
and she closes the door behind her
betty come back here
dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the front door
several transformed teenagers stare at the spectacle with their flesh colored skin and bright blue eyes
they seem to hang back in the shadows
big bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that reads pleasantville chamber of commerce
as the only legally constituted body in pleasantville it is a natural place for a town meeting
there is nothing bright and cheery however
the floor lamps in each comer cast huge looming shadows up the walls
the light at the podium bathes big bobs face in a blinding splash of light
the whole thing evokes some weird twisted image from german expressionism like they are about to go look for frankenstein
it is grayer than gray
big bob stands at a lectern with a rotary insignia on the front
he speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and women who hang on his every word
bob holds a bright yellow this was found over in dave murphys trash can
there were four of them like this
there is a murmur from the crowd
he sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind bob
george wears a shiny new rotary pin in his lapel as a full fledged member of the chamber of commerce
he sits stoic and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a shiny new pin can give you
he holds up a pair of bright red boxer shorts
jane davidson found these in her sons laundry basket
there is a louder murmur
the crowd shifts in their seats
bob points behind him to a bright green lawn chair
this is from mary petersens front porch
she found one last week
there were two more this morning
the murmur starts to grow
david and margaret stand beneath the big elm tree outside margarets house a statue of two young lovers
they wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette
the meeting across town seems a million miles away
after a moment or two david reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift
it is three feet long with a bright red bow
softly i got you something
margarets eyes widen
she beams at him then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella
a real umbrella
she looks up at him thrilled
whered you get it
it was a prop for the school play
she looks down and giggles
can i open it
margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella
she puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes like her own kind of rain dance
margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm
all at once a pair of headlights round the corner
david grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly
margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two teenage boys pull up beside them
they are clean cut with black and white faces
clipped hello whitey
they smile at each other for no good reason
its scary and arrogant
more pointed hello margaret
loud hey bud how come youre not at the town meeting right now
curt no reason
pause firing back how come youre not
were sposed to go out and let everybody know about it
he points to an armband that has some sort of chamber of commerce seal on it
whitey leans out of the car and leers
no reason hunh
see i thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend
margaret literally flinches
the boys share a peel of laughter and snort at each other
david puts an arm around her and pulls her close
why dont you guys just get the hell out of here
oh okay bud
well do that
he guns the engine as if to leave then pauses and turns toward margaret
leering more you know margaret you can come over and bake those oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to
they share another chortle as whitey guns the car and peels out with a screech
margarets lip starts to quiver and david holds her tighter
it doesnt mean anything
she nods groping for reassurance
the chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing
various citizens are now on their feet screaming from the audience
ed mcfaddens got a blue front door
its always been blue
not that blue
theres a big tree turning orange in joe bakers front yard
he still sits behind bob with the same stoic expression on his face
george fingers the little pin in his lapel
i think we all know whats going on here
bob lifts his hands in the air
the crowd quiets down a bit
obviously certain changes have been happening
up until now things in pleasantville have always been well
and recently certain things have become
now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant from the things that are un pleasant
there is a loud murmur and nod of agreement
george why dont you and burt take the lead on this
why dont you put together kind of an un pleasant activities committee
johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass
there is a knock at the door
johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it
betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a lady samsonite weekender bag
she stares up into his eyes
burt campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every morning only today there is a slight difference
he swings open the door puts out the rakes and shovels then sets a newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window as the businesses are opened on main street
more and more no coloreds signs appear in the windows next to the donuts
by fishing poles
beside the stationery supplies
everything else looks frighteningly the same
joey anderson the local paper boy is finishing his morning rounds
he reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the bakery
then he throws right toward the post office
then he turns left toward the soda shop does a double take and slams into a trash can
johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene there is a brand new painting that isnt cubist at all
a nude version of betty graces the shop window painted in curving sensual brush strokes
joey stops his bike and just stares in amazement
he gets up and rides away as fast as he possibly can
david is in a happy daze wandering up main street and doesnt even notice the crowd gathered outside mr
johnsons soda shop
after a moment or two he glances up and sees the window
his eyes go wide
the murmur of the crowd grows louder as stray derisive comments rise above the noise
david glances from the nude in window to the growing angry mob
david goes tearing through the business district looking for any sign of his mother
he glances in the flower shop
toward the green grocer
david is just about to turn on elm street when a booming voice seems to come from the sky
david stops and looks to his right
there in the window of the philco tv store are twenty screens of various sizes displaying the image of dick van dyke
i want a word with you
scared oh well
the sound reverberates like god himself
david ducks inside the store slamming the door behind him
fifty dick van dykes stare at him from every tv in the store
the effect is smothering
still pretty loud what the hell do you think youre doing
david glances around not sure where to look
terrified what do you mean
what do i mean
beat you think this is a toy
you think its your own little goddamn coloring book
look it just sort of happened
a deluge doesnt just happen
bolts of lightning dont just happen
louder you burned down an elm tree for christs sake
i had nothing to do with that
im sorry refresh my memory
what episode does the orgy happen in again
it was a gift bud
it was so special
you liked these things as much as i did remember warm smells in the family kitchen
a smile from a stranger
you know how rare that is
beat quietly only if they mean it
dick van dyke looks at him for a beat then goes red in the face
finding courage i didnt do anything wrong
let me show you something
all at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of the screen containing the image of david and margaret at lovers lane
the videotape rolls forward as she extends the bright red apple
david hesitates then takes it then puts it to his mouth and takes a bite
the image of david biting the apple plays backwards and forwards like some football instant replay
david just stares at the repeated images of dick van dyke on the tv screens
quickly wheres the remote control i gave you
because youre coming home
im gonna put this place back the way it was
no youre not
gathering strength im sorry
i cant let you do that
nuts he lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the barrier
terrified im going to leave now
youre not going anywhere
youre gonna get that remote and youre gonna come home and were gonna make everybody happy again
dick van dyke looks at him stunned as david turns and leaves the shop
dont make me get rough with you
i can get awfully fucking rough
david sprints down the tree lined street toward his house
the leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn green even this far into town
david vaults over mr
simpsons hedge and goes tearing up his front walk
the door flies open and he rushes in breathless
david glances around the house to make sure that it is empty
he crosses into the living room
david rushes to the tv and grabs the remote
he looks down at it glances at the television then bolts for the front door
david moves quickly down main street looking for a place to stash the remote
he pauses in front of the pleasantville travel agency
it has posters in the window depicting various destinations in and around pleasantville the place doesnt see much business
david bends down to stash the remote in a drain pipe near the entrance when he hears voices from up the street
david turns to see a small crowd up near the end of main street
he sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to his feet as the voices get louder
the crowd is moving toward him
a woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her taunting and harassing her
a moment later david can make out the face betty clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs
the rosy hue of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her
betty holds her head high with dignity and fear while the ugly epithets overlap one another oooh lets see the rest of you
lets see whats under that nice blue dress
bet shes even pinker than her picture
one of the boys yanks at bettys skirt and she quickens her pace
just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground
david shields his mother as he shoves one of the boys into the dirt
the kid gets up but david punches him hard in the side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare
violence is as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment
david steps in front of his mother with both fists clenched
as scared as she is come on
he plants his back foot primed for action
the crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it
they look at him warily
the boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of red blood is running down his chin
he looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away
get out of here
they back away further and david takes a threatening step
the boys turn and run as he turns back to face his mother
david moves up to her gently
are you alright
she nods still clutching her purse to her chest
david reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go wide
off her look what
betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact
she opens it and holds it up to david showing him the reflected image of his own face
at last he has turned to color
he holds the mirror staring at his own reflection
the courage which transformed him only seems to grow
they look at each other both in color now when david puts a gentle arm around her shoulder
quietly come on
he begins to lead her up toward the corner
a larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude painting of betty in the window
the jeers and cat calls are even louder
the closed sign still sits in the doorway
after a beat or two a huge brick shatters the glass
a big cheer goes up from the crowd
drunk on adrenalin the fever builds and another brick smashes the window
in an instant mr
johnsons canvas is totally destroyed
the cheering grows louder
almost by osmosis the crowd rushes the building together
the door is kicked in and they stream into the place
soon all that can be heard is the weird sound of laughter and it is an orgy of destruction
stools are hurled tables ripped out
the cash register is turned over
two boys kick in the front of the juke box
david and betty round the corner to find the soda shop being destroyed
they stand at the far side of the intersection watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok
after a moment or two there are some more hoots as margaret comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped open
oh my god
he takes her in his arms and margaret starts to sob
david strokes her hair
are you alright
are you okay
margaret catches her breath for a moment or two then glances down to her side
she is clutching the umbrella in her left hand
the thing has been ripped to shreds
the spines are broken and the fabric is torn
margaret stares at the thing with a combination of confusion and shame
david goes white with rage and looks toward the mob
taking his arm no
lets get out of here
they all ride in georges convertible up the twisting turning road
it has turned completely pink with the dogwood petals
david winds up the trail in the fading light looking for refuge
he clutches the wheel tight
we should be okay up here
the car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road
after a moment lovers lane reveals itself
it is lush and green like before only this time there is one major difference
a phalanx of black and white thugs have created a roadblock in the foreground
david jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier
it is a weird incongruous image the black and white roadblock in front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind like some perfect dream you can never
the thugs have turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs across the road
they hold axe handles in their hands
a whisper we better go
darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on
some debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of the mob still fill the air
david rolls back into town with the headlights off
where are they
im not sure
they head down main st
and turn the comer on walnut
all at once a weird orange light bathes the car
a bonfire has been lit in the middle of the street between the library and the barber shop
twenty to thirty people are gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright orange flames shoot into the air
david pulls over by the curb and their eyes go wide
from closer up it becomes clear what theyre burning
huge piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk waiting their turn on the pyre
there is a strange celebratory atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames with the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker
david sees something and bolts from the car
oh my god
jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with biff
he clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire
just let go
its better mary sue
i said no
yanking it ive read like one book in my whole life and ill be damned if i let you throw it on that fire
jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then suddenly kicks biff in the groin
he doubles over in agony when jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other direction
she sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop when a hand reaches out and grabs her
jennifer starts to scream but david puts a hand to her mouth
a whisper its okay
the crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark wreckage of the soda shop
several stools lie out in the street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered around the sidewalk
it is eerily quiet
david betty and margaret sit silently in the car across the street with the lights off
he unlatches the door handle and gets out slowly
the rest of them follow him into the empty street as they move silently toward the soda shop like some platoon on patrol
as they get closer more of the wreckage comes into view
half a booth
a soda spigot
after a moment or two jennifer looks up and gasps
several teenagers step out of the shadows
they have scraped faces and ripped clothing the signs
most are dazed and all of them are in color
after a second or two more appear mary jane
the boy who was reading huck finn
the kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer
of course he doesnt
the sounds of the mob still carry through the air from somewhere off in the distance
lets go inside
the place is just sad
all the remnants of what they had are strewn around the floor the jukebox is turned over
the stools are ripped out of the floor
betty looks over at the corner where he painted her
the easel is smashed to bits
she brings a knuckle to her lip and david puts an arm around her and draws her close
after a moment or two they hear a weird scraping sound
the scraping sound stops
they all look to the open door and after a second or two mr
johnson appears holding a broom and dustpan
just thought id try to tidy it up a bit
betty runs across and throws her arms around him
the teenagers watch as she holds him tight
once we sweep it up itll be alright again
betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair
no one says anything while they just embrace for a moment
well hes right
lets turn these booths back up
mary sue why dont you help me slide this in front of the door
well be okay in here
they respond to the tone of leadership
one by one the kids start to pitch in sifting their way through the wreckage
jennifer and david slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together
big bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house
the atmosphere is odd somewhere between a bake off and a lynching
people sit in the aisles and in the window sills
bob points his finger
this is not the answer people
the crowd quiets a bit
he leans over the lectern
no matter how upset we may get or how frustrated we may be were not gonna solve our problems out in the street
its just the wrong way to do it
we have to have a code of conduct we can all agree to live by
his tone grows softer more concerned
now i asked george and burt here to sketch out some ideas and i think theyve done a terrific job
beat scans the crowd if we all agree on these then we can take a vote and i think well start to move in the right direction
they murmur and nod
reading from the one all public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately
it is still ablaze with books
as bob continues to read in voice over a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb
the same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls several yards of it from the back of the truck
he can barely contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and extinguish the raging bonfire
two all citizens of pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and pleasant manner
the code of conduct is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in rapid succession
it is plastered on walls and in shop windows
debris is still strewn around the street
a dim light emanates from inside
it looks like a scene from the french revolution
ten to fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while david reads the code of conduct out loud by flashlight
courteous and pleasant manner
that doesnt sound too bad
david just looks at her then continues
reading from the code three the area commonly known as lovers lane as well as the pleasantville public library shall be closed until further notice
this sends a murmur amongst the kids
four the only permissible recorded music shall be the following pat boone johnny mathis perry como jack jones the marches of john phillips souza or the star spangled banner
in no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or pleasant nature
overlapping oh my gosh
david holds up his hand
five there shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind
various glances dart back and forth between them
six no bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than inches wide
pause seven the only permissible exterior paint colors shall be black white or gray despite the recent availability of certain alternatives
david looks over at mr
johnson who just winces slightly
betty clutches his hand
eight all elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the non changist view of history emphasizing continuity over alteration
david pauses wow
david lowers the paper
it is silent in the soda shop
everyone sits motionless for a moment or two letting the decree sink in
david just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness
off in the corner however one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasnt paid any attention to what was being read
all of a sudden his voice rings from the corner
this thing works
he hits a button and buddy hollys voice fills the soda shop
rave on blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time
well all the things that you say and do make me want to be with you oo oo
suddenly in a panic turn that off
the boy looks back at her
shrieking youre not allowed to do that now
he flinches and pulls the plug from the wall
the jukebox winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it
david looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear tone
sure you are
he walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in
the kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance
buddy hollys voice fills the soda shop but it has a suddenly different meaning
all the kids listen spellbound as if to an anthem while the rock and roll lives up to its rebellious reputation
the little things that you say and do make we want to be with you oo oo
its a crazy feeling
its got me reelin
jennifer looks over at her brother with pride
betty puts an arm around mr
johnson feeling a little stronger a little safer
the kids seem to relax a bit and even if they dont feel totally reassured at least they dont feel ashamed
twenty colored faces listen as buddy holly tells them rave on
david stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship
he steps out over the debris and looks both directions
david motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge
the disturbance seems to have died down and the street is silent although strewn with debris
david turns to the kids
whisper stick together till you get off main street
they nod and head off down the block
david just watches them silently from the wreckage of the soda shop
the fire department is cleaning up the charred remains of the bonfire
betty is asleep in one of the booths
jennifer sleeps beside her on the floor
david and margaret sleep next to them in another booth with margaret curled up against his chest
david opens his eyes
johnson is standing in the middle of the shop staring at the large piece of plywood where his window used to be
he just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it
theres a faraway look in his eye
he rises carefully from the booth without waking margaret
david crosses over to mr
johnson and speaks in a whisper
well get you a new one
softly i dont know what id do if i couldnt paint anymore bud
i just dont know what id do
he just nods
david glances down at the table next to him
he picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just looks at it
its orange and pink and yellow
david thinks for a second
maybe i have an idea
the same paper boy who rode into the trash can peddles down main street tossing his papers toward the curb
he throws right toward the post office then left toward the hardware store then right toward the bakery then finally looks up
this time the boy slams into a lamp post
he tumbles off his bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief
two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of paint cans
above them however is painted a vivid almost utopian mural of the town of pleasantville in living color
instead of being drab the place literally gleams with life
the post office turns out to be a rich red brick
the sky shines in vibrant blue
it is a rendering of what the town could look like
david and mr
johnson sleep soundly next to their own signatures
david opens his eyes and sees the paperboy
he turns around and rides away as fast as he can
a huge crowd has gathered
there is a loud buzz in the air
david and mr
johnson stand side by side in front of their work like theyre presenting and guarding it at the same time
most of the faces are black and white
a few near the back are in color
big bob moves through the back of the crowd hurriedly buttoning his shirt
the buzz grows and the people part as he heads toward the front of the pack
when bob emerges from the crowd mr
johnson flinches slightly
david just looks him in the eye and tries to find as much courage as he can
big bob looks up at the color rendering of his town with absolute horror
his eye scans the green trees the bright yellow gas station the puffy pink clouds on the horizon
bellowing did you do this
quietly but clearly yes i did
bob grabs a copy of the code of conduct and waves it at him
do you know that its illegal
thinks yes i do
bob looks dumbfounded
he tries to process the whole thing but just looks more confused
bob runs his hand through his hair shaking his head
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want
betty stands beside margaret and jennifer watching the spectacle
there are tears in her eyes and a great deal of love
jennifer smiles with pride at her brother
youre not allowed to do this
i could arrest you for this
still doesnt make it right
there is some clapping from the back of the crowd
bobs eyes widen
his face goes flushed darker gray
a vein bulges in his neck
he turns to the police chief
i dont know how to do that bob
what do you mean
well i never had to do it before
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station
guess i could do that then
suddenly stronger cmere dan
ill help you
david walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out
a louder murmur moves through the crowd as david actually helps him fasten on the cuffs
johnson comes over to join them and the murmur starts to grow
a bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky
a group of colored kids hangs out on main street near the police station
they gaze off into the distance at the barred window of a jail cell
it is elevated half a story above the street
everything is black and white except for the warm yellow light that glows through the bars
they know in a glance whos inside
david sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling
the place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases
he cant help smiling
johnson crouches on his bunk ignoring his food
he clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in true inmate fashion
rather than scratching the days or even the hours mr
johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall complete with lush forest and a running brook
he looks at his work and smiles
he approaches davids cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars
david turns around
theres someone to see you bud
david sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could be
after a moment or two a strange look of understanding crosses his face
he hears the sound of a key turning in the lock
david looks up at the doorway and smiles
i thought it might be you
he stands in the doorway still dressed in his tv repairmans outfit
for the first time he is completely in black and hope youre proud of yourself
i am actually
glad to see youve finally shown your true colors
dick van dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him
okay lets cut the shit and get right to it
wheres that remote control
because youre coming home
smiles why dont you just take me back without it
youre a smart little bastard arent you
tightly its kind of like a restricted ticket
you gotta leave the same way you came
david just looks at him
he smiles confidently
leans back on the bunk
i guess as long as im here all sorts of things could happen to this place
we could have pink lawns and blue trees
just gimme the damn remote
i cant do that
dick van dyke takes a deep breath
he glances toward the barred window
i dont know what went wrong
you answered every question
you knew every detail
the senior prom
mcintires department store
we had all the same warm memories sock hops
the church social
they werent my memories
beat i borrowed them
its no good when you borrow them
dick van dykes eyes go wide and he literally starts to tremble
containing his rage how long do you think youve been here
warily i dont know
three four weeks
much less than that
checks his watch an hour and a half
david looks at him uneasily
dick van dyke flashes a broad nasty smile
see and this is really great the show was on for what half an hour a week
so that means for every week that goes by in pleasantville only half an hour goes by in the real world
the smile gets bigger
dick van dyke moves closer to him
now buddy youre going on trial tomorrow
and if they find you guilty youre gonna be stuck here forever
well not forever lemme think
calculates five year sentence
carry the three
that comes out to
sixteen and a half centuries and thats rounding down
im going on trial tomorrow
this is tv pal
they dont fool around
david is rocked but tries not to show it
stoicly theres worse places
for the first hundred years
then it starts to get a little monotonous
beat sleep well
he taps on the bars for dan who opens the lock and lets him out
the door clangs shut as the two of them disappear down the hall
the minute they are gone the stoicism falls
david looks around his cell truly afraid
he stares at the tiny cot
the plain light bulb in the ceiling
the single pillow with the plastic covering it forever is starting to look like a long time
david crosses to the small window and looks out
across the town square he can see the side of the town hall complete with the newly painted mural
the utopian view of pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable exception the edges of painting are starting to turn back to it is bathed in sunlight
dozens of people stream through the front door for the first trial in pleasantvilles history
there is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air
the place has been transformed from the chamber of commerce meeting hall to a small town courtroom complete with pews and ceiling fans
the only carry over from its previous configuration is the huge chamber of commerce banner draped across the back wall
at the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is a large elevated judges bench with a rotary insignia on the front
big bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name
the whole thing is a strange combination of franz kafka and inherit the wind
big bob bangs the gavel
the undertone begins to quiet down
all of the faces in the pews are black and white
there is a colored section in the back for standing room only
george is seated in the front row of the jury despite his relationship to one of the defendants
he is dressed impeccably with his rotary pin still gleaming on his lapel
after a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of the room
she stands in the back with the rest of the colored faces
betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of david or mr
all at once a hush goes through the crowd
it swings open and david and mr
johnson are led in wearing handcuffs
dan the police chief now ballif shows them to a table in the center of the room directly facing big bob
there is no lawyer present
there is also no prosecutor
he glances around a little confused
big bob bangs the gavel
bud parker and william johnson you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of
conduct and laws of common decency
do you admit that on the night of may you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall beat red pink vermillion puce chartreuse
umber blue aqua ox blood green peach crimson yellow olive and magenta
yes i do
wheres our lawyer
we prefer to keep these proceedings as pleasant as possible
i dont think a lawyer will be necessary
there is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces
big bob smiles to himself then proceeds
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness
well it was dark out
do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to and in plain sight of minor children
it was accessible to everyone
let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges
he looks directly at them for the first time
do you have anything to say in your defense
johnson just looks at david confused and terrified
i didn t mean to hurt anybody
i just have to paint
i need to
he gropes for something else to say but what else is there
david glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat
david rises from his chair
i think ive got something to say
david looks out over the audience
after a moment or two he looks back at big bob
i think i know why youre doing this
i mean i understand why youre doing this
i used to feel the same way
i used to want this place to stay just the way it was
i never wanted it to change
there is a loud murmur
big bob bangs the gavel
he smiles slightly but nothing stays the same
you get things and you lose things and thats the good part and the bad part but you cant have a good part without a bad part
he turns and sees his mother in the balcony
they lock eyes for a moment
david smiles slightly and continues
its like the basketball team
leaning forward the basketball team
everybodys upset because theyre not winning anymore but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win
theres a murmur in the gallery
wouldnt it feel better than when they used to win all the time
there is a louder murmur
big bob looks concerned
see i know you want it to stay pleasant but there are so many things that are so much better like silly
beat and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them
pointing to the colored section look at those faces back there
theyre no different than you are
they just happened to see something inside themselves that you dont want to
okay thats enough
i thought i was allowed to defend myself
youre not allowed to lie
im not lying
here ill show you
he turns suddenly toward the jury box
what color is that hedge of yours
no not that hedge
the other one
the other one
the one in your mind
the one that you see on a bright cold morning
the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare
simpson suddenly looks far away
he gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye
what color is that hedge
a huge murmur moves through the courtroom
bob bangs the gavel
i said thats enough
let him finish
big bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when david suddenly turns toward george
there is a louder murmur
big bob just looks at him frozen while david confronts his father
george straightens up
solemn yes bud
beat dont you miss her
he looks at him stunned
big bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens
george just stares at him like he got shot
i mean of course you do but it isnt just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss its something else isnt it
the undertone in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room
softer whisper maybe you cant even describe it
maybe you only know it when its gone
maybe its like theres a whole piece of you thats missing too
shrugs you might even call it love
banging the gavel loudly okay thats it
motioning toward the back now dont you think she looks just as pretty in color
dont you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her
slowly almost imperceptibly george nods
a single tear rolls down his cheek
as it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of color behind it
dont you wish you could tell her that
he nods again and it all comes out
betty smiles at him through her tears
johnson smiles as well
pounding the gavel why am i out of order
well i dont think its a circus
and i dont think they do either
david motions behind him to the black and white section
there are now ten to fifteen colored faces
but see thats just the point
it cant stop at once
because its in you
and you cant stop something thats in you
tightly its not in me
oh sure it is
no it isnt
he crosses to the bench looking right up at big bob
he leans over the bench and gets right up in his face
smug whisper what do you want to do to me right now
big bob starts to tremble
he shakes with rage as david moves closer
everyones turning colors
kids are making out in the street
no ones getting their dinner hell you could have a flood any minute
pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked
thats not going to happen
but it could happen
no it couldnt
big bob looks at david and starts to tremble
it starts around the base of his neck spreads quickly up the rest of his head
after a moment or two big bob has gone completely a gasp goes through the courtroom
david looks at him and just smiles
the crowd reaction turns almost to a roar as big bob turns and catches his reflection in the window
he sees the ruddy image staring back at him then looks down at his hands
they have gone completely red as well
big bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room flinging open the doors to the courtroom
as big bob flees he reveals an amazing sight the town square glistens in living color
the huge lawn is a rich deep green
the sky is a dense opaque blue
dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside
all the birds are really chirping
red brick yellow cars green hats
the barber pole in front of gus has finally turned to red white and blue he cant help smiling
david walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation
the whole town is washed in joy
margaret comes up and throws her arms around him
they meet in a rich passionate kiss in direct defiance of the code of conduct
several people around them actually clap like spectators at a wedding
jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out
i am like gonna hurl
david turns and looks at her
both of them laugh
david throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight
david and jennifer stand together on the edge of town
she clutches a valise in her hand
he holds the remote control
are you sure
i told you
im like positive
this thing works
we could go home right now
im not ready yet
i gotta do this for a little while
they stand on the edge of town which finally has an edge
a large sign says springfield miles and for the first time the end of main street is no longer the beginning
jennifer is dressed in mary sues clothes with a little bit of style thrown in
rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance
you think theres like a chance im gonna get into college back there
they both smile
you got the admissions letter
and youre sure about this
ive done the slut thing david
its really kinda old
ill come back and check on you in a month
jennifer nods and gives him a hug
she holds on tight for a couple of seconds
youre like the coolest brother in the world
never been called cool before
they suddenly hear the sound of a motor and look to their left
a huge greyhound bus lumbers up the highway pulling to a halt at the sign
the doors open beckoning her in
jennifer smiles at her brother then turns toward the door
she clutches her umbrella at her side
david holds a bag of oatmeal cookies
each one clings on to the other ones clothing
their faces are inches apart
youre gonna forget about me
no i wont
she looks at him for a moment then wraps her arms around his neck
they meet in a long rich wet soft kiss
the umbrella falls to the ground
a whisper i like calling you david
i like it too
david stands in front of the television with mr
johnson at his side
he holds the remote control in his hand
johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea
well how do you know it wont go back to the way it was
youre gonna keep painting arent you
he nods again and thinks about it
they smile at each other one last time
remembering something oh
reaching into his pocket ive got something for you
he pulls out a folded piece of paper
johnson extends it to david who unfolds it and instantly smiles
it is a small painted replica of their mural in the same vibrant colors
everything is scaled perfectly exactly like the one on the wall
just a little you know
david looks up at him and smiles
all at once he glances toward the door
betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag
a sweater is draped over her arm
extending the bag i made you these for the trip
theyre marshmallow rice squares
i thought you werent gonna
painful quieter i had to say goodbye
she looks up at david and their eyes lock
betty hands him the bag
theres a meatloaf sandwich in there too
dont go skipping dinner just cause youre not here anymore
voice quivering and
wear this on the trip in case it gets cold
nodding its a pretty short trip
she nods as well
betty puts the sweater around his shoulders anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two
then she throws her arms around his neck
im so proud of you bud
i love you
i love you too
she clings on tight for a second or two then lets go
betty flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath
she steps back and looks at him
david glances down at the remote
you better stand back a little
betty and mr
johnson cross toward the comer of the room
david points the remote at the tv
all the ersatz spanish houses stretch out toward infinity
a westec security patrol cruises by them at a crawl
a second or two later all the sprinklers turn on in uniform synchronization
he stands in the middle of the living room looking at his new old surroundings
everything is the same as it was
the black onyx coffee table
the clean burbur rug
the big screen tv in its sleek black cabinet
david looks at it and smiles
the place is inadvertantly in black and white
he reaches forward and turns on the tv by hand flipping around the dial
jerry springer is berating a prostitute
tony robbins hawks self improvement in an infomercial
court tv is doing an o
david unfolds mr
johnsons sketch and glances down at it
he smiles to himself
a different kind of nostalgia
