before the fact
i didnt ask to be
then tough luck george because you are
why because you only told me about it
why are you doing this to me dave
why are you talking this way to me
i dont understand
why are you doing this at all
thats none of your fucking business
well well well talk to me we sat down to eat dinner and here im a criminal
you went for it
in the abstract
so im making it concrete
why you going to give me five grand
do you need five grand
is that what i just said
you need money
is that the
hey hey lets just keep it simple what i need is not the
what do you need
what is the five grand
pause what is the you said that we were going to split five
my end is my business
your ends twenty five
in or out
you tell me youre out you take the consequences
and why is that
because you listened
roma is seated alone at the booth
lingk is at the booth next to him
roma is talking to him
all train compartments smell vaguely of shit
it gets so you dont mind it
thats the worst thing that i can confess
you know how long it took me to get there
a long time
when you die youre going to regret the things you dont do
you think youre queer
im going to tell you something were all queer
you think that youre a thief
you get befuddled by a middle class morality
get shut of it
shut it out
you cheated on your wife
you did it live with it
pause you fuck little girls so be it
theres an absolute morality
and then what
if you think there is then be that thing
bad people go to hell
i dont think so
if you think that act that way
a hell exists on earth
i wont live in it
you ever take a dump made you feel youd just slept for twelve hours
i dont know
or a piss
a great meal fades in reflection
everything else gains
you know why
cause its only food
this shit we eat it keeps us going
but its only food
the great fucks that you may have had
what do you remember about them
what do i
i dont know
for me im saying what is is its probably not the orgasm
some broads forearms on your neck something her eyes did
there was a sound she made
or me lying in the ill tell you me lying in bed the next day she brought me cafe au lait
she gives me a cigarette my balls feel like concrete
what im saying what is our life
pause its looking forward or its looking back
and thats our life
where is the moment
pause and what is it that were afraid of
pause the bank closes
we get sick my wife died on a plane the stock market collapsed
the house burnt down
what of these happen
none on em
we worry anyway
what does this mean
im not secure
how can i be secure
pause through amassing wealth beyond all measure
and whats beyond all measure
thats a sickness
thats a trap
there is no measure
how can we act
the right way we would say to deal with this there is a one in a million chance that so and so will happen
fuck it it wont happen to me
we know thats not the right way i think
pause we say the correct way to deal with this is there is a one in so and so chance this will happen
god protect me
i am powerless let it not happen to me
but no to that
theres something else
what is it
if it happens as it may for that is not within our powers i will deal with it just as i do today with what draws my concern today
i say this is how we must act
i do those things which seem correct to me today
i trust myself
and if security concerns me i do that which today i think will make me secure
and every day i do that when that day arrives that i need a reserve a odds are that i have it and b the true reserve that i have
is the strength that i have of acting each day without fear
pause according to the dictates of my mind
pause stocks bonds objects of art real estate
now what are they
pause an opportunity
to make money
to lose money
to indulge and to learn about ourselves
so fucking what
theyre an opportunity
theyre an event
a guy comes up to you you make a call you send in a brochure it doesnt matter therere these properties id like for you to see
