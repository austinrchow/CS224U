written by aaron sorkin revised third draft july in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere
small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower cut through the ground mist
we hear all the unidentifiable sounds of night in the woods
we also hear very very faintly a slow deliberate drum cadence
and as this starts we begin to move slowly up the tower more becomes visible now
the sandbags on the ground piled ten high
the steel fire escape type stairway wrapping around the structure and leading to the lookout post and finally
the lookout post maybe forty feet off the ground
standing the post is the silhouette of a marine
hes holding a rifle and staring straight out
the drum cadence has been building slightly
a wider shot of the fenceline
and we see by the moonlight that the tall wire mesh fence winds its way far far into the distance
the drum cadence continues and we we hear two pairs of footsteps and then where we see that the footsteps belong to dawson and downey two young marines who well
get to know later
they stop when they get to a certain door
the drum cadence is still growing
dawson puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it slowly
he openss the door and they walk into willy santiago a young very slight marine lies asleep in his bunk
dawson kneels down by the bed puts his hand on santiagos shoulder and shakes him gently
santiago opens his yes looks at dawson and for a moment theres nothing wrong and then santiagos eyes fill with terror
he lunges out of the bed but forget about it
in one flash dawson and downey grab him out of bed and before the scream can come out downeys shoved a piece of cloth into santiagos mouth
everything that happens next occurs with speed precision and professionalism
a strip of duct tape is pulled ripped and slapped onto his mouth and eyes a length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet
quietly youre lucky its us willy
an arm grabs him tightly around the neck not choking him just holding his head still the drum cadence has built to a crescendo
we hear four sharp blasts from a whistle and we and the drum cadence weve been hearing has turned into semper fidelis and its coming from the u
marine corps band a sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished silver and brass
the band is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds before a crowd made up mostly of tourists and day campers
as the titles roll we watch the band do their thing from various angles
incredible precision is the name of the game
each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were all attached by a rod
each drumstick raised to the same fraction of a centimeter before striking
a rifle drill team that cant possibly be human
flags banners the works
high angle of the entire band an we end credits
its an important building a main building
a few sailors enter and exit and as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building
the woman is joanne galloway a navy lawyer in her early s
shes bright attractive impulsive and has a tendency to speak quickly
if she had any friends theyd call her jo
as she walks she mutters to herself
captain id like to request that i be the attorney assigned to rep id like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent she stops that it
be myself who is assigned to represent
good jo thats confidence inspiring
we follow jo still muttering as she walks into the brick building which bears the seal of the as jo enters
captain west and two other officers gibbs and lawrence sit around a conference table
jo come on in
thank you sir
captain west this is lt
jo you know mike lawrence
to west captain i appreciate your seeing me on such short notice
i understand there was some trouble over the weekend down in cuba
this past friday evening
two marines corporal harold dawson and private louden downey entered the barracks room of a pfc william santiago and assaulted him
santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later
the nis agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident
theyre scheduled to have a hearing down in cuba at this afternoon
whats the problem
dawson and downey are both recruiting poster marines and santiago was known to be a screw up
i was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red
jo lets this sink in a moment
under his breath christ
id like them moved up to washington and assigned counsel
someone who can really look into this
someone who possesses not only the legal skill but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military
in short captain id like to suggest that
i be the one who that it be me who is assigned to represent them
jo looks around the room for a response
joanne why dont you get yourself a cup of coffee
thank you sir im fine
joanne id like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back
jo gets up and walks out
i thought this code red shit wasnt going on anymore
with the marines at gitmo
who the hell knows what goes on down there
well lets find out before the rest of the world does this thing could get messy
what about this woman
jos been working a desk at internal affairs for what almost a year now
and before that
she disposed of three cases in two years
three cases in two years
who was she handling the rosenbergs
shes not cut out for litigation
shes a hall of an investigator jerry in internal affairs sure
she can crawl up a lawyers ass with the best of em but when it comes to trial work i know
all passion no street smarts
bring her back in
lawrence goes to the door and motions for jo to come back in
continuing commander were gonna move the defendants up here in the morning
thank you sir
and ill have division assign them counsel
from what i understand from your colleagues youre much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what im sure will boil down to a five minute plea
bargain and a weeks worth of paper work
sir dont worry about it
i promise you divisionll assign the right man for the job
his name is lieutenant junior grade daniel allistair kaffee and its almost impossible not to like him
at the moment hes hitting fungoes to about a dozen lawyers who are spread out on the softball field on a corner of the bass
the yankees theyre not but they could probably hold their own against a group of say airforce dentists
kaffees in his late s months out of harvard law school and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it
he is at this point in his life passionate about nothing
except maybe softball
calling out to the team alright lets get two
he smacks one to the second base
the ball bounces right between his legs
nothing to be sorry about sherby
just look the ball into your glove
he smacks one out to the same place
it bounces off the heel of sherbys glove and into center field
you gotta trust me sherby
you keep your eyes open your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten
spradling a young naval officer sweaty and out of breath walks up behind the backstop
lets try it again
you seem upset and distraught
we were supposed to meet in your office minutes ago to talk about the mcdermott case
youre stalling on this thing
now we got this done and i mean now or no kidding kaffee ill hang your boy from a fuckin yardarm
calling out sherby does the navy still hang people from yardarms
calling back i dont think so danny
back to spradling dave sherby doesnt think the navy hangs people from yardarms anymore
back to the field lets go lets get two
he goes back to hitting fungoes
im gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty
plead guilty and ill recommend days in the brig with loss of rank and pay
it was oregano dave it was ten dollars worth of oregano
yeah well your client thought it was marijuana
my clients a moron thats not against the law
the third baseman takes one in the face
that had to hurt
calling out way to keep your head in the play lester
walk it off
ive got people to answer to just like you im gonna charge him
with what possession of a condiment
kaffee dave ive tried to help you out of this but if you ask for tall time im gonna file a motion to dismiss
you wont got it
i will get it
and if the mtd is denied ill file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance and after that im gonna file against pre trial confinement and
youre gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a signalman second class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano
b misdemeanor days in the brig
c misdemeanor days restricted duty
i dont know why im agreeing to this
cause you have wisdom beyond your years
dave can you play third base
about navy and marine lawyers several of whom are women are taking their seats around a large conference table
a paralegal is handing out folders and some photocopied papers to the lawyers
we might notice that one of the lawyers is lieutenant junior grade sam weinberg
sams serious and studious looking
if he werent in uniform you wouldnt guess that he was a naval officer
captain whitaker walks in
school class morning captain whitaker
sam hows the baby
i think shes ready to say her first word any day now
how can you tell
she just looks like she has something to say
kaffee walks in
excuse me sorry im late
im sure you dont have a good excuse so i wont force you to come up with a bad one
thank you isaac thats nice of you
sit down this first ones for you
he hands kaffee some files
continuing youre moving up in the world danny youve been requested by division
oooh s and ahhh s from the other lawyers
subtle note kaffee doesnt want to move up in the world
requested to do what
whitaker hands him a file
guantanamo bay cuba
a marine corporal named dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline and into cuban territory
whats a fenceline
a big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys
pfc william santiago threatens to rat on dawson to the naval investigative service
dawson and another member of his squad pfc louden downey they go into santiagos room tie him up and stuff a rag down his throat
an hour later santiagos dead
attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin
they poisoned the rag
not according to them
what do they say
theyre being flown up here tomorrow and on thursday at youll catch a transport down to cuba for the day to find out what you can
meantime go across the yard and see lt
commander joanne galloway
shes the one who had em brought up here
shell fill you in on whatever she has
the flight to cuba was that in the morning sir
it seems important to division that this one be handled by the book so im assigning co counsel
i have a stack of paper on my desk work with kaffee on this
kaffeell finish this up in four days
in other words i have no responsibilities whatsoever
my kinda case
jo sits behind her desk
kaffee and sam stand in the doorway
kaffee knocks politely
jo looks up
beat im daniel kaffee
i was told to meet with checks notes commander galloway
jo is staring at him
kaffee doesnt know why
continuing about a briefing
jo is finding this hard to believe
youre the attorney that division assigned
im lead counsel
this is sam weinberg
i have no responsibilities here whatsoever
jos deeply puzzled
beat come in please have a seat
kaffee and sam come into the office and sit
continuing lieutenant how long have you been in the navy
going on nine months now
and how long have you been out of law school
a little over a year
beat i see
have i done something wrong
its just that when i petitioned division to have counsel assigned i was hoping id be taken seriously
kaffee and sam exchange a look
to jo no offense taken if you were wondering
kaffees generally considered the best litigator in our office
hes successfully plea bargained cases in nine months
one more and i got a set of steak knives
have you ever been in a courtroom
i once had my drivers license suspended
danny commander from what i understand if this thing goes to court they wont need a lawyer theyll need a priest
theyll need a lawyer
during this shell hand kaffee a series of files which kaffee will pass to sam without even glancing at them
continuing dawsons family has been contacted
downeys closest living relative is ginny miller his aunt on his mothers side she hasnt been contacted yet
none of this really means anything to kaffee
continuing would you like me to take care of that
sure if you feel like it
jo takes another beat to size this guy up
one of the people youll be speaking to down there is the barracks c
colonel nathan jessep i assume youve heard of him
beat who hasnt
to kaffee hes been in the papers lately
hes expected to be appointed director of operations for the national security counsel
passing kaffee another file these are letters that santiago wrote in his months at gitmo whispering to kaffee guantanamo bay
i know that one
he wrote to his recruiter the fleet commander hq atlantic even his senator
he wanted a transfer
nobody was listening
you with me
this last letter to the naval investigative service she hands it to kaffee who hands it to sam continuing where he offers information about corporal dawsons fenceline shooting in exchange
for a transfer was just a last ditch effort
is that all
beat lieutenant this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill santiago
beat and santiago is
beat the victim
to sam write that down
to jo am i correct in assuming that these letters dont paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in guantanamo bay
yes among other and am i further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy
colonel jessep yes but twelve years
i can get it knocked down to involuntary manslaughter
you havent talked to a witness you havent looked at a piece of paper
pretty impressive huh
youre gonna have to go deeper than just commander do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that i should know about
my job is to make sure you do your job
im special counsel for internal affairs so my jurisdictions pretty much in your face
read the letters
youre not under any obligation but id appreciate a report when you get back from cuba
kaffee gets up without waiting for jo to say youre dismissed
sorry i always forget that
sams standing in the doorway
hes a little preoccupied
beat the teams playing bethesda medical next week
tell your friend not to get cute down there
the marines in guantanimo are fanatical
and in voice over we hear dear sir about being marines
and while we hear the letter read in v
what were seeing is this santiagos life in guantanimo bay over the last months
he had a rough time of it
santiago running along at the rear of a group of marines
its been over seven miles and hes matted with sweat
a sergeant runs up along side grabs his back and pushes him to keep up with the group
santiago falls struggles to get back up and keep running and santiago doing push ups alone in the rain
hes being supervised by a sergeant who sees to it that his face hits the mud every time down and santiago sitting alone in the mess hall not a friend
within four seats of him and santiago being chewed out by a lieutenant in front of his squad and santiago running with the squad of marines again this time down a rocky hill
its hot as hell and it looks like hes gonna pass out
he stumbles and the sergeant picks him up and pushes him down the hill
he rolls about feet before he stops
over this we hear
my name is pfc william t
i am a marine stationed at marine barracks rifle security company windward second platoon delta
i am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in cuba and to ask for your help
ive fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated but on may th id fallen back about or yards going down a rocky unstable
my sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill
then i saw all black and the last thing i remember is hitting the deck
i was brought to the hospital where i was told i just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot
sun and i hyperventilate
i ask you to help me
i just need to be transferred out of rsc
pfc william t
at this point with santiagos letter still in v
we its the last paragraph of the letter weve been hearing and at the moment we cant see the hands that are holding it
in exchange for my transfer off the base im willing to provide you with information about an illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of august nd
and as these last words are spoken we pull back to reveal colonel nathan r
jessep who drops the letter hes been reading on his desk where it joins a stack of other letters just like it
jesseps a born leader considered in many circles to be one of the real fair haired boys of the corps
hes smart as a whip with a sense of humor to match
as soon as he drops the letter he says who the fuck is pfc william t
hes talking to his two senior officers
captain markinson is in his late s
hes a career marine and a nice guy in a world where nice guys may not finish last but they sure as shit dont finish first
jonathan james kendrick is from georgia and an academy graduate
if you asked him hed tell you that the gates to heaven are guarded by the u
sir santiago is a member of second platoon delta
yeah well apparently hes not very happy down here at shangri la cause hes written letters to everyone but santa claus asking for a transfer
and now hes telling tales about a fenceline shooting
he tosses the letter over to markinson
markinson is looking it over
jessep is waiting for a response
im appalled sir
this kid broke the chain of command and he ratted on a man of his unit to say nothing of the fact that hes a u
marine and it would appear that he cant run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion
what the fucks going on over at windward matthew
colonel i think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private
that wont be necessary colonel ill handle the situation
the same way you handled the curtis barnes incident
youre doing something wrong lieutenant this my methods of leadership are dont interrupt me im still your superior officer
and im yours matthew
the room calms down for a moment
continuing i want to know what were gonna do about this
i think santiago should be transferred off the base
hes that bad huh
not only that but word of this letters bound to get out
the kids gonna get his ass kicked
yes i suppose youre right
i suppose thats the thing to do
ive got a better idea
lets transfer the whole squad off the base
lets on second thought windward
the whole windward division lets transfer em off the base
jon go on out there and get those boys down off the fence theyre packing their bags
calling out tom
the orderly cones in from the outer office
got me the president on the phone were surrendering our position in cuba
wait a minute tom
the orderly stops
continuing dont call the president just yet
maybe we should consider this for a second
maybe and im just spit balling here but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train santiago
maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals
im certain i once read that somewhere
and now im thinking that your suggestion of transferring santiago while expeditious and certainly painless might not be in a manner of speaking the american way
santiago stays where he is
were gonna train the lad
youre in charge jon
santiago doesnt make
on his next fitness report im gonna blame you
then im gonna kill you
i think thats a mistake colonel
matthew i believe i will have that word in private with you now
jon thats all
why dont you and i have lunch at the o club well talk about the training of young william
yes sir id be delighted to hear any suggestions you have
kendrick is gone
continuing matthew sit please
continuing what do you think of kendrick
beat i dont know that i think hes kind of a weasel myself
but hes an awfully good officer and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit
were in the business of saving lives matthew
thats a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously
and i believe that taking a marine whos not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment puts lives in danger
markinson starts to stand continuing matthew siddown
beat we go back a while
we went to the academy together we were commissioned together we did our tours in vietnam together
but ive been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have
now if thats a source of tension or embarrassment for you well i dont give a shit
were in the business of saving lives captain markinson
dont ever question my orders in front of another officer
jessep grabs his hat and walks out leaving markinson sitting all alone and we its maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday
is waving a procession of three military police sedans and a fourth unmarked car through the gate
the cars drive through and we another red brick building
a few m
is stand out front as the cars pull up
as soon as they come to a stop all the doors swing open and various uniformed and non uniformed officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they
escort dawson and downey in handcuffs out of the car
harold dawsons a handsome young black corporal
intense controlled and utterly professional
louden downeys a year old kid off an iowa farm
hes happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do
dawsons his hero
the two prisoners stand still for a moment
they might as well be in oz
dawson doesnt say anything
continuing is this washington d
alright lets move
and kaffees at it again
alright lets get tough out there
jo walks up from behind the backstop
you want to suit up
we need all the help we can get
no thank you i cant throw and catch things
thats okay neither can they
i wanted to talk to you about corporal dawson and private downey
dawson and downey
beat those names sound like they should mean something to me but im just not dawson
the cuba thing
dawson and downey
pause ive done something wrong again havent i
i was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball
we need the practice
that wasnt funny
it was a little funny
lieutenant would you feel very insulted if i recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel
i dont think youre fit to handle this defense
you dont even know me
ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover im not fit to handle a defense
jo just stares
continuing oh come on that was damn funny
jo moves close to kaffee to say this with a degree of confidentiality
i do know you
daniel allistair kaffee born june th at boston mercy hospital
your fathers lionel kaffee former navy judge advocate and attorney general of the united states died
you went to harvard law on a navy scholarship probably because thats what your father wanted you to do and now youre just treading water for the three years youve
gotta serve in the jag corps just kinda layin low til you can get out and get a real job
and if thats the situation thats fine i wont tell anyone
but my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast food slick ass persian bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else somethings gonna
and i wouldnt be doing my job if i allowed dawson and downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary because their attorney had pre determined the
path of least resistance
kaffee cant help but be impressed by that speech
beat im sexually aroused commander
i dont think your clients murdered anybody
what are you basing this on
there was no intent
the doctors report says that santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning
beat now i dont know what any of that means but it sounds pretty bad
santiago died at one a
at three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death but two hours later he said it was poison
oh now i see what youre saying
it had to be professor plum in the library with the candlestick
im gonna speak to your supervisor
you go straight up pennsylvania avenue
its a big white house with pillars in front
i dont think youll have much luck though
i was assigned by division remember
somebody over there thinks im a good lawyer
so while i appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm i think i can pretty much handle things myself
do you know what a code red is
kaffee doesnt but he doesnt say anything
continuing what a pity
and an m
is leading kaffee and sam down to dawson and downeys cell
officer on deck ten hut
dawson and downey come to attention
through the following the m
will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in
sir lance corporal harold w
rifle security company windward second platoon delta
someone hasnt been working and playing well with others harold
sir yes sir
sir pfc louden downey
im daniel kaffee this is sam weinerg you can sitdown
dawson and downey arent too comfortable sitting in the presence of officers but they do as theyre told
kaffees pulled out some documents sams sitting on one of the cots taking notes
continuing to dawson is this your signature
you dont have to call me sir
to downey is this your signature
sir yes sir
and you certainly dont have to do it twice in one sentence
harold whats a code red
sir a code red is a disciplinary engagement
what does that mean exactly
sir a marine falls out of line its up to the men in his unit to get him back on track
whats a garden variety code red
harold you say sir and i turn around and look for my father
danny daniel kaffee
garden variety typical
whats a basic code red
sir a marine has refused to bathe on a regular basis
the men in his squad would give him a g
scrub brushes brillo pads steel wool
was the attack on santiago a code red
to downey do you ever talk
sir private downey will answer any direct questions you ask him
private downey the rag you stuffed in santiagos mouth was there poison on it
silver polish turpentine anti freeze
we were gonna shave his head sir
when all of a sudden
we saw blood drippinq out of his mouth
then we pulled the tape off and there was blood all down his face sir
thats when corporal dawson called the ambulance
kaffee tries not to make too big a deal out of this last piece of news
to dawson did anyone see you call the ambulance
were you there when the ambulance got there
yes sir thats when we were taken under arrest
kaffee kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for a moment
to dawson on the night of august nd did you fire a shot across the fenceline into cuba
my mirror engaged sir
to sam his mirror engaged
for each american sentry post theres a cuban counterpart
theyre called mirrors
the corporals claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him
santiagos letter to the nis said you fired illegally
hes saying that the guy the mirror he never made a move
dawson says nothing
continuing oh harold
sam is staring at dawson
continuing you see what im getting at
if santiago didnt have anything on you then why did you give him a code red
because he broke the chain of command sir
he went outside his unit sir
if he had a problem he shouldve spoken to me sir
then his sergeant then company commander then yeah yeah alright
harold did you assault santiago with the intent of killing him
what was your intent
to train him sir
train him to do what
train him to think of his unit before himself
to respect the code
whats the code
unit corps god country
i beg your pardon
unit corps god country sir
the goverrment of the united states wants to charge you two with murder
you want me to go to the prosecutor with unit corps god country
dawson stares at kaffee
thats our code sir
kaffee takes a long moment
he picks up his briefcase and he and sam move to the door
well be back
you guys need anything
books paper cigarettes a ham sandwich
no thank you
kaffee smiles at dawson
harold i think theres a concept you better start warming up to
im the only friend youve got
and as kaffee and sam walk out the open cell door dawson and downey come to attention and snap a salute
they hold the salute until kaffee and sam are well out of sight and we hes packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the work day
jack ross a marine lawyer maybe two years older than kaffee opens the door and walks in
sailin jack ross
welcome to the big time
you think so
i hope for dawson and downeys sake you practice law better than you play softball
unfortunately for dawson and downey i dont do anything better than i play softball
what are we lookin at
they plead guilty to manslaughter ill drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming
years theyll be home in half that time
i want twelve
cant do it
they called the ambulance jack
i dont care if they called the avon lady they killed a marine
the rag was tested for poison
the autopsy lab report even the initial e
they all say the same thing maybe maybe not
the chief of internal medicine at the guantanamo bay naval hospital says hes sure
what do you know about code reds
ross smiles and shakes his head
he closes the office door
continuing are we off the record
you tell me
pause im gonna give you the twelve years but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow you should know this the platoon commander lt
jonathan kendrick had a meeting with the men
and he specifically told them not to touch santiago
kaffee holds for a moment
dawson and downey neglected to mention this
he packs up his briefcase and cleats
ill talk to you when i get back
hey we got a little four on four going tomorrow night
when does your plane get in
its dusk and people on the base are going home from work
we can see the flag being lowered in the background
kaffees walking toward his car
jo intercepts him and starts walking along with him
any luck getting me replaced
is there anyone in this command that you dont either drink or play softball with
commander listen i came to make peace
we started off on the wrong foot
what do you say
look i dont by the way i brought downey some comic books he was asking for
the kid kaffee i swear he doesnt know where he is he doesnt even know why hes been arrested
commander you can call me joanne
joanne or jo

jo steps aside and lets kaffee got into his car
im going to cuba with you tomorrow
and the hits just keep on comin
hold on kaffee and jo
hes driving down a washington street and pulls over at a sidewalk newsstand
he gets out of his car leaving the lights flashing and runs up to the newsstand
as he plunks his cents down and picks up a newspaper he engages in his daily ritual with luther the newsstand operator
hows it goin luther

you gotta play em as they lay luther
what comes around goes around you know what im sayin

and we a baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal sam is standing over the crib
kaffees sitting on a beer
when nancy gets back youre my witness
the baby spoke
my daughter said a word
your daughter made a sound sam im not sure it was a word
oh come on it was a word
you heard her
the girl sat here pointed and said pa
she said pa
she was pointing at a doorknob
pointing as if to say pa look a doorknob
sam joins kaffee in the living room
jack ross came to see me today
he offered me twelve years
thats what you wanted
i know and ill
i guess i mean beat ill take it
it took albout seconds
he barely put up a fight
beat danny take the twelve years its a gift
kaffee finishes off his beer and stands
you dont believe their story do you
you think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives
i believe every word they said
and i think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives
kaffee nods and puts down the empty beer bottle
ill see you tomorrow
sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the stoop for a moment
remember to wear your whites its hot down there
i dont like the whites
nobody likes the whites but were going to cuba in august
you got dramamine
dramamine keeps you cool
dramamine keeps you from throwing up you get sick when you fly
i get sick when i fly because im afraid of crashing into a large mountain i dont think dramaminell help
ive got some oregano i hear that works pretty good
kaffee starts toward his car then turns around
continuing you know ross said the strangest thing to me right before i left
he said the platoon commander lieutenant jonathan kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch santiago
i never mentioned kendrick
i dont even know who he is
beat what the hell
beat ill see you tomorrow
we hold for a moment on kaffee as he walks to his car then the whole place in stark contrast to the washington navy yard is ready to go to
fighter jets line the tarmac
ground crews re fuel planes
a seat airforce jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a stair unit is brought up
howard a marine corporal is waiting by the stairway as the passengers begin to got off
mostly marines a few sailors a couple of civilians and kaffee jo and sam
kaffee and sam are wearing their summer whites jo is in khakis
kaffee and sam stare out at what they see theyre not in kansas anymore
howard shouts over the noise from the planes
lieutenants kaffee and weinberg

the cubans see an officer wearing white they think its someone they might wanna take a shot at
kaffee turns and glares at sam

tearing along down the road and now we see a beautiful expanse of water maybe yards across
its a section of guantanamo bay
shouting well just hop on the ferry and be over there in no time
we gotta take a boat

pleased to meet you commander
he has no responsibility here whatsoever
ive asked captain markinson and lt
kendrick to join us
kaffee i had the pleasure of seeing your father once
i was a teenager and he spoke at my high school
kaffee smiles and nods
well what do you know
son this mans dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods
madison county school district
the folks down there said a little black girl couldnt go to an all white school lionel kaffee said well just see about that
how the hell is your dad
he passed away seven years ago colonel
dont i feel like the fuckin asshole
not at all sir
well what can we do for you danny
not much at all sir im afraid
this is really a formality more than anything else
the jag corps insists that i interview all the relevant witnesses
the jag corps can be demanding that way
jonanthanll take you out and show you what you wanna see then we can all hook up for lunch how does that sound
a squad of marines jogs by as a jeep carrying kendrick and the three lawyers cruises down the road
we follow the jeep
i understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon
whatd you guys talk about
i told the men that there was an informer among us
and that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution private santiago was not to be harmed in any way
what time was that meeting
kaffee turns around and looks at sam
leaning forward four oclock
kendrick leads the lawyers down the corridor to santiagos room
two strips of tape which warn do not enter at order of the military police are crisscrossed over the closed door
they open the door and step under the tape and walk into the room is exactly an it was left that night
the un made bed the chair knocked over
the lawyers look around for a moment
the room is sparse
kaffee goes to the closet and opens it a row of uniforms hanging neatly
he thumbs through then for a second but theres nothing there
he opens the footlocker socks underwear
all folded to marine corp precision
a shaving kit a couple of photographs a pad of writing paper and some envelopes
kaffee closes the footlocker
sam somebody should see about getting this stuff to his parents
we dont need it anymore
actually the uniforms belong to the marine corps
the lawyers take a moment
kendrick can i call you jon
no you may not
beat have i done something to offend you
no i like all you navy boys
every time weve gotta go someplace and fight you fellas always give us a ride
kendrick do you think santiago was murdered
commander i believe in god and in his son jesus christ and because i do i can say this private santiago is dead and thats a tragedy
but hes dead because he had no code
hes dead because he had no honor
and god was watching
sam turns to kaffee
how do you feel about that theory
beat sounds good
lets move on
sam and kendrick walk out the door
jo stops kaffee
you planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour
beat im pacing myself
jessep markinson kendrick and the lawyers are seated at a table in the corner
stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee
jessep is finishing a story
and they spent the next three hours running around looking for americans to surrender to
kendrick joins him
sam and kaffee force a laugh
markinson forces a smile
jo remains silent
continuing to the that was delicious men thank you
our pleasure sir
colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about august th
on the morning of the sixth you were contacted by an nis angent who said that santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting
santiago was gonna reveal the persons name in exchange for a transfer
an i getting this right
if you feel there are any details that im missing you should free to speak up
jesseps not quite sure what to say to this navy lawyer lieutenant smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak freely on his own base
now it was at this point that you called captain markinson and lt
kendrick into your office
and what happened then
we agreed that for his own safety santiago should be transferred off the base
heres something else kaffee didnt know
neither did jo
sam jots something down on a small notepad
markinson doesnt flinch
santiago was set to be transferred
on the first available flight to the states
six the next morning
three hours too late as it turned out
theres silence for a moment
kaffee takes a sip of his coffee
then drains the cup and puts it down
continuing alright thats all i have
thanks very much for your time
the corporals got the jeep outside hell take you back to the airstrip
standing thank you
wait a minute ive got some questions
no you dont
yes i do
no you dont
colonel on the morning that santiago died did you meet with doctor stone between three and five
jo of course i met with the doctor
one of my men was dead
to jo see
the man was dead
to jessep i was wondering if youve ever heard the term code red
jo ive heard the term yes
colonel this past february you received a cautionary memo from the naval investigative service warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasnt to be condoned by officers
i submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a soviet made cuban ml al assault rifle
however the directive having come from the nis i gave it its due attention
whats your point jo
she has no point
she often has no point
its part of her charm
were outta here
my point is that i think code reds still go on down here
do code reds still happen on this base colonel
jo the colonel doesnt need to answer that
yes he does
no he really doesnt
yeah he really does
you know it just hit me
she outranks you danny
i want to tell you something danny and listen up cause i mean this youre the luckiest man in the world
there is believe me gentlemen nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning
promote em all i say
jos not upset
jos not mad
but shes gonna ask her question til she gets an answer
colonel the practice of code reds is still condoned by officers on this base isnt it
you see my problem is of course that im a colonel
ill just have to keep taking cold showers til they elect some gal president
i need an answer to my question sir
take caution in your tone commander
im a fair guy but this fuckin heats making me absolutely crazy
you want to know about code reds
on the record i tell you that i discourage the practice in accordance with the nis directive
off the record i tell you that its an invaluable part of close infantry training and if it happens to go on without my knowledge so be it
i run my base how i run my base
you want to investigate me roll the dice and take your chances
i eat breakfast yards away from cubans who are trained to kill me
so dont for one second think youre gonna come down here flash a badge and make me nervous
a moment of tense silence before lets go
colonel ill just need a copy of santiagos transfer order
santiagos transfer order
you guys have paper work on that kind of thing i just need it for the file
for the file
pause of course you can have a copy of the transfer order
for the file
im here to help anyway i can
you believe that dont you
that im here to help anyway i can
the corporalll run you by ordinance on your way out to the airstrip
you can have all the transfer orders you want
to jo and sam lets go
the lawyers start to leave
but you have to ask me nicely
sam and jo stop and turn
i beg your pardon
you have to ask me nicely
you see danny i can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood
i can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear
i dont want money and i dont want medals
what i want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform and with your harvard mouth extend me some fuckin courtesy
you gotta ask me nicely
kaffee and jessep are frozen
everyonestaring at kaffee the officers at their tables
kaffee makes his decision
if its not too much trouble id like a copy of the transfer order
hold for a moment
jos very disappointed
jessep stands there and watches the lawyers as they turn and leave the officers club
continuing i hate casualties matthew
there are casualties even in victory
a marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon that marines a hero
the foundation of the unit the fabric of this base the spirit of the corps they are things worth fighting for
markinson looks at the ground
continuing dawson and downey they dont know it but theyre smothering a grenade
markinson looks up as we as a plane touches down on the runway
its dusk in washington and a little one bedroom
just the essential furniture barely even that
kaffees sitting and watching a baseball came on t
hes holding a copy of the baseball encyclopedia normally his favorite reading material but right now hes having trouble keeping his mind in it
hes holding a baseball bat and fiddling with it
the remnants of a pizza and yoo hoo dinner sit next to him
his white uniform in a pile in the corner
theres a buzz at the door
kaffees not expecting anyone
he goes to the door
who is it
kaffee opens the door and jo walks in
ive really missed you jo
i was just saying to myself its been almost three hours since i last saw markinson resigned his commission
sometime after we left
ill talk to him in the morning
i already tried i cant find him
joanne youre coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation
jo hands kaffee the file shes been holding
im louden downeys attorney
he opens the file and begins to read
continuing aunt ginny
she said she feels like shes known me for years
i suggested that she might feel more comfortable if i were directly involved with the case
she had louden sign the papers about an hour ago
kaffee looks up
still too stunned to say anything
i suppose its way too much to hope that youre just making this up to bother me
dont worry im not gonna make a motion for separation youre still lead counsel
kaffee hands her back the file
i think kendrick ordered the code red
beat so do you
dawson and downey come to attention as kaffee and jo are led in
officer on deck ten hut
kaffee starts in immediately
did kendrick order the code red
dont say sir like i just asked you if you cleaned the latrine
you heard what i said
kendrick order you guys to give santiago a code red
to downey did he
you mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before
you didnt ask us sir
cutie pie shits not gonna win you a place in my heart corporal i get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail
i know you do sir
fuck you harold
theres some understandable tension in the room broken by alright
lets sort this out
there was a platoon meeting on august th at four in the afternoon
kendrick he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to santiago
now is that true
i want you to speak freely
maam thats correct
but then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms
and what happened then
kendrick came to our room maam
about five minutes after the meeting broke sir
continuing and what happened then
kendrick ordered us to give santiago a code red
ross is playing a game of full court basketball with some other officers
a door at the far end of the court opens and kaffee and jo walk in
they head down the sideline toward ross
kaffee shouts jack
but ross is into the game
waving him off hang on
they were given an order
ross stops cold and looks over at kaffee
the game flies by him
he motions to the locker room door in the corner of the gym and the three of them make their way to privacy
how long have you known about the order
i didnt to kaffee who is this
this is jo galloway shes downeys lawyer
shes very pleased to meet you
what exactly are you accusing me of commander
im accusing you of theyre in the and kaffee slams the door shut behind them
jack didnt know about the order
because if he did and he hadnt told us jack knows hed be violating about articles of the code of ethics
as it is hes got enough to worry about
god forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order
kendrick specifically told the men not to touch santiago
and then he went into dawson and downeys room and specifically told them to give him a code red
thats not what kendrick said
you have proof
i have the defendants
and i have marines who arent accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation
why did markinson resign his commission
well never know
you dont think i can subpoena markinson
you can try but you wont find him
you know what markinson did for the first of his years in the corps
there is no markinson
some of the wind has been taken out of kaffees sails
continuing jesseps star is on the rise
divisionll give me a lot of room to spare jessep and the corps any embarrassment
how much room
ill knock it all down to assault
theyre home in six months
no deal were going to a jury
jo no youre not
cause youll lose and danny knows it
and he knows that if we go to court ill have to go all the way theyll be charged with the whole truckload
murder conspiracy conduct unbecoming and even though hes got me by the balls out here dan knows that in a courtroom he loses this case
dannys an awfully talented lawyer and hes not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months
this is now clear ross is as good as kaffee
continuing thats the end of this negotiation
from this moment were on the record
ill see tomorrow morning at the arraignment
ross turns and heads back to the gym as we kaffee and jo are sitting at a table
dawson and downey are at parade rest
kaffee lights a cigarette
heres the story the goverments offering assault and conduct unbecoming
youll be home in six months
dawson and downey say nothing
continuing wow kaffee youre the greatest lawyer in the world
how can we ever thank you
fellas you hear what i just said youre going home in six months
im afraid we cant do that sir
make a deal sir
what are you talking about
we did nothing wrong sir
we did our job
if that has consequences then i accept them
buti wont say im guilty sir
kaffee cant believe this
he looks over at jo
did you to dawson and downey did she put you up to this
we have a code sir
well zippity doo dah
you and your code plead not guilty and youll be in jail for the rest of your life
do what im telling you and youll be home in six months
dawson just stares at him
continuing do it harold
its a hockey season
permission to speak
what do we do then sir
after six months
wed be dishonorably discharged right sir
what do we do then sir
we joined the corps cause we wanted to live our lives by a certain code
and we found it in the corps
and now youre asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor
youre asking us to say were not marines
if a judge and jury decide that what we did was wrong ill accept whatever punishment they give
but i believe i was riqht sir
i believe i did my job
and i wont dishonor myself my unit or the corps so that i can qo home in six months
hold on the four of them for a moment then commander i want to talk to corporal dawson alone for a minute
jo waits just a moment before she calls out to downey lets go in another room
louden everythings gonna be alright
has shown up and unlocked the cell door
continuing to m
were gonna go into a holding room
aye aye maam
jo downey and the m
kaffee paces a moment before he says you dont like me that much do you
beat forget it dont answer that it doesnt matter
kaffee paces another moment then sits on the cot
hes trying to choose his tack carefully
continuing you know downey worships you
hes gonna do whatever you do
are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code
do you think we were right
it doesnt matter what i do you think we were right
kaffee gets up
beat i think youd lose
beat youre such a coward i cant believe they let you wear a uniform
kaffee stares at dawson
im not gonna feel responsible for this harold
i did everything i could
youre going to levenworth for the better part of your life and you know what
i dont give a shit
kaffee calls out continuing kaffee and dawson are staring each other down
shows up and unlocks the cell door
kaffee steps out to leave
continuing what happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room
dawson holds on kaffee
then dawson a man who would rather die than breach military protocol takes his hands and puts them in his pockets
the cell door closes and we one light is on at the end of the hall
sam has joined kaffee and jo
the mood is somber
dawsons gonna go to jail just to spite me
if he wants to jump off a cliff thats his business
im not gonna hold his hand on the way down
to sam i want to get him a new lawyer
how do i do it
you just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment
the judgell ask you if you want to enter a plea
you tell him you want new counsel assigned
beat then thats that
one thing though
when you ask the judge for new counsel danny be sure and ask nicely
what do you want from me
i want you to let em be judged
i want you to stand up and make an argument
an argument that didnt work for calley at my lai an argument that didnt work for the nazis at nuremberg
for christ sake sam do you really think thats the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm
these guys arent the nazis
theres a pause in the room
dont look now danny but youre making an argument
beat tomorrow morning ill get them a new attorney
why are you so afraid to be a lawyer
were daddys expectations really that high
please spare me the psycho babble father bullshit
dawson and downeyll have their day in court but theyll have it with another lawyer
another lawyer wont be good enough
they need you
you know how to win
beat you know they have a case
and you know how to win
you walk away from this now and you have sealed their fate
their fate was sealed the moment santiago died
do you believe they have a defense
you and dawson both live in the same dreamland
it doesnt matter what i believe it only matters what i can prove
so please dont tell me what i know and dont know
i know the law
jo looks at him shakes her head and turns to walk away
she turns back
you know nothing about the law
youre a used car salesman daniel
youre an ambulance chaser with a rank
beat live with that
jo walks off leaving kaffee alone
we hold on kaffee
hes not having a good night
kaffee sits at the bar
the place is crowded with yuppies and students
kaffees been drinking there a while now
next to him is a yuppie lawyer regaling his friends with the story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high stakes corporate law
we hold on a kaffee a moment longer then so i told duncan if we leverage the acquisition of biotech the interrogatories would be there on demand
all i have to do is not pick up the phone and itll run flaherty ten thousand a day in court costs
kaffee sits on a bench in the night
he takes a sip from a bottle hes holding in a brown paper bag
a bright sunny morning
the band is performing for a group of day campers
dawson and downey are at the defense table ross is his place
kaffee walks in and joins jo and sam at their table
papers are being passed back and forth between ross and the sergeant at ams
the door in the back of the courtroom opens and randolph a marine colonel enters and takes his place at the bench
we can hear the band in the background
everyone present in the courtroom stands
where are we
united states versus lance corporal harold w
dawson and private first class loudon downey
defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit murder murder in the first degree and conduct unbecoming a united states marine
does defense wish to enter a plea
pause theyre not guilty
jo sam ross randolph
its hard to say whos the most surprised
it takes everything jos got to suppress a smile
the silence is broken by ross who takes the two files drops them into his briefcase closes the lid and snaps it shut
randolph looks at kaffee and ross then turns to the sergeant enter a plea of not guilty for the defendants
well adjourn until ten hundred three weeks from today at which time this court will reconvene as a general court martial
he raps the gavel
randolph walks out
ross walks up the aisle without a word to anyone
s come to escort dawson and downey back to their cell
kaffee and jo and sam are the only ones remaining
sam is looking at kaffee with question marks in his eyes
why does a junior grade with six months experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case
beat would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom
kaffee picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the door
continuing well work out of my apartment
every night seven oclock
jo before you come over tonight pick up a carton of legal pads a half dozen boxes of red pens a half dozen boxes of black pens
sam get a couple of desk lamps
i need you to start on a preliminary medical profile and jo we need all the fitness reports on dawson downey and santiago
the only thing i have to eat is yoo hoo and sugarsnacks so if you want anything else bring it with you
jos still stunned
kaffees at the door stops turns around and takes it all in for a moment
so this is what a courtroom looks like
he walks out the door and we among the stuff is a blackboard thats been hung on the wall
written across the top are three headings sam is on the floor sorting papers into piles
kaffee comes in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of yoo hoo and joins sam on the floor
were you able to speak to your friend at nis
she said if markinson doesnt want to be found were not gonna find him
she said i could be markinson and you wouldnt know it
are you markinson
well im not markinson thats two down
sam doesnt laugh
pause i was wondering now that joannes working on this
i was wondering if you still need me
pause they were following an order sam
an illegal order
you think dawson and downey know it was an illegal order
it doesnt matter if they know any decent human being wouldve refused to theyre not permitted to question orders
then whats the secret
what are the magic words
i give orders every day and nobody follows them
we have softball games and marching bands
they work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot
sam looks away
he doesnt buy it
continuing pause i need you
youre better at research than i am and you know how to prepare a witness
jo lets herself in
shes carrying a huge stack of papers under one arm and a large brown paper bag under the other
but we stay with kaffee and sam a moment longer
ive got medical reports and chinese food
i say we eat first
kaffees still looking at sam
sam nods his head
did you get any dumplings
the remnants of the chinese food is spread around
sam and jo are sitting and taking notes from kaffee
as he speaks hell pace slowly around carrying his baseball bat
he refers to the blackboard
this is our defense
intent no one can prove there was poison on the raq
code red theyre common and accepted in guantanamo bay
the order he writes a kendrick gave it
b they had no choice but to follow it
beat thats it
what about motive
were a little weak on motive
they had one
just because a person has a motive doesnt mean relax
well deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up
for now we start here pointing to intent i dont know what made santiago die i dont want to know
i just want to be able to show it couldve been something other than poison
jo talk to doctors
find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis
lets start prepping for stone
as long as were on the subject of the doctor here we go
listen to me three oclock he doesnt know what killed santiago then he meets with jessep and at five oclock he says it was poison
the doctors covering up the truth
oh thats a relief
i was afraid i wouldnt be able to use the liar liar pants on fire defense
we cant prove coercion
alright fitness reports and biographical information
kaffee looks at the cartons and the mind numbing amount of paper
no cliff notes on these things
the scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up to the trial and are interspersed with shots of kaffees apartment getting messier kaffee jo and sam flipping through documents
and reference books writing on the blackboard dozzing off
we start with jos on the phone kaffee and sam are going over testimony with sam sitting in a mock witness chair
during this kaffee will go to the door pay the pizza man for the pizza and return without missing a single beat
into phone captain hill this is lt
commander galloway im an internal affairs officer with the jag corps in washington d
im trying to track down a captain matthew andrew markinson usmc
doctor other than the rope marks was there any other sign of external damage
into phone he resigned his commission a week ago thursday
into phone no please dont put me on hold doctor was there any sign of violence
beat you mean other than the dead body
i walk into that every goddam time
dont ask the last question
mos jo pulls two thick volumes off a shelf and takes them to the table where sam and kaffee are working
she plops the books down where they join a pile of about two dozen just like them and we the lawyers have their books and papers spread out in front
kendrick the type of disciplinary action or training as you say object
please the court i maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of among others the witness
mos kaffees paying the pizza boy again
he goes into the living room where sam is on the stand
its getting hard to see the floor from all the papers cartons books pizza boxes etc
and a holding room where dawson and downey are being put through their paces
and what happened after kendrick came into your room
beat he ordered me and corporal dawson to give willy a code red
to jo his answers still have to come faster jo
the iowa farmboy thingll play for a while but in the end it looks like hes searching for the truth
to dawson downey hes right and from now on willy is private santiago
you start calling him willy and all of a sudden hes a person whos got a mother whos gonna miss him
mos the clock reads and kaffee in sweatpants and a bathrobe is pacing around slowly with his baseball bat and sam and jo art listening to a lecture for the
dont flinch in front of the jury
something doesnt go our way dont hang your head dont shift in your seat dont scribble furiously
whatever happens you have to look like its exactly what you knew was gonna happen
when you pass me documents do it swiftly but dont look overanxious
beat and dont wear that perfume in court it wrecks my concentration
i was talking to sam
what time is it
time to go home
try to get some sleep tonight
to sam ill give you a ride
sam begins to gather up his things
he stands in front of to sam youre a good man charlie brown
see you in court
sam steps out the door
jo looks at the ground then up at danny i know what youre gonna say
you dont have to
weve had our differences
ive said some things i didnt mean youve said some things you didnt means but youre happy that i stuck with the case
and if youve gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didnt have before well of course im happy about that but we dont have
to make a whole big deal out of it
you like me
i wont make you say it
i was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow
bet your ass
jo walks out the door and kaffee closes it and locks it behind her
then he says very softly
continuing were gonna get creamed
a few m
is are standing by the entrance
kaffee comes around the corner and heads toward the courtroom
were immediately stricken by something in his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a real live naval officer
he opens the courtroom doors and walks into a few more m
s are standing around
the jurors nine enlisted navy and marine men and women are in their place ross is at his table looking through some papers and dawson and downey in handcuffs are
seated at the defense table
the trial in a few moments from being underway and a few people are milling about
kaffee walks down the aisle but is stopped by a voice behind him
kaffee turns around to see a man and woman who are clearly dawsons parents
youre gonna save our son arent you
pause ill do my best
kaffee continues on and stops next to jo whos talking with a woman in her mid s
danny i want you to meet ginny miller loudens aunt
youre aunt ginny
im sorry i was expecting someone older
so was i
not quite the words of inspiration kaffee was hoping to hear before he does the hardest thing hes ever had to do
he walks over to ross
ill flip you for it
kaffee walks back to his table as all those having business with this general court martial stand forward and you shall be heard
captain julius alexander randolph is presiding
god save the united states of america
randolph raps the gavel
randolph without objection the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record
no objection your honor
is the government prepared to make an opening statement
standing yes sir
ross walks to the jury box
continuing the facts of the case are this at midnight on august th the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon mate pfc william santiago
they woke him up tied his arms and legs with rope and forced a rag into his throat
a few minutes later a chemical reaction in santiagos body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding
he drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at minutes past midnight
these are the facts of the case
and they are undisputed
the story i just told you is the exact same story youre going to hear from corporal dawson and its the exact same story youre going to hear from private
furthermore the government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison and entered santiagos room with motive and intent to kill
beat now lt
kaffee is gonna try to pull off a little magic act hes gonna try a little misdirection
hes going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like code red
he might even cut into a few officers for you
hell have no evidence mind you none
but its gonna be entertaining
when we get to the end all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that willy santiago is dead and
dawson and downey killed him
these are the facts of the case
beat and they are undisputed
ross walks back to his seat
before kaffees even stood up these words are coming out of his mouth
there was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just aint true
beat when dawson and downey went into santiagos room that night it wasnt because of vengeance or hatred it wasnt to kill or harm and it wasnt because they were
looking for kicks on a friday night
its because it was what they were ordered to do
beat let me say that again its because it was what they were ordered to do
now out in the real world that means nothing
and here at the washington navy yard it doesnt mean a whole lot more
but if youre a marine assigned to rifle security company windward guantanamo bay cuba and youre given an order you follow it or you pack your bags
beat make no mistake about it harold dawson and louden downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job
kaffee walks back to the table and takes his seat
is the government ready to call its first witness
please the court the government calls mr
while mccguire a civilian in his late s is being sworn in kaffee has sat back down
he leans over to dawson and whispers
how you doin
dawson doesnt change his expression
mcguire would you state your full name and occupation for the record please
mcguire special agent naval investigative service
mcguire did your office receive a letter from pfc william santiago on august of this year
what did the letter say
that a member of private santiagos unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline
was that marine identified in the letter
i notified the barracks c
colonel jessep that i would be coming down to investigate
and what did you find
for the shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing
and who was that
lance corporal harold dawson
continuing to kaffee your witness
ross goes back to his table
mcguire have you questioned corporal dawson about the fenceline shooting
he claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy
but you dont believe him
its not my place corporal dawsons been charged with a number of crimes why wasnt he charged with firing at the enemy without cause
there wasnt enough evidence to support such a charge
mcguire i dont understand what you mean when you say there wasnt enough evidence to support such a charge
you had willy santiagos letter
santiago was the only witness but i never had a chance to interview him
so i dont know what he saw
and now we wont ever know will we mr
no more questions
hammaker a young marine corporal is being sworn in
corporal carl edward hammaker marine barracks rifle security company windward second platoon charlie
corporal were you present at a meeting that lt
kendrick held on the afternoon of august th with the members of second platoon
would you tell the court the substance of that meeting
kendrick told us that we had an informer in our group
that private santiago had gone outside the chain of command and reported to the nis on a member of our platoon
did that make you mad
pause you can tell the truth corporal its alright
did it make you mad
private santiago betrayed a code that we believe in very deeply sir
were the other members of the squad angry
object were dawson and downey
please the court is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on august th
corporal did lt
kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting
what was it
well it was clear that he didnt want us to take matters into our own hands sir
what was the order
sir he said that santiago wasnt to be touched
to kaffee your witness
corporal hammaker were you in dawson and downeys barracks room ten minutes after this meeting
thanks i have no more questions
hammaker gets off the stand and kaffee watches while walks past dawson and downey
a barely perceptible exchange occurs between the eyes of dawson and hammaker
kaffee makes a decision
the government calls corporal raymond thomas please the court i understand lt
ross is planning on calling all the other members of rifle security company windward to testify
in light of the defense that lt
kaffee is planning to mount the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony
the defense is willing to concede that all witnesses will testify substantially as corporal hammaker did if the government is willing to concede that none of them were in dawson
and downeys room at on august th
to ross lieutenant
the governmentll agree to the stipulation sir
then well adjourn for the day
you can call your next witness in the morning
the parade grounds early morning two sailors are raising the flag
commander stone a navy doctor in his mid s is on the stand
and he was pronounced dead at zero zero thirty seven
stone whats lactic acidosis
if the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar instead of oxygen lactic acid is produced
that lactic acid is what caused santiagos lungs to bleed
how long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar
twenty to thirty minutes
and what caused santiagos muscles and other cells to start burning sugar
an ingested poison of some kind
your honor we object at this point
the witness is speculating
commander stone is an expert medical witness in this courtroom his opinion isnt considered speculation
commander stone is an internist not a criminologist and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive
a point which im confident youll illustrate to the jury under cross examination so im sure you wont mind if his opinion is admitted now
not at all sir
doctor stone did willy santiago die of poisoning
are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison
yes i am
then how do you justify there are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable both in the human body and on a fabric
the nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue
thank you sir
kaffee gets up
commander you testified that it takes lactic acidosis to minutes before it becomes lethal
let me ask you is it possible for a person to have an affliction some sort of condition which might in the case of this person actually speed up the
process of acidosis dramatically
stone says nothing for a moment
continuing commander is it possible
what might some of those conditions be
beat if a person had a coronary disorder
or a cerebral disorder the process would be more rapid
commander if i had a coronary condition and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down is it possible that
my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out
it would have to be a very serious condition
is it possible to have a serious coronary condition where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam
there would still be symptoms though
what kind of symptoms
there are hundreds of symptoms of a chest pains
shortness of breath
kaffee has gone back to his table where jo has handed him some documents
he shows then to stone
doctor is this your signature
yes it is
this in an order for private santiago to be put on restricted duty
would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page please sir
reading initial testing negative
patient complains of chest pains shortness of breath and fatigue
restricted from running distances over five miles for one week
commander isnt it possible that santiago had a serious coronary condition and it was that condition and not some mysterious poison that caused the accelerated chemical reaction
i personally give the men a physical examination every three months
and every three months private santiago got a clean bill of health
and thats why it had to be poison right commander
cause lord knows if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health and that man died from a heart related
incident youd have a lot to answer for wouldnt you doctor
move to strike
no more questions judge
ross stands immediately
stone youve held a license to practice medicine for years you are board certified in internal medicine you are the chief of internal medicine at a hospital which serves over
in your professional opinion was willy santiago poisoned
your honor we re new our objection to commander stones testimony and ask that it be stricken from the record
and we further ask that the court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witnesss testimony
kaffee and sam are dying but theyre trying to keep their poker faces
randolphs gonna try to be polite about this but he thought he made himself clear
the objections overruled counsel
sir the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection
the objection of the defense has been heard and overruled
the witness is an expert and the court will hear his opinion
doctor in your expert professional opinion was willy santiago poisoned
thank you sir i have no more questions
commander you may step down
please the court while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises the government rests
well stand in recess until ten hundred hours this monday the l th at which time the defense will call its first witness
randolph raps his gavel
and the courtroom begins clearing out
kaffee jo and sam are packing up their various papers
i strenuously object
is that how it works
no no no no i strenuously object
oh well if you strenuously object let me take a moment to reconsider
i got it on the record
you also got it in the jurys head that were afraid of the doctor
you object once so they can hear you say hes not a criminologist
you keep after it and it looks like this great cross we did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks
its the difference between paper law and trial sam christ you even had the judge saying stone was an expert
sam she made a mistake
lets not relive it
theres an uncomfortable silence
im gonna go call my wife
ill meet you tonight
sam starts to leave
jo turns and says why do you hate them so much
sam stops and turns around
they beat up on a weakling and thats all they did
the rest is just smokefilled coffee house crap
they tortured and tormented a weaker kid
they didnt like him
and they killed him
because he couldnt run very fast
a long silence
kaffee makes a decision
everybody take the night off
continuing i apologize i its alright
weve been working hour days for three and a half weeks straight
take the night off
go see your wife see your daughter
jo do whatever it is you do when youre not here
what day is tomorrow
well start at ten
kaffee picks up his stuff and walks out
sam and jo stand there uncomfortably for a moment
jo begins packing up her things
why do you like them so much
pause cause they stand on a wall
beat and they say nothings gonna hurt you tonight
not on my watch
despite their differences sam likes this woman
dont worry about the doctor
this trial starts monday
a baseball game is on
kaffees pacing slowly around carrying his baseball bat
hes looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room
hes studying it
studying it hard
theres a knock on the door
kaffee answers it
jo is standing in the doorway
im sorry to bother you i shouldve called first
no i was just watching a baseball game
i was wondering if how youd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight
jo are you asking me out on a date
it sounded like you were asking me out on a date
ive been asked out on dates before and thats what it sounded like
do you like seafood
i know a good seafood place
on the virginia side of the potomac
kaffee and jo are sitting at a table finishing up dinner
my third case was a drunk and disorderly
the trial lasted nine weeks
i rounded up people who were in the bar that night
nine weeks on a d and d
what was the prosecutor offering
pause well you sure hustled the shit outta him
after that they moved me to internal affairs
tough to blame them
where ive earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation
why are you always giving me your resume
because i want you to think im good lawyer
no you dont
beat i think youre an exceptional lawyer
i watch the jurors they respond to you they like you
i see you convincing them
i think dawson and downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you
i think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that were gonna lose
beat rosss opening speech it was all true
beat i mean lets pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order
we cant prove it ever happened
beat well keep doing what were doing and well put on a show but at the end of the day all we have is the testimony of two people accused
well find markinson
jo were gonna lose
and were gonna lose huge
we hold on then for a moment and in voice over hear corporal jeffrey owen howard marine barracks windward guantanamo bay cuba
corporal howard the young marine who drove the lawyers around cuba is on the stand
corporal howard name some reasons why a marine would get a code red
being late for platoon or company meetings keeping his barracks in disorder falling back on a run
have you ever received a code red
we were doing seven man assault drills and my weapon slipped
its just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and id forgot to use the resin like we were taught
and what happened
that night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes
then they poured glue on my hands
and it worked too cause i aint never dropped my weapon since
was private santiago ever late for platoon meetings
was his barracks ever in disorder
did he ever fall back on a run
all the time sir
did he ever prior to the night of august th receive a code red
you got a code red cause your palms were sweaty
why didnt santiago this burden to his unit ever get one
dawson wouldnt allow it sir
dawson wouldnt allow it
the guys talked tough about santiago but they wouldnt go near him
they were too afraid of dawson sir
the witness is characterizing
jeffrey did you ever want to give santiago a code red
why didnt you
cause dawsond kick my butt sir
ross is gonna ask you some questions now
ross takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on the table
he brings one to howard
corporal howard i hold here the marine guide and general information handbook for new recruits
are you familiar with this book
have you read it
hands him the book would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds please
just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds
sir you see code red is a term we use its just used down at gitmo sir
i dont know if it actually ross has produced another book
were in luck then
the marine corps guide for sentry duty navy base guantanamo bay cuba
i assume well find the term code red and its definition in this book am i correct
corporal howard im a marine
is their no book no manual or pamphlet no set of orders or regulations that let me know that as a marine one of my duties is to perform code
pause no sir
no books sir
no further questions
kaffee walks over to rosss table and picks up one of the books
he brings it to howard
corporal would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted mens mess hall is
kaffee thats not in the book sir
i dont understand how did you know where the enlisted mens mess hall was if its not in this book
i guess i just followed the crowd at chow time sir
no more questions
kaffee chucks the book back on rosss desk
corporal howard you can step down
greatly relieved thank you sir
kaffee gives howard a subtle you did good kid look and we its the end of the days session
kaffee walks down the hall with sam and jo
seven tonight well do a final kendrick review
i want to slam dunk this guy
as it drives along a street in the d
its evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting against a rain kaffee pulls over at his usual newsstand
he hops out leaving the lights flashing and the door open and runs to the stand
admiral hows the big case goin
nose to the grindstone
no flies on you
a rolling stone gathers no moss
yeah well it aint over til the fat lady sings
aint that the truth
catch you tomorrow
he gets back in his car tosses the newspaper on the passenger seat and turns on the ignition
and as soon as he does a hand is slapped over his mouth its matthew markinson
and kaffee jumps out of his skin
because sitting in the back seat in civilian clothes is jesus fucking christ
you left the door unlocked
scared the shit outta me
are you aware youre under subpoena
im also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands
if there was something i could do about that i would but since i cant all i can do is help you
why dont you drive lieutenant
kaffee begins driving down the street
what do you know
i know everything
was it a code red
did kendrick give the order
did you witness it
i didnt need to did you witness it
then how do you know
you know shit
he was never gonna be transferred off the base
and with this kaffee screeches the car over to the side of the road
he grabs the parking brake and pulls it up
he turns to markinson
continuing jessep was going to keep him on the base
he said he wanted him trained
weve got the transfer order
its got your signature
i signed it the morning you arrived in cuba
six days after santiago died
kaffees wheels are spinning
im gonna get you a deal
some kind of immunity with the prosecutor
in about four days youre gonna appear as a witness for the defense and youre gonna tell the court exactly what you told me
right now im gonna check you into a motel and were gonna start from the beginning
i dont want a deal
and i dont want immunity
kaffee shakes his head and laughs
continuing i want you to know im proud neither of what ive done nor what im doing
kaffee puts the car in gear and we where kaffee has just finished telling his story to an amazed sam and jo
then jo has a total adrenaline rush
where is he
the route best western
jo picks up the phone
i want him guarded
thats probably a good idea
into phone this is lt
commander joanne galloway
my clearance code is
kaffee is impressed
he turns to sam clearance code
to sam i dont have a clearance code
do you have a into phone its jo galloway
i need to secure a witness
jo continues giving information to the person on the phone while kaffee keeps talking to the both of them
sam is writing down notes as fast as he can
he also said that jesseps lying about the transportation off the base
jessep said six the next morning was the first flight santiago couldve left on markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier
jo hangs up the phone
that was impressive
did you hear what i just said about the flight
sam when a plane takes off from a base theres gotta be some kind of record kept right
we need the tower chiefs log for to sam get it
were gonna win
jo dont get crazy about this
we dont know who markinson is
we dont know what the log books gonna say
you just concentrate on downey
im gonna talk to ross and tell him where we are
sing song kaffees got his case now kaffees got his case now
you are like seven of the strangest women i have ever met
a waitress sets two drinks down in front of kaffee and ross who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the back
that was nice work today
the redirect on howard
i have markinson
ross only takes a moment digest this
where is he
a motel room in arlington with federal marshals outside his door
take a sip of your drink
the transfer order that parkinson signed is phoney
and jesseps statement that the six a
flight was the first available is a lie were checking the tower chiefs log
but in the meantime im gonna put the apostle jon kendrick on the stand and see if we cant have a little fun
ross takes another sip of his drink then lays it on the line for kaffee
i have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse kendrick or jessep of any crime without proper evidence youll be subject to court martial for professional misconduct
and thats something thatll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out
markinsons not gonna hold up hes a crazy man
im not saying this to intimidate you
im being your lawyer
and i wanna tell you that i think the whole fuckin bunch of you are certifiably insane
and this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something
dont you dare lump me in with jessep and markinson and kendrick because we wear the same uniform
im your friend danny and im telling you i dont think your clients belong in jail
but i dont get to make that decision
i represent the government of the united states
without passion or prejudice
and my client has a case
pause i want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence
ive been so advised
ross stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table
you got bullied into that courtroom danny
by dawson by galloway shit i practically dared you
not for a second have you believed you could win
you got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer
pause youre a lousy softball player jack
your boys are going down
i cant stop it anymore
people are filing in
kendrick is standing at the entrance to the courtroom
kaffee glides past him
batter up j
kendrick watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom as we kendricks on the stand
what drives kaffees entire examination of kendrick is this kaffees got him
hes gonna win
at least this round
all he has to do is not let his emotions take control of his professional skill
sam will have files and documents ready to hand kaffee as he needs them
kendrick in your opinion was private santiago a good marine
id say he was about average
lieutenant you signed three fitness reports on santiago
on all three reports you indicated a rating of below average
private santiago was below average i didnt see the need in trampling on a mans grave
we appreciate that but youre under oath now and i think unpleasant as it may be wed all just as soon hear the truth
im aware of my oath
kaffees handed some more files
lieutenant these are the last three fitness reports you signed for lance corporal dawson and pfc downey
downey received three straight marks of exceptional
dawson received two marks of exceptional but on this most recent report dated june th of this year he received a rating of below average
its this last report that id like to discuss for a moment
lance corporal dawsons ranking after infantry training school was perfect
records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal while dawson has remained a lance corporal
was dawsons promotion held up because of this last fitness report
im sure it was
do you recall why dawson was given such a poor grade on this report
im sure i dont
i have many men in my charge lieutenant i write many fitness reports
do you recall an incident involving a pfc curtis barnes whod been found stealing liquor from the officers club
did you report private barnes to the proper authorities
i have two books at my bedside lieutenant the marine code of conduct and the king james bible
the only proper authorities im aware of are my commanding officer colonel nathan r
jessep and the lord our god
kendrick at your request i can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority
to kaffee watch yourself counselor
did you report private barnes to your superiors
i remember thinking very highly of private barnes and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge
you preferred it to be handled within the unit
i most certainly did
lieutenant do you know what a code red is
yes i do
have you ever ordered a code red
no i have not
lieutenant did you order dawson and two other men to make sure that private barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days
thats a distortion of the truth
private barnes was placed on barracks restriction
he was given water and vitamin supplements and i assure you that at no time was his health in danger
im sure it was lovely for private barnes but you did order the barracks restriction didnt you
and you did order the denial of food
wouldnt this form of discipline be considered a code red
beat not necessarily
if i called the other men at guantanamo bay to testify would they consider it a code red
please the court the witness cant possibly testify as to what other men would say
we object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness
the governments objection is sustained lt
kaffee and i would remind you that youre now questioning marine officer with an impeccable service record
thank you judge
kaffee looks over at dawson
they share a brief moment before kaffee turns back to kendrick
lieutenant was dawson given a rating of below average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to private barnes
to ross not so fast
to kendrick lieutenant
corporal dawson was found to be below average because he committed a crime
what crime did he commit
beat lieutenant kendrick
beat dawson brought a hungry guy some food
what crime did he commit
he disobeyed an order
and because he did because he exercised his own set of values because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order
of yours he was punished is that right
corporal dawson disobeyed an order
yeah but it wasnt a order was it
after all its peacetime
he wasnt being asked to secure a hill
or advance on a beachhead
i mean surely a marine of dawsons intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own which are the really important orders and which orders might say be morally questionable
beat can he
can corporal dawson determine on his own which orders hes gonna follow
pause no he can not
a lesson he learned after the curtis barnes incident am i right
i would think so
you know so dont you lieutenant
lieutenant kendrick one final question if you ordered dawson to give santiago a code red
please the court i told those men not to touch santiago
is it reasonable to think that he wouldve disobeyed you again
lieutenant dont answer that
you dont have to im through
ross doesnt even wait before he says lieutenant kendrick did you order corporal dawson and private downey to give willy santiaga code red
but kendrick isnt listening hes glaring at kaffee
kendrick did you no i did not
a nerf ball slams into a hoop
jo and kaffee
kaffees pumped and shooting baskets as sam walks in with some bound papers under his arm
whats the word
this is the tower chiefs log for that night
jessep was telling the truth
the six a
flight was the first plane out
kaffee lets the ball drop out of his hands
let me see that
a sedan with u
marshall stenciled on the door sits in front of one of the rooms and the two federal agents inside the car are reading the newspaper as kaffees car pulls next
to them and kaffee jumps out
agent sticks his head out the window and calls to kaffee workin late lieutenant
kaffee pays no attention and bangs on markinsons door
the door opens and kaffee walks into he tosses the log book on the table
there was no flight out at eleven oclock
what the fuck are you trying to pull
the first flight stateside left guantanamo bay at eleven and arrived at andrews airforce base maryland at a few minutes past two
then why the hell isnt it listed in the tower chiefs log
why the hell did you think it would be
kaffee is silent
and now it begins to sink in
what are you telling me
beat he fixed the log book
continuing well maybe he can make it so a plane didnt take off but i can sure as hall prove that one landed
ill get the log book from andrews
markinson says nothing
but his face says that kaffee was born yesterday
continuing beat he made an entire flight disappear
nathan jessep is about to be named director of operations for the national security council
you dont get to that position without knowing how to side step a few land mines
beat and putting me on the stand isnt gonna make him step on one
kaffee stares at him
then shakes his head sighs and picks the log book up off the table and heads for the door
youre taking the stand
hold on markinson
kaffees apartment later that night and sam and j have just heard the report him
theres gotta be someone who can testify to the flight
a ground crew member
do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day
a kid from the ground crew isnt gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago
forget the flight
well put markinson on the stand and well deal with jesseps refusal to transfer santiago and hell testify to the forged transfer order
thatll be enough
that and downeys testimony really oughta be enough
jo is working with downey
he sits on a mock witness stand
private downey why did you go into santiagos room on the night of the th
to give private santiago a code red maam
and why did you give him a code red
i was ordered to give him a code red by the executive officer for rifle security company windward lieutenent jonathan james kendrick
youre gonna do fine
you think theyll let us go back to our platoon soon maam
jo is going over last minute details with kaffee
you remember the order of the questions
are you sure
and youll use small words
he gets rattled when he doesnt understand something
jo im just saying go slow
im gonna go slow
and get him off as fast as you can
hes gonna be fine
they turn and head into the courtroom as we hear markinson in voice over
markinson is writing a letter and we hear it in v
i was williams company commander
i knew your son vaguely which is to say i knew his name
and while we continue to hear markinsons voice writing the letter we begin a series of shots markinson is getting into his class a dress uniform complete with medals side
arm and military dress sabre
in a matter of time the trial of the two man charged with your sons death will be concluded and seven men and two women whom youve never met will
try to offer you an explanation as to why william is dead
for my part ive done as much as i can to bring the truth to light
markinson is finished dressing
he stands in the middle of the motel room
continuing and the truth is this your son is dead for only one reason
i wasnt strong enough to stop it
markinson takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the trigger
always captain matthew andrew markinson
markinson puts the pistol in his mouth united states marine corps
we hear the blast of the gunshot as we kaffee is at the end of his examination of downey
private i want you to tell us one last time why did you go into private santiagos room on the night of august th
a code red was ordered by my platoon commander lt
jonathan james kendrick
to ross your witness
private for the week of august the switch log has you down at post is that correct
im sure it is sir they keep that log pretty good
how far is it from post to the windward barracks
its a ways sir its a hike
about how far by jeep
about ten fifteen minutes sir
have you ever had to walk it
that day sir
the pick up private sir thats what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up
also cause he can get girls in new york city the pick up private got a flat
at the defense table kaffee poker faced scribbles something down on a piece of paper and slides it to jo
jo looks at it wheres he going with this
and hands it back to kaffee
continuing right at
he pulled up and blam
a blowout with no spare
the two of us had to double time it back to the barracks
and if its ten or fifteen minutes by jeep im guessing it must be a good hour by foot am i right
pick up and me did it in flat sir
now you say your assault on private santiago was the result of an order that lt
kendrick gave in your barracks room at
kaffee knows whats coming
theres nothing he can do about it
and he cant lose his cool in front of the jury
but you just said that you didnt make it back to windward barracks until
these are questions he hasnt been asked before
if you didnt make it back to your barracks until then how could you be in your room at
pause you see sir there was a flat tire
private did you ever actually hear lt
kendrick order a code red
kaffees world is falling down around him and theres nothing he can do about it
and he knows it
pause no sir
jo leaps to her feet
please the court id like to request a recess in order to confer with my client
why did you go into santiagos room
the witness has rights
the witness has been read his rights commander
the question will be repeated
why did you go into santiagos room
your honor hal
did corporal dawson tell you to do it
everyone is frozen
continuing he did didnt he
dawson told you to give santiago a code red
downey looks at dawson
dont look at him
answer the lieutenants question
the room is still silent
downey does something weve never seen him do before
he straightens himself up and says this with the pride of a man who believes hes done the right thing
i was given an order by my squad leader lance corporal harold w
dawson of the u
and i followed it
ross lets it hang
he looks over at kaffee
kaffee wont meet his eyes
jo and sam are sitting in silence
its dark outside
where do you think he is
sam doesnt know
jo is beside herself and trying to keep it together
continuing as far as downey was concerned it was an order from kendrick
it didnt matter that he didnt hear it first hand
he doesnt distinguish between the two
sam understands but he doesnt say anything
the door opens and kaffee walks in
kaffee seems to be in an incredibly normal mood
dont worry about it
sam and i were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses wholl talk about implied orders
or maybe we put downey back on the stand before we get to dawson
maybe if we work at it we can get dawson charged with the kennedy assassination
jo studies kaffee for a moment
are you drunk
a simple answer pretty much
pause ill make a pot of coffee
we have a long nights work ahead
shes gonna make coffee
beat he wasnt in his room
kaffees amazed he wasnt even there
beat that was an important piece of information dont you think
pause danny it was just a setback
but well fix it and then move on to markinson
jo and sam are frozen
kaffee says this with no particular feeling one way or the other
continuing you really gotta hand it to those federal marshals boy
he almost has to laugh its not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife
this guy got into full dress uniform stood in the middle of that room drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster and fired a bullet into his mouth
jo and sam dont say anything
continuing anyway since we seem to be out of witnesses i thought id drink a little
i still think we can win
then maybe you should drink a little
look well go to randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance
beat why would we want to do that
to subpoena colonel jessep
listen for a second no
just hear me out no
i wont listen to you and i wont hear you out
your passion is comforting jo
its also useless
private downey needed a trial lawyer today
pause you chicken shit
youre gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up
why did you ask jessep for the transfer order
what are you in cuba
why did you ask jessep for the transfer order
what does it matter why
i wanted the damn transfer order
you couldve gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the pentagon
you didnt want the transfer order
you wanted to see jesseps reaction when you asked for the transfer order
you had an instinct
and it was confirmed by markinson
now damnit lets put jessep on the stand and end this thing
what possible good could come from putting jessep on the stand
he told kendrick to order the code red
why didnt you say so
and of course you have proof of that
ah i keep forgetting you were sick the day they taught law at law school
you put him on the stand and you get it from him
we get it from him
to sam colonel isnt it true that you ordered the code red on santiago
look were all a little im sorry your times run out
what do we have for the losers judge
well for our defendants its a lifetime at exotic fort levenworth
and for defense counsel kaffee
thats right its a court martial
yes johnny after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy lt
kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the rocco columbo school for women
thank you for playing should we or should we not follow the advice of the galacticly stupid
and with one motion he knocks everything from his desk
a ton of papers books files etc
falls to the floor
theres dead silence
maybe just the sound of kaffee breathing after this exhausting outburst
im sorry i lost you your set of steak knives
jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out
the door slams behind her
kaffee walks into the kitchen without a word
sam gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the stuff that kaffee knocked off the desk
kaffee comes back in with a bottle of jack daniels
stop cleaning up
but sam continues
stop cleaning up
sam stops and sits in a chair
kaffee sits on the couch
continuing you want a drink
sam takes a swig from the bottle
is your father proud of you
dont do this to yourself
ill bet he is
ill bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives
sam made law review
hes got a big case hes making hes arguing making an argument
pause i think my father wouldve enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school
beat i think he wouldve liked that
an awful lot
did i ever tell you that i wrote a paper on your father in college
he was one of the best trial lawyers ever
yes he was
and if i were dawson and downey and i had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case id take you any day of the
week and twice on sunday
you should have seen yourself thunder away at kendrick
would you put jessep on the stand
you think my father wouldve
with the evidence weve got
not in a million years
but heres the thing and theres really no way of getting around this neither lionel kaffee nor sam weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of u
versus dawson and downey
so theres only one question
what would you do
we hold on the two of them for a moment then jo is walking through the night at a brisk pace
shes doing her best not to fall apart
two headlights appear coming down the street and kaffees car with sam driving and kaffee riding shotgun slows down alongside jo
kaffee rolls down his window
jo ignores them and keeps walking
the car crawls along with her
jo starts walking faster
continuing jo we look ridiculous
to sam stop the car
kaffee hops out and calls continuing joanne
jo keeps walking
continuing i apologize
i was angry and
im sorry about what i said
but jos still walking
continuing calling im gonna put jessep on the stand
she turns around
a nerf ball bounces off the wall
kaffee jo and sam are sprawled out in the living room
for hours now theyve been trying to come up with an idea
kaffees mind seems to be on his basketball game
i say we hit him with the phoney transfer order
whats the transfer order without a witness
we have a witness
a dead witness
and in the hands of a lesser attorney thatd be a problem
look at this
last night he was swimming in his jack daniels now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound
im getting my second wind
both of you
he sees that sam and jo were already sitting down
beat jessep told kendrick to order a code red
kendrick did and our clients followed the order
the cover up isnt our case
to win jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red
and you think you can got him to just say it
i think he wants to say it
i think hes pissed off that hes gotta hide from us
i think he wants to say that he made a command decision and thats the end of it
he eats breakfast yards away from cubans who are trained to kill him and no ones gonna tell him how to run his base
least of all the pushy broad the smart jew and the harvard clown
i need to shake him and put him on the defensive
sam and jo are silent for a moment
thats the plan
thats the plan
youre gonna trip jessep and hes gonna confess
im not gonna trip him
im gonna lead him right where hes dying to go
and how are you gonna do that
i have no idea
i need my bat
looking around i need my bat
i think better with my bat
wheres my bat
i put it in the closet
you put it in the closet
kaffee heads to the closet
i was tripping over it
dont ever put a bat in a closet
he thinks better with his bat
and we go to kaffee at the closet
i can understand that
i used to have stuffed panda named mr
i could never do my home work without him
during this kaffees opened the closet door
he reaches in to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something his clothes
his uniforms and his civilian clothes
hanging neatly along the bar
he stares at this a moment then suddenly heads back through the living room towards the front door
stay here im going to the office for a while
kaffee storms out
boy he does think better with that bat
a small room at the end of a corridor at the office
kaffee stands over a printer and watches it spit out something hes been waiting for
he tears the printout off and we kaffee is looking over the computer printout
from what we can tell it resembles a large military coded phone bill
kaffee picks up the phone and dials
into phone sam
beat i need you to do something
sam hangs up the phone slowly
whats goin on
ive gotta go out to andrews
the days session is going to begin in a few minutes
kaffee comes around the corner and runs into jo
is sam here
where is he
hes on his way
did he got the guys
listen can i talk to you for a second
jo closes the door behind them
howre you feeling
i think hes gonna have his hands full today
beat when youre out there
if its not gonna happen hes not gonna say it beat dont go for it
kaffee looks at her
continuing if you feel like
if you feel like
you could get in trouble
beat im special counsel for internal affairs and im telling you you could get in a lot of trouble
are you suggesting i back off a material witness
if you think you cant get him
do you think i can get him
beat i think it doesnt matter what i think
im an administrator
beat i cant seem to defend people
kaffee takes that in
he picks up his briefcase and grabs his jacket
then he turns to jo
youre my hero joanne
beat from the first day you were a lawyer
beat live with that
and in voice over we hear the sergeant at arms
everyone stands at attention as randolph enters
sam is missing
to kaffee call your witness
hell be here
lieutenant call your witness
defense calls colonel nathan jessep
jessep is escorted in through a side door
hes wearing his dress uniforms adorned with the appropriate medals
colonel do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this general court martial will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help
yes i do
would you state your name rank and current billet for the record please air
colonel nathan r
jessep commanding officer marine ground forces guantanamo bay cuba
thank you sir would you have a seat please
colonel when you learned of santiagos letter to the nis you had a meeting with your two senior officers is that right
the executive officer lt
jonathan kendrick and the company commander captain matthew markinson
and at present captain markinson is dead is that right
id like to know just what defense counsel is implying
im implying simply that at present captain markinson is not alive
surely colonel jessep doesnt need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information
i just wasnt sure if the witness was aware that two days ago captain markinson took his own life with a caliber pistol
and from the back of the room sam enters
hes escorting two young airmen in airforce dress uniforms
sam shows the airmen to a seat near the front and takes his place at the defense table
over this we hear the witness is aware the court is aware and now the jury is aware
we thank you for bringing this to our attention
move on lieutenant
sam scribbles something on a piece of paper kaffee walks over looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names cecil omalley and anthony perez then turns back to
colonel at the time of this meeting you gave lt
kendrick an order is that right
i told kendrick to tell his men that santiago wasnt to be touched
and did you give an order to captain markinson as well
i ordered markinson to have santiago transferred off the base immediately
i felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out
is there another kind
kaffee holds up a document from his table
we have the transfer order that you and markinson co signed ordering that santiago be lifted on a flight leaving guantanamo at six the next morning
was that the first flight off the bass
the six a
flight was the first flight off the base
kaffee nods and decides to move on
jessep steals a quick glance at the two airmen sitting out in the courtroom
colonel you flew up to washington early this morning is that right
i notice youre wearing your class a appearance in dress uniform for court today
continuing as are you lieutenant
did you wear that uniform on the plane
please the court is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular
the defense didnt have an opportunity to depose this witness your honor
id ask the court for a little latitude
a very little latitude
i wore fatigues on the plane
and you brought your dress uniform with you
and a toothbrush
a shaving kit
change of underwear
to ross is the colonels underwear a matter of national security
to kaffee you better get somewhere fast with this lieutenant
i brought a change of clothes and some personal items
kaffee gets a document from his table
continuing after dawson and downeys arrest on the night of the sixth santiagos barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried
reading pairs of camouflage pants camouflage shirts pairs of boots pair of brown shoes pair of tennis shoes khaki tee shirts belts sweater please the court is there a question
anywhere in our future
kaffee i have to im wondering why santiago wasnt packed
on the jury randolph ross
continuing ill tell you what well get back to that one in a minute
jo hands kaffee the computer printout
continuing this is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past hours
after being subpoenaed to washington you made three calls
handing jessep the printout continuing ive highlighted those calls in yellow
do you recognize those numbers
i called colonel fitzhuqhes in quantico va
i wanted to let him know id be in town
the second call was to set up a meeting with congressman ramond of the house armed services committee and the third call was to my sister elizabeth
why did you make that call sir
i thought she might like to have dinner tonight
judge im gonna put a stop to this now
jos handed kaffee another printout and a stack of letters
your honor these are the telephone records from gitmo for august th
and these are letters that santiago wrote in nine months requesting in fact begging for a transfer
to jessep upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer santiago was so excited that do you know how many people he called
not one call to his parents saying he was coming home
not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport
he was asleep in his bed at midnight and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his
closet and folded neatly in his footlocker
you were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls
santiago was leaving for the rest of his life and he hadnt called a soul and he hadnt packed a thing
can you explain that
the fact is there was no transfer order
santiago wasnt going anywhere isnt that right colonel
your honor its obvious that lt
kaffees intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury
its my recommendation sir that lt
kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench and that the witness be excused with the courts deepest apologies
randolph ponders this a moment
your honor the objections noted
and now he cant help but let out a short laugh
continuing is this funny sir
do you have an answer
my answer is i dont have the first damn clue
maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq
and maybe he didnt have any friends
im an educated man but im afraid i cant speak intelligently about the travel habits of william santiago
what i do know is that he was set to leave the base at
now are these really the questions i was called here to answer
phone calls and footlockers
please tell me youve got something more lieutenant
please tell me theres an ace up your sleeve
these two marines are on trial for their lives
please tell me their lawyer hasnt pinned their hopes to a phone bill
beat do you have any other questions for me counselor
the courtroom is silenced
jesseps slammed the door
kaffee looks around the room sees that the world is waiting for him to do something
kaffee says nothing
he glances over to airmen omalley and continuing lieutenant do you have anything further for this witness
kaffee doesnt respond
jessep gets up to leave
standing thanks danny
i love washington
and jessep starts to leave but hes stopped by excuse me i didnt dismiss you
jessep turns around
i beg your pardon
im not through with my examination
to randolph id appreciate it if he addressed me as colonel or sir
i believe ive earned it
defense counsel will address the witness as colonel or sir
to randolph i dont know what the hell kind of an outfit youre running here
and the witness will address this court as judge or your honor
im quite certain ive earned it
take your seat colonel
jessep goes back to the stand
continuing what would you like to discuss now
my favorite color
colonel the six a
flight was the first one off the base
there wasnt a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at andrews airforce base at a
lieutenant i think weve covered this havent we
kaffee gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that sam scribbled on
your honor these are the tower chiefs logs for both guantanamo bay and andrews airforce base
the guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p
and the andrews log lists no flight that landed at a
id like to admit them as defense exhibits a and b
i dont understand
youre admitting evidence of a flight that never existed
we believe it did sir
glancing at the paper then motioning to the airmen defensell be calling airman cecil omalley and airman anthony perez
they were working the ground crew at andrews at two a
on the seventh
your honor these men werent on the list
rebuttal witnesses your honor called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination
if you looked closely at jessep you could see a drop of sweat
ill allow the witnesses
this is ridiculous
colonel a moment ago check the tower logs for christs sake
well get to the airmen in just a minute sir
a moment ago said that you ordered kendrick to order his men not to touch santiago
and kendrick was clear on what you wanted
any chance kendrick ignored the order
ignored the order
any chance he just forgot about it
any chance kendrick left your office and said the old mans wrong
when kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch santiago any chance they ignored him
have you ever spent time in an infantry unit son
ever served in a forward area
ever put your life in another mans hands ask him to put his life in yours
we follow orders son
we follow orders or people die
its that simple
are we clear
are we clear
kaffee speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from knowing youre about to drop your opponents continuing beat colonel i have just one more question before i call airman omalley
and airman perez if you gave an order that santiago wasnt to be touched and your orders are always followed then why would he be in danger why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base
and jessep has no answer
he sits there and for the first time seems to be lost
private santiago was a sub standard marine
he was being transferred off the base because but thats not what you said
you said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger
thats correct but you said he was in danger
i said grave danger
you said yes i recall what i can have the court reporter read back your i know what i said
i dont need it read back to me like im a damn then why the two orders
beat why did you sometimes men take matters into their own hands
you made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands
your men follow orders or people die
so santiago shouldnt have been in any danger at all should he have colonel
everyones sweating now
everyone but kaffee
you little bastard
your honor i have to ask for a recess to id like an answer to the question judge
the courtll wait for answer
if kendrick told his men that santiago wasnt to be touched then why did he have to be transferred
jessep is looking at omalley and perez
jessep says nothing
continuing kendrick ordered the code red didnt he
because thats what you told kendrick to do
kaffee will plow through the objections of ross and the admonishments of randolph
and when it went bad you cut these guys loose
your honor thatll be all counsel
you had markinson sign a phony transfer order judge you doctored the log books
ill ask for the forth time
you ordered you want answers
i think im entitled to them
you want answers
i want the truth
you cant handle the truth
and nobody moves
continuing son we live in a world that has walls
and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns
whos gonna do it
i have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom
you weep for santiago and you curse the marines
you have that luxury
you have the luxury of not knowing what i know that santiagos death while tragic probably saved lives
and my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible to you saves lives
beat you dont want the truth
because deep down in places you dont talk about at parties you want me on that wall
you need me there
boasting we use words like honor code loyalty
we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something
you use em as a punchline
beat i have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom i provide then questions
the manner in which i provide it
id prefer you just said thank you and went on your way
otherwise i suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post
either way i dont give a damn what you think youre entitled to
quietly did you order the code red
beat i did the job you sent me to do
did you order the code red
pause youre goddamn right i did
randolph ross the m
s theyre all frozen
jo and sam are likewise
jessep seems strangely quietly relieved
kaffee simply takes control of the room now
please the court i suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate article a session
the witness has rights
randolph looks to ross
ross is frozen
he doesnt know what to do
as a friend jack
ross looks at kaffee then jessep then nods his head yes to randolph
the sergeant at arms will take the jury to an ante room where youll wait until further instruction
the sergeant at arms begins leading the jurors out of the room
what the hells going on
no one will say anything until the jurors are out of the room
continuing to captain captain what the hells going on
i did my job
id do it again
now im getting on a plane and going back to my base
s guard the prisoner
s are tentative
theyve never heard a marine colonel referred to as the prisoner before
they sure as hell have never been asked to guard one
guard the prisoner
what the hell colonel jessep you have the right to remain silent
any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by court martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding
you have the right
ross continues reading jessep his rights over im being charged with a crime
im thats what this is to ross marine
ross keeps going marine
ross is doing his job
im being charged with a crime
im thats whats happening
this im this is funny you know that this is and jessep lunges at kaffee and kaffee would be dead but for the three m
s whove leapt in to restrain jessep
sam and jo have come to their feet and stand behind kaffee
continuing to kaffee im gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull
you fucked with the wrong marine
ross is done reading jessep his rights
colonel jessep do you understand those rights as i have just read then to you
i saved lives
that boy was there was a weak link
i saved lives you hear me
the courtroom is silent from jesseps outburst
jessep shakes his head
continuing you fuckin people
beat you have no idea how to defend a nation
continuing to kaffee all you did was weaken a country today kaffee
thats all you did
you put people in danger
sweet dreams son
dont call me son
beat im a lawyer and an officer of the united states navy
and youre under arrest you sonofabitch
kaffee stays on jessep a moment longer then remembers continuing the witness is excused
s start leading jessep out and kaffee notices dawson
who are watching a man in a marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs
kaffee takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat from his hands
he takes a deep breath as we theres low murmur in the room as the jurors are being led back into their box
everyones in place
and sit when randolph sits
have the jurors reached a verdict
we have sir
the sergeant at arms takes all the slips of paper from the foreman and brings them to randolph
kaffee stands and nods to dawson and downey that they should do the same
sam and jo stand as well
reading on the charge of murder the members find the defendants not guilty
its hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout but they do
continuing reading on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder the members find the defendants not guilty
randolph looks up
then reads from the last slip of paper
continuing on the charge of conduct unbecoming a united states marine the members find the defendants guilty as charged
a little of the energy drains out of the room
randolph continues reading
continuing reading the defendants are hereby sentenced by this court to time already served and are ordered
randolph clears his throat
continuing and are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the marine corps
pause this court martial is adjourned
randolph raps his gavel
s move to dawson and downey to unlock their handcuffs
kaffee is packing up his things just another day at the office
harold im sorry
i dont understand
colonel jessep said he ordered the code red
i know but colonel jessep said he ordered the code red what did we do wrong
its not as simple as what did we do wrong
we did nothing wrong
sam slaps his hands down on the table yes you did
a jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine
what does that mean
youre the lawyer
youre the marine
sam lets it hang
dawson is staring at sam
his stare moves slowly to the floor
continuing i never meant to hurt willy
dawson looks up at his parents
the moment hangs there
before kaffee ive gotta take these guys over to personnel for some paper work
continuing to dawson downey gentleman
dawson looks to kaffee
theres gotta be more
this cant be it
but kaffee has nothing to say
dawson and downey walk to the sergeant at arms and begin to follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom
but before they get to the door kaffee turns around and calls harold
they stop and turn around
pause you dont need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor
dawson stares at kaffee for a long moment
dawson and downey come to attention
continuing theres an officer on deck
dawson snaps a salute and holds it
kaffee stares back
then stands up straight and returns their salute
with one last glance back at kaffee dawson turns and walks out the door followed by downey
ross walks over to the defense table
airmen cecil omalley and anthony perez
what exactly were these guys gonna testify to
unless im mistaken they were gonna testify under oath that they have absolutely no recollection of anything
and very handsome too dont you think
ill see you around the campus
ive gotta go arrest kendrick
tell him i say hi
kaffee jo and sam are walking down the steps
the band is practicing on the parade grounds
