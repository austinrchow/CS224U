screenplay by lawrence wright menno meyjes edward zwick story by lawrence wright a coast road
burnt out hulks that once were russian t tanks have long ago been left to rust in the sun
a door mercedes hurtles down the ancient road
were online for exactly two minutes
of the same scene
a grainy image of the car and some distance away a moving cluster of animals
they are as seen at ground level
two shepherds goad them forward
in the distance the mercedes approaches
army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through the rubble of a collapsed barracks
the single worst casualty in the history of american military the mercedes barrels down the road doing at least mph
shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the herd of sheep are about to cross the road
amidst the rubble the dead are zipped into body bags
the truck carrying high explosives is believed to have hit the barracks the driver of the mercedes hits his horn but doesnt slow down
in addition to the driver and a bodyguard an old man with a hennaed beard a turban and sunglasses sits in back
as the mercedes closes with the sheep slow down
as if on command the mercedes finally slows as the sheep move lazily across the road
president clinton addresses reporters in the white house
to any lengths anywhere in the world to bring these people to justice
inside the mercedes they watch as the shepherd urinates and the sheep mill about in the middle of the road
the driver rolls down his window to scream in arabic at who hurries to button his fly
it is only as we look closer that we see the silenced muzzle of protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah
and then fill the frame blocking our view of the mercedes and for a moment all we can hear is their gentle bleating
but as they clear frame we can see that has been turned into an abattoir its windshield shattered and bloody
the driver slumps over the steering wheel the bodyguard is half out of the window
and in the distance one shepherd pulls a black hood over the sheiks head while the other injects him with a hypodermic
the first shepherd activates a satchel charge and swings it into the mercedes while the second straps the sheik into a harness
a balloon self inflates and hurtles aloft pulling a cable attached to the sheiks harness
its whiskers in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable without slowing and roars off the sheik dangling unconscious beneath just as the satchel charges explode the mercedes
records impassively for a moment then breaks up into static
a pale diminished sheik sits at a steelcase table
a steel cot and a steel toilet
closed circuit cameras in the corner
opposite him the man whose voice we have only heard general william devereaux and though he wears a civilian suit his bearing betrays his pedigree
his considerable charm and habitual skepticism are as much a product of self discipline as his close order drill
nobody knows youre here
not your people
not even my president
youll die here alone and be buried unknown barring some miracle
the sheik speaks a few words in arabic
looks at him what you eat
whether you eat
absence of pain
i make the day and the night
even the way you got here a hand that reached down from the sky
looks at him god
i am your new god
a muezzin climbs a spiral staircase enters a turret like room clicks on a microphone and chants the call to prayer
hundreds of believers prostrate themselves on prayer rugs
at the door hundreds of shoes are lined up work boots expensive loafers a range of social classes represented
shopkeepers pause to kneel and pray
in arab homes parents and children do the same
and as we pull back from of the mosque we discover not an arab city but instead the unmistakable skyline of the world trade ctr wall street the federal building
two agents hurry through the bullpen
tina osu sharp and frank haddad lebanese with an insouciant grin
brooklyn south issued a code blue less than two minutes ago
they think hostages are involved
black and whites on the scene
setting up a perimeter now
residence or business
sequence omitted from original script
surrounded by a phalanx of black and whites
they have been joined by anthony hubbard the asac
on the way
the bomb squad approaches
we see terrified passengers inside
how soon can we get there
in this traffic maybe tomorrow
as a police techie inserts a dentists mirror through a drilled hole in the buss door the l
begins to blink and the passengers scream and dive for cover
frank is listening to a cell phone
it just blew
the doors hang off their hinges
as the passengers tumble off we see they are covered in blue paint
thats what theyre telling me
and nobodys hurt
hubs closes his eyes in gratitude
theyre listening to a tape recording altered by a vo corder our first and last warning
as the message continues we pan the faces mike johannson squad supervisor and danny sussman representing nypd
we expect our demand to be met
there will be no negotiation
that is all
demand for what
you hear any demand
you sure this is all they got
maybe its performance art
sussman shoots him a look
clearly haddad enjoys pushing his buttons
finally hub stands up
voice altering technology available from the sharper image catalogue
last i looked they werent offering exploding paint bombs
still the rhetoric sounds political
not their style
jihad isnt known for their sense of humor and hamas is raising so much money here why queer their deal
anyway isnt green the color of islam not blue
and excuse me but why do we immediately assume theyre arabs
i want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today
tina you cross check it against the mainframe
mike have you got the lab analysis on the paint
see if any was sold in quantity the last month
danny tinas phone buzzes
she picks it up as hub keeps going find out what stop these guys got on the bus maybe theres a witness
i think were all eager to give up our weekends on this
it just occurs to me has anybody even committed a crime here
i mean assault with a deadly color
hub deals with haddads irreverence by ignoring it
heres what i dont like
they know explosives
they know our response time
they put in a call and walk
a young agent fred darius hands hub a piece of paper excuse me sir
i think you should see this
came in on the fax
only two words are written release him
who are we holding
sheik whats his name from the trade center
omar abdel rahman
the hamas guy got released in april
looks at the fax why be coy about it
you think its phony
covering the phone hub somebodys flashing a government badge over at the warehouse where theyre working on the bus
our tech guys want to know if were cooperating with any other agencies on this thing
off hubs look we hub and haddad join agent floyd rose a tall black man
shes looking for wiring signatures on the device and asking for copies of any latent prints weve managed to lift
smells like it
turns out shes also been talking to some of the passengers
in the klieg lights the bus
men in white coats dust every inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed ufo
in their midst a young woman midwestern pretty in a serious suit
she looks up as hub enters
special agent anthony hubbard
oh shit ive been trying to liaise with you all day
my name is elise kraft national security council
she offers her hand
hub doesnt take it yet
and youve been trying to liaise with me all day

and doesnt let go
and im colin powell
what exactly do you people want with my bus
she tries to take her hand away but he tightens his grip
were all on the same team here agent hubbard
who exactly is we on this particular team elise
its never the question thats indiscreet only the answer
she smiles back
convinced shes charmed him
tell you what you send me an official inter agency request for cooperation on this and ill give you copies of everything we come up with
otherwise get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have
theres no reason to be nasty
you think this is nasty
smiles in case you havent heard
the cia has no charter to operate domestically
which puts you in violation of federal law
not according to the cooperation agreement special order i suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information
i happen to be well within my authority
special order refers to domestic terrorism
you got something you want to share with me

hub watches as elise is led away by two agents
agent rose stands nearby
in frank haddads home
the haddads are celebrating the day frank jr

say i seek refuge in the lord of men the king of men
franks teacher offers the final benediction

hub and frank watch a dark skinned man being questioned by a uniformed official
an ins supervisor shows them a false bottomed suitcase stuffed with money

khalil pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot
hubs contour pulls over a safe distance behind and waits
an agent passes by and slips a walkie talkie through the open window
falls in behind khalil who ducks into a storefront where we can see him buying a coca cola and a baby ruth bar
notes the purchase twelve bucks in gaza
americas the place to be if youre a terrorist

all of a sudden he breaks into a run
keys radio go go go
all units he slams the car into gear and peels out into traffic
in various guises break cover and sprint after khalil who shifts into overdrive
cars screech to avoid flattening him
hubs contour pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked by a narrow passage between double parked cars
he goes for it scraping his way between them
on the phone judge im gonna have to call you back
into an open air market knocking down veiled women with bags of fruit and vegetables
he vaults over stalls
the contour scrapes parked cars as it swerves into an alley desperately trying to cut off khalils escape route
i didnt take the insurance
a soccer ball bounces into hubs peripheral vision followed by two boys
to avoid killing the two boys
hub gets out of the car and continues the pursuit on foot
hes gaining on khalil when bears down on khalil its doors sliding open as two pairs of hands reach out and another man appears out of nowhere and bodychecks khalil
into the van and jumps in after him
the van burns rubber and disappears into traffic
an impromptu huddle in the alley
agents gather in a circle as radios squelch and helicopters circle above
they just found the van
doesnt look like theyre gonna find any prints
the agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox type photo from a digital printer in his car
hub looks at the picture of khalil and the good looking palestinian
run him down bring him in
fred hands a cell phone to hub
as he listens the first trace of a smile graces hubs face
in an ordinary neighborhood
hub sits in an unmarked car
agent rose climbs into the front seat
ive got two in the plymouth at least three inside and see that guy walking his dog
he did his business about an hour ago and theyre still walking
i had a dog like that once
its not his dog numbnuts
the dog works for the cia
their radio crackles to life
over the radio all units report in turn
we hear unit is good to go unit were ready to rock
is suddenly double teamed by two agents
hands behind your back a third agent throws his jacket over the dog
fishtail across the quiet street boxing in the plymouth as an agent from the sidewalk thrusts a gauge remington pump in through the drivers window
keep em where we can see em thank you very much
is blown in by a specially designed shotgun
two men eating take out are surprised by frank and tina their guns drawn
hi guys i expect you know the drill
hub continues warily from one empty room to the next
a stairway leads downstairs
as hub starts cautiously down muted voices can be heard
reaching the bottom he sees sitting in a chair
behind him stands one of freelancers from the warehouse
and opposite him in a barca lounger elise kraft somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished basement is a palpable feeling of menace
as hub shows himself one of the freelancers points a glock at his head
hub just stares him down
ralph spare us
the freelancer lowers the gun
hub looks at khalil whose face is badly bruised
i never touched him
im taking him into custody just the same
what are you going to charge him with
hub stares at her i dont suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first
not in this lifetime
you know hub
may i call you hub
if you guys hadnt blown the surveillance wed have been able to follow the money
what do you think khalil you would have led us right to your friends wouldnt you
khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her
what have you got for me elise
she stonewalls tell me now or tell me downtown
hub calls out to his agents

as the other agents approach khalil one phone call and hes mine again

anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law overlapping him oh come on
do you have any idea what youre starting here the kind of shitstorm youre about to overiding her kidnapping

as he heads out of the room he says to a waiting agent
elise sits handcuffed alone in the back seat
up front frank is driving with hub beside him
you okay back there you dont get carsick or anything
those handcuffs too tight
shouf mountains right
shiite or sunni

was the paintbomb a warning
to haddad american university of beirut
i was there from to
a look to hub no shit

is there a terrorist cell operating in this city that we are unaware of
ignoring him to haddad such a tragedy
growing up in that city was
like an exotic paris wasnt it frank
you ever been in rikers elise
you know what happens in there
elise looks at him utterly unfazed by the threat
franks beeper goes off
as they look at one another we red lights flashing have sealed off a brooklyn street
on the rooftops swat teams are already deploying
sharpshooters politely insinuate themselves into the surrounding family apartments and take up firing positions
stands alone in the middle of the street
through a marksmans scope we see the terrified passengers forced to stand catch glimpses of the terrorists obscured by the hostages
hub confers with the nypd officer in charge
definitely arab types only this time theyre still in there
any communication at all
its weird theyre just in there
get the frequency of the drivers radio and patch it through to this number
we need two lines
frank get a negotiator out here
sir theyve got kids in there
we count six
this rocks hub for a moment but he covers it well
that gives us something to work with
elise leans forward as hub opens the drivers door
whats happening out there
hub takes off his jacket folds it carefully on the seat
theyve taken another bus havent they
talk to me
oh now you want to talk
you want to be my friend is that it
listen these guys are the real deal
how do you know
she just looks at him
is there a terrorist cell operating in brooklyn
a long moment yes
was the blue paint a warning
and im afraid this time theyll blow the bus
if they wanted to blow the bus then why havent they blown the bus
he starts away
maybe i can help
has been hastily improvised behind a swat van
the drivers name is larry kaiser
he says theyve got explosives strapped to their chests they got automatic weapons and theyre speaking arabic
where the hells the negotiator
tunnels got twenty minute delays and theyre working on both bridges
to the cop what else did he say about the device
did he describe it at all
anything about a button or a cord or
pulls up and raises its satellite dish
almost involuntary oh god
frank turns to look at her
she is suddenly pale
as it dawns on her theyre not here to negotiate
they were waiting for the cameras
hub is deep in conversation with the cops
hub looks up
frank nods for elise to repeat what she said
theyre want the newsies here
they want everybody watching
hub and frank look at each other
can this be true
youve got the shooters in place
kill em now
they just look at her
its lose lose any way you play it
do you want to lose little or lose big
the nypd officer has been listening i got the marksmen on the com theyre looking for a clean shot
as the policeman waits for a response on his radio two more news vans pull up
the media circus has come to town reporters breathlessly offer their live on the scene reports
hub and elise stare at one another
shooter says theyve got the passengers all standing in the aisles
he says no go
hub can see the dread in elises eyes
as the seconds tick away two news helicopter jockey for position above
to the cops we have rules of engagement were gonna follow here folks so put the safeties back on your weapons
looks at elise nobodys killing anybody until we see whats what
he grabs the phone
on the phone larry this is agent hubbard of the fbi ill be negotiating our way out of this
let me talk to one of them
you just hang in there larry
no dont worry ive got somebody here who can translate
he looks over at frank whos listening on another cell
on the phone sir my name is anthony hubbard
i dont have any authority to make deals or respond to demands
i just want to find out if you need anything in there
if any of the passengers are in need of medical attention
he waits as frank translates
hub covers the mouthpiece
i dont know if they understand
on the phone sir is there anything you want to say to me
that i can tell my people here
the guys just breathing into the phone maybe theyre not even arabs
on the phone i get the feeling you dont want to talk but will you listen
whatever grievance you have whatever quarrel surely it doesnt involve these children still no response
on the phone so im gonna ask you to
no response then suddenly the bus doors hiss open and six bewildered ashen faced children step out before the doors hiss closed behind them
as hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children cross the no mans land to safety a smattering of applause breaks
out among the cops
elise tries to hold back tears
okay here we go
on the phone thank you sir
i appreciate that gesture i really do
the best way to get what you want in these situations is to show yourself to be reasonable
as youve just done
haddad translates now weve got some more to talk about
elise watches as the news cameras zoom in
on the phone i am unarmed as you can see
so i propose
you let the rest of the passengers go and i take their place
that way theres no pizza deliveries or bathroom breaks to worry about and all these indicates swat teams people
frank shakes his head dont do this
hubs look says translate it
frank does it
they all wait
on the phone im gonna take your silence to mean youre considering my offer elise looks at frank she cant help but admire his bravery
how about we just start with a few of the elderly people you got on there
its got to be hard for the older folks to be standing all this time
hub looks back at frank
still no response
and then the bus doors hiss open again
a few elderly passengers start down the steps
on the phone thank you sir
now lets just let these hurls hub backwards as to be replaced by a high end almost electronic white noise
imbeds itself into car doors bus benches doorways as every window in a three block radius is shattered
replaces blue paint in a horrific shower
fights for consciousness
rush to his side to see if he is alright but we cannot hear them
though their mouths move it is only the white noise that overwhelms us as we realize that hub has been momentarily deafened by the blast
when at last hub manages to speak his words are muffled and indistinct as if the playback heads of a tape recorder needed to be cleaned
im frank haddad bends down close and we can lip read him saying just hang in there buddy
just let me and then he leans over to vomit in the street
slowly bleeds in through the white noise mercifully for us and for hub who wipes his mouth and looks up realizing that his hearing is coming back
he reaches for franks outstretched hand and stands albeit woozily
is anybody but the look in franks eyes says it all
images we associate with other countries
and then he sees elise
her face is cut and bleeding but as their eyes meet her look is one of absolute compassion
crowded into the now overflowing bullpen
in absolute denial of his physical condition hub paces like a caged animal
every trap every hole
i want to rumble every mosque every community center every student organization thats ever said an unkind word
i want the heat turned up under all our assets all our informers every snitch gets twisted inside out
and put some money out on the street arab community hates these people as much as we do
turns to mike have you got positive id on hub we dont have positive id on anybody
we need more hands
fred im on it
he picks up a phone and begins requesting agent transfers
i want to talk to khalil
hes down the hall
now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony
conferences with dc at and
call your families find a sleeping bag nobody leaves this office until we have a strand to pull
oklahoma city people
the first twenty four hours are the only twenty four hours
and i dont want to see anybody walking
hub and frank watch khalil through a video monitor
the bruises on khalils face have deepened
doctor seen him
hes on his way up
got a cigarette
you dont smoke
hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into frank hangs back in the doorway
hub pulls up a chair turns it backwards and sits down very close to khalil
ten thousand dollars
khalil pretends not to understand
i want to talk about the money
again frank translates
and again khalil looks blank
hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes
khalils eyes widen
hub smiles at him
at the sound of the match lighting sweat begins to bead on khalils forehead
hub takes his time lighting the cigarette drawing deep so the tip turns bright red
khalil unconsciously recoils in his chair
to frank re khalil doesnt like second hand smoke
hub turns back to khalil casually gesturing with his cigarette
khalil almost jumps out of his skin
you ready to talk about money
frank hasnt even begun to translate before khalil begins speed rapping in arabic
translating he says he loves america and only wanted to get away from the security services at home
tears stream down khalils face
he kneels at hubs feet
still translating he says hes sorry but he didnt know he was doing something bad
his cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if hed bring the suitcase to an address in brooklyn
to hub hes a cut out
hub hands tina back the pack of cigarettes
to danny flatbush avenue
bursts into an empty apartment
on the floor a fax machine continuously sending the message release him
we want every rental agreement from every landlord in brooklyn
hotels motels flophouses
to the other agents its cash guys

a technician operates an overhead projector
this is a spectograph of the semtex used in the bomb
look at the benzene spike

as you can see the signature is identical
a computer techie whitney is cross referencing data
digital pictures of suspected terrorists scroll past
a surveillance photo of ahmed bin talal
the ruined army barracks

the techie types in a few commands images of destroyed buses file past
none a match
not according to the mainframe
the bomb scene now resembles an archeological dig
floodlights on stanchions
forensic experts on their hands and knees use black light and brushes to search for latent prints
different color string divides the site into a grid
with a q tip
bone shards hair fingernails nearby danny and mike observe hubs intensity
hes way over his head
shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket
in the lab
a fingerprint expert sifts through a plastic bag of fingertips and teeth
scans each into a computer
sequence omitted from original script
hub is staring at the tv sets which are all replaying the terrible incident over and over again
today tel aviv has come to brooklyn
finally he turns away so no one will see
his eyes are hot with the emotion
the fingerprint techie races in sparing hub a response
hub and tina address twenty agents
ladies and gentlemen meet the late ali waziri
he projects a photo of the dead terrorist onto the wall
tina talked to the israelis and traced this sucker to a group operating out of ramallah
thats the west bank not the west side for those of you just joining us from nebraska
a few appreciative chuckles
theyre all exhausted
this is the first good news in a bitch of a day
okay weve pulled his landing card and his i
so now we know he came in three days ago out of frankfurt she points to where a time line has been created out of colored strips beneath a bank
of silent tv monitors
what we need now is to fill in the time between his arrival and the incident
all known associations and most of all we need an address
the time line is progressing
phone technicians add tie lines dedicated fax lines wats lines and scrambled lines
danny and frank pore over ali waziris i
hold on hold on im looking it up today danny

hub has been pacing nearby
wheres the original

what time is it
off hubs blank look whens the last time you ate
fred darius the young agent appears
they want you in the lab
hub peers through the eyepiece at a magnified strand of fiber
pure unadulterated egyptian cotton
youre saying theyre egyptian
im just saying see
its what they use for funerals
the guy was wearing a shroud
he looks at frank
its just as elise said
the real deal
lets see if shes ready to talk
elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been there before
i thought one phone call and you were out of here
i didnt make the call
she just looks at him entirely neutral
are you alright
just some tinnitus in my left ear they look across the professional chasm that divides them
i need to know what i dont know
lifes too short
but theres a hint of some thawing in her tone
we ordering in
sequence omitted from original script
hub and elise sit eating corned beef sandwiches
the funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self purification
first a fast then the washing of the body then the shroud
i saw it on sixty minutes
tell me something i dont know
she pauses always gauging how much to reveal
last march in iraq we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year
in august he went to lebanon
where he was
extracted by whom
she just looks at him i see
his name is sheik ahmed bin talal
and something of a religious leader
with something of a devoted following
she nods okay i can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our governments in the kidnapping business but why not tell us
hes still being
theyre not ready to go public with charges
what else you got on his followers
clearly theyre committed
in this game the most committed wins
so theyll just keep coming until we release him
unless we match their commitment with our own
what about talking to this sheik
you dont think theyve got guys talking to the sheik
except the sheik isnt talking
so whos giving the orders
how do they coordinate pick their targets
believe me weve put every resource weve got onto that very question
puts down her fork otherwise
she looks at him
for one brief moment the mask drops away
if theres anybody on earth who knows how you feel its me
but youve got to let it go
those people were dead the minute they got on the bus
frank haddad appears making his way toward their table
mmmm is that pastrami
tastes it then with his mouth full oh yeah we made the guy in the picture
sequence omitted from original script
where students sit inside and smoke then smoke some more
the last of the unambivalent smokers

hub looks at elise
samir is leaving its now or never
take him down
keys his radio go
three agents brace samir politely but firmly and lead him to their car
samir slides into the back seat next to elise
in the rearview mirror hub watches as a look seems to pass between them
then again it may not have happened
samir nazhde my name is frank haddad im a federal agent
we have reason to believe you are an accessory to the bombing of bus
are you crazy
you are an associate of ali waziri
i know no one by that name
elise is looking out the window seemingly oblivious
you got him a student visa
i sign these applications as a matter of course hundreds of them
everyone wants to come to the land of opportunity and baywatch
elise tries to keep a smile off her face
hub clocks this
you spent two years in israeli jails during the intifada
the only ones who didnt were women like you
frank backhands him across the mouth
samir says something in arabic to frank who responds in kind
to samir youre going downtown my friend
you cannot hold me
i know my rights
i watch american television
defrauding the ins is a federal offense
hands samir to waiting agents reservation for one please
they enter the bullpen
its well past midnight
people are sacked out in sleeping bags while others continue working
frank leans over danny sussman who has fallen asleep face down on his desk and sings in a lovely brogue singing oh danny boy the perps the perps are call
as he awakens we need a search warrant on samir
frank cmere a sec
i want to show you something
he leads frank into another cubicle
perched on nearby desk elise is dialing a phone she stops to watch them quietly frank you ever hit a prisoner again ill have your badge
someday i will tell you what those people did to my village in
hub waits for him to calm down
touches his arm okay
but right now act as if im capable of saying something funny
now lets go see about that warrant
as they walk back hub says to danny find me a judge wholl play ball this time
and set up a polygraph for samir
i still dont understand why were tipping our hand with him whats there to tip
youre just trying to protect your asset
to elise pointedly arent you elise
hes your joe your asset
hes working for you youre his case officer right
how should she respond
how thin should she slice it
in addition to being a nationality being a palestinian is also a
a lucrative one
meaning hes your joe
at one time or another everybody in the middle east has slept with everybody else
so youre saying
you sleep around
so we share him
to frank call ins find out his status and start deportation proceedings
i cant let you do that
oh you cant let me do that
what precisely is your involvement with these people
sighs then samirs been a very important
project of mine for some time
im the only one hell deal with
hes very well connected and extremely high strung
call the judge
looks at frank how easy is it to get inside frank
how good are your sources in the mosques
how many people you got in hamas
franks shakes his head ruefully
ive seen your deft touch
we tap his phone
and i get to see the transcripts
and i run him
we share him
he cant know were talking
then dont tell him
to frank let him fly
back to her but we better start seeing product
any more surprises for me
then im going home to get some things
ill have somebody drive you
ill grab a cab
and hes gone
frank turns to elise elise
im really high strung too
she just smiles and walks away
not many people around
hub stands on the corner
a taxi cruises up
he slows long enough to see that hub is black and passes right by
the taxi driver stops just long enough for hub to slam his shield on the windshield
hub sits in back hurtling into the night
the drivers id identifies him as abdul hassam
hub shakes his head
as the hot spray hits him he runs his hands through his hair and feels the bits of shattered glass
dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands
not his own
he leans against the shower wall closes his eyes
we are in her apartment
samir looms over her
you let him hit me
you cannot care about me and let such things happen
next time dont be such a smart ass sometimes i hate you just because you are so american
it makes me want to hurt you
i think about fucking you and hurting you
elise can taste the blood in her mouth but its the price shes come to accept
in a heartbeat its all business
you want to fuck me
then work with me
dont tell me what i have to do
do we really want to have this conversation again
something quietly ominous in her tone
he lowers his eyes
and like a sailboat elise changes tack
strokes his arm
i need you to help me
i need you to be strong
as you have always been strong
for both of us
look at me
hes fallen asleep in a chair
in his lap is a pile of visa applications
his beeper goes off
he rouses himself
sex without any shred of tenderness
as samir kisses the back of her neck we see in her eyes the thousand yard stare
in the doorway of an apartment building frank hands hub a styrofoam cup of coffee
its a ritual between them
some people just cannot live in the camps
for my brother it was already like dying
the only thing he lives for is movies
he sits up in bed reaching for another cigarette
and then some sheik tells him that to die for allah is beautiful
if he does this thing our parents will be taken care of and he will live on in paradise with seventy virgins
sighs and my brother he needs to believe it very much so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies
a rueful laugh and i become a vip
it is very confusing
so who are you afraid of betraying
you know these people
they bomb they maim
do they represent the palestine you want to build
looks at him theyre using you
you are using me too
everybody uses the palestinians
we are the whores of the middle east
looks at her you make reports about our little talks
what about fucking me
i had to get special permission for that
as he stands up naked and goes to the window we see seen again from much farther away by hub who stands on a rooftop across the way watching through
frank stands beside him

hub heads for his office his secretary nods inside
someone is waiting
its devereaux in a civilian suit
i understand they call you hub
i know who you are general
offering his hand bill devereaux
i served in the nd airborne i know
same time i was running the rd
put me through school
where on capitol hill wall street or hollywood would you find one man whos even paused over one of those words in the last ten years
hub is unsure why hes audience to such a command performance
what uh brings you here general
can i get you some coffee
you want me to get to the point
the presidents concerned
hes worried that have you met him by any chance
no sir i havent
i know reading the papers terrorisms a real concern for him
and your job is to with all the affection for the man i can tell you he doesnt know fuckall about terrorism or the mideast that i dont put on
his cue cards
what hes expert in is his own survival
you get my meaning
i didnt guess you came all this way for a cup of coffee
agent hubbard you look like you think im here to take your baby away
with all respect for your expertise sir
were on track here
which is what i said to the president the army is not some big green police department
stick with the man on the ground
i appreciate your support
youre sure youre not chasing your own tail though
hub considers for a moment then what do you know about sheik ahmed bin talal
weve received two communications from the bombers to release him
we cant release him
i know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists but hub we cant release him because we dont have him
we never had him
and besides that hes dead
the cia says the cia
the cia couldnt predict the fall of the berlin wall until bricks were hitting them in the head
resuming the libyans snatched the sheik some sectarian muslim thing ill explain it next time you have a free week
they killed him
qaddafi put out disinformation that it was us
who was your source on this
a woman will never know the middle east
youre talking about a culture that keeps its women slipcovered
elise kraft cant tell a sheik from the prophylactic of the same name
i appreciate the heads up
devereaux rises offers his hand
as they shake elise sticks her head in the door without knocking
hub weve got judge frankel in as devereaux turns around oh
please dont let me to hub sorry
that tip on the landlord looks solid
the judge will see us right away
sounds like i should get out of your way
were there if you need us
at the door to elise your father well elise
as can be expected
top of her game
heads out well go get em
and hes gone
elise turns to hub
making new friends
hows your lip
she looks at hub and now she knows that he knows
she brazens it out so
you like to watch
just learning about commitment
its a full contact sport
judge frankel puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands
youre telling me that just because some brooklyn landlord tips you off that hes been paid in cash you have the right to call in the cavalry hub as far
as i know paying cash is not yet a crime in this country
youre not hearing me
this khalil was carrying cash for youve observed him giving cash to no but but you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus
elise sits quietly beside frank observing hubs trials
i know well turn up trace elements of semtex chemicals
and when you do youll get your warrant
what about as a feasibility study
we enter first take a look then fill out the warrant
tell me the difference between that and breaking and entering
were the good guys
not good enough
what is good enough judge
a school maybe
these things come in waves
waves mean nothing to me theres been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years but if you came to me
with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure id send you packing
theres a price to be paid for living in a free society and not in cash i guarantee it
hub catches elises eye were out of here
elise and hub climb seemingly endless flights of stairs
not two judges from now not two hours from now not two minutes from now
these guys could split any second and youve lost your best shot at franks working another warrant you dont understand theyre pros
from the age of twelve theyve been dodging people like you people better than you
you mean people like you
no matter how sparkling your record is no matter how terrified you are to fail finally he stops turns on her its
just because you went to night school or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesnt make you sir thomas more
just because you talk the talk doesnt make you an expert
and just because you read my file doesnt make you an expert on me
youre gonna lose them and theyre gonna do another horrible you think i want to lose them
where do you get off talking that shit
if i dont take em down properly theyll be on the street two hours from now
i could find dynamite semtex plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless ive got the right warrant its all inadmissible theyve also got a warrant
a warrant from god
theyre ready to die
and your quaint laws dont mean shit to these people
my quaint laws
last i checked you were an american citizen
and these happen to be the only laws we got
turns on her look im just a cop okay and im real sorry the cold wars over and you masters of the universe got nothing going on over there in
afghanistan or iraq or wherever but youre just not in the middle east anymore
they reach the top of the stairs where frank is waiting
he dangles a piece of paper the warrant and grins
hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an apartment across the street paper shades drawn
wearing a set of headphones elise listens intently to the arabic conversation
theyre discussing how hard it is to find a decent cup of coffee over here
hands headset to frank i make out three voices
what do you have on the infrared
three sounds right
if we had microwave wed know for sure
the cias got microwave how come we dont have microwave
hub meanwhile is question a syrian landlord
three of them
all day long they watch tv
and eat pizza
nothing but pizza pizza pizza
hub looks over at frank
theyve got a way in
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
mike johannson carrying two pizzas knocks on a door
hub frank and a small army of agents lock and load
opens the door to the length of a chain and hands mike a twenty dollar bill
you want change right
you gonna open the door or what
the arab motions leave them on the ground
jesus didnt ya hear crimes down seven percent
muttering he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs
after a moment we hear the chain pulled and the door open
the young arab sets the pizza on an orange crate
two other young arabs in the next room barely take their eyes off the rerun of hunter
but as the young arab opens the box hidden within explodes with a blinding flash knocking him to the ground
is blown in as armed agents rush in hub leading the way
english and arabic fbi
lie down on the floor with your hands behind your back
have not been affected
not only were they in the next room but also their eyes were averted from the flash
but only get off half a clip each before they are cut down by a fusillade of fbi return fire
the young arab momentarily disoriented stumbles to his feet only to be confronted by six armed agents all aiming at his chest
drop your weapon
the terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and pulls the trigger
as the cordite drifts lazily toward the ceiling hub calls out from behind the table what about the others
see if we can get a pulse other agents scurry in to hover over the inert bodies
hub picks himself up in time to see elise kneeling beside the body of the young arab her hand on his boyish chest
we got semtex we got detcord same stuff as the bus the whole enchilada
a few whoops and high fives as the adrenaline rush of the firefight abates
frank opens the remaining box
anybody like anchovies
then from across the room hub kneels beside an ominous looking device
a claymore mine
it didnt fire
they had it rigged to the door and it didnt fire
frank stares at the lethal booby trap
hub shakes his head
were too old to be lucky frank
where mike and tina are dancing their asses off
around them other agents from the takedown laugh and drink
hub and elise sit watch them cut loose
sips her drink my first boyfriend was palestinian
my father liked to say they seduce you with their suffering
a waitress brings her another drink
you ever been over there
he shakes his head no the courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes
and the people these incredibly
warm people in this
but you work against them
only the crazies
i tend to be suspicious of all true believers
looks at him present company included
so im a fanatic
lets just say you dont seem the ambivalent type
is that right
so whyre are you a fed
thats what my nephew keeps asking me
why you with the man unc
whatd you tell him
you read my file
you tell me
captain of this president of that
hard work fair play make a difference change the system from within
that was in my file
tell me im wrong
he studies her for a moment
you believe in anything elise
like what for instance
how about right and wrong
its easy to choose between right and wrong
whats hard is choosing the wrong thats more right
i just want to make it all
finishes her drink ignore me
frank appears to lean over their table
so am i
tell us about being a spook
ever meet aldrich ames
werent you at the bay of pigs
you were in charge of waco right or was that ruby ridge
the shah of iran noriega i love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the soviet union
yeah yeah yeah
edgar hoover wore a dress
she laughs and stands up to dance what do you say hub
but as he grudgingly stands up a ballad comes on
they stand there awkwardly
finally he takes her into his arms
this feels like high school
only my prom date wasnt packing a gun
mines a mm
how big is yours
from the ground
laughing they dance closer so whats the latest from samir
i want a list of every visa he sponsored
not sure hell do it
i once knew this undercover guy started to care so much about his source samirs a source
have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side
samir in bed with them
that would too much to wish for
youre so confident
only in bed
tina watches them
she rolls her eyes at frank
and then a low rumble as the light flickers and the chandelier sways
what do they put in these drinks
they got earthquakes in manhattan
but elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door
hub joins her
already in the distance the wailing of sirens
blue light flashing
hub elise and frank sit grimly silent
is snarled and gridlocked at th
finally they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of honking horns
past the frustrated drivers
turning the corner at st where from the new victory theatre where a gala benefit is taking place
walks toward camera
from the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace everything is perfect except and now we see haphazardly pulled up over the steps and the firetrucks already unspooling their hoses
cops firemen emts
hub and elise race past
sits weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions
their faces cut and bleeding stumble around disoriented
as hub and elise continue toward a sound we have never heard before in this country
a kind of keening
a nypd sergeant is the senior officer on the scene
hub shows his shield to the man who appears a bit shell shocked
fucking bastards waited til intermission
everybody standing around
glass crunching underfoot they can only watch as horribly disfigured bodies are carried out
a news reporter shoves a microphone in hubs face
is it true the governor was attending tonights benefit
i dont know
who it is im speaking to
hub ignores the reporter
he sees that elise is already tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a society matron
he takes off his coat and goes to work beside her
hub sits alone
folks as you can probably tell we have begun our descent into washingtons national airport
hub reaches up to his damaged ears
as anyone whos ever flown with a sinus problem knows the pain is excruciating
but we can only lip read her question
hes sweating now
over this we hear either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly or next week therell be a hundred more all over the world
sequence omitted from original script
as hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome the debate continues within sounds great general except why cant we find out whos behind it a strategy session chaired by
sleeves rolled up silver coffee service
staff members abound
these sects are organized so you need a kill to your credit to get inside
it makes undercover operations impossible
what that leaves us is
were working on it
how about whos behind whos behind this
ask a question
get an atlas
all i know is that we must respond
find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them
and if we cant find out
the question hangs in the air
look it keeps escalating
first a bus then the theatre
anything but leadership
with all respect senator why dont we just stipulate that the president is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business
what about sending in the guard
the national guard are trained for riot control not counter terrorism
the army then
ive seen the contingency plans
its settled legal doctrine posse comitatus that the army not be turned against our own people
even if thats what our own people are asking for three to one
if the president is willing to declare a state of emergency president lincoln declared martial law in
he suspended which the supreme court later found un constitutional
ex parte milligan
and ive got an election in november
ex united states congressman
guys guys the president lost a lot of friends last night not to mention six points in the polls
and his plane lands in two hours
we owe it to him to have a consensus
you dont fight a junkyard dog with aspca rules
what you do is take the leash off your own bigger meaner dog
the army is a broadsword not a scalpel
you do not want us in an american city
how long would it take you to we only go if the president invokes the war powers act
i understand that general
let us imagine though for a moment that the order has been given
close on devereaux
as he weighs his remarks we flashcut almost imperceptibly to as water is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized manner
we hear the sound of chanting
twelve hours after the president gives the word we can be on the ground
one light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men
elements of the rapid deployment force combined with special forces delta
apcs tanks helicopters
and of course the ubiquitous m a assault rifle a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or seven eleven
it will be noisy it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade
where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud
we watch in slow motion as it drifts down a shoulder
that means civilian casualties
at a minimum its a drunk private joyriding in a hummer who runs down an old lady in greenpoint
at a maximum
sighs make no mistake
we will hunt the enemy
we will find the enemy
and we will kill the enemy
turning the key in an ignition
an engine rumbles to life
looks at them and no card carrying member of the aclu is more deadset against it
than i am
which is why i urge you
no i implore you not to consider this option
a long beat
the chief of staff sighs
i know what the president will say
thats exactly why youre the only man for the job
emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave
the army general speaks up
i remind you general devereaux does not speak for official army policy
a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti in somalia could i interrupt
everyone looks over at hub
thats anthony hubbard fbi
hes the asac on the ground up there
they took out the first cell less than hours after bus
i suggest we hear what he has to say he nods to hub who acknowledges the vote of confidence
there is something you probably havent thought about doing
and that is
dont over react
off their incredulity with all respect gentlemen im just a cop
to you these people may be martyrs but to me theyre criminals
and a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks hes better than everyone else
and hes not better
he only has to be wrong once
and thats where we come in
we run down a tip from a landlord or we pick up a latent print from a bus
our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the arab community wanting to help
he measures his words carefully
unaccustomed to these kind of august circumstances
they love this country and they hate that these criminals are giving them a bad name
with their help and some old fashioned shoe leather well nail these guys
amen to that
thank you agent hubbard
i too think we should proceed cautiously
looks around now weve got an agency briefing prepared
some of you may not know sharon bridger
sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulf war
close on hub as from behind him comes a familiar voice we all know the traditional model of a terrorist network
one cell controlling all others
cut off the head and the body will wither
hub looks to the back of the room at elise whos no longer elise
she looks blithely at hub as if nothing is amiss
unfortunately the old wisdom no longer applies
the new paradigm is like the myth of the hydra
each cell exists independent of the other
cut off one head and another rises up in its place
crossing the brooklyn bridge keeping well below the speed limit
in the distance the glass towers of manhattan
bus was the work of cell
its elimination only activated the work of cell the theatre gala
turns up wall street
frank haddad and danny exit the federal building
they pass mike and fred heading back in
something about the van causes frank to take notice
how do we find cell
everyone looks to sharon elise
hub looks at her too
the question hangs in the air
shes thinking about something
jumps the curb and heads across the plaza on a collision course with the glass lobby of the federal building
frank and danny are rooted to the ground
close on sharon elise
as time elongates
we dont know
sequence omitted from original script
puffy clouds in a blue sky
as we tilt down into of what was once the federal building
rescue workers hunt for survivors as others carry body bags toward waiting ambulances
hub stands sentinel to the grisly process as indeed he has stood there all night
frank is beside him
are they confirmed
fred whitney were waiting on who else
a jeep pulls up and elise sharon gets out
their silence speaks volumes
with sharon is an officer
this is colonel hardwick
shaking hands anthony hubbard
clocking him but til i hear otherwise this is still my show
im here as an advisor only
i intend to keep a low profile
i appreciate that colonel
i dont mean to be insensitive but what exactly are your capabilities at this point
infrastructure youre standing on our infrastructure
hub walks back toward the rubble
sharon watches him go
sofas have been pushed against the wall
hubs apartment now serves as a temporary command post
agents huddle together poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files
they managed to get a partial vin off the van
dmv says it was reported stolen the day before in brooklyn
fiber thinks theyve come up with a piece of the shroud
frank joins them
grim we just got a confirmation on mike
he was with fred in the lobby
how many does that make it
a knock on the door
they look at one another
one of the agents answers it
she walks over to them
about your friends
giving her nothing frank
this is sharon
to her i didnt catch the last name
how ya doin frank
takes from her purse a folder labeled in hebrew
the agency has come up with another list of probables
she takes out photos
neither hub nor frank react
she puts them on the coffee table
no one reaches for them
i think we should circulate them
they stonewall her hey this stuff may be good
why was there no warning from samir
because he didnt know anything
maybe ill ask him
over my dead body
over six hundred dead bodies
they stare at one another
both are tired and raw
look hes one of the good guys
how the fuck can you be so sure
because he helped me recruit the network in iraq
he just stares at her
we were part of the operation to destabilize saddam hussein
printing up fake dinars arming the kurds and financing the sheik
he was going to be our ayatollah khomeini and help bring down saddam
i ran the network
samir was the go between
he risked his life for us over there
so who are they
give me names give me pictures
not some history lesson
i cant give you pictures because i dont know what they look like
we did everything at arms length
so you got nothing
ive got samir
has he had any contact with them
how does he do it
whats he waiting for
we got lots more buildings in midtown maybe hes waiting to see how many they can blow up
look i know how you must feel theyll make contact soon
she looks at him refusing to divulge anything more
suddenly hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into viciously whats the tradecraft sharon
i love all that spy shit
still she says nothing im gonna haul your boy downtown strap his ass to a polygraph and ask him all about you
then im gonna send the transcripts to a friend of mine at the times who just loves to write about the latest cia link to some political horror show
you burn him you lose any chance you ever had
its lose lose from here on in who said that
im not fucking with you
how can you possibly remember who youre fucking
she slaps him hard
without hesitation he slaps her back
she claws at his face but he grabs her wrist and bends her arm behind her back
youre hurting me
something in the violence of the moment is more than a little charged
a dead drop by a hot dog stand
out for her morning jog
a series of freeze frames as the motordrive clicks and whirs
thats good sound
except theyre not saying anything worth listening to
sequence omitted from original script
samir chats with a couple of older men in the steaming waters
ones his uncle he owns the place
the others a doctor
they check out clean
he go there every day
a clean body and a pure heart
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
tonight we take a close look at the tragic sight of a city under siege
hub sits on his sofa watching the special report
spread out before him the surveillance photos of sharon and samir
a deserted times square
police checking packages of shoppers in front of a department store
long lines of security at bus stops
hub and frank are walking downtown
at a stoptlight a bus idles beside them a policeman onboard
claiming responsibility for the bombing
in other news a cab driver was beaten and his cab set on fire
the driver rashid abu the jews man
when they say jump we say how high
i say we if youre on the state department terrorist watch list you cannot get into this country
but ali waziri was on the watch list and he got in
did you call the state department
they told me to call ins
they told me to call state
dont you just love government
is only the bus backfiring
pedestrians who have thrown themselves to the ground screaming now pick themselves up laughing
only hub and frank are not laughing
as many fled there were others who stayed behind to pay the price
jammed freeways a looted corner deli its arab owners bloodied police checking backpacks at an elementary school
today as hundreds of law enforcement officials gathered in a broadway theatre outside people wanted answers
angry people scared people
hub being interviewed about the coordinated efforts of law enforcement
already there is talk of a protest march by a coalition of hub and a few others sit on the stage
two hundred law enforcement officials fill the orchestra seats
is to make this city safe
and your department my department what asshole
sharon stands at the back meets hubs eye and waves
everybodys talking at once
in frustration hub covers a microphone with his hand
the feedback silences the room
from now on we will raise our hands and wait to be called on an appreciative chuckle
hub points to a man in a suit
so weve pulled every ethnic visa in the city and traced them to source
who wants em
we bring me in have a talk
what about translators
how many people we talking about here
sixteen hundred maybe more
where the hell we gonna put sixteen hundred people
everyone again begins speaking at once
hub takes control
what about a military presence at jfk and laguardia
i dont think were there yet
its also not going to stop these people
what about protecting the arab population
theres a lot of anger i represent the american arab anti discrimination committee
whatever injustices my people may be suffering at this difficult moment we will continue to show our patriotism and our commitment to this country
thank you sir
and to everyone else for their patience today
these are extremely difficult times london paris were not the first city to have to deal with this
he pauses a moment searching for the words
in tel aviv the day after they blew up the market the market was full
looks out at them this is new york
we can take it
and then two hundred beepers all go off at once
everyone looks at one another
dear god what now
kids huddled in a corner crying
a dead mom
the legs of what we imagine is the terrorist
we are in hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast barricade of desks and tables
sharon kneels beside them
one of the moms was carrying a piece wounds the guy as hes planting the device
he kills her and locks them all in
points at video up there in the corner
by the clock
the probe is a hot head arthroscopic video camera
its got a timer on it only we dont know how much time is left
as hub stares at the horrifying image the white noise returns and begins to grow in his head
closer on the timer
im trying but the angles wrong
the noise in hubs head continues to grow
and then suddenly it is compounded by the sound of an approaching chopper as an nypd swat helicopter lowers itself into view
what the fuck is the nypd doing here
i dont know
somebody must have in the helicopter a marksman raises a snipers rifle
is screaming now in hubs head
on his radio nypd swat this is the fbi
get that bird the fuck out of there
the sound of the chopper and the white noise drown him out
children are screaming without sound
even the chopper is drowned out by the white noise
the marksman takes careful aim the terrorist grabs a child as a human shield
hub closes his eyes to the imminent nightmare and then he takes off barreling down the hall toward the locked door of the classroom
he flies through it firing hitting the terrorist twice
much like the first one on bus
hub throws himself over several screaming children
and for a moment we dont know if theyll live or die until blue paint covers them all
agents pour in followed by sharon
there on the floor holding as many weeping children as he can who unable to keep up the facade for a single second more is also weeping now
weeping for the victims of the bombings weeping for the children whove survived weeping for himself
and for a moment everyone just
stands there vaguely embarrassed and more than a little moved
hub sits in his boxers toweling blue paint from his hair listening to the cnn report of the school attack
a knock at the door
he pulls on his pants
this just came in
she hands hub another fax last warning
he looks at it and hands it back to her without a word
my necks a little stiff thats all
a long look thats not what i meant
they stand awkwardly in the doorway for a moment
you want a drink
he walks over and opens a bottle of scotch
that was a pretty crazy thing you did today
he doesnt respond
hands her the drink
she takes a drink
i wanted to i
just didnt feel like
i could call him
maybe hed join us
youd like that
or i could call tina
they stare at each other
look i thought samird be an easy recruit
it was crazy but i did what i had to do
looks at him you know as well as i do running an agent can be very
how about running an fbi agent
you think im trying to run you
looks at her why else are you here
staring right back you know why im here
its a charged moment
theyre two sad and lonely people
tell me to leave
when they embrace their ferocity and desperation is something more than comfort and less than love
sequence omitted from original script
the chief of staff is working late in a cardigan sweater
devereaux in his impeccable suit stands opposite him
even at ease he is smartly erect
the fbi received another fax
ahmed bin talal
theyre still under the impression that we have him
to refresh your memory as i told you last time it was the libyans who i remember perfectly well what you said last time
looks at him do we
devereaux frosts him with a look
let me give you some free advice son
dont get between me and the president
you might break a nail
i am speaking for the president
he and devereaux look at each other
it is the moment of plausible deniability
as far as the president is concerned
no we do not
the chief of staff accepts the answer because it serves him for now
and because he has a more pressing agenda
general do you know that after yesterdays attack half the parents in this country kept their children out of school
devereaux nods theyre attacking our way of life
its got to stop
and the president cannot afford to be weak
reading the subtext are you saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps
im saying the president is prepared to be
a ringing phone
hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets
he looks around and realizes he is alone
did last night even happen
on the phone hubbard
slow down slow down he reaches for the remote control turns on the tv
as the first apc enters brooklyn
followed by another
and in a sound bite general devereaux in fatigues for the first time and looking like grim death
today with the invocation of the war powers act by the president i am declaring a state of martial law in this city
road blocks set up at select intersections
random stop and frisk
patrols of young soldiers in the streets
gang kids same age same color eye them warily
to the best of our knowledge we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy
he is hiding among a population of roughly two million
soldiers in full battle dress stop cars check trunks handbags briefcases and ids
the line of honking angry motorists stretches as far as the eye can see
intelligence tells us he is most likely arab speaking between the age of fourteen and thirty
narrowing the target to fifteen thousand suspects
a swarthy teenager is pulled from a car by a sergeant and led away to a camouflaged tent set up on the bridge
we can further reduce that number down to those who have been in this country less than six months
now you have twenty hiding among two thousand
a car trunk is inspected
two women waved through
if you are one of these twenty young men you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background
unfortunately for you you can only hide there
and that population in the classic immigration pattern is concentrated
right here in brooklyn
hub and sharon stare at the orwellian tableau
we intend to seal off this borough
and then we intend to squeeze it
this is the land of opportunity gentlemen
the opportunity to turn yourselves in
after sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile i described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained
hub and sharon show their ids to an mp
would you follow me please
the general is expecting you
he leads him to a camouflaged tent on the service roadway
there is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens
the swarthy teenager is being interrogated by col
but the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve
they are now face to face with the most fearsome killing machine in the history of man
and i intend to use it
and be back on base in time for the play offs
that is all
devereaux sees hub and strides over to him hub
good to see you again
i cant say the same sir
not in that uniform
i thought you were against this
i am against it
it wasnt my call
im only following orders didnt work at nuremberg
it may not be your policy but theyre your tactics
your operation had its chance hub and you couldnt get it done
youre down three touchdowns
time to bring in the first string
against our own team
devereaux suddenly goes ice cold
are you questioning my patriotism
im questioning your judgement yes sir
hub i want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier
i have a dozen tropical diseases ill never entirely get rid of
i set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass
i have watched men die and i have killed
now i am serving my president and quite possibly not the best interests of my country but my profession doesnt afford me the luxury of that distinction
i wont question your patriotism but dont you ever again question my command
im not under your command general
take a good look around my friend and tell me thats still true
softening his tone but were not shutting you out
in fact i cant do it without you hub
i need men like you
men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom
gestures to his uniform these stars mean i have been putting it on the line for thirty years
and never made a mistake worth remembering
dont tell me i made a mistake about you
hub and sharon exit the command tent
ironic theyre not shutting us out
they need men like me
hell fuck it up the arrogant prick
you ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice
were putting samir in play
with all this going on
oh right hes high strung
only you can manage him
you and the cia and the dia and god knows who else youre really working for
seething get back in there sharon elise whatever the fuck your name is theyll probably make you a colonel
if youre not one already
she gestures at the military leviathan
is no more in our interest than it is in yours hub
what exactly are your interests sharon
you protect samir you protect the agency
youre interested in protecting everything but your country
you have no idea what i do for my country
no and i dont want to know
with you or without you were putting samir in play
she looks at him for a long moment
considering one more lamb to the slaughter
samir looks and sees hub standing beside sharon
oh my god
oh my god
he tries to slam the door but they force it open
he grabs a fat joint from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom
to sharon does he understand the difference between the fbi and the dea
its fine hes cool
outside the sound of gunfire
samir reappears wild eyed
listen to that
are you listening
theyre killing arabs out there
you can stop it all right now
what are you talking about
the army is here
theyre setting up interrogation centers right now
theyre torturing people in cellars
lets just calm down for a second

gentling a horse well take care of you
you just have to calm down money
i must have more money
you got a student visa for ali waziri
somebody asked you to didnt they

sharon cracks him across the face
now its samirs turn to taste the blood in his mouth
what he wants to know
to sharon hey thats enough
he fucking knows
theyd never trust someone like me
ive got a picture of the two of us do you remember that picture samir
the mask coming off im going to post that picture in every mosque in brooklyn
and then im gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the west bank
youve got family there dont you
hub jumps up takes sharon by the arm
let go of me he gives her the bums rush out of the apartment shuts the door then turns back to samir who sits ashen faced
nobodys going to burn you nobodys going to call anybody sits beside him who asked you to get that visa
samir is trembling
tears roll down his cheeks
dont be afraid
i can protect you
theres nothing to be afraid of
im afraid of going to hell
hub just sits there
he knows hes got him
finally his name is tariq husseini
he runs an auto shop
hub waits for more on commerce street in red hook
hands him a card my beeper number
anybody messes with you im there in twenty minutes
he gets up and walks into where sharon waits
as they head for the stairs we hear youre good
youre not so bad yourself
but we are hearing it along with in a nearby surveillance vehicle where through the newest microwave technology the kind the fbi dont yet have he has overheard the entire
in his lap the name tariq husseini
they are in a housing project
hub dials his cell phone
you calling devereaux
didnt get his number
on the phone floyd hub
we need to put something together in a big ass hurry
give him a
a yellow school bus pulls up beside them and armed soldiers hop out
sharon watches them as hub continues on the phone and find some kind of beat up car
well beat it up yourself if you have to
its a garage in red hook
but remember looks at her theyre pros
a psy ops van passes by broadcasting through a p
all persons without proper authorization must be off the street until seven a
failure to comply will result in immediate arrest
the announcement is then repeated in arabic
they come upon several more yellow school buses
from within the various apartments the shrill protests of mothers and sisters as young men fitting the terrorist profile are hustled into the buses
tariq will go to ground
we can hit him in less than an hour
turns to leave hit him hard
where are you going
ive got to stash samir someplace safe
as she goes go with god
hub hurries on toward his car passing teenage girls defiantly wearing keffiyahs who mill about taunting soldiers with obscenities in english and arabic
an apc drives past further inflaming their passions
suddenly a volley rocks and bottles come hurtling out of nowhere smashing harmlessly against the armor
the teenagers laugh
and then the sudden concussion of a small blast from up the street
the teenagers scream and scatter
hub sprints toward a smoking car pulling his weapon from his hip
a soldier is rolling on the ground screaming beside a parked car
his leg is shredded
armored jeeps come squealing around a corner
m s are locked loaded and leveled at hub
for a moment its touch and go as the the terrified recruits just weeks out of basic training decide whether to shoot
on the ground the injured soldier keeps screaming
into my jacket
and show you
drop your weapon
hub drops the gun and shows his credentials
the young soldier approaches warily as medics attend to the wounded man
somebodys booby trapping cars
were all a little spooked
the rattle of small arms fire is heard from up the street
in the distance a running figure is chased by three soldiers
the transformation is complete brooklyn as gaza
hub climbs in
on a nearby pock marked wall a single word intifada
hub who sits in a beat up old car a baseball cap worn backwards on his head
he keys his radio
all units report in turn
if talking will reveal your position just key your walkie
inside an auto garage
hoists compression cylinders archwelders
outside two winos share a bottle by the curb
a beat up dodge drives up
in it two scruffy looking black men
upon close inspection we realize that one is hub
the other is floyd
to a mechanic yo
the mechanic looks out from under a car
the mechanic gestures to a partitioned office in the back
as hub heads toward it he checks out the other workers a teenager doing a compression check another fixes a tire
tariq is on the phone talking in arabic as hub enters
tariq holds up a finger hold on
hub sits opposite him
how can i help you
youre tariq husseini
do you think you could give him a message
tell him the fbi is after him
put your hands on top of the table
tariq notices that hubs hands are out of sight beneath the table
hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an audible click
tariq mutters a curse in arabic
that wouldnt be a racist epithet now would it
as tariq stands hub crosses behind him kicks out his legs pats him down and cuffs him
the two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun wielding fbi agents and are now rousting the garage workers
where are the others
but before hub can answer an amplified voice is heard
tariq husseini this is the united states army
you are surrounded
hub is as surprised as tariq
you have thirty seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head
one of the agents with the shotgun calls out
do as he says
as hub hustles tariq to his feet the other agents start to hustle the workers out of door when reaches into his overalls
but when the mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls all he is holding is the pin to a grenade
kills both the fbi agents and their prisoners
hub throws tariq to the ground
an automatic weapon opens fire on the army presence
devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity
his order unleashes an overwhelming display of firepower
hub and tariq crawl for cover as windows explode walls are shredded and incendiary tracer rounds mix with solvents and gasoline to start a conflagration
with the vaguely hallucinatory quality of the s
shootout white noise bleeds in and all sound fades out races in from around the corner only to be hit by a rocket propelled grenade fired through the second floor
appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building
as they dive into their attack trajectory crawls dragging tariq toward the doors as of the attack helicopter fires rounds a minute virtually unzipping the warehouse softening it for the
two hydra rockets that reduce it instantly to a huge fireball
watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment
stagger blinded out of the inferno
hub drags a half conscious tariq where they are pounced on by commandos
pacs and tanks ring the stadium
an anti terrorist perimeter has been established concrete obstacles sandbags and razor wire
musco lights cast their pitiless glow
a mob of frightened parents girlfriends and furious fathers
a lawyer for the aclu confronts a young lieutenant
just want to know if my clients name is on the list
sir the list will be updated every twelve hours and posted in the a gaggle of journalists try to force their way in
this pass guarantees
you cant the first fucking amendment
there will be a pool briefing for all accredited journalists at hours
hub shows his id
is allowed to enter into a muffled cry that might or might not have come from someone in pain
his footsteps echo as he walks out to where all young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are milling about
squatting smoking pacing some laughing most looking terrified
all spread across armed guards backlit in the upper tiers
enlisted men passing out blankets and soup
nearby hub sees tina standing quite still finally she is able to speak
my father was put into the camps at manzanar
until the end of the war
now he roots for the dodgers and swears it could never happen again
hub asks for devereaux is directed across the field through an aisle in the wire cages
frank haddad looms out of the shadows
he looks terrible drawn
they got frankie
my kids here someplace frank slow down fighting back tears of rage hes only thirteen for chrissake nearby the allahuh akbar call to evening prayer
ill get him out
they came into my house
my wife told them who i was swallows hard how many times did i put it on the line hub
how many times frank were american citizens twenty years

and took him
out of my own house
its wrong frank
what can i say to you but its
takes his arm now come with me
ive got to find him
besides this is where i belong
takes out his wallet hands over his badge here
im not their sand nigger anymore
hub watches as he he walks away
a muezzin chants the call to evening prayer
frank drops to his knees and joins the rest of the prisoners
has been transformed in a command post
and his name is haddad
his fathers a shiite
were checking him out
check this out pal
his fathers a federal agent for ten years
dont get in my face hubbard
i might decide youre an ethiopian
and youre just stupid enough to think thats an insult
if a mistakes been made well fix it
there is no if
im vouching for this kid
i want him out
and i said we will look into it
you mean like youre looking into me
breaking up my operations
if id known i was going to have to do your job for you i would never have left the army
theres an fbi office in anchorage agent hubbard
fuck with me and youll be learning a hundred and fifty new words for snow
the two men stare at each other
tariq husseini is my prisoner
i want to see him
the prisoner is being interrogated
i want to see him
devereaux just looks at him as we cut to tariq is strapped naked into a folding metal chair
his head lolls on his chest his eyes are dulled
on a nearby table an empty syringe
two mps stand guard
sharon is speaking softly to him in arabic
suddenly tarak spits in her face
she wipes it off as if it is nothing
how long have you been at it
not long enough apparently
how much longer do you think before he gives up the other cells he cant give up the other cells if he doesnt know about them
gestures to sharon what about her briefing
the strategy session she said the cells dont know about each other that they devereaux ignores him
turns to sharon
how long before he breaks
at this rate
the theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell
so what other models do we have no one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain
what about it sharon
works for the israelis
only in conjunction with sleep deprivation
needs at least thirty six hours
hub stares at sharon as the dark side of her professional life is revealed
we dont have thirty six hours
theyre teetering on the edge of the abyss
the neurotransmitters just shut down
palestinian authority is producing good intel using water
hub finally cant take another second
even in theory
are you people insane
the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds how about two men
how about three
how about public executions that might work
youre welcome to wait outside
youve lost men ive lost men
but what youre doing
it doesnt work in belfast
it doesnt work in gaza
and it wont work here
it comes slowly at first then in a rush what if
they dont want their leader back at all
you said yourself we dont even have him
maybe what they really want is that we herd our children into stadiums
put soldiers into our streets
radicalize people who want to think of themselves as americans
bend the law shred the constitution
searches for the kind of words that come so hard to him because if we torture him and lets call it what it is
then the country men like us have sworn to defend
and bled to defend
and died to defend
a deep breath and theyve won
devereaux stares hard at hub
and then to col
hardwick i think we have to soundproof the room before we begin
hub looks at sharon who looks away
escort him out
the two mps lead hub out of the room
lets get this over with
sequence omitted from original script
sharon emerges from the shower room
she is shattered
the blood drained from her face
as if carrying with her all the sin that was committed in the next room
the sound of a gunshot
the door opens and devereaux emerges in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie
he knew nothing
devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor
sequence omitted from original script
glorious alabaster stone floodlit at night
a symbol of all that is good and free and just
hub drives a rental car staring out at the monuments
hub pulls up to a lovely townhouse
parked on the street an unmarked car from the secret service
opens the door wearing a dartmouth lacrosse team t shirt
cmon in were still trying to get the last one down
in the background we hear a three year old crying
tasteful antiques rag rugs and kids toys
the president wants this shit over with
theres only one way to do that
looks at hub let the sheik go
so we do have the sheik
you think our government operates as a single coherent entity
pushed the agenda
carefully of course the president was completely unaware of it
return of serve of course
now we cant just let him go
america has to stand tall in the world yadda yadda yadda
so what we do is
the punch line we let the american justice system do its work
his wife appears holding a squalling baby looking defeated
ill be right up darling
she grits her teeth and goes upstairs
you have kids
sometimes you just want to
what do you mean let the justice system do its work
we dont release him
a judge releases him
youre an fbi man
thats what judges are good at right
off hubs look its not like weve gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion
holding him in isolation
fruit of the poisoned tree remember that one from law school
oh well have a big trial
everybodyll get their rocks off
but the fact is the punch line the sheik will walk
he looks at hub shakes his head
and this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle
he hands hub an accordion file
documentary evidence of devereauxs whole operation
because youll know what to do with it
hub looks at the file in his hands
and what about her
you know who
how much is she complicit in all this
hub looks up
sharon emerges from the hallway
sequence omitted from original script
hub and sharon sit in silence in hubs rental car i ran an iraqi network for two years
samir recruited them from among the sheiks followers
i trained them in the north
then we played them back into baghdad two three at a time hiding them in the mosques
her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over
it was gonna be beautiful
looks away and then there was a policy shift she thought telling the story would be easy but theres an enormous well of untapped feeling
she fights it back the new doctrine was iran will be too powerful if iraq falls apart
her voice trembles and its not like
we sold them out
and i wasnt allowed to tell them what was coming down
i was ordered not to tell them
fighting back tears and they got slaughtered
she turns away
youve got to understand these people
to us theyre just words
but to them
its very beautiful actually
and when you look at their lives the heartbreak
and what do we do
we think aha we can take advantage of that
losing it so i quit
i came home
i just cant
she doesnt want to reveal herself this way
doesnt want to be vulnerable
doesnt want to cling to him
for a moment he puts his arms around her but its like holding a beautiful dangerous predator
but first you helped them
she senses the hardness in his tone
looks up at him and through tears puts her game face back on
what do you mean
they were being slaughtered
they needed to get out
but they were on the watch list
so you got them visas
you and samir
i promised we would take care of them
they were working
doing what exactly
i dont know what you mean
you said you trained them
thats what you said right
she nods only you left something out didnt you
didnt you sharon
she cant bring herself to look at him you taught them how to make bombs
the tears are streaming down her face now
finally she nods
and now theyre here doing what you taught em
the streetlight catches sharons face
her eyes are haunted
and im going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life
the people of brooklyn will not be held hostage
this afternoon join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass arrests sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
handing out leaflets march on city hall
hub and frank are standing outside hubs car each on opposite sides blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening within
sharon sits inside with samir
she uses a scalpel to make the slightest incision under samirs arm
the radio plays
in case you decide to go on walkabout
into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic transmitter
how did you make contact
he is afghani
he got word to my uncle at the bath house
you never met him
but youre sure hell show up
trembling sharon they are all dead but the last cell and they are crazy with fear
just tell me the message and i will pass it on
i need to deliver it in person
believe me theyll want to hear what i have to say
she turns off the radio
hub and frank glance inconspicuously around
you watch the game
on a piece of paper he has scribbled hit hardwick
nods yes then kannell was really on
hub then writes
nods again think theyll make the play offs
hub looks at him
theres been little time for sentiment
hows your boy
thanks for getting him out
sharon steps out of the car
in her hands is a device resembling a portable oscilloscope
a green dot appears
looks in at samir green is about right
he slips sharon the scribbled notes
as she looks at them hes terrified
then again so am i
you sure hell go through with it
if he doesnt he knows ill give him to devereaux
she mouths they out there
hub nods hows it feel to be on the other end of it
i like watching better
this is the endgame you understand that
if this goes wrong nothings going wrong
were the cia something always goes wrong
the car door opens and samir steps out buttoning his shirt
i dont suppose theres any way you would trust me to do this on my own
off his look i thought not
well in case it gets hairy remember
the most committed wins
hub watches as she and samir walk away
i trust her about as far as i can throw her
they hurry through the park
samir is extremely agitated eyes constantly darting from right to left
this is not the way to the bath house
you said to get a key from my uncle so that we shhhhhh
if youd stop whining youd feel the surveillance
colonel hardwick earphones on overhearing them wait for the light to turn yellow and then cross against the traffic
hardwicks computer a grid map of brooklyn
north on ditmas avenue
sound gardens ready
on a nearby rooftop an army spotter uses a parabolic with a gunsight
another mic is in a womans shopping bag another is in a twenty year olds boom box
trembling sharon please i beg you
do not make me do this
if they even dream we are being followed they will kill us
the light turns red they race across a crowded street
where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonights meal
nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet
sharon enters and turns on the tv
takes out a pocket knife raise your arm
what are you doing
she cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out the transponder
they cannot even dream we are being followed isnt that what you said
sharon very deliberately wipes her bloody hands on the white on tv we see the marchers in front of brooklyn borough hall
that we will not be made afraid to walk free in this great city
i say march across the bridge and into the stadium
demand the release of samir is staring at the tv
it is all so
with rising dread theyre going to hit the march
arab and jew side by side
black and white christian and muslim they appear as spectral images on hardwicks microwave screen
can you imagine a better target
into his handset get me devereaux
the crowd is getting fired up as the speaker exhorts them
soldiers watch uneasily not certain how to respond as the crowd begins to chant no fear
sequence omitted from original script
sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes
she turns off the tv
put this on
we dont want our friends sweating too much while they wait
hardwick speaks into a handset
theyre getting ready to move
units and on my signal seem to materialize out of nowhere boxing them in
what the undercover federal agents roust army cid agents
an fbi agent with a deep drawl spread eagles one against a building hi there im new in town
can you direct me to carnegie hall or should i just go fuck myself the nypd under the command of danny sussman roll up the rest of the sound garden
examine the parabolic microphones
blow off the rear door of the surveillance van
frank enters and looks around at all the high tech microwave technology
in chadors faces veiled descend a back staircase
only as their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim bulb do we recognize sharon and samir
sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal the hidden courtyard of a neighboring building
she and samir hurry through a back alley and out into an adjacent street
where several apcs suddenly roar up and block off the square
devereaux stands nearby watching as though a bullhorn this is an unlawful gathering
you must disperse
i repeat soldiers in full riot gear emerge to form a battle line images of selma chicago los angeles
arab clerics and hassidic rabbis black civic leaders and hispanic gang members all continue to chant no fear
nervously look at one another as the marchers begin to move
through a bullhorn these soldiers carry live ammunition
this is your final warning
devereaux watches in dread as the marchers close the gap on the battle line of anxious soldiers is this why he became a soldier
a young girl unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier
looks into his eyes
and walks past
another marcher walks right past a soldier who does nothing to stop her
soon they are all surging past the riot line
devereaux watches as something is revealed to him something about america that until this moment he had forgotten
frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at christmas
but something is wrong
where once there were two ghostly images of samir and sharon in the apartment now there is nothing
the radio signal of samirs transmitter still registers as an unmoving steadily blinking light
hub is watching the building
frank steps out the van his face pale
weve got a problem
pound up the stairs of the building
hub comes in low and fast
frank comes in hard on his heels
in the center of the otherwise empty room the white sheet smeared in blood is draped over a chair
what the hub stares in dread fascination
its a shroud
and hes out the door in a heartbeat
sequence omitted from original script
frank and hub listen to a playback of sharons conversation with samir on the digital recorders
sweating too much while they wait
frank looks up at hub
first she turns off the tv then she says it
she knew we were listening
it hits them both at the same time
sequence omitted from original script
hub and frank hit the street at a dead run
samir opens a padlocked door with a key
he and sharon disappear within
an arab bath house
rays of sunlight play off the steaming waters
their footsteps echo off the tiled mosaic walls
sequence omitted from original script
samir kneels to touch the steaming water
how soon are they coming
theyll be here
he starts taking off his clothes
what are you doing
he finishes disrobing
he steps into the bath
with a sponge he washes his body
what message do you have for them sharon
ill tell them when theyre here
the distant sound of the approaching march echoes off the tiled walls as samir steps out of the purifying waters and takes a towel from a hamper
nobody else is coming is there
from the hamper he takes a sig sauer
youre the last cell
there will never be a last cell
racks the slide of the
you should listen to the young men in that stadium
it is just beginning
sharon watches in dread fascination as he takes a white egyptian cotton funeral shroud and drops it over his head
are streaming down the street
hub and frank desperately fight their way through a wild almost carnival feel
reflected in the purifying waters samir is putting civilian clothes on over the shroud still holding the
how could i have missed the play a forgiving gesture it was the money
you believe money is power
belief is power
just tell me we didnt finance your operation
a sad smile the world is a wheel
what message do you have for me sharon
theyre going to release him
when will he be free
a few months at most
first they have to bring him to trial but he turns away from her opening the hamper
not looking at her no
thats what you want isnt it
why youve done all this comes next
velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest
he comes to stand beside her
i want you to bleed
as we have bled
samir the koran preaches do not speak to me of the koran woman
fighting his emotion you take our leader
a holy man
you put him in prison for preaching the word of god
you must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live
with rising terror but its over your points been made why spill any more blood
those poor people out there in the street theyre fucking marching for your cause
fastens the last strap on his semtex harness and they too will become its martyrs
a voice from the top of the stairs let her go and youll live
samir looks up sees hub aiming his
but sharon is between them blocking his shot
from outside we hear the sound of the marchers chanting no fear
samir hears it too
move away from the door
let her go and youll live screaming panicked theyre all screaming at once
still samir keeps inching toward the stairs
hub blocks the way
no way youre going out there
samir jams the gun into sharons ribs
sharons eyes meet hubs
samir is edging ever closer
starting up the stairs
sharons eyes plead with hub begging for a kind of unholy redemption
weeping now you
hubs finger tightens on the trigger
but then slowly almost imperceptibly at first he lowers his gun
it is gods will
his left hand moves imperceptibly toward the ripcord of the explosive device
if there is a god he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name
rips through sharon into samir blowing them both backwards
is to samirs hand as it reaches for the ripcord
is a killing headshot
rolling him into the baths
blooms in the cleansing water
the funeral shroud billows
still rings in the tiled room as hub kneels beside sharon
on radio officer down
hub cradles her head
the saddest smile i
appears at the top of the steps
behind him two paramedics race down to kneel beside sharon
hub is pushed aside as they begin triage but it doesnt look good as suddenly she begins to convulse
and then she begins to mumble at first incoherently and then more clearly
we realize shes speaking arabic
what are you
and then frank is standing above them
tears in his eyes
king of kings
and hub suddenly understands she is preparing for her own death
he holds her as she continues to pray in and out of her two native tongues
until at last whispers allah ahkbar
god is great allah ahkbar amen
and shes gone
a block away we can see the marchers pass by
the chant of no fear
fades into the distance
but hub has already turned his back and is hurrying away
hub hurries toward the courthouse
judge frankel opens the door
he is taken aback by the blood on hubs clothes
i want to talk about a free society
where devereaux is watching coverage of the march
a very moving moment in which the people of a city step forward to declare their courage and solidarity he looks up to see hub
hes carrying the accordion file that the chief of staff gave him
agent hubbard do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining colonel hardwick and six of my cid staff
because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison
the last cell has been taken down
it was samir
i took him out
what makes you so sure he was the last cell
sharon is not trustworthy
sharon is dead
she gave her life
takes a piece of paper from his pocket this is a writ from the us district court releasing all those being held here without habeus corpus
my authority supersedes the civilian judiciary under the decree of martial law
a rueful smile sorry
your authority ends now
its all over
looks at him theyre going to release him
holds up the chief of staffs file clear violation of international law congressional oversight statutes a couple of treaties the federal perjury statute and my favorite the logan act for
conducting your own personal foreign policy
simply i know the whole story general
you dont know shit
poor suffering sharon and her poor suffering people
its called going native the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it
she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it
and now theyre getting exactly what they want which is the sheik will be back in the mix
but ten times as strong because now hes the big man who stood up to the americans
looks at hub i did what was necessary
i make no apologies
if you think youre going to be able to use that file against me you know even less about politics than i imagined
im not in politics
you can have this back
i wont use it
hub hands him the file
devereaux takes it
because you dont have the balls
off hubs look did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude
you serve your country
dismissively is there anything else
hub would love to just
instead i said i wasnt in politics
im in law enforcement
he takes his gun from its shoulder holster
william devereaux you are under arrest for the torture and murder of tariq husseini under color of authority united states code title chapter subchapter sections
takes out his gun surrender your weapon
behind them a commotion as frank and several agents force their way into the room followed by reporters who shout questions as strobes and videotape record the arrest
an nypd car devereaux within pulls away lights flashing
emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers the tearful smiles of their wives and children
hub and frank stand there watching the reunions
after a moment did we win or did we lose
hub has no answer
no one has the answer
