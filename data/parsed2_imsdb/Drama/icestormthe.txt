b if window
href b b the ice storm by james schamus
based on the novel by rick moody
first draft revised january suburban connecticut outside of new york city
the still after a terrible storm
trees dripping their branches torn the air warming just before the break of a new day
the train lies dark and motionless a few flashing yellow emergency lights up front as a work crew removes debris from the track
various passengers huddled uncomfortably cold asleep
on paul hood and a half stoner preppie look hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light
he reads his fantastic four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign
suddenly the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the trains engines returns
the conductor enters the car blasting forth in his classic nasal voice
good morning ladies and gentlemen he sounds like a baseball announcer
mumbling ad lib what ladies
this train originating at new yorks grand central station is back in service next stop will be new canaan connecticut
new canaan connecticut next stop
he moves on to the next car
the train begins to move
paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still dark early morning
he looks back down at his comic book
on the comic book reed richards also known as stretch has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that annihilus has implanted in
the thing medusa flame and richards wife sue storm look on stunned
paul looks up again thinking
in issue number of the fantastic four published in november reed richards has to use his anti matter weapon on his own son who annihilus has turned into a human
his son is the result of richards coupling with the earthling sue storm and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused richards and the rest of the fantastic
four on their aborted moon mission have made young franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti matter
the train moves slowly through a suburban semi forested landscape
and thats what it is to come from a family if you analyze it closely
each of them is negative matter for the other ones
and thats what dying is dying is when your family which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge its when the family takes you back thus
hurling you back into negative space
on paul as the sun breaks over the horizon
his face glows warmly in the yellow light
he looks down idly at the comic book
so its a paradox the closer youre drawn back in the further into the void youre thrown
the train slowly pulls in
the train doors open and paul weary from the long night emerges
he sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform ben a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks elena distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater and wendy a sullen suburban lolita
he pauses regarding them
they stand silent even dignified awaiting him
a typical new england prep school
cramped a mess but quaint
paul shares the room with francis davenport iv a dissolute smart ass son of money
pauls alarm clock rings
he slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis loose tie shirt with one tail untucked in
across the room francis beckons from his desk as he finishes loading up a four foot high bong
arise and shine young hood
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night
finishing a hit the water as you call it is a special mixture of amaretto and ben ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our
precious thai stick
paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit
he coughs spewing uninhaled smoke
waste not master hood that was for the bag
gathering books papers almost talking to himself man francis you are one drug addled elitist freak and when the revolution comes i do not want to be lined up with
you and shot cause youre fucking ripe for political reeducation you know like in the fields
paul cancel your mental appointments baby
what are you like still stoned from last night
spraying some chloroform mouth spray i gotta get to english class
an english class in progress
paul hood sits blankly hardly listening until he hears the teacher call out
what dostoyevsky is saying here is that to be a christian is to choose because you have to choose of your own choice but since you cant choose to be
good because that would be too rational you have to choose to be bad its existential
thank you libbets thats a very compelling summary but paul looks at her smitten
marge pauls friend notices his look
as class lets out paul accosts libbets
hey dostoyevsky im also really a fan and what you were saying you know have you ever read the idiot
if you liked notes from underground youll love the idiot
turning to go great thanks for the tip
after her the idiot
paul walks with marge
im in love with libbets casey
yeah well youve been in love with like every other girl here i was wondering when youd get around to libbets
its beyond mere physical attraction
thats good because i dont think libbets is capable of the sex act
my diagnosis is messed in the head
a poor little rich girl i mean check out the jeans and fur look
and lend your ears to this brutality
like her mom and step dad and her step sisters are going to switzerland to ski over thanksgiving break and like they didnt invite her
how do you know this shit
they did it last year too
its like traditional or something
theyve got this humongoid park ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash
beat arent the hugely wealthy sad
pause you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in why dont you just keep your libbets thing a secret from him
good thinking marge
paul francis and friends enter the dark crowded room
various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm style undanceable rock jethro tull etc
francis hands paul the tail end of a joint but paul waves it away
no more man
im about to drop as it is
where you going
paul let me enlighten you about something
you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on
im off to get laid
flame on asshole
and remember with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex because you drone on like a
motherfucker when youre stoned
he waves his fingers toward pauls eyes in the classic stoned gesture then wanders off
paul looks on at the gathering
marge waves to him from the dance floor
paul wanders stoned through the party
he sees libbets from across the room
she seems to be surrounded by friends
paul has cornered libbets and is talking over the music
there are just a few people left most of them making out with each other
stoned because ive been reading kerouac and ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever and of course with all kinds of people but when
you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives and uh these guys didnt bathe much i mean they were really filthy with like genital crabs lice exceptionally strong body odor
libbets smiles through her yawn
paul sits alone on the bench freezing cold eating a donut
some kids from across the lawn yell good night to him
paul is at his desk
francis enters wrapped in a towel fresh from the shower
how can you do that man
sleep all day
i mean look its already getting dark outside and youre just getting up
beat um libbets casey
i could sense the vibe
what do you mean
am i right or am i right
youre not planning my man i speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid
ive been giving this one a lot of thought and i believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that a knock at the door
paul rolls off his bed opens the door
dont mess with libbets
i mean it
paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall
its a modern shag carpet geometric patterned wallpaper etc
ben hood talks on the phone a drink in his hand
in the background we can see wendy watching richard nixon on hi dad
things ok up there
you all right
im fine dad
youll be on the wednesday afternoon
well dad actually i thought id take the morning train on thanksgiving got a lot of studying papers you know lab experiments lab experiments
right smart guy paul you know your mothers gonna be disappointed not to see more of you in fact let me make this more than a simple request guy i
think you should
on tv from san clemente press conference well with regard to the questions as to why americans feel we were wrong to make the tapes that is not particularly surprising
i think that most americans do not like the idea of taping conversations and frankly it is not something that particularly appeals to me
hold on for a second
turning wendy you want to say hi to your brother
she gets up sullenly and goes to the phone
have you been keeping out of my shit
have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room
i have not touched your sh looks at father stuff
you watching this
he should be shot
overhearing hey thats the president of the goddam united states youre talking about wendy
from the kitchen elena overhears
shes dressed to go out but in the process of making a kraft macaroni and cheese dinner for wendy
hes a liar
still talking more to her father than into the phone dean told him on march st about kalmback and hunt all about the payoffs to the watergate burglars so you
tell me where the so called dean report is but you cant because it doesnt exist because he lied about haldeman and erlichman and the april tape thats why
ben retreats going to the wet bar to pour another drink
muttering ok ok the defense rests
to elena in the kitchen want another
no thank you
we should be off
he puts the bottle back down without pouring
on the phone hey charles
charles calm down i wasnt in on it
elena putting on her coat comes into the den and gives wendy a kiss on the forehead as wendy mumbles her good byes to paul on the phone
dinners on the counter
well be at the williamss you know the number
takes the phone from wendy paul
is there anything youll want any particular kind of food or snack or anything we can stock up on
youre all right
see you next week
i love you
back to nixon on the tv
we must recognize that one excess begets another and that the extremes of violence in the s contributed to the extremes of watergate
on wendy as she regards the tv hearing her parents farewells as they leave through the front door
a large new england colonial with a few modern additions and touches
we hear the sound of dinner chatter
the kitchen door swings open into the dining room and mikey and sandy williams emerge each holding platters of food
mikey and a half lost in space and sandy a sullen and barely pubescent boy each have towels draped over their forearms they are the evenings waiters
they move unsteadily to the table at which sit their parents janey a hard edged sharp witted beauty and jim large and a bit goofy a genius inventor together with
their guests ben and elena hood and neighbors dorothy and ted franklin
we jump cut through the evenings conversations seen mostly from the furtive povs of the boys
his brother came back from where
are we going to talk about this about
you should hear
its very sad he was janey is whispering something into mikeys ear who returns to the kitchen
it was a benefit for the aclu or something and harry reems himself was there the man with the from deep throat
the very one something about a first amendment defense fund well i believe in it ted took me to see it
ted how romantic
i have to say the movie didnt do much for me
but being in that theater surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts there was something in the air that the boys are pouring wine
pulls right up to the pump jumps out like theres no gas shortage oblivious and by this point everybody in lines piling out of their cars ready to kill the
guy when they notice its that reverend edwards the unitarian
the new one
yeah claims he pulled off creek road and didnt notice the line going back mill street for half a mile
hes either got his head in the clouds or up his i hear hes slept with half the women in his congregation lucky bastard
as this is said mikey accidentally spills some wine on ben
i mean no problemo there mikey
here i janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of bens pants
is there a just barely noticeable frisson between ben and janey as she removes the napkin
if there is elena doesnt or pretends not to notice
the boys now in pajamas sandys with padded feet mikeys a combination of t shirt and pj bottoms are bringing out coffee and dessert
the adults eye mikeys handling of the coffee pot with some nervousness
unconvincing so fascinating
do you get free tickets to the movies that kind of thing
no my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money
its dont be so modest ben
its a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends
you were the first to predict that billy jack would be a hit with a bit too much conviction and as usual no one believed me
the dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks
elena remains behind to help janey pick up the table
she stacks a plate on top of another
its not a bother
beat dont touch them
elena realizes that theres an edge to janeys voice
realizing shes gone too far its really quite all right
the party progresses
mikey and sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs out of sight
and to think they met at a key party of all things
a key party
you know its a california thing
that scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in l
you know the men put their car keys in a bowl and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home
with whoevers keys theyve got
anyhow thats how she met this rod person or whatever his name is and hes left his wife and shes packing for california
irwin is devastated
its so ironic
caught out well um yes
his name is rod
the guests are leaving
the men shake hands the women kiss and the men and women awkwardly peck each others cheeks
thank you janey
it was lovely
hey jim next time youve got to fill me in on whatever it is youre up to these days
at the top of the stairs a rather dejected sandy and mikey finish spying on the leave takings below
mikey nudges sandy and they silently head back the upstairs hall
they enter mikes room the door has a nuclear waste positively no admittance sign on it
as mikey reaches his bed he doubles over groaning and starts to make retching noises
he then throws himself onto the bed his head leaning over the far side
sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed
taken aback for a moment he then reaches forward and picks it up its fake plastic vomit
he throws it on top of mikes back but mikey doesnt take notice
pause looking sullenly at mikes back is wendy hood your girlfriend
not looking up but alarmed who said so
i dont have a girlfriend
mikey returns to his reading a copy of the sensuous woman obviously well pawed over
he absentmindedly picks his nose
as he flips the pages a beautiful almost electrical humming sound begins to fill his ears
he frowns and pauses to listen to it
sandy who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane obviously doesnt hear it
mikey focuses on the plane as sandy waves it through the air
perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky
there is a large poster of a cartoon version of richard nixon tricky dick on her wall
wendy is on the phone to her friend beth
he knows that when the march th tape you know with dean where dean tells him that theres a cancer growing on the presidency she pauses as beth asks a
hes like a big infected whitehead wearing jeans
i wouldnt she hears the downstairs door open
whispering shit its my parents
she turns her light out
ben and elena walking past wendys room to their bedroom
youd think shed learn how to cook a chicken eh
my drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there
im probably going to get whatever that disease and jim how that guy ever became a millionaire he pauses before a hall table and with his eyes traces the telephone
cord under wendys room
i knew shed still be up
watch this but elena simply continues into the master bedroom
he starts to pull gently on the cord
and continues pulling
no response for a few seconds
then yelling behind her door dad stop it
get to sleep young lady and i mean it
wendy opens the door to her room
if i were a fascist i would have sent you to one of those southern military academies a long time ago
now get to bed
she slams the door
he opens it
ben enters the room angry
wendy jumps into bed and under the covers pulling them up over her head
he stands over her looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket
softening hey kiddo
sleep well huh
he places his hand where her cheek should be and caresses the sheet
without pulling the sheet down but nicely good night dad
good night kiddo
ben turns to the door where he sees a silent elena standing in her nightgown a slight smile on her face
elena is sitting cross legged eyes closed on her side of the bed
we hear the toilet flush from the master bath and see ben emerge in his boxers
he pauses in front of the bed looking at elena
without opening her eyes youre staring at me
i wasnt star ive been thinking ben about wendy
i was going to ask if shed come with me sometime to meet dr
that shrink the one you always wanted me to see
i thought you dropped him
i did but somebody should probably see her talk to her
you think shes ok
why shouldnt she be
elena just gives him a look more sad than angry
pause then again why should she be
i mean with us with our
so maybe youll come too
oh not again elena
if weve got problems why cant you just come out and talk about them
its you ben who needs to talk
ive had my say and im waiting to hear back from you
yeah but elena even you dont believe all that im ok
youre ok stuff you keep babbling about you say so yourself
ive been all ears for about ten years now on his subject and and you havent moved out yet
its because youre too lazy ben
too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision elena
sighing sleep in the study
ben picks up a pillow and walks out pausing wistfully at the door
wendy hears her parents door close and sees a strip of light illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on then off
a nondescript cleanly modern building
engraved on the doors shackley and schwimmer securities brokerage established ben seated is finishing a brief presentation to a small group of men which includes george clair mid thirties unctuously
but what exactly is stagflation this mixture of inflation and stagnation and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it
well and i hope im not out of bounds here think of the money supply as a large male organ continuously inflating and yet the societal vaginal cavity simply wants
as the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues the money organ may seem to be in demand but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted
this is why i suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns we at the same time fantasize so to speak of the safe harbor of
the aging boss nods agreement
more or less mumbling brilliant brilliant
george clair just grins
ben is gathering papers readying to leave
he looks up to see george clair in his doorway
hey there benjie youre becoming quite the in house philosopher
when do you have time to think up all that stuff shackley sure eats it up
as we see that clair is deftly fondling hoods attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office
she looks up coyly at clair hidden for the moment from bens view
ben comes out of his office pulling his coat on
clair and the secretary pull back but its clear that ben has some sense of whats transpiring between them
george im just trying to get a global view of things cant just look at the small picture
theres an obvious rivalry between the two of them
and speaking of which you have those market share charts mr
shackley was asking about
gotcha george not a problem
hey you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself
ben you know thats your territory and i wouldnt dream to trespass youre the expert
hey how do you think paramounts gonna do with that blatty novel whats it called
overpriced bomb cost over million no stars and no ones into the horror genre these days anyway
im advising the company recommend reducing positions there
its disaster films that are gonna stay at the top
hey you heading out a little early today
got a meeting uptown
already moving off right o
up the organization
then to himself bastard
the secretary pretends not to hear
an august new york institution
a stuffy ivy league atmosphere
a decades old tradition of serving overcooked american food
ben is seated across from his father harold hood a retired curmudgeon
there is a walker parked by harolds chair
waylaying a passing waiter id asked for that double martini about three hours ago
coming right up sir
so asking me out for lunch what prompted this exceptional event
of course im paying
we dont have to always go to your club dad
and why are you still calling me dad
youre forty years old already and well what am i supposed to call you
thats besides the point
the martini arrives along with bens beer
i was actually trying to see about getting a little advice you know advice
im supposed to be getting the stock tips from you ben
unless have you quit your job
they fired you
you know dah he looks up and sees his father slurping his martini not paying attention
actually its not about work its advice about oh for crying out loud ben you dont mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now well
elena and i have kind of been talking not really talking but your mother god bless her stood by me for forty two years we never once contemplated divorce i assume youre talking here about divorce
the very thought but dad you guys truly hated each other i mean really hated each waiter
wheres my cobb salad
back to ben you want advice ben
if your big brother were still alive id have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head
look kid you married that woman against my advice what advice
you never thats besides the point
the point is if id had any sense in me id have divorced your mother years ago and thats the truth and here it is and divorce is as easy
as paying off a traffic ticket and for crying out loud ben be a man and just get it over with
i would have if id had the chance
ben ponders as the food arrives
but i well maybe i love her
his father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork
make up your mind and eat your lunch
elena browses the self help section
a longish haired slightly gone to seed but still handsome clergyman pauses next to her
hes wearing an ecclesiastical collar and bell bottoms
he pulls out a copy of me myself and i glancing again at elena
elena hood am i right
you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year
yes it was i ended up smiling no need to make excuses a cool gray afternoon
a group of boys are playing flag football on the field while two groups of girls are gathered underneath the bleachers at either end warily smoking c garettes
wendy beth and a couple of other girls are gathered in one group
referring to one of the girls gathered in the other group she said you licked dave brewsters weenie in the third floor bathroom
shes a liar
i wouldnt touch dave brewsters dick if you paid me
its probably crawling with v
after he put it in her which he did
the conversation peters out at this point as the two groups of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar
wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the field where the boys are playing
a group of boys break from a huddle mikey among them
the quarterback takes the hike and mikey runs out for a pass
as he runs his breathing increases in volume filling his ears and transforming into the humming sound hed heard before
the quarterback spots him and throws a long one
he runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound
the ball drops next to him as he continues in a world of his own to run
suddenly the humming ends and he stops and turns around to see all the other kids just standing there looking at him
one of them makes a pot smoking gesture as if thats the explanation
as he returns to the group ball in hand did anybody hear that
the other kids snicker
wendy looks on and catches mikeys eye for a fleeting moment
i gotta go
she takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off
elena and philip are seated at a booth
its been a tremendously transformative year maybe a little controversial of course but were breaking down the old unitarian barriers i suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it
ive never been much of a joiner although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person well i of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion at times its the disorganization thats liberating and of course ive begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments in small groups and one on one couples elena looks outside the window and sees wendy speed past on her bicycle
cutting him off my daughter
i havent been on a bike for years
still not really looking at him when was the last time you rode a bike
a bit taken aback by the abrupt topic change they say you never forget
jarred back to his presence forget what
forget how to ride a bike
no of course you dont youre right
wendy pulls her bike up to the back locks it and walks in
wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the aisles arriving at the candy selection
she looks around
she takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the oversized pockets of her painters pants
she turns around and her breath goes out of her an old woman has been watching her shoplift
the woman looks sadly at her but says nothing
wendy slowly walks past her and out the back door of the store
the woman looks on
as she walks her bike onto the sidewalk wendy comes across sandy
mikey was looking for you
she pushes off on her bike
sandy gazes after her
he takes his g
joe out of his coat pocket and points it at her
wendy flies along on her bike
its a desolately beautiful fall day
wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the private psychiatric clinic
a security guard leans against a booth
once a bit past the gate she gets off her bike and walks it into a grove of trees near the front drive
mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as wendy arrives
want some gum
pulling them out of her pocket twinkie
opens his mouth displaying the gum on his tongue im chewing
she puts the twinkies back and pops the gum in her mouth
they stand together chewing
after a pause did you tell sandy
wendy doesnt say anything
you didnt tell him either did you
the wind is picking up and the light is fading
mikey and wendy climb the fence around the pool which is empty and half covered in dead leaves and twigs
they climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the deep end leaning against the far wall of the pool
they each matter of factly take their gum out and put it behind their ears
they begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in each others mouths
we see them from high above the pool as the dead leaves swirl lightly around them mikey groping under wendys poncho
a couple are in the final throes of lovemaking
we see janey williamss face more or less enjoying the proceedings
the man gives a final heave and groan and rolls off to reveal himself to be ben hood
janey smokes a cigarette
ben is babbling
we were golfing and you know golfing to me is something im supposed to enjoy and i was on the goddam golf team in college so its something one would
assume i do well i used to do well but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing or plowing
janey smiles briefly at this
its like farming
i am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks and george clair has obviously in the mere two years since he joined the firm he
has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro and i assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course
and the guy talks incessantly throughout the entirety of the miserable holes on topics that are the supposed domain of my department ben yeah
gently youre boring me
i have a husband
i dont particularly feel the need for another
you have a point there
thats a very good point
were having an affair
an explicitly sexual relationship
youre absolutely right
you should probably get dressed
the boys will be home soon
she wraps a blanket around herself and gets up
ben cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side gate
wendy enters the house as elena is finishing supper preparations
without waiting for instructions wendy starts pulling out plates and silverware and setting the table
i saw you on your bike today
we were just riding around
elena takes this in
well you looked very free when i saw you
wendy continues setting the table
weightless almost as if i were seeing my own memories of being a girl
there was something internal about it
are you ok
wendy of course
you must think im ripe to be checked into silver meadows
youre not a psycho
the people at silver meadows arent psychos
theyre rich drug addicts and celebrities
when i saw james taylor there and weve been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston
well i saw what i saw and if you dont want to believe me oh wendy
they need the money for my band uniform at school
i thought you quit the band i never hear you practice anymore
i dont really need to practice
i just play a few notes you know so i thought maybe id stay in
well im sure your father and i would love to hear what youre playing these days
maybe after dinner
ben and elena take their seats on the sofa
wendy stands before them holding an enormous trombone with a music stand and sheet music in front of her
she puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz time
when shes done she looks up from the sheet music to her parents
cant wait to see how it fits in with all the other instruments
elena gives him a look
elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the kitchen table
ben comes in and fills a glass with ice
the halfords have invited us again this year
you want to go
what do you think
well it is a neighborhood tradition
he comes up behind her looks down at the checkbook
im uh going to bed
he leans over and kisses her on the cheek
is that a new aftershave
he recoils a bit
musk or something
you like it
he walks uncertainly from the room
does she suspect
mikey is painfully at work writing an english essay
sandy comes to the door with a geometry textbook
sure anything but this english
sandy puts the open textbook in front of him
why are you so good at math but not in english
im not good at math
he looks at the book
drawing out his examples on a piece of paper its like you know when they say two squared
and you think it means times equals
but really they really mean a square
a square with a side of two
and the area of the square is four
like every time you use the word like squared or cubed its really space its not numbers its space
and its perfect space but only in your head because you cant draw a perfect square like in the material world but in your mind you can have perfect space
pause you know
as mikey goes on we see his geometric doodles and hear faintly the humming sound under his voice
but i just need some help with my homework
a knock at the door
jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand
hey guys im back
honestly confused you were gone
sandy looks at mikey as if pondering a lost cause
a look of disappointment yeah mikey
yep i was in houston working on some great new ideas about silicon which comes from sand very conductive
how you guys doing
mikeys still flustered
uh i dunno
ok i guess
he walks off
you really didnt notice
man hes been gone for three days
janey is reading still dressed on the bed
she nods to jim as he enters with his suitcase
he nods and puts his suitcase down then sits heavily on the side of the bed
as he sits you bet
it turns out its a water bed and his weight creates a wave that nearly pushes janey off her edge of the bed
jumping up which only creates another wave sorry honey
hell weve got to trade this thing in for a normal bed
just be careful
as he begins to unpack you notice anything with mikey lately
the kid seemed a little out of it tonight eh
jim hes been out of it since he was born
hell i guess he takes after me huh
he laughs to himself
she gives him a look
elena and philip edwards are having coffee again
in many ways the church bound tradition of the father son and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent child adult triad within us all
its a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology
youre saying that christ is the child and and god the angry parent and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self
all well and good but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in
you ask what the point is
ministering to help people reach their fullest potential
would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self realization
i would say it sounds like youre trying to get me into bed
if thats a potential you see yourself fulfilling
flustered my i sound a bit im sorry
that was stupid of me
i didnt mean to be so rude
you actually for some reason you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself
but not too ashamed
smiling now you are being rude
and youre still trying to get me into bed
just then dorothy franklin passes by their table a smirk firmly implanted on her face
hello you two
am i barging in on some kind of religious study group
elena you look marvelous
will i see you and ben at the halfords
i suppose well make an appearance
and reverend edwards
did you make the list
laughing i believe so mrs
with the two of you there it will be positively a revival
she scurries out of the coffee shop
im afraid shes something of a gossip isnt she
gathering her things to go im afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about
getting up take care
that i will indeed
mikey is reading his english paper before the class
because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies
like when you smell things because when you smell a smell its not really a smell its a part of the object that has come off of it molecules
so when you smell something bad its like in a way youre eating it
this is why you should not really smell things in the same way that you dont eat everything in the world around you because as a smell it gets inside
so the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating
an embarrassed silence
the new canaan high school band is doing a wind version of a popular rock tune
in front theres wendy in halter top and hip hugging bell bottoms incongruously blowing away on her trombone this being her one stab at extracurricular activities
in the flute section directly behind her is sandy piping away on a tiny piccolo
he sits on a riser slightly elevated above her
he directs downward at wendy a protracted regard a look of intense concentration on his face
wendys backside her pants pushed outward in the back affording sandy a libido charged view of the top of her bum crack
push in on a close up of this cherished abstract landscape then back to sandys furrowed face
ben and harold are at their table again
lunch is being cleared
its not the taxes i object to
its all the fines and penalties
but you sold the house you didnt tell anyone including the irs and id of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff it was all junk
ben decides not to pursue an overworked topic
elena wanted to know when we could expect you on thanksgiving
its just going to be you this year
ben im going to florida
i hate thanksgiving and i hate the cold
i have a new nurse
shes a negro she weighs three hundred pounds and ive decided to leave my entire estate to her
ben spits his drink out
jesus benjamin youre still as gullible as ever
that was a joke
you dont tell jokes
i thought id start trying
if you dont mind
but i am going to florida and i do have a new nurse
ben sits in the moving train commuting home
he puts down his paper to look at this fellow passengers
note he is in the same seat as was paul at the beginning of the film
elena sits in a yoga pose
elena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light on
she finds an old bicycle and pulls it out
elena rides her bike into town infused with the girlish sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter
suddenly theres a pop a tire is blown out
she slows down and gets off the bike
as she bends to look at the wheel a station wagon slows near her
the drivers side window rolls open
its janey williams
need a lift
elena sits in the passenger seat
the two women are obviously uncomfortable with each other
for the dinner
thanks for eating it
i dont know why i even pretend i can cook
i used to know how to cook
its not like were too busy
they smile barely
im thinking of going back to school
howd you know
im that predictable
no you dont have to answer that
its just that with the kids almost grown you dont have to apologize
im too much of a cynic
you actually seem to be trying to figure things out dont mind me
she pulls the car over
janeys car pulls to the curb
here you are
opening her door thanks for the lift
if the bikes any bother none at all
ill leave it in front of your garage
elena watches the car pull away
she turns and walks into the store
elena moves through the aisles putting various sundries into a basket
she pauses in front of the lipsticks
she picks up a lipstick looks at it then quietly places it in her pocket
we see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle as she quickly exits the store
the middle aged lady behind the counter watches her leave
in a wide shot from across the street we see elena leave the store followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and taps her on the shoulder
they converse for a minute and elena is accompanied back into the store
through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of her purse
shes obviously distraught offering to pay talking quickly etc
the shopkeeper is holding a telephone not yet decided on whether to call her in
to find yourself in the negative zone as the fantastic four often do means that all everyday assumptions are inverted even the invisible girl herself becomes visible and so she
loses the last semblance of her power
close on images from the fantastic four
paul sits reading on his way home
janey pulls up in the driveway
as she gets out of the car she hears a small explosion from the back of the house
janey comes around the back to discover sandy stuffing a model airplane with m firecrackers
he lights them and runs back a safe distance
the plane explodes its wreckage joining the debris from a few other dolls models and toys
sandy looks up busted
janey marches over to him
you little idiotic prick you could blow yourself fucking sky high with all this demented crap
sandy looks on the verge of tears
she softens and bends down to him
picking up the firecrackers ill take this stuff
you going to tell dad
would it matter
sees something else lying on the ground and whats that
sniffling you know its the whip the one uncle frank got me from mexico
its not packed with explosives is it
going into the house play with the whip
mikey and wendy are in front of the tv watching a rerun of divorce court
mikey have you heard the explosions coming from the backyard
he stares blankly at her do you know what sandys been up to
honestly oblivious as usual i dunno
she pauses then walks into the kitchen
sandy flicks his enormous whip in the direction of a small bush
one by one he snaps off its leaves
janey hauls a turkey out of a bag and into the fridge
mikey and wendy are still in front of the tv
janey comes in again and looks at them
dont you kids have homework
without looking up in unison thanksgiving break
she walks out of the room again
sandy comes in whip in hand looks over at mikey and wendy then walks over to them and without a word slumps down beside them and watches the tv
elena walks unsteadily pausing to rest against a brick wall
she takes a deep breath then walks to a corner where a local taxi station wagon sits idling
she gestures to the driver who beckons her in
later still mentally devolving in front of the tv but with various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different show a rerun of the original highway patrol
sandy wanders off
wendy gets up goes upstairs and wanders down the hall to the bathroom
she gets to the door just as sandy gets there from the opposite direction
sandy hesitantly opens the door as wendy still hovers by it
well you can
hey sandy what were you blowing up out there
your mom was pretty p
all my model planes
the ones you built
they were old
and they couldnt fly anyhow
im going to get a radio controlled airplane at christmas and then ill stuff it full of m s and then fly it into mrs
burgesss english class and blow it up
i have to go to the bathroom
but he stays put unaware it seems that hes blocking the doorway
wendy looks around no one in sight
ill show you mine if you show me yours
sandy goes wide eyed and almost against his will backs into the bathroom like a feather
mikey looks up from the tv wondering where wendy is
he eats another pringle
wendy flips up her dress for sandy
he slowly unzips his hand unsteady
we can tell from the look on wendys face that shes feeling a bit sorry for the little guy
suddenly sandy turns beet red and bursts into tears
what do you want
what do you want
get out of here
the door flips open and janey williams appears
sizing up the situation shit
janey is giving wendy a lecture a persons body is his temple wendy
this body is your first and last possession
now as your own parents have probably told you in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us
thats why in samoa and in other developing nations adolescents are sent out into the woods unarmed and they dont come back until theyve learned a thing or two
wendy is led to the door by mrs
wendy trades a glance with a sullen mikey who sits in the living room pretending to ignore her
wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face
from behind her mikey rides up on his bike and rides alongside her
she doesnt look at him
trying to stay on his bike but moving slowly he wobbles nearly falling off
i dont ever want to see you
then whyd you come after me
the taxi pulls up
elena gets out and pays the driver
ben is in front of the open freezer trying to get something out
he hears elena come in the front door
i need some help here if this things gonna defrost by tomorrow
she comes up and together they tug and pull until they succeced in extracting a large frozen turkey
as they pull it out it slips from their hands and after a dull thump slides along the floor
elena bends over to pick it up
ben observes her
she notices his look
he goes over and picks up the turkey placing it in the sink
he looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look
you all right there
sure i did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce
they stand together his concern and her vulnerability forming an awkward attraction between them
because you like it on your turkey sandwiches
im are you
i think i am
pause you know elena ive been thinking ben maybe no talking right now
if you start talking youre going to she kisses him as if she needed him
ben and elena enter their bedroom
elena closes the door quietly behind her
ben and elena undress shyly
they make love
elenas face is almost fearful
elena and ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon light
ben turns on his side and notices a small tear forming in elenas eyes
im just sad ben i mean it was
you were but you know
i just dont know
gently making light whatever that means elena and you complain about me not communicating
i thought it was no i didnt mean to sound negative
it was but ben
beat what is going to happen with us
have you you have to bring this up now
did i do something here
is that it
is it something i did
i wasnt accusing you ben
its just that weve got to be honest
not just with ourselves but with the children
pause sitting up hell i know
i i guess if you want to accuse me youve got looks at watch oh hell
ive got to pick up paul
i almost forgot
he gets up and starts to get dressed
you were saying
he smells the armpits of the shirt hes putting on
yikes i was hoping to wear this thing to the halfords friday
leave it ill wash it for you
he looks at her ruefully
wendy walks and mikey rides along
you have to follow me
i theyre now in front of the hoods house
ben exits the house in a rush and sees wendy and mikey on the street in front
hey there mikey hows business
tripping off of his bike business
uh i dunno
ben grimaces fiddles for his car keys
as mikey remounts and rides off wendy passes her father on the driveway
im picking up paul at the station want to come
what you been up to
wendy enters the house and climbs the stairs
she sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents room and hears elena in the shower
paul walks to the parking lot with his father who carries his duffel bag
bens car heading back to the house with paul
so hows school treating you
well its good to see you we miss you around the house and all but this st
peters its top of the line eh
you know paul ive been thinking maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk you know about well he makes a sharp turn
paul puts his arms up on the dashboard to steady himself
well the whole gamut
facts of life and all
some fatherly advice because i tell you theres things happening that youre probably old enough
pause for example on the self abuse front now this is important its not advisable to do it in the shower it wastes water and electricity and because we all
expect you to be doing it there in any case and um not onto the linen and not on your sisters underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother he pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son then continues
uh dad just then ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another car
if youre worried about anything just feel free to ask and uh we can look it up
uh dad you know im
all the more reason for this little heart to heart
the car pulls up
paul gets out looking shell shocked
he sees wendy waving to him from a second floor window
he nods back
on second thought can you do me a favor and pretend i never said any of that
in the doorway elena waits
paul knocks on wendys bedroom door
she opens it
paul and wendy sit on the floor
how are the parental units functioning these days
dads like doing his up with people routine mom hasnt been saying much
i dont know
dad seems a little weird
yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth
they both ponder silently
then may i operate your telephonic apparatus
why dont you use the phone downstairs
calling an individual charles in new york
confirming a social outing for friday night
can i come
its a one on one kind of date thing
her names libbets
what kind of a name is libbets
elena is coming out of the master bathroom in a robe a towel wrapped around her head
the turkey in
stuffed and baking
ben hood pads down the hall in his bathrobe tries the bathroom door
the shower is running but paul is standing by the open window puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke outside
ill be out in a second
ben walks back to the bedroom smirking
sure you will
one by one each member of the hood carried in a final item to place on the overstuffed thanksgiving table
then one by one they each silently take their seats
they look over the table
no one moves
well its great we can all be together
and this thanksgiving no hysteria no yelling especially with grandpa not here although we miss him
so lets do it right and actually wendy why dont you say grace
you used to love to say grace remember
wendy grimaces as they all bow their heads slightly
dear lord thank you for thanksgiving and for letting us white people kill all the indians
everyone looks up
and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs mutterings and groans wendy
for christs sake etc
while children in africa and asia are napalmed and jesus all right enough
they all unceremoniously start to dig in
janey williams is pouring benjamin hood a drink from a bottle of vodka
benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless janey still fully dressed
after the thanksgiving i had i need it
you having one
in a bit
she sits next to him he kisses the back of her neck
you know i think elena might suspect something
janey gives him a rather contemptuous look
thinking aloud maybe its all for the better you know
yesterday at dinner well she hasnt said anything
has she acted funny to you i mean have you noticed anything
almost ironic have i noticed anything
im not married to her benjamin you are
i think youve probably a better vantage point from which to observe her
yeah but i ive been working a lot lately and no thats not it
i guess weve just been on the verge of saying something whatever it is just saying something to each other
on the verge
janey gets up
ill be back
benjamin looks at her quizzically
she leaves the room
he leans back onto the bed
sits back up
takes a sip of vodka
puts the glass down
takes his socks off
hes now in just his jockey shorts and shirt
faintly he hears a door close
the front door
he takes another sip
he hears another sound
he goes to the door and carefully opens it
he hears quite audibly a car door open close janeys car start and pull out
he runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of her driving off
benjamin sits on the guest bed still in his underwear drinking from the bottle
he gets up and starts to wander around the house still holding the bottle
benjamin saunters through
he presses on the king sized bed it undulates
he wiggles comically making more waves
ben idly goes through janeys drawers
he rifles through the bathroom cabinet checking out the medicines
he notices a garter belt hanging from the walk in closet door
he picks it up and twirls it
benjamin walks in an obvious look of distaste
he sorts through a few of mikes things monster eyes that glow in the dark the sensuous woman etc
he twirls the garter belt absentmindedly then tosses it into the back of mikes closet
he finishes putting his clothes back on
as he reaches for the door he hears voices and quickly steps back in again
mikey and wendy
see no ones here
maybe you want to go to the basement
maybe we can just watch some tv
theres a tv in the basement
hood hears their steps down into the basement
wendy and mikey stand in the middle of the semi lit basement
maybe we can mess around
you know only if you want to
i dont know
why did you with sandy
i dont know
you like him
he worships you
but wendy doesnt seem to hear shes drawn to an object lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side
hey whats this
with a look of utter fascination she picks up a nixon mask looking at it as though it were an archeological find
she puts the mask on
from behind the mask i wont take my pants off
but ill touch it
thats as far as it goes
mikey looks totally confused
remaining fully clothed wendy loosens mikes belt showing no excitement from behind her mask and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump
just then a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs ben towers above them looking down
mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together grabbing a tv guide as wendy stands up the mask still on
as ben descends mikey still stuffing his shirt tail into his pants pretends to flip through the tv guide
muttering when worlds collide
when worlds collide
ben arrives folds his arms
what the hell are you kids doing down here
what do you think were doing dad
what do i think
i think youre probably touching each other
i think youre touching that reckless jerk off for gods sake and i think hes trying to get into your slacks
i think at fourteen years of age that youre getting ready to give up your girlhood hey hang on there mr
hood dont you direct a single word at me mikey
i dont want to hear it
ill be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon
bet your ass on that son
talking to me dad
who else would i be talking to
and take that thing off
pulling off the mask well then forget all this stern dad stuff
im not interested in your smart ass remarks now lady
you and i can discuss it on the walk home
she stands next to mikey for a moment both on the verge of tears
hood and wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain
he looks at her from time to time then takes her arm
look kiddo dont worry about it
i really dont care that much
im just not sure hes good enough thats all
i mean hes not serious hell end up living off janey and jim you watch
its just that you develop a sense when you get older if things are going to work out or if they wont and sometimes its not worth the mess
she looks at him
they keep walking
she walks through a puddle
your toes cold
he stops and lifts her in his arms
ill carry you up the drive
she puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up
on her face as he carries her a look of blank but real intimacy
hood and wendy enter wet and cold muttering hellos
from the kitchen dinner in ten minutes
you go dry off now
wendy heads for the stairs hood following
hood finishes taking off his wet clothes as elena enters and turns on a light
she stands watching him
never guess where i found her
not much response from elena
in the basement over at janey and jims
with that weirdo mikey
not even a tv on
and theyre on the floor and hes got his trousers down though thank goodness shes still dressed
well i really let him have it
a nervous laugh and wendy came home peacefully
hey should i dress for the halfords now or give me your up to you
id like to go early and leave pretty soon after that
i get you loud and clear
hey you look nice
so what were you doing in the williams basement anyway
oh just dropping off a coffee cup
jim left it last time he was over
it was on the dash of the car
you were you know reading thought id just catch some air
the mustache coffee cup
the one that was sitting on the dash
yeah that one
she walks down to the kitchen benjamin following her
wendy is already in the kitchen fishing through the drawers for silverware and napkins
stay out of trouble
youll be on the train
paul ah let the guy have his fun
whats the name of this girl with the park avenue address
what kind of name is libbets
a silent dinner of turkey sandwiches with elena benjamin and wendy
the turkey carcass sits embarrassed in the middle of the table
wendy finished gets up from the table
opens the fridge but finds nothing
then goes to the candy shelf and grabs some hot tamales leaving the room without a word and going into the den
wendy turns the tv on
and that ends todays highlight coverage of the watergate affair
hood and elena rise from the table with their dishes
whats for dessert
see for yourself
no advice from the experts huh
his plate slips out of his hands into the trash
he fishes it out and sets it on the counter
you think i i have no idea
whats on your mind
dont it wouldnt make a pleasant evening if thats what youre after
i dont want to talk about it
stupid mustache cup
what do you mean
dont be dim
elena what are youre talking about
im not surprised
listen elena if youre gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again your unfaithfulness thats what im trying to talk about
and you wont do me the dignity of being up front about it
quieter am i unfaithful
is that what youre trying to say
its a starting place
well what kind of faithfulness are you after
if youre going to insult me what else could i be
what else could i be
were not living in the real world here
youre living out some fantasy land from the past or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts
there are some hard facts here
its the law of the land
the government the world those two guys on the yankees
and im not having any fun at it i can tell you that
wendy puts the volume of the tv up to drown out a conversation she can almost overhear but doesnt want to
you think im so dense
and now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party
you want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesnt go with those pants at all
you want to wear that and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage
and youre not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this
you dont really know what this feels like
whispering sure i do
do i know what loneliness feels like
sure i do
i know a lot about it if thats what you mean
thats supposed to explain it
seemingly tired he stands before her
elena sighs then walks into the den
were going to the halfords
the numbers on the calendar in the kitchen
we should be home around
eyes still glued to the is it a big party
a big neighborhood party
if theres a problem i guess ill just call you there to interrupt
what sort of problems are you planning exactly
elena kisses the top of her head
still watching the tv oh i thought id steal the station wagon drive up to a commune
or set the house on fire
just bundle up
its supposed to freeze tonight
well see you in the morning
elena and ben emerge from the house and look up at a darkening foreboding sky
a light rain falls
they jog toward their car
the car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets
inside elena and ben dont speak
their firebird pulls up
there are already many other cars parked on the lawn and driveway
hood and elena enter
dot halford accosts them
so wonderful to see you
finishing the last of a celery canoe she kisses the air next to bens ear and gives elena a manic hug
then picking up a white salad bowl from the hall table would you care to play
new this year
close on the bowl full of keys
strictly volunteer of course
you can put your coats in the library if you like
uh ive left the youve
in the car
yeah well be right back dot
ben and elena climb back in the car and close the doors shivering
this just isnt the best moment for this
i know i know
i had no idea that this was going to be a key party
yeah well if wed understood we could have invented some kind of excuse
a key party did you see how stuffed that bowl was already
i think were here and we dont have to stay we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home
damn it ben im not staying at this party so we can go home with someone elses wife
thats not why were here right
were simply being neighbors here and i think we should do just that youre not going to im not
you have some marker thats what i think if you want to know the truth
you have some marker and youre going to put it on the house keys so that janey can find them and then when i get back to the house ill
find the two of you in there and wendyll be able to hear you and paul will be back and hell hear you and ill catch you thats what i think
shell be swearing and banging against the wall and ill catch elena
she rubs her eyes
elena its not what you think
its not a big plot
i dont know if you want to go over this now but its just something that comes over me
i dont feel good about it
i know ive done what i didnt want to do
i dont know well im really pleased to hear a confession
elena youre just getting wound up to get wound up
thanks for the diagnosis ben
so lets just go to this fiasco if thats what you want to do
lets just go on in
id rather talk to anyone else but you
she pulls the keys out of the ignition gets out of the car and slams the door
he follows her
elena entering the house again tosses the keys at dot halford who looks surprised
hood slides in behind his wife
dot drops the keys into the bowl
slow motion close up the keys on their equine chain fall in with a thunderous crash
the room is crowded with nervous expectant couples and various groupings
elena slips into a side room
benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours a stiff one turning around to find at his elbow none other than george clair
clair george clair
what the hell brings you to new canaan
well its the funniest thing
ive been talking to some investors a little outside venture you understand between you and me about a scheme to manufacture a new styrofoam packaging
little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping
anyway it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor jim williams
how about that
well hey isnt that a one in a million coincidence
a real dreamer jim williams eh
look here benj whaddya make of this sequel to the godfather
you think its gonna work
dont see how
i think the publics had its fill of this gangster stuff

benjamin catches a glimpse of janey voluptuously attired across the room
well gonna make a break for the hors doeuvres guy
yeah see you bright and early monday am
beat say wheres the wife
winking as he goes in rhode island with the folks
im a free agent tonight
at this they both notice elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room
clair gives ben a sideways glance then moves on
ben makes straight for janey who pretends to be preoccupied with a plant
oh jeez benjie
well here you are
damn right but where the hell were you
looking around what are you talking about
whispering but too loudly dont bullshit me around janey
jesus christ i waited around for more than half an hour in nothing but my boxer shorts and and whats all that about
what the hell happened
janey takes a sip of her drink
a prior engagement overcame me
listen benjamin hood
i have obligations that precede your
from before you showed up
one or two you know good natured encounters that doesnt mean im
im not just some toy for you
when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party i just did them thats all because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy
i dont know how to take this
and what do you mean jimmy
i thought you said you and your husband how you take it isnt all that interesting to me benjamin
im sorry i just cant believe you could be so stalling he watches her take another sip of her drink and wander off
the air is filled with talk of watergate billie jean king the oil crisis the mets
benjamin goes over to the couch where dave gorman is chatting up an attractive younger woman
lighting up a joint welcome to the monkey house has been a seminal influence on me hey benjamin give it a try
this stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions
waving it away thanks for the advice dave
but then benjamin changes his mind
uh well what the hey
taking the joint he tugs on it holding the smoke in his lungs
coughing good shit
sure is good shit
i had it in my chamber for a while
i was smoking this other its what
dont fret benjie its darn it dave
he rises unsteadily weaving through the rooms conversations
theyve got their own airline in state thats not subject to the fare controls
compare sacramento to l
on the controlled airlines and youll see what friedman is saying supply and demand less restriction
benjamin walks over to a window
the outdoor lamps illuminate a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet
paul is seated reading the latest number of the fantastic four comic book
the cover displays a lurid atomically glowing baby
the conductor walks through the cabin
approaching our final stop grand central station
paul looks out the window at the tenements of harlem barely visible through the walls of sleet
soon the train enters the tunnel toward the station
paul gets out of a cab and heads inside
hes met by the doorman
libbets casey please
a smirk elevator on the right
eighth floor shes waiting for you
paul rings the bell
from the other side of the door open it paul
paul opens the door and enters the apartment
its half dark has an air of old wealth
libbets skids across the parquet floor to him
we were waiting
she turns and runs into the den
under his breath we
and there in the den cleaning an ounce of dope on an open copy of nixons six crises is francis
lifting the book up you oughtta read this hood nixon our leader all ye need know about the travails of life
check out the checkers speech stuff
all hope drained from him francis
you gonna leave the seeds in there
in the binding like that
all will be revealed baby
the television is turned on to a weather report about the coming ice storm
awesome sleet and rain
you young knight
can you check on the mead
can you sally forth and secure us some more mead
nasal voice impersonating a tv character moisture
in the pantry
paul trudges disconsolately out of the room
paul after wandering a maze of halls enters the kitchen where he takes a six pack out of the fridge and returns to the living room
he enters the room with the beer
frankie opens them with his teeth
handing him a beer hey its a sellable skill
francis licks closed a second joint then takes the beer and opens it with his rear molars
hell on the fillings
paul opens the other two beers and hands one to libbets
they light up a joint
everythings gonna freeze the big freeze
yeah paul are you gonna get home okay
paul and francis exchange a look
she puts an allman brothers tape on the track and turns the tv down
wendy enters the bathroom
she fills the sink with water then turns off the tap
she takes a razor blade from the counter and slowly determinedly holds it to her wrist
she presses it into her skin drawing a small drop of blood
she drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist grabbing some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound
she hears the phone ring and walks downstairs
wendy picks up the phone
mikey is on the other end of the line
youre parents at that party
you get in trouble
cant really tell yet
im sorry if i got you into trouble
maybe we dont have to you know
unless you really want to
im going to silver meadow check out the ice storm
you wanna come
mikey bundled up in a huge orange ski parka and cap heads for the door
where you going
when it freezes i guess that means the molecules are not moving
so when you breathe theres nothing in the air you know to breathe in to your body
the molecules have stopped
so its clean
sandy just looks at him
he walks out into the night
elena sits on a couch talking to no one barely looking up when someone stands in front of her
perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me philip
he sits beside her
im a bit surprised
sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep
im going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile
philips about to reply but thinks better of it
they sit glumly next to each other for a minute
then philip rises
he walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys out of the bowl then heads for the door
passing by i hope those werent my keys
he laughs at his own joke as philip rushes out the front door
back to elena even more forlorn than before
paul enters the bathroom
we hear francis and libbets voices from the other room laughing
at the sink he pauses in front of the medicine cabinet then opens it
he pulls out some bottles
uh cant quite pronounce this one par er goric
a beat looking into the mirror for effect francis chamberlain davenport the fourth tonight you sleep the sleep of the just
he pockets the seconal and turns out the light
paul re enters the den to find francis alone
and whence has yon virginal maiden absconded
like into one of the other or so bathrooms theyve got in this place
paul takes out the bottle and opens it
check it out
not for the faint of heart
you are a god
picking up beer trying to hurry before libbets returns one for you and one for me
he hands a pill to francis then pretends to pop one into his mouth and takes a swig of his beer
as francis downs his own paul pockets his unswallowed pill
in the doorway no candy for me
to paul young master of the revels a treat for our hostess
well uh i dont its really what is it
come on paulie share the wealth
you copped em from her moms stash anyway
hand in pocket libbets you really shouldnt mix and match you know with the beer
ill put em back
libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle
oh far out paulie
hey look these expired like five months ago
you think theyre better aged
she opens up the bottle and takes one out
maybe you should have just a half
thanks for the advice dad
she takes the pill
paul looks on thwarted
ben is back at the bar pouring another tall one
mark boland sidles up next to him
benjie feeling no pain
as the indian saying goes pain is merely an opinion
nodding across the room hey check it out
maria conrads brought her son
walking off i wish some of the gang had brought their daughters
ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke
he looks across the room as maria and her son neil stringy hair acne tie dyed turtleneck patched jeans are engaging janey and philip edwards in conversation
paul francis and libbets sit on the floor listening to the music blasting at full strength
libbets and francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness
paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face
neil has now cornered janey
as werner says there is nothing to get
when you get that theres nothing to get
thats the training when you ask yourself the question what is is
wait this is the training where they dont let you go to the bathroom
that was the hardest part
but i did it
and you get into some far out shit
libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping francis whos crashed out on the floor in a corner
francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings
paul is sitting on the couch and libbets comes back and sits at his feet facing up to him
i guess hes just real exhausted from you know tests and stuff
libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland
you know libbets i really feel you know like a real connection to you yeah but you dont even know me really
sure i do you know like your aura
that you give off
its like very positive and i feel a real special feeling because you really and i have a special feeling too because i do
because i feel for you and i have a feeling for you too because youre just like i feel for you like youre youre just like simultaneously like a brother
yeah youre not alone with that line
so how about we take a bath together
consciousness fading fast hah hah youre funny
like a brother and sister
oh man im so wasted
her head bobs and weaves her eyes close and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch smack dab between pauls legs
she begins to snore instantly her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch
paul doesnt move doesnt even breathe
then slowly he leans his back into the couch without shifting the rest of his body
he looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy
the crowds a bit thinner than before
as dot halford begins calling out for everyones attention a few couples make their last minute way to the door
we have a little business to attend to now
so everyone whod like to stay please gather in the living room
she scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table which has been put in the middle of the room
walking up to elena ready to go
were not going anywhere
elena waves at janey williams who is standing across the living room
janey looks back without expression
libbets and paul in the same position whence last we saw them
paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a phone
he dials a number
the phone rings
wendy picks it up
whispering charles what time is it
is this charles
what time is it
um ten o five
where are you
im uh in the midst of a moral dilemma
and i was wondering because i know youre a very moral person and and
i cant really talk about it
i guess i better get to the train
what are you doing at home on a friday night
i have plans
paul hangs up the phone and looks down at libbets
libbets allman brothers tape has run out
the machine makes a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to circle
the only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartments windows
wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike but the ice makes it too slippery
the storm is now in full swing
she gets off and walks
wendy walks barely keeping her balance in the wind
all the couples are now gathered for the key selection process men on one side of the room women on the other
the storm can be heard outside
well what shall the order be alphabetical
in order of appearance
lowest handicap does the honors
ladies isnt it up to you
oh ill go first damn it
lets just line up and get it over with
maria chooses stephen earle
hands the keys to him
a smattering of applause as she takes his arm and they leave
neil watches his mothers exit
a few more couplings
helen worthington approaches the bowl
helen worthington has the size and shape of a sumo wrestler
there is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the room
helen delicately reaches into the bowl
her hands emerge with a key chain
george clair steps forward obviously depressed as a collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him
ben looks on momentarily triumphant
elena smiles to herself
the gadds choose each other
oh my own husband
isnt that against the rules
relieved oh i think not
gadd smiles as they leave obviously happy to go
finally only mark boland neil conrad janey and jim williams rob and dot halford sari steele benjamin and elena
getting down to the wire
elena steps forward
benjamin is obviously agitated
close on janeys hands selecting away from bens equine key ring
she lifts up another key ring neil conrad the teenager
she hands the self important looking neil his keys and they turn to go
jim williams smiles mysteriously to himself
ben suddenly lurches forward semi drunkenly trying to separate neil from janey
ad lib hey hey ben hang on there a sec
he backs off ashamed and taking a step backwards trips over the coffee table
mark boland helps lift him up
maybe i should
right down the hall ben
muttering sorry im sorry
uh ill be back
dot follows mark boland down the hall behind ben
suddenly its just elena and jim williams and sari steele and rob halford
taking saris arm actually we didnt put our keys in at all
but you wont spread it around
its my party and dot isnt
hey were just going to slip upstairs for a while
you folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go
elena and jim look at each other
rob well fix it for ourselves
you two go and get acquainted
well let ourselves out the front door
jim and elena stand there alone
well i have to say i dont have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl
doesnt seem entirely safe leaving your car keys around
she takes the bowl and dips her hand in
two sets are left
one her own she avoids
she takes out jims keys and walks across the room handing them to him
thanks but oh i dont think so
its been kind of a discouraging evening
you couldnt have hoped for much better when you came up the walk
somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it
actually i didnt think about it at all really
they sit down on the sofa
you want coffee or something
well maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen look elena the fact that were neighbors
you know close friends well it sort of makes this a little strange dont you think
my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom or at least he wishes he were
ive been married to him for years and i dont have any intention of going in there to get him
so what im proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy and since you are standing here alone im proposing that you and i do what
pass some time
they both look at their hands
now dont make me feel as if im being too forward ok
if you dont what the hey
lets go for a drive
shall we clean up around here first
do you think its all right nah that wasnt in the contract
but they still walk around turning off lights
in the hallway elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door
she hears the sound of running water from inside
then she goes into a sideroom and joins jim
they pick up their coats
elena and jim walk outside into the freezing pelting rain
covering their faces they jog to his car an oversized cadillac
a thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield
they climb in
were going to have to defrost this thing for a while
he turns on the ignition and the vents start to blow cold air at them
he leans over and kisses her
do these seats go back
that starts it
he jumps at her unbuckling her and unzipping himself
they tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds
and then comically hes in her
with a groan its over in a flash
jim pulls himself off readjusting his pants
that was awful really awful
im so sorry elena
elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself
things are really rotten at home
you wouldnt believe how rotten
shes unstable i guess
its not the right time to tell you
but thats it its like i cant make her happy the boys cant make her happy she just doesnt jim maybe we should just go
ive got to look in on the kids
paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city
jesus let me make it up to you i can do better than that honestly well we can talk about it
i wouldnt expect you to see it any other way
maybe you just need look can you wait here a sec i need to tidy up just a minute ill be right back
she opens the door and walks back to the house
elena hesitantly walks to the bathroom
she opens the door
bens sitting on the floor next to the toilet woozily flipping through the pages of a magazine
ben ive got a ride home
maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here
ill drive you ben
she sits on the toilet next to him stroking his hair
youre in no condition to drive
well talk in the morning ok
he sits accepting and quiet
youll get some sleep on the couch out there
looking up at her with gratitude sure
and well talk in the morning
well talk in the morning
wendy walks up the drive in the rain pauses then goes to the front door and knocks lightly
the door swings ajar
she pushes on it and lets herself in
wendy wanders into the living room then climbs the steps
the sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her
she goes into mikeys room its even more of a disaster zone than usual
she sees on the wall his dark light poster of the sexual positions of the zodiac
she notices the black garter belt on the floor and picks it up absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out of the room
she walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen leaving the garter belt on the counter
she opens the refrigerator grabs a jar of peanut butter and scoops some up in her finger
as she puts her finger in her mouth wendy
she gives out a little yelp
sandy you scared the shit out of me
what are you doing
just thought id stop by
mikes out i think he went to silver meadow to see if you were hanging around there
pause are you his girlfriend
elena gets in
they drive off silently
the car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice inches up a hill then falters and slides back silently circling a couple of times before crashing into an embankment
as the car slides and crashes amid jims and elenas screams
well i guess we can walk from here
jim and elena get out shaky from the car
they pause for a moment
the street lamp above them sizzles but stays on
they start to walk
paul and libbets still frozen in the same position
finally paul gently pushes libbets head back
it slides off his leg and as paul lurches forward in a failed attempt to grab it libbets flops backwards her head hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly
paul gets up looks down at her
he runs over to a side table and sees the clock
oh shit oh shit
he grabs his comic books and runs for the door
the driver impassively inches down park avenue
oh shit oh shit
paul sprints down the platform just as the doors are closing
he barely makes it into the train
paul walks through the nearly empty train car and finds a seat
he pulls his fantastic four comic book out of his coat pocket
ben makes his way to the kitchen pours himself a cup of coffee
he sees himself reflected in the black glass of the cabinets
sandy and wendy are sitting on the floor
he grabs his g
check this out
hes supposed to talk all kinds of stuff but hes like malfunctioned
he pulls the dog tag on the doll and g
joe emits a plastic macho voice
get this message back to base
again and again
wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord
get this message back to base
its gonna get a lot colder tonight i predict
probably a blackout
do you have candles in your house
i know where the candles are and i have my own flashlight
also i know where every emergency exit is on this floor
during the course of his monologue as wendy looks on sandy calmly ties a noose for his doll
this knots called a bowline
he puts the noose over the dolls head as wendy holds him
lets hang him
sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer
they both look at him in silence
the silence continues
if it wasnt raining we could take him outside and blow him up
he wouldnt blow up
hed just get all mangled or twisted
she takes him down and lays him flat on the bed
and then begins to remove his clothes
sandy looks on desirous
noticing his lack of anatomy it looks like someone got to his private parts before us
communist viet cong
they left it in the jungle
they speak with high seriousness
wendy slides up on the bed where sandy sits a pillow on his lap and one by one with exaggerated slowness she removes her snowboots as if they were stiletto
can i get into your bed
pause with you
sandy begins to shake
we we have to go to the guest room
we cant stay in here
what if mikey
dont worry about them
theyre at that party getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff
sandy begins to cry
its just its just she takes his hand and they walk out of the room and down the hall into the guest room
wendy and sandy enter
she sees the vodka bottle on the dresser
want a drink
you never tasted the stuff
she fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to sandy
they clink and each toss back a sip wendy almost the entire glass
sandy coughs and gags but swallows
it feels warm
one more shot
under the covers
under they go and soon every layer of clothing emerges
feeling her way get em off
sandy begins to laugh and soon wendy joins him
they roll around on top of each other for a while
have you ever had a nocturnal emission
thats the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff like after a sexy dream
sandy shakes his head
they didnt tell you this stuff yet
what planet do you live on
sandy doesnt answer but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck
i love you
are you drunk
i dont know
how do i know
i dont know either
you spin around when you lie down
sandy rolls off her and lies on his back
i dont think im spinning
they cuddle up together
mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain
he climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it but then gets off and stands looking down at the pool again
mikey walks across the field
the storm has let up
mikey walks along
with a running start he slides on the ice down a hill
he walks back up and slides again hollering with joy
he is an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom
the streetlights sputter on then off
sandy and wendy lie asleep
a power line is down
it hisses and hums a humming very much like the humming mikey has been hearing earlier
the humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which mikey has become so accustomed at such moments
mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity
a strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face as the power line connects to the guardrail
glued by an electrical pulse to the rail he shakes as the current flows through him
after a minute his body slumps and slides down the road
as paul sits reading on he moving train the lights inside begin to sputter and the train begins to slow
after a few moments the train grinds to a halt and paul and his few fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark with only the light of
an emergency exit sign above pauls head to light the scene
the train is eerily silent
ben drives home
an emergency vehicle lights flashing crawls by bens car
he drives on slowly
jim and elena arrive on foot
you want to come in get a cup of coffee warm up
i can either walk you home or you could crash in the guest room
i hope the pipes he walks into the kitchen
the pipes have begun to burst
theres a water leak running down the walls forming a puddle on the floor
elena has walked into the kitchen behind him
she leans against the counter picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second then putting it back down
why dont you put on some dry socks and weve got some rain boots in the guest closet back there
last room upstairs back of the hall
elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet
elena opens the door and discovers wendy and sandy asleep
she stands before the bed and gazes down on them
they look almost angelic
wendy sensing her presence in the room opens her eyes slowly coming out of sleep
heartbroken softly get dressed
elena walks out of the room back to the kitchen
wendy gets out of bed quietly leaving sandy sleeping peacefully
she looks at him lovingly and tucks the blanket back up around him
elena and jim are drinking coffee
you should let him sleep
she looks inquisitively at the two adults
ben continues to drive slowly
he looks out his side window and sees something
he puts on his brakes
ben gets out of the car and stands on the top of an icy embankment
in a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka
he walks hesitantly toward it
mikes body lies face down in the wet ice
ben leans down and turns the body over then stands back in amazement and saddened shock
he stands there for a moment then picks mikes body up carrying him over the hill and onto the street
we see now that he is parked just a short block from the williamss house
he bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house
the effort is obviously enormous
he falls from time to time then gets back up
various passengers asleep
paul hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light cold
he reads his comic book by the light of the emergency exit
suddenly the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the trains engines returns
the conductor enters the car blasting forth in his classic nasal train conductor voice
good morning ladies and gentlemen on paul squinting in the harsh light
the train moves slowly through a suburban semi forested landscape
on the street below the bridge an emergency highway crew is removing a fallen tree their trucks aglow in flashing yellow lights
elena pours wendy a cup of coffee
theyre both in their coats
i dont like coffee
itll warm you up
elena sits next to her
they both raise their cups and sip the coffee not noticing the simultaneity of their movements
jim watches the sleeping sandy picks up the half empty bottle of vodka pours himself a drink
the noise wakes sandy up
jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip
jim looks at him
elena and wendy hear a hollering from outside get up to see what it is
elena and wendy come out the front door as ben lays mikeys body onto the ground before the front steps
hes too breathless to speak
they stand there looking down at mikey
behind elena and wendy jim appears
he pushes softly by them toward the body of his son
jim he was just up in silver lane i think maybe a power line jim picks up his son
he carries him silently into the house
sandy now standing inside the foyer pushes himself back against the wall as they pass without expression
after a moment from outside the hoods can hear jims wailing
do you think
maybe we should call someone the phones out
well we can just ben i dont think he wants us here
wendy has been watching sandy through the screen door
wait i she turns back up the front steps and gently goes in on the living room floor jim is hugging mikes body his shoulders shaking uncontrollably sobbing
wendy walks and stands next to sandy who is filled momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward her but she takes him and gives him an awkward childlike
hug then turns and runs out the door joining ben and elena on the driveway
sandy watches her go his face wet with tears
oh you know for a minute i thought it was paul
you think hes probably been waiting all night at the station
elena wendy and ben reach the car and get in
the car starts and drives off
there are more crews out cleaning up the storms debris and fixing the power lines as they drive
the train slowly pulls in
the hood family walks down to the end of the platform
the train doors open and paul tired and a bit cramped emerges
he sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform and walks to them
they stand silent even dignified awaiting him
when he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get in
sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds ben as he starts the engine
he squints his eyes tearing a bit from the light
he looks around first at his wife then at his two children sitting in the back seat
he turns off the engine
quietly he begins to cry
he turns to the back seat
theres something your mother and i have to tell you two elena puts her hand out almost touching him
paul looks at wendy silently asking her whats happening
she casts her eyes downward as does he
her hand still not yet touching him ben
from above the car the first morning light shining upon it
