b if window
href b b by jim uhls based on a novel by chuck palahnuik people were always asking me did i know tyler durden
tyler has one arm around jacks shoulder the other hand holds a handgun with the barrel lodged in jacks mouth
tyler is sitting in jacks lap
they are both sweating and disheveled both around tyler is blond handsome and jack brunette is appealing in a dry sort of way
tyler looks at his watch
looking out window this is the beginning
were at ground zero
maybe you should say a few words to mark the occasion
with a gun barrel between your teeth you only speak in vowels
jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth
still distorted i cant think of anything
with my tongue i can feel the rifling in the barrel
for a second i totally forgot about tylers whole controlled demolition thing and i wondered how clean this gun is
tyler checks his watch
its getting exciting now
that old saying how you always hurt the one you love well it works both way
jack turns so that he can see down stories
we have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction
the demolitions committee of project mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin
in two minutes primary charges will blow base charges and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble
i know this because tyler knows this
look what weve accomplised
checks watch thirty seconds
somehow i realize all of this the gun the bombs the revolution is really about marla singer
pull back from jacks face
its pressed against two large breasts that belong to
bob a moose of a man
jack is engulfed by bob in an intense embrace
bob weeps openly
bob had bitch tits
pull back to wide on
men are paired off hugging talking in emotional tones
near the door a sign on a stand remaining men together
this was a support group for men with testicular cancer
the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob
were still men
men is what we are
six months ago bobs testicles were removed
then hormone therapy
he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen
that was where my head fit into his huge sweating tits that hung enormous the way we think of gods as big
theyre gonna have to open my pecs again to drain the fluid
bob hugs tighter then looks with empathy into jacks eyes
you cry now
jack looks at bob
let me start earlier
jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling
for six months
i could not sleep
jack sleepy stands over a copy machine
his starbucks cup sits on the lid moving back and forth as the machine copies
with insomnia nothing is real
everything is far away
everything is a copy of a copy of a copy
other people make copies all with starbucks cups sipping
jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves
jack sipping stares blankly at a starbucks bag on the floor full of newspapers and fast food garbage
when deep space exploration ramps up it will be corporations that name everything
the ibm stellar sphere
the philip morris galaxy
jack looks up as a pudgy man jacks boss enters starbucks cup in hand and slides a stack of reports on jacks desk
im going to need you out of town a little more this week
weve got some red flags to cover
it mustve been tuesday
he was wearing his cornflower blue tie
listless management speak you want me to de prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade
you need to make these your primary action items
he was full of pep
mustve had his grande latte enema
here are your flight coupons
call me from the road if there are any snags
jack hides a yawn pretends to listen
jack sits on the toilet cordless phone to his ear flips through an ikea catalog
theres a stack of old playboy magazines and other catalogs nearby
like everyone else i had become a slave to the ikea nesting instinct
into phone yes
id like to order the erika pekkari slip covers
jack drops the open catalog on the floor
move in on catalog on photo of coffeetable set
if i saw something like clever coffee table sin the shape of a yin and yang i had to have it
pan to photo of armchair
like the johanneshov armchair in the strinne green stripe pattern
the armchair appears
pan over next to armchair
or the rislampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly unbleached paper
the lamps appear
pan over to wall
even the vild hall clock of galvanized steel resting on the klipsk shelving unit
the clock appears as the shelving unit appears on the wall
i would flip through catalogs and wonder what kind of dining set defines me as a person
we used to read pornography
now it was the horchow collection
a dining room set appears
jack the cordless phone still glued to his ear walks into frame and continues
no i dont want cobalt
oh that sounds nice
jack opens a cabinet takes out a plate
i had it all
even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections proof they were crafted by the honest simple hard working indigenous peoples of wherever
he rummages through the refrigerator
its practically empty
jack takes out a jar of mustard opens it and uses a butter knife to eat it
jack eyes puffy face pale sits before an intern who studies him with bemusement
no you cant die of insomnia
maybe i died already
look at my face
you need to lighten up
cant you give me something
red and blue tuinal lipstick red seconals
overlapping w above you need healthy natural sleep
chew valerian root and get some more exercise
the intern ushes jack to the door
they step into the
the intern walks away from jack picks up a chart
im in pain
facetious you want to see pain
swing by first methodist tuesday nights
see the guys with testicular cancer
the intern moves into the other room
jack stares after him
jack heads for the front door
jack stares at a group of men including bob who are all listening to a group member speak at a lectern
the speaker has pale skin and sunken eyes hes clearly dying
wanted three kids
two boys and a girl
mindy wanted two girls and one boy
we never could agree on anything
the speaker cracks a sad smile
some men chuckle happy to lighten the mood
well she had her first child a month ago a girl with her new husband
and thank god
im glad for her because she deserves
the speaker breaks down weeps uncontrollably
a couple of the men go up to the speaker comforting him leading him away
a leader takes the stand
everyone lets thank thomas for sharing himself with us
jack uncomfortable joins everyone else in unison thank you thomas
i look around this room and i see a lot of courage
and it gives me strength
we give each other strength
jack looks around
many of the men are sniffling sobbing
jack squirms in his seat
its time for the one on one
lets follow thomass example and open ourselves
everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing off
jack stands uncomfortable
can everyone find a partner
bob his chin down on his chest starts toward jack shuffling his feet
the big moosie his eyes already shrink wrapped in tears
knees together invisible steps
bob takes jack into an embrace
bob was a champion bodybuilder
you know that chest expansion program you see on tv
that was his idea
i was a juicer
diabonol then wisterol its for racehorses for christsake
now im bankrupt divorced my two grown kids wont return my calls
strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one
bob breaks into sobbing putting his head on jacks shoulder and completely covering jacks face
after a long beat of crying bob raises up his head looks at jacks nametag
go ahead cornelius
you can cry
they look at each other
slowly jacks eyes grow wet
i was lost in oblivion dark and silent and complete
bob pulls jacks head back into his chest
jack tightens his arms around bob
i found freedom
losing all hope was freedom
jack pulls away from bob
on bobs chest theres a wet mask of jacks face from how he looks weeping
babies dont sleep this well
jack lies sound asleep
i became addicted
jack moves into a group hug of sickly people men and women
in view is a sign by the door free and clear
jack stands with a weeping middle aged woman
he begins to cry along with her
a sign by the door onward and upward
if i didnt say anything people assumed the worst
they cried harder
i cried harder
everyone including jack sits back in their seats eyes closed
the leader speaks into a microphone
tonight were going to open the green door the heart chakra
i wasnt really dying i wasnt host to cancer or parasites i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around
and you open the door and you step inside
were inside our hearts
now imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light
thats right the pain itself is a ball of healing light
jack eyes closed is silent
it moves over your body healing you
keep this going and step forward through the back door of the room
where does it lead
to your cave
step forward into your cave
jack walks along moving through an ice cavern
youre going deeper into your cave
and youre going to find your power animal
jack comes upon a penguin
the penguin looks at him cocks his head to signal jack forward
the penguin jumps onto a patch of ice and slides away
jack walks out a doorway saying goodbye to people
he walks down the sidewalk shining with peace
every evening i died and every evening i was born again
jacks still in an embrace with bob
bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too
being there my face against his tits ready to cry this was my vacation
marla singer enters
she has short matte black hair and big dark eyes like a character from japanese animation
and she ruined everything
marla looks around raises a cigarette to her lips
this is cancer right
bob and jack stare dumbfounded
everyone paired off
move through room
find jacks face as he stares
move through room
find marlas face
shes drinking coffee smoking a cigarette
did not have testicular cancer
she was a liar
marla sits with the group smoking listening intently while a member speaks
jack spies on her
she had no diseases at all
i had seen her at my melanoma monday night group
marla sits at the end of a row smoking
all the faces down the row are turned toward her incredulous
and at free and clear my blood parasites group thursdays
jack leans out further than the others scornful
and again at seize the day my tuberculosis friday night
marlas eyes are closed her head on the shoulder of the man shes embraced by
she opens her eyes catching jacks stare
jack looks away
marla the big tourist
her lie reflected my lie
marla rests her chin on the mans shoulder
tears roll down her cheeks
she wipes at them
marla walks out the support groups dispersing
jack exits amongst them
he spots marla walking away
and suddenly i felt nothing
i couldnt cry
so once again i could not sleep
jack stares after marla for a long moment
he walks away
jack in underwear is cross legged on the floor assembling ikea furniture cordless phone shouldered to his ear
into phone no i just cant believe that card is declined okay okay let me give you a different card number
jack gets his wallet off the floor pulls out another card and mos over the following he reads it into the phone
next group after guided meditation after we open our chakras when its time to hug im going to grab that little bitch marla singer pin her arms against her sides
close on jack as he clamps his arms around marla
marla you liar you big tourist
i need this
jack in pajamas stares at home shopping network on his tv
when you have insomnia youre never really asleep and youre never really awake
i hadnt slept in four days
jack walks in and joins the crowd looking around
people are chattering with each other
but in here in everyone theres the squint of a five day headache
yet they forced themselves to be positive
they never said parasite they said agent
they always talked about getting better
everyone sits in chairs
jack catches sight of marla
to open tonights communion chloe would like to say a few words
taking the lectern is chloe a pale sickly girl whose skin stretches yellowish and tight over her bones
she wears a head bondage
she clears her throat
chloe looked the way joni mitchells skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everyone
well im still here but i dont know for how long
thats as much certainty as anyone can give me
but ive got some good news i no longer have any fear of death
applause from around the room
i am in a pretty lonely place
no one will have sex with me
im so close to the end and all i want is to get laid for the last time
i have pornographic movies in my apartment and lubricants and amyl nitrate
the leader gingerly takes control of the microphone
thank you chloe
everyone lets thank chloe
thank you chloe
now youre standing at the entrance to your cave
you step inside your cave and you walk
jacks face eyes closed is motionless
if i did have a tumor id name it marla
the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it but you cant
now find your power animal
jack finds marla smoking a cigarette
marla cocks her head indicating whe wants him to slide
jacks eyes open and turn to marla watching her blow smoke rings with her eyes closed
everyone stands and mills about pairing off
pick someone special to you tonight
jack sees the ghastly spectre of chloe ambling towards him
he tries to smile
she smiles with a twisted dying mouth
i never gave my real name at support groups
weve never actually talked
chloes eyes are eerily bright with desperation
jack in a sincere attempt at levity chokes out you look good
like a pirate
chloe laughs a little too much
jack squeezes out a laugh
then he sees marla off by herself
someone heads for her
excuse me i have to
jack gives a quick nod to chloe and darts towards marla
chloe watches him go
stay on jack and marla as jack clamps his arms around her
he whispers into her ear
we need to talk
im on to you
youre a faker
you arent dying
okay in the sylvia plath philosophy way were all dying
but youre not dying the way chloe is dying
tell the other person how you feel
youre a tourist
i saw you at melanoma tuberculosis and testicular cancer
and i saw you practicing this
telling me off
is it going as well as you hoped
reads his nametag
ill expose you
ill expose you
share yourself completely
marla puts her head down on jacks shoulder as if she were crying
jack pulls her head back up
she deadpans at him
why are you doing this
its cheaper than a movie and theres free coffee
these are my groups
i was here first
ive been coming for a year
howd you manage that
anyone who mightve noticed either died or recovered and never came back
let yourself cry
why do you do it
i dont know
when people think youre dying they really listen instead
instead of just waiting for their turn to speak
brief recognition between them broken as the leader passes
share with each other
jack waits till the leaders out of earshot
warning it becomes an addiction
jack sighs then pulls back
look i cant cry with a faker present
candy stripe a cancer ward
its not my problem
cant we do something
marla starts out of the room
jack follows her
now the closing prayer
marla gets to the sidewalk moving quickly along
well split up the week
you can have lymphoma tuberculosis and you take tuberculosis
my smoking doesnt go over at all
i think testicular cancer should be no contest
well technically i have more of a right to be there than you
you still have your balls
i dont know am i
jack follow marla into
marla walks with authority up to an unwatched dryer
she takes out clothes picks out jeans pants and shirts
ill take the parasites
you cant have both parasites
you can take blood parasites i want brain parasites
ill take blood parasites and organic brain dementia i want that
you cant have the whole brain
so far you have four and i only have two
then take blood parasites
now we each have three
marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past jack
jack follows bewildered
left half your clothes
marlas led him into the street with traffic barreling down
marla walks on oblivious as cars screech to a halt horns blaring
jack dashes following
marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter
an old clerk sifts through the clothes begins writing on a pad
youre selling those
marla steps down hard on jacks foot
he winces in pain
for the clerk to hear yes im selling some chothes
the clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts
so we each have three thats six
what about the seventh day
i want ascending bowel cancer
the girl had done her homework
i want ascending bowel cancer
the clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to marla
thats your favorite too
tried to slip it by me eh
well split it
you get it the first and third sunday of the month
jack tries to withdraw his hand marla holds it
looks like this is goodbye
lets not make a big thing out of it
she walks to the door pocketing money not looking back
hows this for not making a big thing
jack watches her go
a moment then he follows after
jack hesitates unsure then run walks to catch up to her
marla should we maybe exchange numbers
in case we want to switch nights
jack takes out a business card writes his number on the back hands it to her
she takes the pen grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm
she walks into the street causing more screeching and honking
she turns holds up the card
it doesnt have your name
who are you
any of the stupid names you give each night
jack starts to answer but the traffic noise is too loud
marla just shakes her head turns and keeps moving
a bus moves into view obscuring her
this is how i met marla singer
the plane touches down the cabin bumps
jacks eyes open
you wake up at ohare
jack snaps awake again looking around disoriented
you wake up at seatac
the rear of a crashed car sticks up by the side of the road
jack stands marking on a clipboard
the sun sets behind
jack stands at a gate counter
an attendant smiles at him
check in for that flight doesnt begin for another two hours sir
jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch steps away and looks at an overhanging clock
pacific mountain central
lose an hour gain an hour
this is your life and its ending one minute at a time
jacks eyes snap open as the plane lands
you wake up at air harbor international
jack stands on a conveyor belt briefcase at his feet
he watches people moving past on the opposite conveyor
if you wake up at a different time and in a different place could you wake up as a different person
jack misses seeing tyler on the opposite conveyor belt
they pass each other
jack sits next to a businessman
as they have idle conversation we move in on jacks tray
an attendants hands set coffee down with a small container of cream
everywhere i travel tiny life
single serving sugar single serving cream single pat of butter
hands place a dinner tray down
microwave cordon bleu hobby kit
jack brushes his teeth in the mirror
shampoo conditioner combo
single serving mouthwash tiny bar of soap
jack picks up an individual wrapped q tip looks at it
he moves out of the bathroom into
jack sits on the bed
he turns on the tv
its tuned to the sheraton channel shows waiters serving people in a large banquet room
jack stops brushing his teeth feels something on the bed lifts it a small dinner mint
jack sits next to a frumpy woman
jack turns to look at his food takes a bite
he turns back and its
a bald man next to him talking
jack takes another bite turns back and its
a businessman next to him
jack takes another bite turns back and its
a business woman next to him
the people i meet on each flight theyre single serving friends
between take off and landing we have our time together but thats all we get
jacks eyes snap open
you wake up at logan
a giant corrugated metal door opens
on a long enough time line the survival rate for everyone drops to zero
two technicians lead jack to the burnt out shell of a wrecked automobile
jack sets down his briefcase opens it and starts to make notes on a clipboarded form
im a recall coordinator
my job is to apply the formula
its a story problem
heres where the infant went through the windshield
a new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at miles per hour
the rear differential locks up
the teenagers braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good anti smoking ad
the car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside
now do we initiate a recall
the father mustve been huge
see how the fat burnt into the drivers seat with his polyester shirt
very modern art
take the number of vehicles in the field a and multiply it by the probable rate of failure b then multiply the result by the average out of court settlement
a times b times c equals x
jack is speaking to the businesswoman next to him
if x is less than the cost of a recall we dont do one
are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
oh you wouldnt believe
car company do you work for
a major one
jack turns to the window
he sees a pelican get sucked into the turbine
every time the plane banked too sharply on take off or landing i prayed for a crash or a mid air collision anything
jacks face remains bland during the following the plane buckles the cabin wobbles
no more haircuts
nothing matters not even bad breath
the side of the plane shears off
screaming passengers are sucked out into the night air flying past the quivering wind
magazines and other objects fly everywhere
life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip
jack remains in his same position same bland expression
the seatbelt light goes out
jack snaps awake
everything is normal
some passengers get out of their seats
from next to jack a voice weve heard before
there are three ways to make napalm
one mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice
jack turns to see tyler
without turned to jack tyler continues two equal parts gasoline and diet cola
three dissolve kitty litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick
tyler turns to jack
this is how i met tyler durden
tyler offers his hand
jack takes it
you know why they have oxygen masks on planes
no supply oxygen
oxygen gets you high
in a catastrophic emergency were taking giant panicked breaths
tyler grabs a safety instruction card from the seatback hands it to jack
suddenly we become euphoic and docile
we accept our fate
tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures
emergency water landing miles per hour
blank faces calm as hindu cows
what do you do tyler
what do you want me to do
i mean for a living
so you can say oh thats what you do
and be a smug little shit about it
tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a briefcase
you have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
jack points to his own briefcase
we have the same briefcase
tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward jack
jack looks at tyler then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly wrapped bars of soap
soap the yardstick of civilization
reaches in his pocket i make and sell soap
tyler hands jack his card
the paper street soap company
if you were to add nitric acid to the soap making process one would get nitroglycerin
with enough soap one could blow up the world if one were so inclined
tyler snaps the briefcase shut
tyler you are by far the most interesting single serving friend ive ever met
tyler stares back
jack enjoying his own chance to be witty leans closer to tyler
you see when you travel everything is small self contained the spork
i get it
youre very clever
hows that working out for you
thrown well uh
keep it up then
keep it right up
tyler stands looks towards the aisle
as i squeeze past do i give you the ass or the crotch
tyler moves to the aisle his ass toward jack walks away
we are defined by the choices we make
tyler goes to the curtain dividing first class slaps the curtain aside and sits in an empty seat
how i came to live with tyler is airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage
utterly empty of baggage
no people except for jack and a security task force man
the security tfm smirking holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall
to jack throwers dont worry about ticking
modern bombs dont tick
but when a suitcase vibrates the throwers have to call the police
my suitcase was vibrating
nine time out of ten its an electric razor
but every once in a while
whispers its a dildo
its airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo
we use the indefinite aricle a dildo
never your dildo
jack sees through the window tyler at the curb throwing his briefcase into the back of a shiny red convertible
tyler leaps over the door into the drivers seat and peels out
jack turns away looks at the security tfm
in the background a harried man dashes after tyler and the convertible screaming
to security tfm i had everything in that bag
into phone yeah uh huh
pause still on phone oh
a lone suitcase sits on the concrete
security personnel keep their distance
the suitcase explodes
the security tfm shakes his head hangs up
im terribly sorry
the security tfm hands jack a claim form
jack snatches it disgusted takes out a pen starts filling out the form
you know the industry slang for flight attendant
along a residential street
jack looks ahead sees a tall grey bland building on the corner
home was a condo on the fifteenth floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals
the walls were solid concrete
a foot of concrete is important when your next door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume
the taxi turns a corner and jack sees the front of the building
a diffuse cloud of smoke wafts away from a blown out section of the fifteenth floor
firetrucks police cars and a mob are all crowded around the lobby area
or when a volcanic blast of debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out your floor to ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night
jack gaping at the sight above him absently gives the cabbie money
the taxi pulls away
jack starts toward the building
he pushes through the fray of people into the
the doorman sees jack enter gives a sad smile shakes his head
jack starts for the elevator
theres nothing up there
jack presses the button
the doorman moves next to him
you cant go into the unit
the elevator doors open
the doors close
jack heads out the lobby doors
the doorman follows
jack walks past smoking charred debris a flash of orange from the yang table a clock face from the hall clock part of an arm from the green armchair
his feet crunch glass
do you have somebody you can call
jack comes to his refrigerator lying on its side
he reaches down and takes a note marla and a phone number from under a banana magnet
the police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out
letting out just a little bit of gas
jack gets to a payphone
the doorman follows watching him
lots of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things
jack picks up the receiver puts in a quarter
he looks at marlas number a long moment
the sound of the hiss
the gas could have slowly filled the condo
seventeen hundred square feet with high ceilings for days and days
jack replaces the receiver
he pockets marlas number digs out a small filofax
he flips through the pages for phone numbers and addresses
most of the pages are blank
many young people feel trapped and desperate
then the refrigerators compressor could have clicked on
screen goes white
jack looks at the doorman
tylers business card falls from the filofax
jack catches it
if you dont know what you want you end up with a lot you dont
the doorman walks away
jack stares at tylers card
if you asked me now i couldnt tell you why i called him
jack re deposits the quarter dials tylers number
and rings and rings
jack sighs and hangs up the phone
a moment then the phone rings
we met on the plane
we had the same briefcase
you know the clever guy
i just called a second ago
there was no answer
im at a payphone
i star sixty nined you
i never pick up my phone
let me see
heres the thing
a small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot
jack and tyler sit in the back with a pitcher of beer
you buy furniture
you tell yourself this is the last sofa ill ever need
no matter what else happens ive got the sofa issue handled
then the right set of dishes
the right dinette
this is how we fill up our lives
tyler lights a cigarette
i guess so
and now its gone
tyler offers cigarettes
could be worse
a woman could cut off your penis while youre asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car
theres always that
i dont know maybe im wrong
maybe its a terrible tragedy
i mean you did lose a lot of nice neat little shit
the trendy paper lamps the euro trash shelving unit am i right
jack laughs nods
he shakes his head drinks
but maybe just maybe youve been delivered
toasts delivered from swedish furniture
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns
delivered from martha stewart
delivered from bullshit colors like cobalt ebony and fuchsia
they laugh together
insurancell cover it
oh yeah you gotta start making the list
the now i get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again list
this time maybe get a widescreen tv
youll be occupied for weeks
well i have to file a claim
the things you own they end up owning you
do what you like
looks at watch god its late
i should find a hotel
so you called me up because you just wanted to have a drink before you
go find a hotel
i dont follow
were on our third pitcher of beer
just ask me
you called me so you could have a place to stay
why dont you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place
would that be a problem
is it a problem for you to ask
can i stay at your place
yes you can
but i want you to do me one favor
i want you to hit me as hard as you can
i want you to hit me as hard as you can
let me tell you a little bit about tyler durden
and we see its pornography
jack in the foreground faces camera
in the background tyler sits at a bench looking at individual frames cut from movies
near him a projector rolls film
tyler was a night person
he sometimes worked as a projectionist
a movie doesnt come in one big reel its on a few
in old theaters two projectors are used so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins
sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner
tyler points to the side of our frame and the two dots briefly appear onscreen
theyre called cigarette burns
its called a changeover
the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea
why would anyone want this shitty job
it affords him other interesting opportunities
like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films
in reel three right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag who have celebrity voices eat out of a garbage can theres the flash of tylers contribution
in the audience children suddenly start squirming confused looking at each other
a woman abruptly stops sucking her soda straw feeling vaguely terrible
her uncomfortable husband slowly leans back in his seat
jack and tyler watch from the projection booth window
one forty eighth of a second
thats how long its up there
no one really knows that theyve seen it
but they did
a nice big cock
only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work
tyler moves around one of many tables setting down soup bowls
jack stands in the same position facing camera
tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the luxurious pressman hotel
the guests command the waiters with snaps of fingers
jack turns and we pan to tyler standing by a cart with a giant soup tureen
his hands are at his open fly and hes in position to piss into the soup
he was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry
i cant if you watch
the sound of a stream of liquid is heard
he farted on meringue he sneezed on braised endive and with creme of mushroom soup well
you get the idea
tyler and jack come out the back door
i dont know about this
i dont know either
i want to find out
ive never been hit have you
thats a good thing isnt it
i dont want to die without any scars
how much can you really know about yourself if youve never been in a fight
youre the only person ive ever asked
jack stares at him
why not you
im letting you go first
this is crazy
alright go crazy
let er rip
where do you want it
in the face
jack swings a wide clumsy roundhouse hits tylers neck makes a dull flat sound
that didnt count
tyler shoots out a straight punch to jacks chest
jack falls back against a car
his eyes tear up
how do you feel
but a good strange
weve crossed the threshold
you want to call it off
call what off
this fight pussy
jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under tylers ear
tyler punches jack in the stomach
tyler and jack move clumsily throwing punches
they breathe heavier drooling saliva and blood growing dizzier from every impact
jack and tyler sit on the curb watching sparse headlights on the nearby freeway
their eyes are glazed with endorphin induced serenity
they look at each other laugh
if you could fight anyone
one on one whoever you wanted who would you fight
my boss probably
pause who would you fight
a long pause as jack studies tylers face
nodding i didnt know my dad
well i knew him till i was six
he went and married another woman had more kids
every six years or so hed do it again new city new family
he was setting up franchises
my father never went to college so it was really important that i go
i know that
after i graduated i called him long distance and asked now what
he said get a job
when i turned twenty five i called him and asked now what
he said i dont know
a generation of men raised by women
im wondering if another woman is the answer we really need
jack feels his bleeding lip smiles
we should do this again sometime
tyler cracks a smile give a sidelong glance to jack
a street sign paper street
a paper mill stis on one side facing a lone house on the other
the rest of the land is grass and weeds
its a grand old three story long abandoned
tyler leads jack toward it
wheres your car
i dont know how tyler found the house but hed been there for half a year
tyler leads jack through the front door
it looked like it was waiting to be torn down
most of the windows were boarded up
tyler and jack climb creaky stairs to the nd floor landing
none of the doors locked
the stairs were ready to collapse
i didnt know if he owned it or he was squatting
tyler opens the door to a room
jack enters stis on the creaky bed
dust drifts upwards
neither would have surprised me
jack turns on the water
loud vibrations from the walls
water spits in starts
the rusty plumbing leaked
turning on a light meant another light in the house went out
all the taverns lights are off
tyler and jack fight
five guys stand around watching
jack his face showing new bruises and cuts makes coffee with a wire mesh strainer
tyler shuffles in wearing a flannel bathrobe
he spears pieces of bread on a fork starts roasting them over a burner
there were no neighbors
just warehouses and the paper mill
the fart smell of steam the hamster cage smell of wood chips
jack sits watching as tyler swings an old golf club thwack sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street
at night tyler and i were alone for half a mile in every direction
all the lights are off
ten guys yell standing around jack and tyler who fight
three cars are parked in the lot
jack sits on basement stairs watching as tyler knee deep in water works at an open fusebox flipping breakers in a certain order showing jack how its done
when it rained we had to kill the power
by the end of the first month i didnt care about tv
i didnt mind the warm stale refrigerator
tyler and jack are seated across from each other on the buckled floor reading magazines
rain drips from the ceiling
thousands of magazines
the previous occupant had been a bit of a shut in
of magazine hum
oh a new riot control grenade
the successful combination of concussive foot candle flash blasts and simultaneous high velocity disbursement of
blah blah blah
tyler begins ripping the article from his magazine
readers digest i am joes lungs
its written in first person
without me joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells
theres a whole series i am joes prostate
i get cancer and i kill joe
tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles chooses another magazine
what are you reading
soldier of fortune
all the lights are off
jack and tyler stand amidst fifteen guys around two guys fighting
the crowd yells more wildly than before
in the background are eight parked cars
i should have been haggling with my insurance company
i should have been looking for a new condo
jack walks along
he stops looking at a church with support group people milling around the entrance drinking coffee and sodas
marlas there amongst them smoking
i should have been upset about my nice neat flaming little shit
jacks face shows no reaction
he continues to walk
but i wasnt
jack in work clothes interlocks his fingers and pops his knuckles picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips
tyler in waiters uniform comes to have jack straighten his tie
most of the week we were ozzie and harriet
jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door
but wednesday night ever wednesday night
all the lights are off
no one around but there are at least twenty five cars parked in the full lot
we were finding something out we were finding out more and more that we were not alone
a slide show progresses run by a chipper salesman walter
jack sits deadpan with a puffy lip and a bruised cheek
thursday mornings all i could do was think about next week
boss gives jack a dubious look
walters next slide a the basic premise of cyber netting your office is make things more efficient
can i get the icon in cornflower blue
walter continues his sales pitch drowned out by jacks v
walter the microsoft account exec
walter with his smooth soft hands
maybe he was thinking about the free range potluck hed been to last weekend or his church group car wash fund raiser
or probably not
walter moves to jack and slaps him in the shoulder
i showed this already to my man here
you liked it didnt you
his teeth are red with blood
they glow eerily in the dim light
you can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick
jesus id hate to see what happened to the other guy
jack keeps the smile frozen on his face
his candy ass wouldnt last a second wednesday night
out of silent darkness headlights appear from all directions
cars pull up and park in the already packed lot
young men get out and march into the tavern
the men including jack and tyler enter and stand against the back wall waiting
the bartender irvine calls out drink up people
irvine flicks on the lights
drunken customers squint and get the message
they plop down money leaving
it was right in everyones face
tyler and i just made it visible
irvine hits a button and the jukebox loses power
members of the waiting army begins to share secret looks
finally one buy locks the door
two other guys close the blinds
it was on the tip of everyones tongue
tyler and i just gave it a name
a bomb shelter
one bare bulb above tyler standing directly beneath it
welcome to fight club
the guys mill around finding partners
everyone brims with eagerness but tries to act cool
chatter gets louder
everyone spreads out forming a circle tyler at center
every week tyler gave the rules that he and i decided
peaking chatter till tyler raises his arms and the chatter dies
a couple of coughs feet shuffling then silence
the first rule of fight club is you dont talk about fight club
the second rule of fight club is you dont talk about fight club
the third rule of fight club is when someone says stop or goes limp the fight is over
fourth rule is only two guys to a fight
fifth rule one fight at a time
sixth rule no shirts no shoes
seventh rule fights go on as long as they have to
and the eighth and final rule if this is your first night at fight club you have to fight
tyler steps back
a short guy ricky and a goateed man take off shirts and shoes and step to the center
this kid ricky supply clerk couldnt remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink
the two fighters circle then begin throwing punches
but ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size
harder faster punches between the two
shouts become deafening
rickys getting the best of goateed man pounding him
sometimes all you could hear were flat hard packing sounds over the yelling or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed
spittle lipped ssssstop
jack eating lunch watches the broken nosed waiter with a goatee from the above fight converse with a maitre d
even if i could tell someone they had a good fight i wouldnt be talking to the same man
the goateed waiter approaches jack and sets a refill soda down on the table
the two of them briefly make eye contact
who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world
jack stands over a copy machine hit by flashes of light
he glances over his shoulder watches ricky wearing an apron push a supply cart
ricks nods at jack
you werent alive anywhere like you were there
but fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends
jack playing solitaire on his computer daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief
boss passing by the doorway looks in at jack irritated
what are you getting yourself into every week
jack keeps playing solitaire
boss enters folds his arms
after fight club everything else in your life gets the volume turned down
you can deal with anything
have you finished those reports
handing him reports yes
the people who had power over you have less and less
jack looks at boss
reflexively jacks tongue plays with his teeth
by this point i could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw
tyler and jack walk both smoking cigarettes
a guy came to fight club for the first time his ass was a wad of cookie dough
after a few weeks he was carved out of wood
if you could fight any celebrity
alive or dead
they reach a bus stop as a bus arrives tossing their cigarettes getting on board
the bus is crowded
as tyler and jack walk toward the back jack studies the faces of other passengers
we all started seeing things differently
wherever we went
they hold hand grips
jack looks up at an advertisement a calvin klein ad featuring a tan bare chested muscle stud
i felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms trying to look like what calvin klein and tommy hilfiger said they should
tyler looks at jack looks at the c
self improvement is masturbation
self destruction is the answer
a man in a suit knocks tylers shoulder as he passes
the man takes a handle close by
jacks pissed staring at the man who stares back
to tyler so the man can hear you could take him
tyler looks to jack glances over his shoulder at the man
tyler casually picks a small scab off jacks nostril
the trick is not to care
tyler stares forward
tyler hits the floor stomach first
his opponent lands on top of him grappling trying for a choke hold
the surrounding crowd jack included screams at them
tyler and the opponent wrestle desperately and tyler flips his attacker gets on top sprawling to pin him
tyler turns starts reining punches into the opponents groin
jack lands a couple of blows to his opponents stomach brings up a left uppercut that smashes the opponents jaw
tiny spatters of blood adorn the walls along with sweat
jack catches sight of a swollen faced tyler watching appreciatively a smile growing slowly on his face
fight club wasnt about winning or losing
it wasnt about words
the opponent recovers throws a headlock on jack
jack snakes his arm into a counter headlock
they wrestle like wild animals
the crowd cheers maniacally
they hysterical shouting was in tongues like at a pentecostal church
onlookers kneel to stay with the fight cheering louder
the opponent smashes jacks head to the floor over and over
when the fight was over nothing was solved but nothing mattered
everyone moves in as the opponent steps away
tyler pushes through the crowd
others lift jack up
they turn their attention to the floor to a blood mask of jacks face similar to the tear mask on bobs shirt
jack limply shakes his opponents hand
how about next week
look at me
how about next month
everyone helps jack walk
hes sweating bleeding smiling
afterwards we all felt saved
a nurse tends to jack while tyler watches
he fell down some stairs
the nurse doesnt look at tyler just keeps tending to jack
i fell down some stairs
sometimes tyler spoke for me
tyler and jack share the cracked mirror
tylers clipping at his hair with blunt ill suited scissors
jacks brushing his teeth spitting out pink foam
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails
any historical figure
skinny guys fight till theyre burger
jack reaches in his mouth exploring pulls yanks a tooth
jack looks at it
tyler puts scissors down done
remember even the mona lisas falling apart
jack drops the tooth in the sink with tylers hair
jack enters buttoning his shirt
the phone rings
marlas in the hall on the payphone twisting the phone cord around her neck
where have you been the last few weeks
jack looks through the archway and sees tyler in his gummy flannel bathrobe doing sit ups
jack leans cups the phone
quietly how did you find me
the forwarding number
i havent seen you at any support groups
thats the idea we split them
you havent been going to yours
i found a new one
its for men
like testicular cancer
look this is a bad time
ive been going to debtors anonymous
you want to see some truly fucked up people
im just on my way out
i got a stomach full of xanax
i took what was left of a bottle
mightve been too much
jack looks exasperated turns to look into the camera
picture yourself watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment
this isnt a for real suicide thing
this is probably one of those cry for help things
this could go on for hours
so youre staying in tonight
do you want to wait to hear me describe death
jack puts the handset on top of the phone still off the hook walks out the back door
do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone
thru the archway tyler leans to look in curious
grunts of pleasure and exertion
glimpses of torsos asses legs arms breasts and female hair all drenched in sweat
bodies hit the floor
insane grunting and laughing
a flash of marlas face
jack sits up in bed looks around the room
jack steps out of his room
the neighboring door is closed
tylers door was closed
id been living here two months and tylers door was never closed
jack stares into the toiler looking at six used condoms
jack sits at the table sips coffee read readers digest
he hears footsteps approaching
youre not going to believe what i dreamt last night
marla walks in straightening her dress looks like shes been raped by a hurricane
jacks jaw drops
i can hardly believe anything about last night
marla goes to pour coffee
she takes a swig gargles and spits it in the sink
she gives jack a lascivious smile
what are you doing here
what the hell are you doing here
marla stares at him a beat then drops the cup in the sink
marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out
jack gets up watches her stomp away
jack turns and tyler is at his shoulder staring after marla
hes in his usual sweatpants
he grins at jack then moves away pours himself coffee
jack smoldering slumps at the table and picks up readers digest
tyler puts his foot on a countertop does stretching exercises
shes a piece of work
get this i come in here last night the phones off the hook
jack pretends to read quickly glances at tyler
tylers i already knew the story before he told it to me
tyler enters gently lifts the handset and listens
from handset ill tell you when im floating out of my body
how could tyler off all people think it was a bad thing that marla singer was about to die
tyler a wry smile on his face ambles up the stiars looking at the rotting walls
he reaches the top of the stairs and heads for marlas room
before he can knock marlas hand shoots out and grabs him
marla pulls tyler inside and shuts the door
her drugged eyes look him over
you got here fast
she staggers and sits on the bed
she slides off along with the blanket and sheets to the floor
the mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic
she tries to focus her eyes on tyler
did i call you
tyler studies her with cynical curiosity looks at a dildo lying atop a dresser
marla follows his gaze
its not a threat to you
sirens and vehicles screeching outside can be heard doors opening and slamming running footfalls
somebody called the cops
she gets to her feet grabs tyler pulls him out the door
marla locks her door then pulls tyler toward the staircase
cops and paramedics charge up with oxygen and medical kits
marla and tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass
pointing end of the hall
the rescuers keep running
calling after the girl who lives there used to be a charming lovely girl but shes lost faith in herself
miss singer let us help you
you have every reason to live
marla yanks tylers arm heading down the stairs
shes a monster
infectious human waste
good luck trying to save her
tyler makes coffee
marla slouches against the refrigerator
if i fall asleep im done for
youre gonna have to keep me up all night
tyler chuckles shakes his head
he was obviously able to handle it
tyler stands across from jack gets a cigarette from a pack
i mean this girl
uh youre not into her or anything
not at all
i am jacks raging bile duct
tyler lights his cigarette
yeah im sure
this chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room
the things that she said
ive never heard a woman talk like that
tyler smokes post coital
marla puts her lips to his ear
whispering i want to have your abortion
tyler laughs shakes his head
jacks gripping his readers digest just a little too tight
how could tyler not go for that
night before last he was splicing sex organs into little mermaid
tyler sits studies jacks face
youre okay with this
put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains
she is a wild twisted bitch
stay away from that one
oh and my pace is more librarians
dont knock librarians
marla doesnt need a lover
she needs a case worker
she needs an exorcist
this isnt love
this is sport fucking
shed invaded my support groups now shes invading my home
do me a favor
sit here a minute
tyler pulls out a closer chair motions to it
jack puts down his readers digest and moves to that chair
youve gotta understand something about me
i have a little rule okay
dont ever talk to her about me
i cant stand that kind of shit
tyler fixes jack with a friendly but firm stare
if you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house to her or anyone i will find out
and youll never see me again
promise you wont
yes i promise
i said i promise
that was three times you promised
tyler smiles gets up and leaves
jack sits smoldering
if only i had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch marla die none of this would have happened
jack watches tv at high volume
sounds of sex from upstairs
jack lies calmly on his bed staring at the ceiling
sounds of thumps and crashes from beyond the wall
muffled through wall miserable fucking discharge
i couldve moved to another room one on the third floor so i wouldnt have heard them
but i didnt
sounds of rain
jack flips fuses off then walks upstairs
jack walks hears marla scream in orgasm
he reaches the landing
tylers door is ajar
jack peeks in
marlas legs are sprawled on the bed
the door pushes open wider tyler naked stands close to camera
what are you doing
jack steps back
just going to bed
tyler scratches his head wears a rubber glove
you want to finish her off
jack continues toward his room
jack brushes his teeth
i became the calm little center of the world
i was the zen master
haiku is being typed in a trendy italicized font
worker bees can leave even drones can fly away the queen is their slave i wrote little haiku poems
jacks clothes are permanently stained with blood
he sits in zen pose cigarette in mouth finishes typing haiku
i faxed them around to everyone
he hits send gets the error chime sound
he presses this key over and over
is that your blood
some of it yes
boss stares at jack like hes from mars
take the rest of the day off
come back tomorrow with clean clothes
get yourself together
jacks leaving looks like a war casualty passing coworkers who coldly stare at him
his face is totally passive
i got right in everyones hostile little face
yes these are bruises from fighting
im comfortable with them
i am enlightened
jack walks toward the house
you give up the condo life give up all your flaming worldly possessions go live in a dilapidated house in the toxic waste part of town
jack walks in
sounds of violent sex and a polaroid camera from upstairs
pieces of plaster fall from the ceiling
and you come home to this
laughing you fucking slut
thank you sir may i have another
thank you sir may i have another
jack rolls his eyes takes off his pants
he runs water in the sink finds a tiny bit of soap and scrubs at the blood stains
the phone rings
he answers it
a cop detective stern refers to a file
this is detective stern with the arson unit
we have some new information about the incident at your condo
i dont know if youre aware
your front door it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder
no i wasnt aware
i am jacks cold sweat
does this sound strange to you
yes sire strange
jack starts to sweat scrubs his pants obsessively
it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride
do you know what that means
what does that mean
it means it was homemade
really a shock
whoever set this homemade dynamite couldve blown out the pilot light days before the explosion
the gas it seems was just a detonator
who do you think couldve done this
ill ask the questions son
whispering in jacks ear tell him
jack almost leaps out his skin startled looks to see tyler standing right next to him
overlap w below the liberator who destroyed my property has re aligned my paradigm of perception
into phone overlap w above i dont know what to make of this sir i really dont
do you know anyone whod have the expertise or motive to do something like this
i reject the basic assumptions of civilization including material possession
jack pushes tyler away cups the receiving
into phone no
i loved that condo
i loved every stick of furniture
the lamps the chairs the rugs were me
the dishes were me
the plants were
id like to thank the academy
well if any ideas come to you give me a call
in the meantime dont leave town
i may need to bring you in for questioning
jack hangs up
could be worse
you could be cursed with the three terrible karmas
you could be beautiful rich and famous
jack turns away continues to scrub his pants
marlas footsteps can be heard coming downstairs
jack really grinds the soap against the pants splashing water
he turns sees marla enter
tyler is gone
marla lights a cigarette
except for their humping tyler and marla were never in the same room
i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar
keeps scrubbing worth every penny
my parents pulled this exact act for years one came in the other disappeared
marla begins a slow exotic dance moving very close to jack
she lifts her dress dangerously high dancing close to jacks body almost touhcing
seductive its a bridesmaids dress
someone loved it intensely for one day then tossed it
like a christmas tree so special then bam its abandoned on the side of the road tinsel still clinging to it
jack becomes very aware of having no pants on presses against the counter
marla pulls her hemline further up
like sex crime victims underwear inside out bound with electrical tape
coldly it suits you
she leans in very close to jacks ear whispers hoarsely you can borrow it sometime
jack takes a step away keeps scrubbing
marla blows smoke in his face
jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink
marla backs away fed up storms out going upstairs
get rid of her
jack turns to see tyler in the doorway
you get rid of her
pointing at jack dont mention me
marlas footsteps are coming downstairs
jack looks to the archway then back at tylers gone
marla enters shoes and balled up clothing under one arm looking for something on the junk strewn table
im six years old again passing messages between my parents
think you should go now
marla ignores still searching the table tossing things pushing other things off to the floor
its time for you to leave
dont worry im leaving
marla finds what she wanted a pack of cigarettes
she moves up into jacks face
youre such a nutcase i cant even begin to keep up
she laughs spins on her heels
as she exits the back door she sings this merry go round from valley of the dolls
jack watches her through the kitchen window
tylers right behind him
through the window marla can be seen walking away
tyler picks up the remnant of soap jacks been using holds it up to jack
to make soap first we have to render fat
jack looks at tyler
tyler stands inside the fence
jacks atop the fence struggling to cross barbed wire
he wobbles gets over snags his shirt
jack falls rippppp
a flashlight beam
tyler pulls jack behind a dumpster one of dozens
a silhouette of a security guard moves along the perimeter flashlight first
he walks away
move back to tyler and jack who emerge from hiding
tyler eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster
the best fat for making soap because the salt balance is just right comes form human bodies
tyler lifts the lid it creaks
what is this place
a liposuction clinic
from the dumpster tyler pulls out an industrial sized thick plastic bag full of pink goo
from societys richest asses and thighs
time cut tyler and jack climb back over the fence carrying bags of fat
one of jacks bags rips spilling the goo down the chain link fench
jack slips and slides
tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag
jack and tyler each stir a boiling pot
as the fat renders the tallow floats to the surface
remember the crap they taught you in boy scouts
hard to imagine you in boy scouts
this clear layer in glycerin
well mix it back in when we make the soap
tyler sticks a spoon into a pot lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer
then he crabs a can opens it
lye the crucial ingredient
adding lye to mix ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river
because human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
year after year bodies burnt
water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye
the lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river
tyler licks his lips until theyre gleaming wet
he takes jacks hands and kisses the back of it
the first soap was made from the ashes of heroes
like the first monkeys shot into space
the saliva shines in the shape of the kiss
tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto jacks hand
without sacrifice without death we would have nothing
jacks whole body jerks
tyler holds tight to jacks hand and arm
tears well in jacks eyes his face tightens
this is a chemical burn
it will hurt more than youve ever been burned and you will have a scar
jack looks the burn is swollen glossy in the shape of tylers kiss
jacks face spasms
tylers kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand
look at your hand
guided meditation worked for cancer it could work for this
tyler looks at jacks glazed and detached eyes
come back to the pain
dont shut this out
jack snapping back tries to jerk his hand away
tyler keeps hold of it and their arms knock utensils off the table
i tried not to think of the words searing or flesh
i imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light
tyler jerks jacks hand getting jacks attention
this is your pain your burning hand
its right here
look at it
i was going to my cave to find my power animal
tyler jerks jacks hand again
jack re focuses on tyler
dont deal with this the way those dead people do
deal with it the way a living person does
jack tries to pull his hand free
tyler wont let go
jacks eyes glaze over again
jack speaks whiny from pain i
i think i understand
i think i get it
no what youre feeling is premature enlightenment
tyler slaps jacks face regaining his attention
this is the greatest moment of your life and youre off somewhere missing it
no im not
our fathers were our models for god
and if our fathers bailed what does that tell us about god
i dont know
tyler slaps jacks face again
listen to me
you have to consider the possibility that god doesnt like you he never wanted you
in all probability he hates you
this is not the worst thing that can happen
we dont need him
jack is a wide eyed zombie
we are gods unwanted children with no special place and no special attention and so be it
jack looks at tyler they lock eyes
jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain his body a quivering coiled knot
he bolts toward the sink but tyler holds on
you can go to the sink and run water over your hand
look at me
or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn but first you have to give up
first you have to know that someday you are going to die
until you know that you will be useless
jack spasms with a shiver of pain
you dont know what this feels like tyler
tyler shows jack a lye burned kiss scar on his own hand
tears begin to drip from jacks eyes
tyler grabs a bottle of vinegar pours it over jacks wound
jack closes his eyes holds his hand
slumps to the floor
youre a step closer to hitting bottom
jack and tyler in trench coats looking like deaht warmed over wait as a buyer fills out forms
there are bars of the paper street soap company soap on the counter
jack looks like hes half expecting to get arrested
his hand is bandaged
tyler sold the soap to department stores at twenty bucks a ear
god knows what they charged
we were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them
jack sits at his desk playing a game on his computer smoking a cigarette
he was wearing a yellow tie
it must be thursday
i didnt even wear a tie to work anymore
boss slaps a piece of paper down on jacks desk
the first rule of fight club is you dont talk about fight club
jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray stares up stoically
i mustve left the original in the copy machine
the second rule of fight club
is this yours
you dont get paid to abuse the copy machine
abuse the copy machine
theres an image
pretend youre me
you find this
what would you do
jack rises slowly walks to his door shuts it
id be very careful who i talked to about this
it sounds like someone dangerous wrote it
someone who might snap at any moment stalking from office to office with an armalite ar carbine gas semiautomatic bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co workers
jack moves very close to boss picks up the paper and starts tearing it into pieces
might be someone youve known for years
somebody very close to you
or maybe you shouldnt be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up
jack puts the paper in his trash
bass stares with a tinge of outrage a tinge of fear
jack answers it
compliance and liability
my tits going to rot off
just a second
to boss smiles could you excuse me
i need to take this call
boss goes to the door stares at jack a beat then leaves
into phone what are you talking about
would you do something for me
i need you to check and see if theres a lump in my breast
i cant afford to throw money away on a doctor
i dont know
she didnt call tyler
im neutral in her book
jack walks down the sidewalk seeing marla take two boxes from a van with the sign meals on wheels
marla leads jack inside
this is a sweet side of you
picking these up for
reads the boxes mrs
where are they
tragically theyre dead
im alive and im in poverty
you want any
he stares at her while she eats
what happened to your hand
jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back
marla stands facing a mirror with her shirt open
jack stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her breast
marlas hand guides his
jacks head is behind marlas
they speak softer slower
okay im sure
you feel nothing
marla turns around and faces him begins to button her shirt
well thats a relief
i wish i could return the favor
jack touches his own chest shakes his head
i think everythings okay here
i could check your prostate
marla leans to kiss him lingers for a bit longer than just friendly
jack pulls away
are we done
yeah were done
see you around
jack emerges from the lobby
he looks up at marlas window watches her silhouette
he walks away right into big bob the moose eating a donut and drinking orange juice
how are you
how are you
better than ive ever been in my life
still remaining men together
an intense look of born again fervor comes over bobs face
i found something new
really whats that
quietly the first rule is
you arent supposed to talk about it
and the second rule about it is
youre not supposed to talk about it
and the third rule
im a member
look at my face
bob roughly slaps jacks shoulder
thats a fucking great man
yeah both of us
you know about the guy who invented it
i hear all kinds of things
supposedly he was born in a mental institution
they say he only sleeps one hour a night
you know about this guy
the crowd screams insanely as bob and jack go at it in the circle of light
bobs eyes are wild with glee
everyone sneaks out of this new location weve seen none of these guys before its a new chapter
jack and bob stagger out last jack being in worse shape
they both grin with religious serenity
bob hugs jack
bob relaxes the hug and jack drops to the ground like a sack completely enervated from the beating he took
fight club this was mine and tylers gift
our gift to the world
jack has his briefcase on the table looks at paperwork
tyler wanders in carries a dirty pot to the sink
jack takes out a cigarette lights up
he offers the pack
no thanks i quit
where you headed
going to work
tyler scratches his chin absently
do what you like
tyler walks out the way he came
jack sits staring at his screen saver
jack steps into the open doorway knocks on the doorframe
boss looks up from his large expensive desk
we need to talk
where to begin
with your constant absenteeism
with your unpresentable appearance
youre up for review
i am jacks complete lack of surprise
boss sits up in his seat becoming enraged
youre the department of transportation and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects
brake linings that fail after a thousand miles
fuel injectors that burn people alive

in exchange for my salary ill keep my mouth shut
i wont need to come to the office

boss stands moves around his desk glaring with rage
you little fucker
jack punches himself in the nose
blood starts to trickle
he punches himself in the jaw throws himself back as if by the force of the punch slams against a framed picture and shatters the glass
he falls to the floor
i am jacks smirking revenge
jack gets back to his feet
dont hit me again please
im your responsibility
he punches himself in the stomach then in the jaw again
he reels backwards pulls down a hanging shelf its contents flying
he hits the floor
for some reason i thought of my first fight with tyler
jack crawls toward boss dripping blood grabs bosss leg
give me the paychecks like i asked for
i wont be any trouble
you wont see me again
jack climbs up bosss leg while boss tries to shake him off
boss stumbles back into his desk knocking off belongings
under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted something horrible had been growing
jack crawls high enough to grab bosss belt hoisting himself up
he dribbles blood an bosss clothing smudges blood from his face onto the knuckles of bosss hand
and right then at our most excellent moment together
two security guards enter and gape at the sight
behind them stand curious workers looking in
gurgling blood please dont hit me again
jack holds a check in front of tylers face
six months advance pay
jack digs in his pocket takes out a thick bundle of cards
forty eight airline flight coupons
just a minute
jack holds up a finger going to open the front door
he drags an unwieldy shopping cart in behind him filled with his computer phone fax and other office equipment
i am now officially self employed
jack looks at the cart then back at tyler proud
good for you
an enormous crowd of guys including jack and bob stands around tyler whos in the center of the circle holding up his hands to quiet them
i look around
i look around and see a lot of new faces
an enthusiastic rumble from the crowd
which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club
a glum silence falls
guys look at each other
i see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables or theyre slaves with white collars
more tyler cont advertisements have them chasing cars and clothes working jobs they hate so they can buy shit they dont need
we are the middle children of history with no purpose or place
we have no great war or great depression
the great war is a spiritual war
the great depression is our lives
we were raised by television to believe that wed be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we wont
and were learning that fact
and were very very pissed off
the crowd erupts into a deafening chorus of agreement
jack looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd
we are the quiet young men who listen until its time to decide
a fat middle aged man stomps down the stairs pushing into the crowd followed by a tall hefty thug who holds a gum
who are you
who am i
theres a sign on the front that says lous tavern
im fucking lou
who the fuck are you
tyler extends his hand for a shake but lou slaps it away
who told you motherfuckers you could use my place

tyler gains his breath determined
he looks up turns his head looking to jack
jack watches wide eyed
tyler straightens facing lou

lou punches tyler in the face
some of the guys move forward but the thug points his gun
jack runs forward anyway lou punches him in the face
more guys move forward but tyler waves them off facing lou

lou proceeds to beat the shit out of tyler punching his face his stomach
tyler collapses to the floor
lou starts kicking his
tyler bleeds from the mouth and face

youll feel better
lou flushes red with exasperation kicks more
finally sweating bewildered lou stops
he looks to the thug who is just as bewildered
suddenly tyler springs up grabs onto lou
yes i am shit and crazy to you and this whole fucking world
tylers blood spatters on lou
lou tries to shake tyler off but tyler bites lous necktie
the thug grabs tyler and pulls the necktie tightening and strangling lou
lou slaps at tylers face but recoils from the blood
tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth
you dont know where ive been
tyler bear hugs lou pulls him to the floor
tyler rubs his bloody face into lous face
the thug lifts tyler
tyler clings to lous belt dragging lou as he is dragged

tyler lets go of lous belt
lou scrambles away
the thug drops tyler trying to keep clear of the blood
lou gets to his feet looks at tyler then at the rest of the guys
he and the thug back away
slamming the door behind
fight club surrounds tyler
they help him up move him to a crate
tyler sits slumped for a long moment his breathing labored
then he sits back crossing his legs and looking to the group his demeanor businesslike
this week each of you has a homework assignment

raymond begins to weep shoulders heaving
an expired community college student id card

tyler rams the gun barrel against raymonds temple
i asked you what you studied

slow motion in the deserted office gasoline filled computer monitors begin to explode
luxury automobiles are parked splattered with bird shit
viewed out rd story window tyler uses a rake dragging it across rocks and dirt
he stops a moment rake on his shoulder staring off
then back to work
muttering quietly you are not how much money you have in the bank

tylers marking a large square in the weeds and rubble of the backyard kicking rocks away dragging the rake
you are not the contents of your wallet
the driver has a broken nose
the bus is empty except for jack in the very last seat sleepy
he had a plan
maybe you just didnt see it till it hit you between the eyes
pause but it started to make sense
in a tyler sort of way
the ability to let that which does not matter truly slide
jack gets off the bus
as the bus pulls away we see it dropped jack off right in front of the house
tyler dressed in fatigues and splattered with paint grabs beers from the refrigerator
jack notices rope and rappelling tools on the table

bob goes to turn up the tv
one guy sixteen years old with an angelic face angel face gets up to take beer from jack
to jack great thanks
angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts
jack looks to the tv it shows a live shot of the parker morris building
the building has a giant grinning face painted on it two broken windows for eyes with flames pouring out
firetrucks spray water
police commissioner jacobs has just arrived
just a second
excuse me commissioner could you tell us what you think has happened
commissioner jacobs a wrinkled official turns to camera
we believe this is related to the recent acts of vandalism around the city
its some kind of organized group and we are coordinating a rigorous investigation
jack turns sees tyler in the archway watching him
tyler tips his beer to toast pulls back out of sight
what did you guys do
they all burst into laughter
they look at jack and shake their heads
jack doesnt get it
suddenly the guys faces turn to stone
bob sits rigid
the first rule of project mayhem is
you do not ask questions
jack stares at them
a luxurious banquet
commissioner jacobs guzzles champagne
he rises and starts out of the room
jack in a waiters uniform looks apprehensively to other waiters bob
angel face who all give each other a look
jacobs saunters down an empty hall
he stops to check his tie in a mirror
he pushes open the door of the mens bathroom face to face with tyler
tyler grabs commissioner jacobs pulling him into the bathroom
he slaps a piece of tape over jacobs mouth
the other waiters rush in
jack stays back to keep the door shut
tyler and the others hold jacobs pulling down his pants
bob snaps a rubber band reaches to jacob s crotch
wrap it around the top of his hackie sack
man his balls are ice cold
ricky produces a knife moves it down to jacobs testicles
jacobs is bug eyed
jack red faced keeps his distance
youre not going to continue your rigorous investigation
you will publicly state that there is no underground group
or imagine the rest of your life with your scrotum flapping empty
mouth taped no
well send one to the new york times and one to the los angeles times
press release style
your nuts will be bicoastal
the people youre after are everyone you depend on
more tyler cont we do your laundry cook your food and serve you dinner
we guard you while you sleep
we drive your ambulances

ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife causing jacobs to jump ricky holds up the severed rubber band
jack tyler and the others file quickly out the back service entrance
tyler gives angel face a hearty slap on the back
angel face smiles at tyler nods grinning
jack sees this his eyes narrowing stops walking
fight club in full swing
jack battles angel face beating the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness
i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
the crowd shouts maniacally save tyler who watches with an inscrutable stone face
angel face tries to speak but jack pounds too hard
the crowd begins to grow quieter
i wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the french beaches id never see
finally angel face lies still unconscious
jack stops stares down numb
jack walks away the crowd parts to let him pass
jack scans faces
where did you go psycho boy
i felt like destroying something beautiful
tyler and jack walk through pools of streetlight
a idling car honks
tyler leads jack toward it
a bruised faced valet parker thrown keys to tyler but jack intercepts
there you are mr
airport parking long term
motions to car after you mr
tyler gets in the drivers seat
jack gets into the front passenger seat
ricky and the mechanic are in back
tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb
it has two bumperstickers recycle your animals and make mine veal
rain gushes down
jack stews silent
the car moves down a highway intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights
something on your mind
tyler shrugs turns on the radio ignores jack
why wasnt i told about project mayhem
what should i have told you
why wasnt i involved from the beginning
you and i started fight club together
fight club was the beginning
now its out of the basements and theres a name for it project mayhem
together the first rule of project mayhem is you do not ask questions
this is as much mine as yours
is this a needlepoint club
is it about you and me
you know what i mean
what do you want
a statement of purpose
should i e mail you
should i put this on your action item list
i want to know what do you want to know about project mayhem
together the first rule of project mayhem to ricky and mechanic shut up
to tyler i want to know whats going on
tyler steers the car into the opposite lane accelerates
opposing headlights get closer fast
this does not belong to us
we are not the leaders
we are not special
what are you doing
we are the all singing all dancing crap of the world
we are all part of the same compost heap
tyler steers back into the proper lane
the other car flies past horn sounding
what the hell
you choose your level of involvement
i wont make decisions for you
im not asking you to
youre asking questions that dont have answers
you know just as much about project mayhem as anybody else
i dont think thats true
tyler again steers into the oncoming lane speeding up
through the windshield oncoming headlights a truck
what is this
jack fights to turn the wheel but tyler uses both hands
what will you wish youd done before you died
paint a self portrait
build a house
to jack and you
i dont know
if you died right now how would you feel about your life
i would feel nothing about my life
is that what you want to hear
the oncoming truck honks and flashes its lights
it moves to the other side of the road
tyler steers there too
i want to hear the truth
fuck my life
fuck fight club
fuck you and fuck marla
im sick of this
why do you think i blew up your condo
hitting bottom isnt a weekend retreat
its not a seminar
you have to forget everything you know everything you think you know about life about friendship about you and me
nearing impact with the oncoming truck tyler takes his hands off the wheel jack keeps his grip turns the wheel
the car swerves
the truck roars past spraying water horn blasting
tyler looks at jack his hands in the air
jack looks at tyler with dead eyes
jack takes his hands off the wheel holds them in the air
tyler studies jack face impressed
tyler makes no move to take the wheel
through thr windshield a stalled car ahead on the side of the road surrounded by flares
jack and tylers eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder
heading for the stalled car
their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares
they smash into the stalled car airbags inflate
the back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass over tea kettle roll down a hill
id never been in a car accident
this mustve been what all those statistics felt like before i filed them into my reports
the car finally hits the bottom lying on its roof
tyler crawls from the passenger side
he walks around
opens the drivers side door and drags jack out into the mud
ricky and the mechanic climb out the broken rear window
tyler sits beside the stunned wounded jack
we just had a near life experience
jack lies in bed traumatized eyes empty staring at the ceiling
tyler sits in a nearby chair
in the world i see youre stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of rockefeller center
you will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life
you will climb the wrist thick kudzu vines that wrap the sears tower
you will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway
tyler stands gives jacks head a pat
leaving feel better champ
jack sits at the table sips coffee
hes pale dazed seems broken
he hears the faint sound of sawing and hammering unsure of where its coming from
marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter
her back is to jack as he looks at her
she pours ccffee and lights a cigarette
a beat of silence then ill be out of your way in a sec
she seems to be as weak as jack
dont have to
i mean it
pause have you been going to your groups
do you care
i dont know
it was the smart move on her part
marla turns to face jack a grim expression on her face
theres a bruise on her arm
jack gets up moves closer
why are we both
caught up like this
i came so close to saying tylers name i could feel it vibrate inside my mouth
marla looks a him waiting
i dont understand
why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person
to hang onto
what do you get out of it
faint sound of sawing and hammering
jack cant quite figure where its coming from
you hear that
sawing and hammering
have we been talking too long
must we change the subject
jack turns through the crack of the open basement door tylers staring at jack from the bottom of the stairs
harsh whisper youre not talking about me are you
jack reacts turns back to marla
to marla and tyler no
that day you came over to my place to play doctor
what was going on there
still a whisper what are you talking about
to marla and tyler nothing
i dont think so
whisper this conversation
marla comes to touch jacks hair
jack closes the basement door
marla sees the kiss scar on jacks hand grabs his hand
jack tries to pull it back but marla keeps a grip
what is this
who did this
guy or girl
why would you ask if its a guy or a girl
why would you get bent if i asked
let go of me
pulls his hand free leave me alone
youre afraid to say
marla backs away closes her eyes struggling with frustration
she leaves out the back door not looking back
jack leans against the wall
after a moment he opens the basement door heads downstairs
tyler walks upstairs passing as jack continues down
jack looks around
triple decker bunks clutter the basement as many as can fit into the space
calling upstairs tyler
whats this for
from upstairs the sound of the doorbell
jack opens the door
ricky stands on the porch staring ahead in subordinate military style
hes in black pants black shirt black shoes holds a paper bag with an army surplus mattress rolled up at his feet
what can i do for you ricky
tyler steps up beside jack looks ricky over
youre too young
wait a minute
tyler comes back inside shuts the door
if the applicant is young we tell him hes too young
old too old
fat too fat
if the applicant waits at the door for three days without food shelter or encouragement then he can enter and begin training
jack comes out walks around ricky hands in his pockets unsure
tyler watches nods for jack to go ahead
you should probably be on you way
no response from ricky who remains at attention
jack goes back inside
tyler closes the door
ricky remains at attention
jack bursts out with a broom knocks the brown bag out of rickys hand kicks it away
are you deaf
i told you to leave
you will never get inside this house
rickys still there
tyler comes out friendly
look friend im sorry for the misunderstanding
its not the end of the world
just go away
youre trespassing and i will call the police
ricky same spot
jack bursts outside with the broom again
youre never getting through this door you stupid little weasel
look at me when i talk to you
he whacks ricky in the shoulder with the broom
what is your major malfunction
at the window tyler sips coffee watches this scene on the porch below
sooner or later we all became what tyler wanted us to be
bob is now next to him in black with a paper bag in hand mattress at his feet
tyler steps out
jack stays in the doorway locking eyes on bob
to all the following questions ricky answers sir
you have two black shirts
two pair black trousers
one pair black boots
two pair black socks
one black coat
three hundred dollars personal burial money
ricky goes in
tyler turns to bob
youre too old
and youre too fat
nice seeing you
bob looks genuinely hurt
he picks up his mattress and starts away
tyler looks at jack and rolls his eyes
jack follows bob
leading bob back let me explain this to you
bob stands at at rigid attention
tyler and jack stand in bathroom doorway watching ricky finish shaving off all of his hair
tyler comes to give the top of rickys head a sharp slap
a monkey ready to be shot into space
a space monkey ready to sacrifice himself for project mayhem
from here on all those with shaved heads space monkeys
jack looks out the window
bob stands motionless
theres another applicant a short guy beside bob
ricky comes out the front door with the broom
to bob youre too fucking old fatty
we dont want your kind here
to short guy youre too short
go away stumpy
go back to the circus
ricky hits them with the broom then goes in slams the door
so it went
tyler works with a half dozen space monkeys preparing the square of backyard
they pull weeds clear rocks working with shovels rakes etc
they cart away wheelbarrows of rocks and carry in sacks of fertilizer
tyler built his army
in the kitchen window jack watches
jack keeps watching out the window eats toast
to what purpose might one ask
well one might ask if not for the first rule of project mayhem
jack turns to look around the kitchen
three space monkeys work one scrubbing the floor one washing dishes one scrubbing the walls
jack walks out
in tyler we trust
jack opens his eyes awakening to sunlight thru the window
jack slowly pushes open the door to tylers room
the room is empty
he was gone
jack comes downstairs
finds dozens of space monkeys
space monkeys render fat and make soap
they pinch herbs adding them to the mix
they add vodka
off to the side a couple monkeys stir a vat of rice
on the wall is a big bulletin board with hundreds of drivers licenses a sign above it human sacrifices
you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake
you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
we are all part of the same compost heap
jack dips a spoon into the rice chomps on it irritatingly
we are the all singing all dancing crap of the world
jack picks up a bottle of vodka
i had to hug the walls trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys cooking and working and sleeping in teams
jack enters vodka in hand
ten space monkeys here reading
the house became a living thing wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing
so many people moving the house moved
jack walks out
angel face reads a book marks on a chart
space monkeys shuffle papers and news clippings
walls are lined with files each labeled with a street address under signs mischief disinformation arson
jacks eye lingers on arson
he starts flipping through a file
angel face comes to take the file from him
that wouldnt interest you
the first rule of project right right
as angel face replaces the file jack notices a lye burned kiss scar on the back of angel faces hand
jack takes a swig of vodka smokes
in the background a space monkey whacks an applicant with a broom
its a ritual no words
other space monkeys tend the garden
im all alone
i am jacks broken heart
jack drops his cigarette in the gravel steps on it
a space monkey immediately comes to clean it up
get away from me
who are all these people
jack turns sees marla with an overnight bag
the paper street soap company
can i come in
hes not here
hes not here
tylers not here anymore
hes gone away
marla stares at jack miserable
a tear runs down her cheek
she turns and walks away
jack watches her go
theres a loud commotion from the house voices shouting
jack heads to the back door
ricky crawls bleeding from a gunshot wound to the leg
space monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating the wound
other space monkeys carry in a dead body in black clothes and ski mask putting it on the table
whats going on
space monkeys stare at the body
the mechanic sweating gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse its bob with a gunshot wound to the head
jack pushes past a space monkey stares down stricken
out of breath we were on assignment
a sculpture adorned with a giant globe on top
we were supposed to kill two birds with one stone a series of explosions blasts the globe free
a piece of corporate art
the globe rolls downhill to the street rolling over one parked luxury car after another crunching car roofs and causing windows to explode
and trash a trendy coffee bar
then the globe arrives at the lobby of a hotel
broadsides a limo ricochets
rolls directly into the front of a closed arrosto coffee bar smashing windows
decimating coffee push pats
bob the mechanic and ricky flee laughing at their handiwork
they split up running o
we had it all worked out man
it went smooth
sounds of gunshots and flashes of muzzle fire
the mechanic looks up from bobs corpse
they shot bob
they shot him in the head
jack walks away from bobs corpse distraught holds his head turns to look back his eyes filling with tears
we gotta do something
we got to get rid of the evidence
we have to get rid of this body
jack looks around in disbelief
take him there
lets do this
several space monkeys gather around bobs body
space monkeys stop
jack gets between them and bob shoves a few space monkeys back
get your hands off him
what the hell do you think youre doing
this is a man
you killed him
he was killed in action
look at you
youre running around in ski masks exploding things
he was killed serving project mayhem
its what he would have wanted sir
what he wanted
look at him
look at him
what does he want
wipes tears points at bob this is a person
this is not a cog in your machine
but this is project mayhem
this is a man this man has a name
but in project mayhem we have no names
this mans name is robert paulson
robert paulson is dead
hes dead because of you
everyone just stares at jack
in death a member of project mayhem has a name
his name is robert paulson
his name is robert paulson
his name is robert paulson
louder his name is robert paulson
his name is robert paulson
jack backs away surrounded pushes his way out of the room
jack barges in goes to the desk rifling through drawers
he finds flight coupons used and unused
the used coupons
have the flight information including the destination cities
the phone rings
jack answers it
from phone this is detective stern of the arson unit
id like to see you in my office tomorrow morning
jack in a panic hangs up
jack sits stiffly in a seat
i went to the cities on tylers used tickets stubs
jack hurries from the terminal runs to a taxi
in every city i branched out from the airport to downtown bar hopping
jacks looks out the window intently watching buildings
i didnt know how or why but i could look at fifty different bars and somehow i just knew
to driver points here
let me out right here
he sees several male patrons with fight bruises
jack moves to the bar
the bartender has a broken arm and swollen face
im looking for tyler durden

the bartender winks at jack
every city i went to
as soon as i set foot off the plane
i knew fight club was close
jack runs through the airport lugging his suitcase
tyler was setting up franchises all over the country
the proprietor his head bandaged is confronted by jack
i need to know where tyler is

i just need to know if youve seen tyler durden
im not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you nor would i even if i had said information you want at this juncture be able
jack looks around incredibly frustrated
you are a moron
im afraid i have to insist you leave
jack gives up shoves his way out the door
jack sits on the bus looking out the window
the bus stops
under and behind and inside everything i took for granted something horrible had been growing
out the window a construction worker with a broken nose works a jackhammer
he stops wipes his brow
tvs show football
jack is seated with two bruised patrons
no ones ever seen him
no one knows what he looks like
he has facial reconstructive surgery every three years
thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard
is it true about fight club in miami
durden building an army
am i asleep
jack sits awake
everyone around him is asleep
have i slept
im not sure if tyler is my bad dream or if im tylers
jack steps off the sidewalk hailing a taxi
the alleyways deserted
jack heaft to rusty cellar doors
he opens the doors looks around heads down stairs
i was living in a state of perpetual deja vu
jack enters this dark basement walks ahead in the dim light
the place is damp and empty
jack stops looks down
everywhere i went i felt i had already been there
at his feet dried blood on the concrete floor
jack walks in
the place is empty
he walks to a kitchen door opens it and peers in at
a group of kitchen workers solemnly stand in a circle chanting
his name is robert paulson
his name is robert paulson
from behind jack welcome back sir
jack whirls startled facing the wounded bartender who wears a neck brace his nose a smashed eggplant
how have you been
you know me
is this a test sir
its a test
you were in here last thursday night
you were standing right where you are now asking how good our security is
its tight as a drum
who do you think i am
is this part of the test
jack nods slowly
the bartender holds up his hand shows the kiss scar on the back of his hand
youre the one who did this to me
please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position
jack bursts inside out of breath runs to grab the phone punches a number doesnt bother to turn on the lamp
marla its me
have we ever had sex
what kind of stupid question is that
because the answers yes or because the answers no
is this a trick
will you just answer me for christsake
you mean you want to know if i think we were just having sex or making love
we did make love
is that what youre calling it
answer the question
you fuck me then snub me
you love me you hate me
you show me your sensitive side then you turn into a total asshole
is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship tyler
weve just lost cabin pressure
what did you say
what is wrong with you
say my name
say my name
whats my name
tyler durden you fucking freak
whats going on
im coming over there
marla no wait
as marla hangs up
jack stares at the receiver dazed
weve got six fight clubs in chicago now
jack spins dropping the phone tyler sits beside him
four in milwaukee
whats this all about tyler
and were definitely filling a void in the rural south
why do people think im you
you broke your promise
you talked to her about me
why do people think im tyler durden
why did you do that
answer me tyler
why do people think anything
i dont know
tyler shakes his head in disgust extremely irritated
people think that youre me because you and i happen to share the same body
is this really news to you
what are you talking about
sometimes i control it and you imagine yourself watching me
commissioner jacobs checks his tie in a mirror goes to open the door of the mens bathroom face to face with jack
jack stands surrounded by eager fight club members under the bare bulb talking and behaving like tyler
the first rule of fight club is you dont talk about fight club
and sometimes you control it
jack stands in the yard vodka in hand yells at marla
hes not here
tylers not here anymore
hes gone away
you can see me and hear me but no one else can
jack sits alone on the curb watching the nearby freeway
he talks to someone beside him but nobodys there
thinks my boss probably
pause who would you fight
jack listens looks at the empty space beside him
nodding i didnt really know my dad
but when you fall asleep i do things without you
jack is on top of marla sweating making violent love
i go places without you
get things done
the parker morris building
jack bob ricky angel face and another guy rappel down the side spraying paint
jack is tyler in demeanor mannerisms speech
shouting you are not your job
you are not how much money you have in the bank
two windows shatter outward two men look out and yell i am not my job
i am not how much money i have in the bank
jacks having trouble catching his breath
i asked for one thing from you
one simple promise
now look what youve done
this isnt possible
were going to have to do something about marla
what are you saying
a little codependent sure but
jack shakes his head in disbelief in denial
this isnt true
we were around other people together both of us
you never talked to me in front of anyone else
wrong wrong what about the car crash
the two guys in the backseat
what about them
you took me to the house
the house is rented in your name
you have jobs
night jobs while you were sleeping
what about marla
what about marla
youre fucking her
jack stands trying to absorb feeling ill trying to find words then he suddenly faints to the floor out cold
its called a changeover
the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea
jacks eyes snap open
he sits up alone
he remembers the previous night
looks at himself in the mirror
looks at the clock am
the room door slams open as jack bursts out of the room carrying his suitcase sprinting for the stairwell
jack races down three steps at a time dragging his suitcase boom boom boom behind him
jack hurries to the front door his suitcase half broken open passing the front desk
a desk clerk calls after him
are you checking out
the clerk follows the length of the counter waves a paper
please initial this list of phone calls
jack goes out the door freezes
he rushes back in going to the desk snatches the bill studies it many numbers
when were these made
it says right there sir
between two and three thirty this morning
jack looks at the clerk at the bill at the clerk
i need a copy of this
jack stares out the window his face set hard
had i been going to bed earlier every night
have i been sleeping later
has tyler been in charge longer and longer
a taxi halts
jack leaps out points to the grungy cabbie
jack walks in to find the place empty and deserted
he continues on into the kitchen gawks at bathtubs and canisters holding vast amounts of liquid
there are hoses gas masks beakers test tubes and pumps
he picks up a bottle labeled nitric acid
jack sits by the phone pulls out the hotel bill runs his finger up and down the list of phone numbers
deja vu all over again
jack finger stops on a number
he dials phone to his ear
from phone eighteen eighty eight
jack sees a file on the wall century park east
who is this

jack hangs up desperately dials the next number on the bill
front phone twenty one sixty
jack sees a file pico boulevard
he throws the phone pocketing the bill
he grabs up all the files
jacks taxi halts
marla walks out of the lobby doors sees jack getting out of the cab laden with files
marla makes a sharp turn walking away
jack follows hugging the files to his chest catching up
your whacked out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
i thought they were going to break my arm
im sorry i
the were burning their fingertips with lye
the stink was unbelievable
i need to talk to you
its going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out
here comes an avalanche of bullshit
marla heads into a diner
a little more faith than that
marla sits in a booth
jack sits across from her
i dont want to hear anything youve got to say
give me a minute marla alright
just sixty seconds
sixty seconds then im out of here
absolutely you have every right
i need you to do me a favor
ive done you enough favors
a waiter with a black eye appears at the table
anything you order is free of charge sir
why is it free of charge

then ill have the clam chowder
fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie
jack look to the pass through window into the kitchen where three cooks look out with stitches in their faces
clean food please

thanks no clam chowder
the waiter snaps to attention and leaves
you got about thirty seconds

ive only just realized what
i mean the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me

to waiter ill take my food to go
marlas getting up to go but jack rises fed up takes her by the arm putting her back in her seat
sit down and give me my last fifteen seconds without opening your mouth
marla crosses her arms
jack collects himself
im trying to tell you and this is where you have to trust me but i think your life might be in real danger
you have to get out of here

marlas getting upset tears coming to her eyes
theres a part of you i really like but i cant do this anymore
i just cant

marla gets up
jack grabs for her but shes gone heading for the door
jack gathers his files runs to follow
jack pushes out the door files under one arm catching up
i cant explain
you wouldnt believe me anyway
im trying to protect you
jack grabs her arm tries to hail a taxi but the taxi races past
marla pulls free screaming at him
let go of me
do this for me marla
do this for me if you never do anything else
jack spots a bus idling further up the street
leave me alone
i dont ever want to see you again
okay if thats what it takes youll never have to see me again
digs in his pocket here
he pulls money from his pocket holding it out
take this money get on this bus
pointing to bus get on and i promise you ill never bother you again if thats what you want
marla looks at jack numb
im begging you

get on the bus
marla takes the money from tyler walks towards the bus
as they approach it jack shields his eyes afraid to look
why are you doing this
i cant let myself see where youre going
go wherever it takes you remember
keep away from major cities
marla stands at the doors of the bus heartbroken gives one last look at jack
holds up the money im not paying this back
i consider it asshole tax
just get on
stay away a couple of weeks at least
jacks still covering his eyes
marla gets on the bus
jack finally looks to her
you are the worst thing that ever happened to me
doors hiss shut
the bus leaves heading away
jack seems relieved
then a scream is heard from marla
jack turns looks
through the bus windows the bus is filled with bald men in black space monkeys
jack sprints after the bus
the bus speeds away
onboard space monkeys subdue marla
jack falls to the asphalt rolls files flying
son of a bitch
jack runs to the front desk crazed dumps the armload of files on the desk in front of the desk sergeant
loudly i want you to arrest me
im the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the city
detective stern in arson knows who i am
detective stern and three detectives stand staring at jack whos seated
on the table are the phone bill and files
there are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area
chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities
theyre tightly regimented with many cells capable of operating without a central leader
check this address paper street
youll find the body of robert paulson buried in the garden
youll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin
the plan i believe is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the trw building
why these buildings
you are not your job
you are not how much money you have in the bank
to other detectives keep him talking
a beat then the remaining detectives smile at jack with reverence
i really admire what youre doing
youre a brave man to order this
youre a genius sir
they grab jack and force him on his back on the table
flat top has a rubber band the bald detective has a knife
you know the drill
you said if anyone ever tries to interfere with project mayhem even you we got to get his balls
flat top pulls jacks pants completely off tosses them aside
flat top holds his legs
its useless to fight
this is really a powerful gesture mr
itll set quite an example
youre making a mistake
you told us youd say that
im not tyler durden
you told us youd say that too
okay i am tyler durden and im ordering you to abort the mission
you said you would definitely say that
whats our best time for a cut and run
is somebody timing this
looks at his watch wait till the second hand gets to the twelve
a knock at the door
flat top slaps a hand over jacks mouth
he and redhead block view of the table as baldy opens the door a crack
stern mutters some of this info checks out
lets go to the place on paper street
baldy glances back at the other detectives leaves closing the door
the two remaining detectives continue
jack kicks and screams and writhes
the detectives wrangle him but with more difficulty now that baldys gone
checking his watch mr
durden youre going to fuck up the time
jack gets one leg free kicks knocks flat top backwards flat top slams the wall falls
redhead lets go of one of jacks arms jams his elbow into jacks throat
cutting off the airway
jacks face reddens
jacks free hand reaches searching
pulls redheads gun and points it at him
redhead backs off
jack gets up gasping for air pistol whips flat top as he rises
jack grabs one of the files off the table
jack without pants in boxer shorts escapes out the back door
he looks at the address on the file folder
jack sprints down the middle of the street gun in hand looking like a complete madman
cars almost hit him
jack sweating and panting stops looks
then heads toward the building with the address
jack tries the door
he lifts a cast iron bench runs forward rams it into the glass
the bench immediately recoils from the glass slams jacks groin
jack falls to his knees doubled over holding his package
then he rises shoots the glass
jack pushes through the broken glass
he sprints for the parking door
jack enters looks no cars
he bolts to the stairs
jack enters heaving
again no cars
he moves from one support post to another searching
he finally spies across the garage nine large canisters heavily wired
jack runs to the bomb frantic
he walks around it
theres a digital clock ticking down from
jack moves to pull the lid off one canister looks inside
could be worse
jack looks tylers seated his back against one post
you could be standing under stories of steel and concrete with a gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support
oh maybe it couldnt be
points at bomb you
you cant be serious about this
what a ridiculous thing to say
i cant let you
go through with this
what are you going to do
im going to
im not going
to let this happen
theyre our sentences
get your mind around that
tyler gets up walks to jack
what are you doing running through the streets in your underpants
we both use that body
since when is project mayhem about murder
the buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago
everythings proceeding exactly as planned
you dont know that
there could still be people inside
tyler keeps walking around crosses his arms
maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldnt synchronize their watches
jack looks back to the bomb goes to it wipes sweat off his face
he starts finger the many wires sorting them
i wouldnt be doing that
unless you know which wires in what order
if you know i know
jack holds his gun under one armpit uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires
maybe i knew youd know so i spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones
jack chooses one wire green holds it in his fingers
if im wrong were both dead
this is not about martyrdom
jack twists the green wire around his finger
im pulling the green wire
did you say green
tyler comes a little closer leaning to try to get a look seems genuinely concerned
dont pull the green wire
pull anything but the green wire
thats the wrong one
jacks unsure swallowing pulling the wire taunt fingers trembling
the sound of a vehicle is heard from below
just in the nick of time eh
jack looks to tyler
tyler points towards the sound
see for yourself
jack releases the wire walks to a railing gun in hand keeps an eye on tyler
jack looks over the railing
below a bus idles
the doors open and marlas dragged out kicking and screaming carried by six space monkeys
they carry marla into the buildings entrance
jack leans against the railing exhausted
ive got everything
ive got marla
bob is dead tyler
the police blew a hole in his head
was that part of your plan
tyler thinks shrugs
bob was a grown man
in any great struggle there will be casualties
wouldnt that be implicit in the name
fuck your struggle
i want out
you want out
not an option for the most obvious of reasons
you need to get with the program
looks at his watch seven minutes
lets get out of here
tylers walks away
jack looks at the gun in his hand
he points the gun at tyler
still walking away what
cocks the gun defuse the bomb
tyler stops walking
ask me nicely
defuse the bomb please
defuse the bomb
tyler strides towards the bomb
jack trains the gun
tyler looks at the bomb reaches over to it
he grips the green wire yanks it out the clock stops
jack lowers his gun
i did that for you
as a gesture
now how fast can you run
there are ten other bombs in ten other buildings in the immediate area
if youre going to get them all you better get cracking
looks at watch six minutes
green wires remember
ill be upstairs
tyler walks across the parking garage past jack heading for the stairs
jack aims the gun at tylers back fires
tyler ducks to one side impossibly quick avoiding
tyler spins to face jack
what was that all about
tyler dodges behind a post as the bullet throws concrete
jack edges forward gun held in both hands moves around the post
tyler is not there
jack turns takes slow steps moving the gun from side to side
suddenly a fist enters frame slugs jacks face
the gun goes clattering across the floor
jack turns looking
jack looks to the gun scrambles to his feet running to pick up the gun
tyler kicks jack in the chest sends jack sprawling
jack rolls holding his chest
he looks up sees tyler run into the stairwell
jack grabs the gun and follows
jack smashes the door open
the stairwells empty
jack runs up a flight of stairs kicks open another door
jack steps forward gun up
two interlocked hands slam down onto his head
jack drops to the floor
tyler backs away laughing
jack gets to his feet aims his gun
fire at will
jack clenches his teeth firing nothing happens to tyler
jack fires twice no effect
tyler raises his arms
what did you expect
tyler dodges punches knocks the gun out of jacks hand
they fight trading punches grappling taking each other to the floor
banks of security monitors sit unmanned
on one monitor jack is seen in the lobby on the floor alone wrestling himself
he swings his left hand up punching empty air then swings his right hand punching himself in the side of the head
tyler and jack fight viciously bloodied
tyler manages to get his hands around jacks throat starts banging jacks head against the floor
jacks got his hands around his own throat banging his own head against the floor over and over
jack manages to break tylers grip kicks tyler away
tyler springs to his feet runs heading for a staircase
jack gets up breathing hard holding his head follows
on the stairs tyler reaches the loft level above the lobby disappears around a corner
jacks right behind turning the corner tylers not there
jack receives a sharp slap on the back of the head
tyler isnt there
a tap on his shoulder
jack turns around wham
tyler punches his face
jack falls against the loft railing
tyler comes forward swings
jack punches himself square in the nose
tyler grabs jacks shirt pulls him forward swings him throws him down the stairs
jack tumbles horribly down
hits bottom striking his head on the floor
jack passes out
close on jacks head jerks back as he snaps awake
he looks around trying to focus his eyes
tracks in the sawdust of the floor from where his body was dragged across to where he is how
close on jack tries to comprehend
he turns his head tylers hand brings the gun up puts the gun in jacks mouth
jack freezes looks around with his eyes
tyler is seated in jacks lap
tyler holds the gun in jacks mouth his arm around him
this huge room is being remodeled
tyler and jack are seated near floor to ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the city
tyler looks at his watch
i think this is about where we came in
looking out window this is the beginning
were at ground zero
maybe you should say a few words to mark the occasion
jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth
still distorted i still cant think of anything
tyler checks his watch
its getting exciting now
jack turns so he can see down stories
look what weve accomplished
checks watch thirty seconds
looks out windows out these windows we will view the economic collapse
one step closer to global equilibrium
im glad youre here with me
tyler watches the skyline whistles at tune waiting
distorted cant you call it off
its out of our hands
looks at watch this is it
fifteen seconds now
can you see alright
tyler looks out the windows at surrounding buildings excited
jack closes his eyes despairing
out the window the skyline remains unchanged
a long beat
a very dark scowl comes over tylers face
jack opens his eyes
tyler looks genuinely surprised pissed off
what the fuck
your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin
i saw it floating in the bomb
more jack cont they mustve run out of cotton and epsom salt
paraffin is iffy at best
tyler rises taking the gun from jacks mouth starts pacing
jack rubs his sore jowls allows himself a smile
god damn it
not exactly according to plan
do we have to do everything ourselves
tyler stops walking lets out a sigh of disgust
he reaches into his pocket taking out a walkie talkie
into walkie talkie codename rooster
passcode first strike
jacks eyes go wide
into walkie talkie proceed with remote detonation
jack leaps tackles tyler
the gun is knocked away
jack strikes tylers face repeatedly with his elbow scrambles off
jack gets the gun turns pointing it
tylers getting to his feet sees the gun annoyed
havent we already done this
jack shoots twice
bullets pass right thorough tyler
tyler just rolls his eyes drops the walkie talkie to the floor and stomps on it crushing it
pointing howd you do that
youre a fucking figment of my imagination
youre psychogenic fugue state
fuck that maybe youre my hallucination
jack falters pointing at tylers feet
theres no walkie talkie there
jack looks down sees the walkie talkie crushed under his own foot
jack holds his head walks around at his wits end
why cant i get rid of you
why cant i just wish you away
you need me
no no i dont
pause i thank you i really do
thank you but i dont need you anymore
look i can be selfish i know that
pause im not blind to my own failings
jack backs up against a window numb and weary
from now on well share marla
weve been spending too much time apart
no no no
no more running off without you
from here on out we do it together
why are you doing this
im doing this for us
ive gotten all i can from this tyler
sullen if i leave you will be right back where i found you
i swear on my life i wont
you know you will
jack stares at tyler tears welling up hangs his head
he looks at the gun in his hand
can you live with that
jack stares at the gun a long time
jack brings the gun up puts the gun in his mouth
tyler cocks his head
what are you doing
what have you left for me
why do you want to do that
why do you want to put that gun in your mouth
not my mouth
tyler is calm
this is interesting
tyler smiles in appreciation slowly walks forward stands very close to jack
why are you going with this ikea boy
its the only way to get rid of you
jack cocks the hammer on the gun
i can see you feel very strongly
i feel strongly too
pause hey you and me
pause friends again
their eyes are locked unblinking
do something for me
look at me
my eyes are open
jacks finger squeezes the trigger
jacks cheeks inflate with gas
his eyes bulge
blood flies out from his head
the window behind him shatters
smoke wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts
resume normal speed as the glass falls behind jack
tyler stands in gunsmoke eyes glazed sniffs the air
whats that smell
jack slumps to the floor
tyler hits the ground
the back of tylers head is blown open revealing blood skull and brain
suddenly a group of space monkeys burst into the room moving forward to jack
tylers body is gone
are you all right sir
jack quakes holding the side of his head a ragged hole blown in his cheek
hes bleeding hard but hes alive
jack looks to the space monkeys trying to get his eyes to see
two space monkeys enter with marla
one holds a gun to marla as she struggles
are you sure
you look terrible sir
sir you look really awful
do you need medical assistance
jack sees marla tries to get to his feet falls
bring the girl to me
the rest of you get out
the monkeys bring marla releasing her saluting
marla crouches takes out wadded tissues and tries to apply
them to jacks wound
space monkeys are leaving hesitantly
get to the rendezvous point
jack and marla are left alone
my god youre shot
jack tries to got up
marla helps him
who did this to you
i did i think
but im okay
the glass walls rattle
jack and marla look out the windows a building explodes collapsing upon itself
then another building implodes into a massive cloud of dust
jack and marla are silhouetted against the skyline
jack looks to marla reaches to take her hand
you met me at a very strange time in my life
marla looks at him
another building implodes and collapses inward
and another building
the film slows then advances one frame at a time showing sprocket holes on the sides
each frame is an imploding building then one frame is a penis
then the imploding building again
speed up the frames lose the sprocket holes resume normal speed
