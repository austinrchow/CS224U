b if window
href b b the day the clown cried by and based on a story idea by additional material by jerry lewis the normal activity and excitement of showtime around the
circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which in paris is an enclosure
the animals the midgets the people and the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster as we now know showtime is momentarily due
we move toward the action slowly but definitely picking up sounds and actions of the busy people as we go
we see barkers children people pushing
buying tickets hats candy
sounds of children laughing music playing from o
within the tent area
a continuation of the animals trainers clowns intercut with the action of the circus customers jamming the entranceway to get in
complimented cuts from backstage to out front
building to the final crescendo
as we see the alley empty and clear out vs
the front area clearing and also becoming empty
the fully dressed orchestra playing the oncoming people to their respective seats as we pan along the happy faces and excited children
down and back within the circus backstage and slowly come to a stop outside clown alley
the heartbeat of any circus
the long row of unkempt yet beautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up with many of the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and things around their
own little areas
midgets running and playing like the little children they are about to entertain
music is in the deep background
as we come to a stop at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed we pull back and away from the lettering on the trunk and reveal the face
of a gentle but drawn man a man whose body and movements indicate he has been at this for a long time
as he sits the little midgets run close to see what they can do to help one pulls the chair for him to sit on another brings a hot cup
of coffee another takes his coat and hangs in on the hattree adjacent to his trunk
as we push past him to introduce the other clowns
some half made up others finishing their make up
and some just sitting and rapping together smoking drinking coffee waiting for showtime
and in the very distant b
almost against the wall of clown alley we see the trunk and the body of a clown in silhouette
we crawl towards the body and the trunk
and come to a stop
holding full frame
the clown already made up and dressed in his tramp outfit has his head in his hands leaning down on the trunk table top a depressed and sad looking hulk
of a man
its nice and hot
the midget slides the cup in front of the clowns face
as he picks up his head and smiles and nods yes
he sips the coffee and we see the clown is helmut dorque pronounced doork
he is a depressed and very unhappy clown
the frown on his face shows years of knocking around
plus fear that those years are now over
we hear the sound of a small air horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets
he is yelling through an old megaphone
minutes to circus
minutes to circus
upon hearing this clown alley really gets busy
all the clowns get up and put their last minute touches together
touching up their make ups
getting their coats and props together
and as they get themselves up and ready they exit the clown alley area and start for the arena
the last one to go is helmut lingering behind intentionally as we ladies and gentlemen we proudly present
helmut hangs back until the very last clown exits clown alley as we the music is really going strong
and the clowns come on like all forty
they explode in the ring
doing all their bits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the entrance area they just came from and they make the west point arch for the timpani drum
roll and the grand entrance of gustav the great
gustav makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the longest pair of tails ever seen at least feet long and at the end holding them from dragging on
the floor is helmut the tramp clown
we see gustav taking the applause and it is tremendous
he stops center of the ring but helmut keeps walking and doesnt see the post in front of him as he walks around the post still holding the tails and
goes on his butt pulling gustav down as well
the audience screams with laughter believing this all part of the act as we all the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks and there is a sense of gloom
permeating the air as gustav and mr
schmidt pace back and forth behind helmut both going at him unmercifully
in the middle of his tirade not to mention how unprofessional that was
but it was an accident
oh sure it was
a very well planned and calculated accident
i swear to you
it was an accident
gustav stops and grabs schmidts arm and with a threatening pointing finger
i dont want to hear any more
you will get me another stooge
i dont want this man
dont get excited gustav you shall have it
you bet i will or you shall have no show
gustav walks away sits at his trunk starts taking his make up off
moving to helmuts trunk leaning over into helmuts ear you will run with the other clowns and thats all you will do
is that clear
helmut shattered nods his head yes
continuing and if there is another one of your cute tricks
i promise you will do your bits for the cats while cleaning their cages
schmidt walks away
leaving helmut stunned and shocked
helmut lifts his trunk cover which opens on a hinge and stays upright as we slowly crab around to reveal the one sheets glued to the inside of the trunk
as helmut reaches for a towel to clean his face we read from germany the one sheets are battered and torn and certainly appear to be many years old
as we pan the lid to see them all helmuts face is reflected in the mirror as we see the tears rolling down his face
as we freeze frame music hits for helmut dejected and as sad as any man could be strolls down the deserted street alone
he comes to a small bistro and walks in
stands at the bar
give me a double whiskey with beer chaser
who knows him you wont get funny out of a bottle
and you wont make a dime sticking your nose in other peoples business
clause pours the whiskey and places the beer next to it as helmut gulps the drink down and chases it with the beer from the bottle
we standing at the window looking out is a beautiful woman simply dressed no make up and clean she has the look of a woman who has just bathed and
one could almost smell the fragrance of bath oil on her body
she is tense and concerned
she sees something and moves toward the door and opens it
there is a beat and finally the o
sounds of feet scuffling get to the door
it is helmut fairly crocked at this point
helmut darling are you all right
nastily do i look like im not all right
i was so worried about you
your dinner is cold and i couldnt imagine what happened to you
were you really worried about me or your stupid dinner was getting cold
ada is hurt by this but knows something is really chewing away at him
and deals with it even more tenderly which only digs in deeper on helmut
sweetheart i care about you
i love you
i worry about you
i cant help those feelings
during the above helmut is at the small bar in the living room pouring another blast and gulps it down
he hears the words but tries to ignore them
if there is anything i dont need right now
its your super sentimentality
he flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead
again ada is hurt by his blasting her but shes wise enough to know this isnt the man she loves
she has to get whats eating him out of there
whats tormenting your soul
please let me help you
talk to me
i dont care what it is
i love you
im your friend
you can trust me to understand
i cant trust anybody
i dont know how to trust anybody
im not anybody
im your wife
helmut hearing these words looks up at her and sees the beauty in her eyes and he is affected by this
he stands up and takes her in his arms
almost breaking her in two
im sorry my love
im so sorry
youre not anybody
youre my wife and i love you too
so very much i just have no one to fight back at
im lost and alone i cant handle the disgrace of failure
the pain of being a has been is more than i can bear
ada knows now whats happened
when will you learn they fear you and they know how vulnerable you are now
if they can beat you down then they neednt worry about you coming back to haunt them
they worry about me
dont be ridiculous
they just took the last comic bit away from me
because of a silly accident
im now down at the bottom just a stooge assisting a not so funny clown
but they cant take your talent away
thats your strongest force
walking away from her getting angry again
what the hell are you talking about
and if i had any its being suffocated into nothing
and thats just what i am now
a prop to be used and mis used
how does my great talent stand up to those odds
by not quitting
you must fight
creative survival is even more difficult than human survival
you must fight
helmut gets quiet and listens and it makes sense
ada knows shes got him now
continuing go to schmidt
force a confrontation
dont let gustav win
make schmidt see what an injustice they are imposing on you
please my love fight
make your world better by fighting for it
you can do it
i know you can
helmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right
i will go now and see schmidt
i will tell him i wont take any more degradation
i will tell him i am a clown not a stooge
a special person
a special clown
ada happily gets his hat
placing the hat on his head go my love
go and fight for what you know is right
i will warm your dinner and wait for you to come home
she kisses him opens the door for him and he goes
the low key light and the silence of the circus is almost ominous and a little frightening for helmut as he walks across the empty arena
with a small light burning from up high
all the equipment is tied off
slight animal sounds in the deep background
and the faintest sound of circus music is heard
helmut is now center of the main ring and stops and looks around
his face tense then eases as he looks around
the stands are full the lights come up and the audience is standing applauding thunderously
in his clown outfit bowing and acknowledging the ovation
as they stop applauding and sit down
helmut the chair and the trombone as the completion of the trombone pantomime helmut walks away from the position he was in with the trombone and bows and milks the
crowd for reactions and as he bows the second time
we shimmer in bowing position as he looks at the crowd
his face shows signs of utter despair and dejection
the dream is gone and the memory of what was really hurts deep down
he looks around making sure he hasnt been noticed by anyone and takes that deep sigh and strolls towards the back of the circus tent area on his way to
truck with him holding the many empty seats in the b
as he walks
trying to muster up the courage hes going to have to call
something that has now become totally foreign to him
we see helmut as the tiny figure he feels like walking out of the tent area and into the backstage section
helmut enters the section of the circus where schmidt has his temp office quarters
it is a tent like arrangement with the canvas flap as his door and we see light streaming from the half open canvas flap
helmut looks and sees a shadow of a body moving around in the tent office area and starts for it
schmidt pacing up and down
thinking as we pull back to see gustav seated in one of the fold up chairs with a i am waiting look on his face
naturally i agree
doork is a nuisance but to just let him go seems a little unfair
dont make me put it on a either him or me basis
ill give him listening
his two weeks notice tomorrow
will that satisfy you
lets have a drink
helmut drops his head completely discouraged and saddened by what he knows is a losing battle
as he starts to walk away we can hear the tinkling of glasses and the slight laughter of the two men as we watch helmut slowly scuff his way towards
the backstage circus exit as we dissolve ft holding his walk over his limp body at bar
helmut has had more than a few and really looks beaten and shoddy he waves for the bartender to bring another
pouring still another blast its your funeral
not too clearly a funeral is usually in order when someone dies
up to now we have no idea whatever as to the time in history we are indeed in germany but as helmut downs another blast we slowly creep our camera
to include more of the bar than we have seen before and it includes pictures framed of soldiers arms interlocked looking somewhat like summer camp stills the german flag vintage crisscrossed with the swastika a large banner marked deutchland ober aliss
and finally the larger than life photograph of hitler
helmut slowly crosses camera as he takes another drink and starts spouting again
the trouble with man today is that he takes everything for granted
he thinks things hes told to think
and accepts it
just because we know meanings of words we use them and we fool ourselves
people should use the dictionary more
look up words like good
especially loyal i know what loyal means and i have always been that
but does anyone care
of course not
only when it is expedient
when it isnt he slashes his throat with his finger zipppp
helmut stops with his back to camera looking straight at hitler and screams and that goes for you too
he shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of hitler
you too are a fool
you allow yourself to think you have loyal followers
wait until theyve had it with you
youll get yours
all the smiling bowing heel clicking idiots will shaft you too
and you will deserve it because if you allow people like herr schmidt to got about his business of lying and cheating and being disloyal one day all the schmidts
in germany will turn on you and you will finish as the dumb little corporal you started as and never know what hit you
during the above dialogue two s
men along with two gestapo men walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by helmut and as they sit helmut continues he really has to be stupid
indicating hitler i could help him by telling him about the people he thinks are good germans
the two s
men and the two gestapo men just happened to stop in the pub they cant really believe what they are hearing and the two s
men make a move to get up and secure helmut
the head gestapo man nods to them to stay seated and wait and listen
helmut continues his rave and gets more violent as he goes on
clause the bartender would love to tell him the germans are there but chooses to go about his business
helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is bordering on flipping his lid completely
he does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on the other side of the bar furthest away from where the s
men and gestapo men are sitting
we play this for visual humor but at the same time showing just how swacked he is
helmut finally reaches the table he has been trying desperately to get to and falls into it exhausted and emotionally drained
he looks around at the few people who have been watching him most of which are frightened at what he has said trying vainly to stay out of it
helmut catches the eyes of the four men s
and gestapo just looking at him
angrily what are you staring at
didnt you ever see a man drink before
the four men just stare at him with no answer
whats the matter
havent you guys got a sense of humor
you must have
look how youre dressed
grown men in their little soldier suits
and the black coats and gloves
like in a movie
helmut gets up and walks over to their table
mumbling and staggering as he goes
real cloak and dagger stuff
didnt you gestapo guys ever know that everybody can spot you a mile away
leaning over and whispering listen if you really wanted to be unnoticed
you should dress like plain people then nobody would know you
you might even wear straw hats and shorts
he hears this and gets hysterical laughing
straw hats and shorts
now thats really funny isnt it
straw hats and shorts
they just stare
well isnt that funny
think of it
why dont you laugh
they are really staring now hard to believe their ears and eyes
gets an idea i know why youre not laughing
because things you hear you have to think about
ill show you something that youll laugh at because all youll have to do is watch
helmut goes over to the bar where a little man is standing drinking his beer
alongside of the beer is a small plate with crackers and brown jam
helmut takes a comb out of his pocket dips it in the mans glass of beer combs his hair down over one eye takes a finger full of the brown
jam and makes a shicklegruber mustache from it
and turns on the four men yelling ve vill conquer the world
he screams the last heil and collapses on the floor
the four men get up and proceed to pick him up and carry him out of the bar
as they get to the doorway and exit we stay on
ada who has just arrived to see them pick him up and carry him away
she is shocked
we stay on a closeup of her face showing the strain pain and sadness as we we open on the shiny black boots swinging the door open in front of
him and as we pull back we see helmut seated in a slumped position on the hard wood bench as we introduce the wearer of the black boots lt
reicher he enters his office as we go with him
feather edge set
he walks briskly to the desk where there are briefs and papers stacked high on his desk
he bellows after looking at the top folder
get in here
a frightened and spineless like corporal springs into his office and clicks his heels and screams
shooting that stiff arm out like on a spring
reicher flips his wrist in answer to the heil showing complete annoyance at having to do it
do i see what i think i see here
the corporal leans over the desk and in order to see puts his hand on the desk to brace himself
reicher smacks his arm knocking his face flat on the desk
he stays there with his ass in the air waiting for instructions
reicher leans down putting his nose right to the corporals nose
never put your hands on my desk
is that clear
still in the same position the corporal extends his arm for a heil hitler which is virtually impossible in the position he is in
meekly yes sir
the corporal rises and stands stiffer than ever
picking the folder up now tell me is this brief correct
is that prisoner the drunk the one that impersonated the fuehrer
reicher paces behind his desk
the corporal still stiff at attention
waits and watches in mortal fear
to himself i get all the weirdos
alright corporal send him in
the corporal clicks his heels thrilled that he can go
he exits and returns with helmut and one more guard
helmut stands in the doorway frightened and unsure reicher still pacing behind his desk feels helmuts presence
alright come in sit down
helmut walks to the chair in front of reichers desk
the spineless corporal moves towards the door
and takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the guard is standing at
reicher picks up the folder again fingers through it
as he looks through the folder he looks at helmut and looks and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting to helmut as he sweats and waits
reicher is toying with him and each time reicher looks up the sick little boy smile crosses helmuts face hoping to endear himself to this prussian pig
reicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that resembles a throne
it is high and it looks down on helmut
props this chair must be higher and taller than helmuts chair
for pov shots diminishing helmut seated there
soft spoken are you helmut doork
nervously doork yes sir helmut doork
i am he
yes sir that is correct doork
and are you a clown in the circus
ego setting in and forgetting for a moment his trouble and danger not just a clown
i am helmut doork premier clown
ive clowned for the royal heads of many of our finest countries why there were times when i had to
breaking in that was years ago
according to these papers you are now just a helper in the circus with little or no importance
this stuns helmut his facade destroyed
his face drops along with his fear
meekly some things are only temporary
only yesterday i had calls from one of the great circus owners in all of europe
breaking in strong and angry you are nothing
you are a has been
you were a clown
continuing you are now a prisoner of the state and thats not funny
can you make something funny out of that clown
helmut sinks even lower in the over stuffed chair despair in his eyes and a weight on his heart
the truth slashing at his very being
reicher i cant make anything funny from that thought
it is no thought
it is fact clown unquestionable fact
now down to the issues at hand
did you willfully and with malice attack the state and impersonate the fuhrer
softly i was drunk
it was a mistake
i meant no disrespect
honestly i was drunk and not responsible for my actions and thoughts
and my actions were subconscious
meaning it was all motivated by truth that came out under the influence of alcohol
still softly i am a loyal german
and what kind of commendation would you expect for being a loyal german
i want nothing
but im more loyal than most germans i know
helmut realizes this was the wrong thing to say
i dont know
i dont know sir
but you said other germans
what other germans
who are they
why arent they loyal
trying desperately to cop out im not responsible for what i say now
youre not drinking
you said you werent responsible last night because you were drunk
are you drunk now
then why are you not responsible now
i dont know
i dont know sir
why are you not responsible
on each attack of the word why reicher creeps up closer and closer to helmut really intimidating him
and the sound of his voice echoes and becomes monotone and ominous
the corporal gets reichers point and marks his notebook flips the cover closed snaps to attention as we ada walking as briskly as a woman can walk without running and
then her walk becomes a panic running looking sweating and the look on her face is evident that she is frightened and close to shock
she gets to a train gate where she sees the s
men pushing men through the gate to the train
she knows she is where she has to be
she approaches one of the s
excuse me sir but i wonder if you would help me
very briskly no
you dont understand
you dont understand
i said go away
ada backs away from the gate and stands to one side watching the prisoners being moved from the back of the huge truck backed up to the railway area
she is looking through the iron bars we shoot the bars holding depth of field snugly so that the prisoners and the bars are in sharp focus
we make quick cuts between ada and the prisoners exiting the huge truck
as we see the change of expression on adas face we know she sees what shes been looking for
he is walking in a slow rhythm following a group of men who look equally as broken and sad as he looks
ada yells through the bars
just as she yells the voice of an s
man drowns out her scream as he yells
we havent got all day
one two three four his voice rings loudly in echo in the vast station its as though he is timing his yells to each scream of hers
we see her mouth moving with the sound of the s
mans voice coming from it
she is screaming helmut
as the s
helmut and the other men push ahead faster and faster
with intercuts of ada tears streaming down her face
with cuts of helmut walking with his head down embarrassed and shattered
we move the camera slowly towards her peering through the bars of the huge gate
and as we move we hear the doors of the train slamming
and the slow start of the locomotive moving the train out of the station
by the time we get to the choker of ada
the train is almost out of listening range
she drops her head wipes her eyes with her handkerchief as we hear so
the same one at the gate who told her to go away now i would be glad to help you fraulein
shall we start with a drink
there is a lovely little bar around the corner
during the above dialogue we see another s
man closing and locking the gate to the train platform
she looks at this pig then down and up as though she were examining a rare never seen insect
and then right into his face
and softly whispers go away
she turns and slowly walks the long walk down the empty station corridor as we ada is sitting at the kitchen table the table is empty the light is low
and we see the picture of a lonely heartbroken woman she has a small bowl of soup in front of her and the spoon in her hand is doing nothing more than swirling the soup around in the bowl
she cant eat which is evident and as she swirls the spoon around we move in slowly and into the bowl of soup choker
and hold on the spoon in the bowl as we we see wooden spoon doing exactly what ada was doing just swirling the spoon around in what looks like dirty
water with a carrot in it the bowl is chopped and cracked the spoon is old and almost white from use
the handle still retains its wooden look
as we pull back we see helmut is swirling the spoon in the slop
behind him is a guard just watching his actions
after a beat the guard taps helmut on the shoulder
shame on you doork
dont you want to grow big and strong like me
helmut knows hes in trouble and just waits indifferently for the fireworks to start
we must eat our food
do we want uncle to feed the little man
the guard pulls the man next to helmut out of his seat and practically throws him to the floor to make room for himself to sit down next to helmut
which he does
he half turns his body towards helmut and turns helmut around in the same fashion so they are almost facing one another
the guard takes the wooden spoon and fills it with the soup and proceeds to feed helmut
he stuffs the spoonful of soup into his mouth
and helmut takes and swallows
then the guard takes another spoonful and makes believe he is blowing it like a mother blows the hot soup not to burn the babys mouth
and forces the spoonful into helmuts mouth
continuing to feed him as he puts the spoon in his mouth and now one for aunt ada
as the guard uses the name ada helmut bites down on the spoon and wont let it go
but if looks could kill
he stares at the guard with hate
pulling the spoon let go doork let go
its the soup that makes us big and strong
not the spoon
let it go
helmut still holds it clenched in his teeth and the guard smacks his face full force
helmut lets it go
and holds his face embarrassed and humiliated as any many would be
continuing now lets try it again
he fills the spoon and sticks it toward helmuts mouth but helmut clenches his teeth keeping his mouth shut
i said lets try it again
he shoves the spoon into his lips as the soup drips all over the front of helmuts shirt
the guard uses the spoon to clean the front of his shirt and forces the liquid he took from the shirt front into helmuts mouth
some of the men at the table and surrounding tables feel for helmut others think its funny
they laugh quietly
oh i know why youre unhappy
soup without bread is terrible
the guard takes the large loaf of brown bread and rips a huge piece out of the center of the loaf and proceeds to stuff helmuts mouth with bread until
he looks like his cheeks are eight times their normal size
isnt that better
now take some soup
he pushes a spoonful of soup into his mouth which is so full nothing can get in
consequently the bread spills out the soup spills out
and he is a mess
we play this scene for plot value but it will work comically as well
ive had enough thank you
no more please
the guard just stares at him
im surprised at you doork youve been here two years now you should have learned we of the third reich never acknowledge the weak sniveling begging of you swine
thats all youre good for
youre a disgrace to the human race
thats why we of the superior race must do away with all of you
the guard turns to the other men at the table and goes into one of his mentally unbalanced tirades
and we will
do away with all of you
youre worthless pigs
with no courage no guts why if anyone did to me what i just did to doork i would kill him
turning to helmut why dont you kill me doork
take the knife from the table and kill me
helmut looks at the knife on the table picks it up holds it in stabbing style thinks about it
and we know by his look he would love to
with knife in hand i would kill you
but i am getting my release any day now
and i wont do anything that would spoil my chances
helmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head in his hands
totally shook from the encounter
he begins to laugh but hysterically
they told me you were funny
but i never realized just how funny you are
and the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the mess hall as the guard makes his way towards the exit
the men at the table slowly get up and exit the scene as do the others at the surrounding tables
leaving helmut just sitting there
we pull back to reveal the empty mess hall and the lonely sad body of helmut as he looks around realizing hes alone gets up and slowly creeps out of
the hall like a puppy with his tail between his legs
as we there are two rows of prisoners quarters wooden buildings weather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks each
joined at the ends farthest from the camera by the administration building a two story type making a u shape of the compound
the entire yard is surrounded by two high wire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high
at intervals of about twenty five yards in the area between the fences are the guard towers each about eighteen feet above the ground equipped with searchlights sirens machine guns
with three guards on duty
along outer fence also about twenty five yards apart other powerful lighting equipment mounted on high poles
it is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesnt in any way alter the drabness of the compound
nor does it help change the look of the men
there are about three hundred men milling about some still chewing what was their breakfast some pulling brown bread from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes or just
making deals one with another
some sit along the barracks walls trying to get some sun
others walking in circles
some talking laughing even playing cards
doing whatever they can to kill time
pan the entire camp
at completion of the long pan introducing the prison camp we pick up the sixtyish johann keltner formally anderlich a warm sensitive looking greying man thin but with a dignity
and a serenity about him
he walks briskly and we know hed love to walk slowly and tiredly but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct will help those that cant help themselves
his face tells us he is good kind and the reason men want to live he is special and he smiles at all those he passes greets the men and
is generally what man wishes he could be under the same circumstances
he walks into the building which we learn is the barracks
the barracks are empty
keltner enters the huge room and looks around and sees helmut at the other end of the barracks just walking back and forth like a caged lion
angry hurt sad and generally out of sorts
he cant even hear keltner approaching him
he finally stops at the back wall of the barracks and lays his head against the barracks wall
not aware keltner is behind him dear god please hear me
he hears you my son
helmut jumps scared
throwing his back against the wall like a man who fears being attacked at any time
sympathetically here here easy you cant do this to yourself
you frightened me johann im sorry
softly you have nothing to be sorry for
fear isnt something controlled by man
fear can not be conferred with
there isnt anyway known to mankind where man can say to himself
i will not be afraid
oh certainly man can try to fight it
but faith and believing are mans only chance
you must have faith
i have faith
but not always
sometimes it eludes me
i cant remember to remember it
but thats natural
you cant expect to be perfect in what you try to do
i dont know
he starts pacing again
i heard what happened at breakfast this morning with rothman the guard
helmut spins around frightened again
will they do something to me
what have you heard
putting his arm around him nothing absolutely nothing
dont worry about it
i just wanted you to know that i believe you handled yourself admirably
that was one time i didnt care for the laughs i was getting from some of the men
of course you didnt
but im sure you know man laughs for two reasons
one because something is funny
two because they fear showing fear
they laughed because there but for the grace of god go i
do you really think so
im certain of it
helmut smiles and takes johanns hand tenderly and warmly thank you johann
i always feel so much better after you talk to me
im glad helmut im very glad
you know you can always talk to me about anything
i almost forgot
helmut puts johann around the back of the barrack area near the wall out of sight of anyone coming in
before breakfast this morning i spoke to one of the guards a very intelligent one and he seems quite nice and friendly too
well he said that the gestapo has set up a special review board to handle cases just like mine
and he said he would get me a form a special form
just been printed up
and im to fill it out
isnt that good
keltner looking at him like a child that believes in the boogie man how many times since youve been here have you filled out forms
in fast but this is different
its entirely new
helmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to show keltner
these are made up by the gestapo itself
and the form will go directly to berlin to gestapo headquarters
thats the important thing about this
the gestapos in on it
thats a very good sign
a beat isnt it a good sign
sympathetically yes my son it is a good sign
in fast excited scanning the papers and i have to be very careful of everything i put down on the form
the tiniest detail could make the difference
dont you agree
helmut looks up and notices johann is looking up towards the ceiling of the barracks
helmut looks up too
up and under the eaves of the barrack just above their heads two small birds are perched apparently they flew in from outside and decided to nest there
isnt it strange
they are free to go anywhere they want and they come here to nest
helmut doesnt react to keltners dialogue but goes back to his creased and soiled papers that hes read a thousand times before and reads them again
as he reads
keltner takes a piece of brown bread from his shirt pocket and crumbles it and throws the crumbs up to the little birds
they scramble to chew the crumbs and they do
johann just watches smiling at the birds turns and looks to see if helmut is watching too
intense at scanning through the papers and totally oblivious to keltner and the birds
softly watch the birds eat helmut
its so cute
im sure ive got everything here
the important facts from the moment i was arrested the questions the gestapo officer asked me
now what was his name again
i cant seem to remember what his name was
what the devil was his name
coming out of it oh yes johann
you were saying
youre not a religious man are you helmut
thinking about it well i
not sure i am myself anymore
helmut quite surprised by this remark
when i see those birds i wonder
were they sent here to let us know this place really isnt god forsaken
he should have sent them elsewhere
they could be eaten here
helmut goes back to studying his papers keltner ponders helmuts remark looks backup at the birds
his face full of compassion as we we now see the barracks completely shooting from flat on the wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with eight two
tier bunks on each side
a group of men are clustered around keltners bunk
here we meet adolf a large once powerful man in his mid thirties
ludwig once a fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed him in prison is older and his bitterness is written all over his face
franz is the youngest
he is a sensitive looing twenty five year old more than likely the rebel type of the s
helmut is in his upper bunk over keltner writing on an old piece of paper with a scruffy pencil which he bites to make a point of and wets with
his tongue like any fat butcher selling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper bag
we truck the camera down the long barrack to include the other men doing their things
a couple of men are getting ready for a card game
several others are comparing clothing mending and helping one another a couple play chess
a few are sleeping but for the most part most of the men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling
the floors are spotless
suffice to say they better be
the walls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying
a torn calendar wrong year etc
johann sits with his back to camera
at the edge of his bunk leaving room on his bunk for adolph ludwig franz
he is showing something to them that we cannot see
keltners body covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking at facing camera
and they are indeed gawking with delight and admiration
seriously i think we should eat it
not on your life
catching himself er that is
put it somewhere so it can brighten up the place
sourly it would take a hell of a lot more than that to brighten up this place
itll be better than looking at your long face
chuckling keltner rises
we boom up with him and as his head comes up over the top of the bottom bunk
he holds out the object for helmut to see
it is a potato a sorry looking spud
that keltner has put in a small can of water and is beginning to sprout two sick looking shoots
to helmut do you see the way its sprouting
i told you it wasnt completely rotten
his mind on his thing thats nice johann
do you remember when i filled out those last forms
the date might be important
almost annoyed about four weeks ago i think
as keltner walks away from helmuts bunk
ill put it up here on the window sill itll get the morning sun
he reaches the window and starts to reach up to place the potato on the sill
a hand shoots out holding the hand of keltner
think you can trust your potato so close to me reverend
the potato he trusts
its you he doesnt trust
all the men laugh including the stout prisoner who laughs the loudest
keltner hands the stout prisoner the potato who in turn takes same and places it gently on the window sill just adjacent to his bunk
after placing it on the sill he gestures ala the trapeze artist after making a super truck looking for applause
keltner pats his leg in a gesture of thank you
he starts back towards his bunk when the front door of the barracks flings open and the guard enters
the men jump but quickly to their feet and stand at attention at the front of their bunks ala inspection in the army
they are rigid and waiting to hear whats up
the guard takes a few steps into the barracks
behind him we see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the barracks
all the prisoners from the other side of the camp are being moved over to this side of the camp over to this side of the camp
barracks h will make room for three additional bunks
he takes a few steps down the aisle
i want all the bunks moved down toward the far end
get them as close together as possible
the men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately begin pulling shoving and grumbling comments about being too overcrowded as it is
ad lib gotta have more room
we need more space
hey watch where youre going
this is stupid
you down there at the end
get those bunks right up against the wall
as bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks keltner and helmut prepare to move their bunks the last ones on their side
helmut and adolf who have already made their move come up to keltner to help him with his bunk
helmut sees that keltner has help so he decides to back off and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of paper
totally involved with his own pain and his undying fantasy about his ultimate release
the guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish the moving job
hurry it up
come on get moving
the guard turns towards the door and motions for the six prisoners to enter the barracks
they enter by pairs each pair carrying a double tier bunk
their personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung over their shoulders in sacks barracks bags
the guard motions for the two bunks to be placed next to helmuts and one on the opposite side
next to the stout prisoner
note this arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk right by the door
the guard motions for the stout prisoner and herman to give the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks
get them close
he looks around the barracks youre all going to be nice and cozy in here
in a loud voice yeah like triplets before they are born to a mother weighing pounds
thats what i call cozy
the guard smiles and all the men laugh
the guard starts for the door satisfied with the arrangements
as he gets the door open helmut runs over to catch him before he makes his exit
anxiously excuse me sir the papers
did they arrive yet
annoyed theyll have to wait
he exits closing the door behind him
helmut with a look of despair on his face goes back to his bunk
youd think since he was coming over here anyway the least he could do was bring the papers with him
this moving men around has undoubtedly kept him very busy
dont worry hell bring them
im sure if i asked him again hed really become annoyed with me
would you remind him for me please
kindly of course i will
helmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious paper work
as the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their belongings the regulars of barracks h among them adolf ludwig herman and franz begin moving towards them to meet
keltner turns to the new white haired prisoner whose bunk is directly next to his
ive seen you around the yard but the others
about thirty of them got here yesterday from the prison outside of frankfurt
who occupies the bunk above the white haired prisoner for the last three months weve been shuttled from one camp to another
his bunk is the lower bunk on the direct opposite side now theyre shuffling us from one side to another
i think theyre trying to lose us
do you think theyre bringing in war prisoners
i dont know why theyre sending them here
were overcrowded as it is
its got to be something else
otherwise they would have left the bunks
it could be possible that he is fixing up the barracks for some of his lady friends
that many women
standing at attention reverend we germans are supermen
all the men break out in laughter at hermans comment and his actions
but the laughter is cut short as they hear the door open again and they all look in that direction
shooting over the men onto the door entering is the same guard that was just there
this time he enters with two more prisoners carrying their bunks
one of them is josef galt a burly bully like man who knows all the tricks of survival and ernst uhlmann a think little man with a face like a
they follow the guard into the barracks proper
the men quickly snap to attention
the guard indicates for galt and uhlmann to put the bunk in the space right by the door
we might as well be outside
if i get pneumonia ill hold the government responsible
with a little luck youll both get pneumonia
the guard turns and moves towards the door stops and turns to see all is well and exits the door closing it behind him
galt sits on the lower bunk as uhlmann sprints up to the upper bunk and looks towards the original men who are just standing around watching the two new fish
then men sense trouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks
some of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners
sitting on his bunk its sure quiet in here
uhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant on the window sill
next to the stout prisoners bunk
he jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant
he takes it from the window sill and yells over to galt
come over and look at this
coming over to uhlmann what is it
aint it cute
its a god damn posie
he and uhlmann burst into laughter
looks kinda sick doesnt it
examining it its one of them potato things
and it sure as hell is sick
maybe we should put it out of its misery
no we dont want to do that
we might break someones heart
he looks around at the other prisoners
whose little plant is this
the stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move forward and challenge galt
but keltner jumps from his bunk and gets to galt first
with deep conviction the plant is mine
is it now
tell me precious
do you knit too
if necessary i can
and i do
this brings a ripple of laughter from the others
particularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing someone stand up to galt for a change
galt with a sneer on his face steps out into the aisle to face keltner square on
to uhlmann what do you think of that uhlmann
now if he could just cook
galt and uhlmann laugh but they are the only ones that do
coming out of the laugh can you cook sweetheart
keltner knows damn well he cant fight the brute yet he realizes that if he steps down life not only for him but for the others in the barracks will
be intolerable under galts bully rule
during the following dialogue adolf franz ludwig herman and the stout prisoner
easy up a little closer to keltner and galt
if necessary i can cook yes
now if you dont mind ill take that plant
he holds out his hand
galt wearing a deceptive smile eyes the older man
alright old man you really want it
he raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand
go get it
he looks past galt at helmut who is sitting up on his bunk
he looks at helmut
his eyes try to encourage helmut to do something say something do anything to show that he is on keltners side
he sits up on his bunk and wants nothing to do with the bully and his pranks
so he goes back to studying his papers and looks up again to catch keltners look of disappointment and as keltner turns away from helmut
helmut realizes he should do something to show keltner he indeed cares
he jumps down from his bunk and grabs galt by the arm and turns him around
they are now face to face
why dont you pick on someone your own size
shocked but pleased that he finally got a rise out of someone what
firmly you heard me
give him his plant back and leave him alone
he didnt bother you
and if you have to show your muscle theres plenty of other guys to pick on
youre my size
and with this galt smacks helmut a shot across the mouth that sends him spilling into the corner half knocked unconcious
he lays there with blood flowing from his mouth
keltner leaves galt and runs to the corner to see if helmut is okay
galt follows him
keltner is leaning down checking helmut
as galt bends down next to the two of them
still holding the plant
thatll teach him to keep his nose out of my business
heres your plant
galt makes like hes handing the plant to keltner who reaches for it and as he does galt slowly stands up making keltner reach and reach and reach
and as keltner gets closer and closer galt stands to his fullest height
making it literally impossible for keltner to get it
franz ludwig adolf herman and the stout prisoner more than likely provoked by helmuts stand now circle galt
still holding the plant up high go on little man reach for it
keltner torn between seeing that helmut is alright and getting his plant back tries to get it and still looks to see that helmut isnt hurt too bad
in a low menacing voice give it to him
galt looks at him with a menacing stare
you heard him
give it to him
youve had your fun
give it to him
closing in on galt galt realizes this is no time for a showdown
and with a childlike smile
grits his teeth
sure heres your stupid flower or whatever you call it
keltner takes it from him
keltner leans down and picks helmut up and walks him to his bunk helps him onto it and puts the plant on his own bunk
the four men ludwig adolf franz and herman stay with galt as does the stout prisoner
they are clustered around galt
whats the matter with you guys
cant you take a joke
hell all i was doing was trying to have a little fun
have it with someone else
whats so special about him
thats the reverend
even when they came and dragged him from his church
he kept right on preaching against them until they knocked him unconscious
galt is silent for a beat
well how the hell was i supposed to know
now you know
galt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten for the moment to his own bunk
as the men disperse and walk back to their respective bunks
galt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk while uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched position on the top of his bunk
galt gives him a stare
you and your posies
that was close
where were you when i need you
i make love not war
goes giggly over what he just said hey thats pretty good
i made that up
make love not war
i bet that would make a good slogan someday
aw shut up
and he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk
keltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood dripping mouth of helmut
that was really very nice of you helmut
yeah nice and stupid
helmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns on his side away from keltner
keltner bends down gets the towel sits on the edge of his bunk
looks up wonders and ponders helmut as we the door to barracks h slowly opens and helmut peeks through the opening to see that all is clear
he slips out and walks along the dark dreary alleyway towards the guards shack
he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the spotlights in a jail break
helmut gets to the guards hut
he looks into the window and sees the guard he wants
sitting at his desk eating off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it
including the doilies
wine and a steak that would satisfy six men in barracks h
helmut looks around to be sure no one notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the shack and knocks on the door
annoyed at being bothered come in
the meek and frightened helmut enters the shack and walks over to the guards desk and his eyes go immediately to the tray of food
while the guard just stares at him
somewhat shocked at his presence in the shack
breaking the silence what the hell are you doing here
who gave you permission to leave your quarters
helmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder
are you some kind of privileged character
helmut nods no
then what are you doing out of the barracks
the frustration of not being able to answer and the frustrations of being hungry
and the child like treatment helmut is getting from this pig becomes emotionally too much
as he screams
turning red if youll shut your stupid mouth maybe i can answer one of your questions
the guard looks at helmut in disbelief
but at the same time a little delighted at this chance to show his german superiority
as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and crosses to helmut with a sneer that would frighten rommel
nose to nose with helmut i have a stupid mouth
helmut backs away towards the door and the guard moves closer and closer to him
backing him up against the door
meekly im sorry i didnt mean to raise my voice
he bows his head in fear as well as concern for what he might have done to his chances of release
the volume of your voice isnt the issue
its what comes out of your mouth that disturbs me
maybe you need a little lesson in respect and courtesy
and he smacks helmut across the face with his black glove
and maybe ive been a little too soft with you
he smacks him again harder
the glove now feels like a sword to helmut
and his hands hang limp down by his sides
you see doork i knew why you came in here
i knew why you left your barracks without permission
its just that i hadnt heard you mention your release papers for so long i had hoped i could hear you begging once more
in a whisper im sorry
mimicking him im sorry im sorry
youre a sorry specimen of a human being
thats what you are
and he smacks him this time with all the force he can muster
now i will help you to your quarters herr doork here you will stay and pray for release papers that may or may not ever come
this wakes helmuts soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced at the words the guards just said
this look infuriates the guard even more
he grabs helmut by the scruff of the neck
like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the house
and he opens the door and pulls helmut by the back of the office
out the door down the three steps and onto the ground
and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the barracks doorway
helmut is just about beaten at this point as the guard opens the door of the barracks and pulls helmut into the doorway and his body stops on the threshold
shooting over the men onto the doorway
in the deep b
the sad body and figure of the man lays in the doorway as the guard kicks him in the ribs unmercifully
now get inside where you belong and dont ever let me catch you doing anything without permission again
helmut slowly gets up
in pain and practically crawls to his bunk
having to pass all the men almost as though he were ashamed
he gets to his bunk and tries vainly to get up to the top where he lives
keltner helps him
and as he settles in his place
yelling across the barracks reverend
if you dont watch that idiot we may have to get him a keeper
the guard storms out the door
slamming it shut
keltner leaning over the side of helmuts bunk whispering
as the other men go back to their respective chores and whatever they were doing when the guard stormed in
helmut helmut how could you think of doing such a thing
i begged you not to irritate him
and that i would ask him about your papers
that wasnt smart helmut
not smart at all
as a matter of fact
gritting his teeth leave me alone
and mind your own business
just leave me be
keltner knows this is nothing more than helmuts dismay and pain in his heart talking
the kindly man drops down to his own bunk
just shaking his head
as if to say how can i help him
as we the same guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get outside
he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and the men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly as they can
the guard moves inside after the last man has made his exit
shooting over the guard as he looks around we see keltner coming out of the toilet area rushing because hes late
he throws his towel on his bunk and as he does
he sees what stops him in his tracks
it is helmut still sound asleep in his bunk
keltner moves towards helmut to wake him
in a sotto voice reverend let him sleep
you move out ill take care of this
keltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front door as the guard passes him on his way to helmuts bunk
keltner goes out the door
the guard sneaks over towards the bunk where helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the cover off helmuts body
then proceeds to open the window above his head and the window alongside
and across the way and opens the back door
which is adjacent to the toilet area
and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door wide open
all the men are lined up for inspection they are all looking straight ahead as the guard walks down the line
all except keltner who cant help but look in the direction of the barracks where he knows helmut is still sleeping
he throws a glance at the guard as if to say
why are you doing this
why did he leave helmut sleeping usually the one thing that would send the guard up a wall
why is he allowing this to happen
as he finishes his walk you are a sick looking group of things
i cant even call you human
because youre not
youre all lice
the men break up and go about their business they move in all directions but keltner starts for the doorway to the barracks and is detoured by the guard who
knew he would as he stands in the way of keltner who has to turn away and go about his business
the guard peeks into the barracks
helmut still sleeping
he is delighted
he grabs the door and slams it shut with a bang that would wake the dead
then opens it again and walks off
he jumps from out of his hard sleep
foggy and unsure about where he is what time it is and he looks around and sees the barracks are empty
and he panics
but he is also shivering
the barracks feel like the inside of a meat truck refrigerated somewhat below zero
helmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk pulls the cover over him and tries to get the pants on under the cover
it is cold
photographically we can show cold
props vapor smoke
he gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and dances from the ice like floor he bends down looking for his socks and shoes
he wears just a tee shirt
having trouble finding both shoes he grabs the blanket again and covers himself with it while searching for the other shoe
he finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on
takes a beat and sees he has no socks on
reaches under the bank and pulls out the pair of socks
which stand straight up from the cold
he holds them in the air and drops one at a time and they sound like pans hitting the floor
he takes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks one at a time which warms them
props the socks need discussion
he then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on and then the other
now wearing both shoes he starts to tie the laces
he pulls them straight away to tie and they stand straight up
props this is done with leather laces pure leather
it works without any unnecessary rigging
he finally gets them tied and starts still sleepily into the toilet area
we can go for a great sound joke here
he steps into the latrine closes the door and we hear the sound of crushed ice being poured into the bowl
he flushes and we hear what might sound like an ice crusher
he steps out of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the water on
the water spigots
they both read cold
and as he takes some water on his hands to his face
it is cold and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold
he looks around and sees the little metal ashtray that looks like a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather soap
he fills it with water
and to show his ingenuity he takes a lighter from his pocket places the tin on the edge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin which couldnt
possibly hold more than a handful of water and proceeds to heat same
once he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the spigot supplied he grabs for the tin which is so hot from the burning he screams in another
the pain of hot hurting
he decides to flick his fingers in the tin bowl and splash some of the water on his face which is by now just drips of water
brushes his teeth with his finger and soap
straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his bunk to get his shirt
another ice cold item
he feels how cold it is and doesnt have the courage for another climate blast
he rolls up his shirt and places it under his armpit to warm it
as it hits under his arm
the cold just about wipes him out
he decides to sit on it
and he does
hes been peeking all the while
he figures hes had his laugh and its the first time we see he can laugh
he steps into the barracks area and yells doork
move it out and on the double
helmut jumps with fright unravels his shirt runs towards the open door putting on his shirt as we most of the men are clustered around their bunks and in the
dull light we see some of them in the aisles talking playing cards
while most of the others are whistling clapping and laughing as uhlmann does his silly little clog dance
it is apparent the ugly episode between galt and uhlmann has been forgotten for the moment
the lights are hung from cords down off the ceiling and for a complex this size it could use ten
there are but two
uhlmann is having the time of his ignorant life
the more the men applaud the more he clog dances
they are both seated on their top bunk adolf enjoying the poor dance uhlmann is giving as ludwig looks down the aisle towards helmuts bunk
nudging adolf it looks like helmut found some new ears to listen to his super star fantasies
adolf takes a look shrugs his shoulder as if to say i couldnt care less
and goes on watching the action of uhlmann and the other men
to himself but for adolf to hear as well a la shakespeare mimicking helmut ringling brothers would have done anything for me to appear with them but i had to
do what was best for me
the four new men are surrounding helmut on the top of his bunk listening to his bragging
so i told mr
ringling if he wanted helmut hed have to bring his circus to germany
i am a german i told him and my responsibility is to my own people who are my biggest fans
did you really say that
proudly of course i did
they offered me anything
anything i wanted to go with them
i saw the circus in berlin about four years ago
didnt you make your entrance in a long tail coat with a pair of tails on the jacket about fifty feet long
and a funny little clown at the very end carrying the tails like a womans train
helmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldnt even remember the clown he saw was gustav the great why not
no one would ever know
and he nods with a kind of studied humility
you were great
helmut eats it up
you should have seen him
youd never know it was him
with the long tails and white tie
and a battered top hat
with the hair hanging way down to his shoulders
and ah let me see
your mouth went from ear to ear
how do clowns ever come up with such ideas for faces and make up
it doesnt happen overnight
it takes years and years
you try many faces then finally you hit the one thats just right for you
my kids will never believe this i cant wait to
his voice trails off as he realizes the hopelessness of what he was about to say
this puts a damper on the discussion and the men start to break up and get down off the bunk
helmut seeing his captive audience leaving
emotionally wait let me tell you some other things
i mean things that are really exciting and
let me just have a few more
ignoring helmut completely whats going on with those guys
hes looking off down the aisle where uhlmann has his audience
the four prisoners move out into the aisle to get a better look leaving helmut perched on his bunk with a pleading and broken look of despair
a last attempt did you know clowns literally bequeath their faces to their sons or sometimes to
he realizes its futile as the four new prisoners move towards uhlmann and the others down the aisle
come on lets see whats such fun
he moves and the others move along with him
helmut thinks about joining them and starts to move off his bunk but his body wont respond
he just hangs there limply
his head lowered a sad man
shooting over the men placing helmut in the very deep b
as we see the four new prisoners walk over to watch the action
uhlmann is just finishing his dance with a spin when he finally gets dizzy and topples over on one of the bunks
all the men applaud wildly
uhlmann laying half down and half up on the lower bunk he landed on breathing heavily
yells over to galt
hey galt its your turn how about doin one of your belly dances for us
all the men agree and start yelling for galt to do it
galt moves out into the center of the aisle in the clearing made by the men and holds up his hands for silence
they quiet down and galt looks around until he spots keltner
the men become very still they look from galt to keltner and back to galt their eyes reflecting suspicion of him wondering what hes up to now
galt is fully aware of this
well reverend what do you think
would a little belly dancing be too much for the boys
keltner studies galt for a beat then accepts his offer of a truce
moving over towards galt a little fun is what we need
if youll all hold the noise down ill join in
a hushed cheer goes up from the men as keltner stands besides galt
galt holds his hands over his head and nods for keltner to do the same thing
the reverend does and now galt begins undulating his hips
keltner studies the move for a beat and then does the same thing but with comical awkwardness
franz starts playing a slow sensuous rhythm on his harmonica
the men clap and whistle softly
he is sitting upright on top of his bunk watching what galt has keltner doing a look of disgust passes his face as he turns away from what hed been
watching and gets busy with his papers and figuring again
they are just finishing their dance
the men applaud wildly but softly
keltner puffing moves over to the side and sits on one of the bunks to catch his breath
galt takes a few bows and the men react with applause and whistling thats beginning to take on noise proportions
keltner motions for the men to hold it down
and they do
say why dont we get the clown to do something
whos a clown
youve heard of helmut doork
thats him down there
dont waste your time
youll never get the great doork to do anything
as he starts walking towards helmuts bunk
oh im sure he will
the others follow right behind
there is a look on keltners face like he would like to stop them but between his puffing and his certainty that helmut will be alright he stays where he
as he walks with the others
youre wasting your time
he doesnt perform for the likes of us
hell turn you down
hes right weve been asking him for three years
i have a feeling he only does his little routines for the crowned heads of europe
and of course the big heads of berlin
there is general laughter
as the group arrives at helmuts bunk
he sees somethings going to happen he puts his papers away and sits upright
his eyes catch galts eyes peering at him
galt tells it all with his eyes
this one isnt sacred to the men
he might just be the pigeon galts been hoping for
the one every bully looks for for his own brand of fun
how about it doork
swinging his legs around ready to jump down id like to but i cant
did i hear you say you cant
it stops him in his tracks he stays up on the bunk id like to do something
pointing to the nd new prisoner he can tell you
hes seen me work
i need props
i work with a lot of different things
and he does
in fast sure tell them
i cant just do anything
i need lights props my costume
galt doesnt like no for an answer
gritting his teeth now me and these
we dont expect you to do your act just a little something thatll give us a laugh thats all
keltner moves in from o
and stands at the back of the group watching and listening
to all the men aw forget it
and thats probably his problem
hes forgotten how
trying to suck him in wait a minute you guys
show people have to be in a mood
to franz play a little music like in a circus
franz starts playing his harmonica
aint that nice
dont it put you in a mood
getting fed up i told you
i need things to do my act
hey doork what about that drunk routine
that was funny
helmut looks at him puzzled
he cant think or remember anything at this point
certainly not anything relating to any of the previous lies hes told
pacifying his head off yeah that drunk thing
that does sound funny
i still need many things
puzzled i dont remember you using anything in that drunk routine
starting to fume hey
are you trying to fool us
with this keltner moves in and up to galt
leave him alone
stay out of this reverend
were not doing anything
we just want him to join in the fun
to the men right
if a reverend can give us a laugh why not a clown
all the men ad lib their agreement with what uhlmann just said it appears that they are all on galts side and keltner knows it
to helmut softly it doesnt have to be anything special
a little dance maybe
taking it all out on keltner like that disgusting exhibition you did
go on doork so i can tell my kids
cant you get it through your heads i need
firmly we need you to give us a laugh
galt grabs helmuts jacket and pulls him off the bunk nose to nose to him
galt has helmut by the neck portion of the jacket practically choking him to death
his vice like hands are closing in on his throat and helmuts trying vainly just to breathe
one of the prisoners starts pounding his feet and making a march like noise yelling from the other end
the other prisoners in the barracks pick up the chant and the stomping
keltner doesnt even hear the racket theyve started because of his concern for helmut being choked to death
he tries to loosen galts hands from helmuts throat
thats enough leave him alone
stay out of it reverend
galt spins helmut around so that his back is facing the aisle and he walks him into the center area
the other men feeling this violence happening and watching
helmut being choked triggers all of their venom and their hate and they really come on strong
ad lib choke him harder
see if thats funny
make him dance
be funny now
he dont look so funny to me
he sure as hell looks funny to me
hey galt pull his string and make the dummy funny
and they stomp and they stomp and they stomp
they get louder and louder
helmut is kicking his legs which are off the ground and galt wont let go
his face is turning color
he hasnt a lot of air left in his lungs
and keltner is practically hanging onto galt trying to get his hands loose
and galt could carry another three men without batting an eye
galt puts him down slowly in the middle of the aisle so that just his feet touch the ground but he keeps his hands around his throat
your public is calling clown
shooting over galt keltner and helmut we see the door of the barracks slam open and bang against the wall making more noise than anything all the men made together
and they all freeze
he stands in the doorway legs spread apart hands on his waist
and he is wearing a raincoat the barracks has become totally silent
all that is heard is the rain pecking away on the roof
galt has let go of helmut who just lays on the floor with galt and keltner on both sides of him
walking slowly into the barracks what is going on here
to helmut on your feet
helmut gets up dizzily just about getting oxygen back into his system
like a little boy he was showing us some of his funny clown falls
the guard surveys the faces of the others as they stare back
because of all the noise coming from in here i have been called up front to explain
i dont like to be called up front
i dont like to have to explain
menacingly and you might not like it either
a beat back to your bunks all of you
turn out the lights and keep it as the guard turns to the door to go helmut takes a step forward about to stop the guard keltner grabs his arm
and turns him the other way
the guard exits closing the door quietly behind him
the men start to disperse
galt gives helmut a ill get you for this look and returns to his own bunk with uhlmann almost up his ass following
keltner leads helmut back to their bunk
whispering i was just going to ask him about the forms
shaking his head that was not the time believe me
keltner sits helmut down next to him on his lower bunk as helmut rubs his throat and tries swallowing a few times
beaten no im alright
they both sit in silence
helmut breaks the silence
johann why do they pick on me
ive never done anything to them
youve never done anything for them
helmut dislikes keltners remark and gets up from the lower bunk and starts up to his
he gets to the top bunk and starts to get onto it stops and whispers to keltner
you think i should have performed
the men would have appreciated it
helmut rolls into his bunk the lights go out and he lies on his back staring at the ceiling
keltner sits on the side of his bunk and takes his shoes off
periodically the rays from the searchlights revolving outside cross the windows to momentarily flood the barracks with light
after a few seconds helmut leans over to whisper to keltner
he stands up eye level with helmut what is it
they dont believe me do they
i mean about being a clown
oh id say youve convinced most
however a long beat there is one you havent convinced
helmut stares at keltner knowing full well whats coming
yet doesnt have the courage to take the chance that it might be another thought
so he waits
gently you helmut
the truth of keltners charge hits helmut with an overpowering force
he looks at keltner for a beat
his eyes filled with pain then slowly turns away from him leaving him standing there as we pan with helmut and hold on
the rain is pouring down
it is the next morning a chilly damp day following a night of rain
all prisoners will assemble immediately in the yard
all prisoners will assemble immediately in the yard
the loudspeakers repeat the command
across the muddy puddle splotched yard a barbed wire barricade about six feet high has been erected dividing the camp in two
a number of guards patrol the fence on both sides
uhlmann is looking out into the yard
he motions to someone to take a look at this
galt has just arrived at the window where uhlmann is standing
theyve put up barbed wire
they look at each other in wonder as they start into the aisle
the men in the barracks are frantically trying to organize themselves
the prisoners are pouring out of the barracks doorway
galt and uhlmann are already standing outside as helmut keltner herman adolf franz ludwig stout prisoner new prisoners join them
all look o
momentarily speechless at what they see
what the hell
beyond the fence we see men women and children standing in groups near the barracks on that side of the camp
the sound of children crying can be heard
as they quickly scurry to line up in front of their own hut
theyve got youngsters over there
helmut stands next to him
what does it mean
what do they need a fence for
shaking his head misery loves company
looks like theyre going to deny us even that
the guard is shoving the late comers into place
all right move
hurry it up
shooting across the prisoners in f
toward the new fence
guards move among the men herding them into lines
on the other side of the fence we can see the new arrivals lining up being prodded into place by guards
on both sides of the fence the prison inmates have assembled in the wet forbidden yard
on one side are the regular prisoners who watch the guards warily as they straighten their lines
on the other side are the new prisoners about two hundred frightened jews of all ages including thirty or forty children and a number of very old men and women
they stand in absolute silence as the loudspeakers blare again except for the crying children
the commandant issues the following special order the north side of the camp is now temporary quarters for non aryan prisoners
fraternizing between aryan and non aryan prisoners is strictly prohibited
any violation of this order will be severely punished
shooting through the booted outspread legs of a soldier guard in f
toward the line of prisoners behind him
one woman holds a child of about three who cries inconsolably
the commandant issues the following special order as the announcement is read the guards legs turn around and he walks away from the camera toward the woman
he stands before her menacingly and she clutches the child closer to her in a futile attempt to hush its crying
the north side of the camp is now temporary quarters for non aryan prisoners
fraternizing between aryan and non aryan prisoners is
shooting along line of prisoners from barracks h to show their various reactions as the announcement continues disdain surprise sympathy and relief
the guard stands with his back to the line at the end farthest from the camera
galt is near the camera
under his breath jews
prisoners nearest to galt eye him questioningly
any violation of this order will be severely punished
the loudspeakers go dead
the prisoners stand silently studying the new arrivals across the yard
the new prisoners self consciously file back into their huts on the other side of the fence
as the prisoners begin to break rank prisoners from barracks h remain in line
barracks h will remain in line
the prisoners turn and look in direction of the guard as they straighten their lines
the guard paces slowly along the line inspecting it silently
on the fringes of the scene we can see prisoners from other barracks gathering to see what their fellow convicts are in for
finally he stops and contemplates his shabby charges with disgust
i said last night i didnt think i would enjoy being called up to account for the noise coming from barracks h
i can tell you this morning i didnt enjoy it
he walks down the line looking at each man
i dont know what caused the trouble last night but im not blaming you entirely
fatherly i failed you
i should have seen that you all have much too much energy for the confined life you lead here
he smiles benevolently were going to correct that
ive been told that energy comes from food
their faces reflect that they know what is coming
shooting past the line of prisoners in f
to the guard who has paused to let his words sink in
to help you
all rations are canceled for the next
forty eight hours
a hushed ripple of ad lib grumbling and growling rolls along the line of prisoners
and if that doesnt quiet you down ill think of some other ideas youll like even less
im going to make this barracks the quietest in the camp
roaring is that clear
the prisoners are silent but their faces register their resentment
now dont blame me
with sly meaning i didnt start the trouble last night
the truth of what he has said is reflected in the faces of the men
as they stand with the other prisoners watching the guard move off
keltner looks worried the others are angry helmut seems undecided as his eyes follow the guard
i cant go without food
suddenly helmut makes up his mind and starts off after the guard
keltner sensing the mood of the men puts a restraining hand on his arm whispers to him hoarsely
but helmut shakes him off and hurries away
the other prisoners notice where he is headed and exchange looks
keltner shakes his head
galts eyes narrow as he watches helmut run off after the guard
loudly hes the one we can thank for the diet
the camera moves backward as the guard strides toward it his face sour
behind him we can see helmut running to catch up to him
when he is close enough
the guard stops and turns so abruptly that helmut almost runs into him
remember the special forms for the gestapo to review my case
he stalks off
helmut starts to say something more but thinks better of it
crushed he starts back towards his barracks head down
he walks sadly for several steps then looks up and stops his expression changing to one of uneasiness
a dozen of helmuts barracks mates including galt uhlmann adolf ludwig herman the stout prisoner several of the new prisoners are drifting across the yard towards him and the looks
on many faces bode no good for helmut
the men converge and form a half circle around him
as the men close in on him he moves back until we cna see the barbed wire fence behind him
helmut senses their disposition and remains warily silent
keltner and franz stand slightly behind the pack
whatd you say now mr
to men last night he wouldnt give us a laugh
today they wont give us food
venomously what were you doing
making a deal with your guard pal to slip you some food
i was asking him about the forms hed promised to get me
admonishing because of last night
im not getting them
keltner seeing how disappointed helmut is moves up through the group
encouragingly when this blows over helmut well
interrupting dont feel sorry for him
hes got no one to blame but himself
the whole thing was his doing
hes been telling us how great he is how funny
why couldnt he have done a trick or two for us
the reverend did a turn
whats so special about him
the men voice agreement
helmut should have performed
helmut starts to go around one end of the semi circle but the men bar his way
dont start anything here
were in enough trouble
the other prisoners in the b
those who have remained in the yard to see what was going to happen to the men of barracks h sense trouble the kind they want no part of and
begin scurrying back to their own barracks
were not starting anything were finishing something
weve decided doork here is going to keep us laughing so hard we wont be able to hear our stomachs growling
better hurry it up clown
cause my stomachs growling already
can you hear it
the whole place hears it
the men take a few steps toward helmut as they call for him to perform
yeah doork do a trick
how about that night in munich when they wouldnt stop laughing
how about it doork
come on just a little trick
give us one laugh
thats all were asking for
come on helmut do something
helmut hoping to stall the inevitable still hoping to preserve for a while longer his beautiful myth of being a great clown holds up his hands for the men to
franz interpreting the gesture as giving in to the demands of the men
excitedly hes going to do it
hes going to do it
the men quiet down and move back a few steps to give helmut room
grandly nothing pleases an artist more than to perform
im going to do a real show for you
all i ask is that you give me a little time
time to get things together
things i can use as props
ill even try to make a costume and
you dont need a costume
weve got imagination
murmurs of agreement
do the drunk pretzel like the kid suggested last night
commanding and do it now clown
no more stalling
helmut still trying to hold on to his dream of greatness draws himself up proudly and begins to move forward
let me through
arent we good enough for you
hed do his tricks fast enough if his guard pal asked him
wouldnt you doork
as the mention of the word guard the mood of the men turns ugly
their faces show their determination that helmut will perform or
do something karl
for gods sake do something
and be sure its funny
helmut is frightened
he strains to look beyond the men for help
he opens his mouth to scream for the guard but galt puts his hand over helmuts mouth
his face pressed close to helmuts you make us scream
scream with laughter
or ill tear you to shreds on the wire
galt presses helmut right up to the barbed wire fence so he can feel the barbs in his back
galt takes his hand away from helmuts mouth
helmut doesnt utter a sound
he knows that galt and the men mean business and he now must do something
he nods his head
the men move back to give him room
frantically he tries to think of something to do
he knows it must be great
or else his myth will explode
he walks around in a little circle trying trying to think of something
finally he faces them
he bows his legs and pretends hes a bow legged man trying to walk a high wire but hes so frightened the result is pathetic not funny
the camera works across their faces which are expressionless
seeing that he is getting no reaction from his audience helmut tries something else
he pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a headless man
he pretends to trip over some unseen object peers through the front of his shirt at it and stamps on the object
again he tries to walk over it and again he slips
as helmut starts to repeat the same routine many of the men are openly contemptuous
galt wears a smirk
keltner unable to watch helmuts degradation moves away
others express their disappointment their disdain
if hes germanys greatest clown god help the fatherland
doork the great
you got paid for that
to go without food is bad enough but to have to watch that
accusingly youre not the clown i saw
youre big all right
a big liar
contemptuously and i was going to tell my kids
hes no clown
not even a bad one
i am a clown
they move away from him
continuing give me a chance
i just got started
but the men continue to walk away
helmut tries to do a hand stand but his hands slip in the mud and he lands ignominously on all fours
when he looks up only adolf galt and uhlmann remain
sadly thats what weve been eating our hearts out to see
a beat you stink
you really stink
i can do it
seeing the disbelief on their faces helmut becomes almost hysterical
he is still on his knees
i am a clown
he pounds on the ground in frustration
galt spits contemptuously and the three start to leave
galt turns back looks down at helmut
very deliberately he comes forward to stand at a mud puddle
doork the great
with that he kicks a shower of mud directly into helmuts face
the mud splatters over his face
he cries out
his hands go to his eyes instinctively
he kneels there rocking back and forth in misery
then from o
we hear a tiny tentative laugh the tiniest laugh ever heard
helmut looks up quickly
he isnt sure that he heard it
then it comes again a little stronger
he looks around quickly to see who has come back to taunt him to ridicule him
the yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other barracks way off on the other side
he is puzzled
then again he hears the laugh o
he turns slowly to look behind him
on the other side of the fence stands a wide eyed boy of about eight who is watching helmut timidly
the ragged youngster laughs again hesitantly as if unsure what helmut is doing is supposed to be funny but finding it so nevertheless
he looks uncertainly at the youngster
is the child ridiculing him too
he leans over the mud puddle and looks at his reflection
he likes what he sees
the mud on his face looks almost like a primitive clown mask
very deliberately helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it on the end of his nose
he waits for the childs reaction
his eyes are laughing but his little lips are pressed tight together
he has been taught not to make sounds
not even sounds of laughter
but finally what he is looking at becomes too much for him and the laughter spills out between his lips as they form a smile
he laughs delightedly now satisfied that helmut is being purposely amusing
helmut gets to his feet bows slightly and stiffly to the child and then attempts another hand stand
this time he holds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows himself to fall on his back in the mud
as he lands he quickly glances off towards his barracks but from the look of disappointment on his face we know that none of his barracks mates are watching
when he hears more laughter from o
he quickly rolls on his side to look
two more youngsters have joined the first and all are laughing excitedly
the first child jumps up and down clapping his hands
helmut gets up and bows more deeply this time a tribute to the childrens vindication for his claim that he is a clown
he turns toward the direction of his barracks
screaming at top of voice come back damn you come back
i am a clown
i am a clown
he turns back to the children and again bows
he quickly leans down looks at his reflection in the puddle and scoops up a handful of mud which he plasters on his nose to make a bulbous artificial proboscis
he turns back to the children and in pantomime pretends to see a fly buzzing about and tries to swat it
the imaginary fly buzzes closer
the camera moves up to as the fly lands on his nose
he looks cross eyed at the mud blob then swats at it
the blob falls off
there are now nine or ten youngsters at the fence all squealing with delight
he bows again and as his head comes up he looks o
toward his barracks still hoping that someone will be watching his great success
when he turns back to the children we see that he continues to smile while tears course down his cheeks through the mud still caked on them
the last barracks on the open end of the camp on the political prisoners side
outside the building is a low counter arrangement with two prisoners behind it serving mush and black bread to a long line of men all of whom carry bowls and
this time in mid july three weeks after the incident at the fence
the day is bright and hot
our angle favors helmut as he nears the prisoner who is serving up the mush
as he moves up to be served and holds out his bowl
the prisoner messman spoons a blob of mush into it
then he looks around quickly and before helmut can pull back his bowl slops another half spoonful into it with a wink at helmut who gives him a grateful smile
helmut moves on to the bread server who gives him a big grin as he slips two pieces of bread into the bowl on top of the mush
helmut hurries away the camera following him
he walks strangely as if having trouble controlling his own feet
helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest the mess hall then peers cautiously back into the main yard
satisfied that he hasnt been noticed he quickly puts one piece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon
holding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl he wolfs down a few mouthfuls of the mush
then he smooths out the remainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched
he places the one slice of bread back on top of it and studies the end result
nodding approval he licks his spoon clean and puts it back in his pocket
he goes back around the corner of the barracks into the main yard and heads for the next building
this pair of massive feet are the property of the big prisoner a massive hulk of a man
dont know how you can go without shoes
soles of my feet are too sensitive
the camera pans upward to the big prisoner and an old prisoner sitting against the side of their hut
the old prisoner a frail man with shirt off is finishing his mush
its my stomach thats sensitive
smiles here comes your second helping
as helmuts feet walk into frame and stop next to the big prisoner we see the reason for his peculiar walk
he is wearing a pair of enormous shoes many sizes too large for him and cut open along the soles from the toes to the insteps so that they flap
as he moves along
as helmut joins them and holds out his bowl of bread and mush to the big prisoner
still grinning the big prisoner puts his empty bowl on the ground beside him and takes helmuts bowl
holding the bread aside he digs into the mush
helmut watches him eat his own hunger written all over his face
after a few bites this makes the big prisoner a little self concious
howre the shoes
the big prisoner nods and goes back to eating satisfied that he has made a fair bargain and shouldnt be embarrassed about taking helmuts food
dont forget the bowl
the big prisoner his mouth full of mush only nods
helmut tearing his eyes from the food moves off
the big prisoner watches him go
suddenly he looks down at the departing helmuts feet and his face darkens
irked hey doork
helmut stops and turns as the big prisoner shoves himself away from the hut and goes to him staring down at the shoes
the big prisoner reaches out with the large toe of one bare foot and lifts up the flapping toe of one of helmuts shoes
he lets it drop again
i said you could use em not ruin em
i had to fix them this way
for the act you know
wait till you see how funny it is
but will i feel like laughing when it gets cold
im the one wholl get frost bitten toes not you
when i return them theyll be like new
the old prisoner has finished his mush and puts his bowl down on the ground and moves forward to join helmut and the big prisoner
for what youve done to my shoes i should get more food
hes got to have something to eat
the big prisoner looks at him questioningly
continuing if he gives you his other meal
hell starve to death
then you wont get anything
this reasoning makes sense to the big prisoner
to helmut remember
you fix them before you bring em back
helmut shakes his head yes turns and quickly hustles off in the direction of his own barracks the camera moving with him
after a few steps
the big prisoner looks at helmut then at the piece of bread helmut had given him
his manner is self conscious
he tosses the piece of bread to helmut
helmut catches the bread his smile expressing his thanks
the old prisoner puts his arm around the big prisoners shoulder while the big prisoner tries not to show that he is pleased with himself for his generous act
taking bites of the bread helmut rather jauntily lopes off toward his own barracks
as he moves among the other prisoners the camera moving with him we see many of them point or nod toward helmut and smile good naturedly
helmut is completely unaware of them so lost is he in his own thoughts
they sit in the shade beside their barracks
herman is using his empty bowl as a fan
keltner is just finishing his food
franz is examining his jacket his empty bowl beside him on the ground
i mean it this time
dont tell us
franz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is missing
what am i supposed to do
who has a pin
you can laugh
he isnt always after you for something
he fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk holds it up
says he can mash it into a powder and put it on his face
herman stops fanning along enough to ask
whered you get it
from a guard
astonished herman and franz look at him questioningly
lowers his voice a very bad nazi
still has a heart
herman and franz smile
then franz holds up his tattered coat
i wish hed have a heart and use someone elses coat
or better yet his own
and nodding ask him
as he comes flapping up still munching on the piece of bread given to him by the big prisoner
keltner holds out the chalk to him
finally got it
helmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner
herman and franz exchange looks
keltner waits for helmut to speak
a little annoyed isnt that what you wanted
holding up the chalk this will do more for the act than anything
waitll you see
a sigh of relief for a moment there you had me worried
indicating bread helmuts nibbling on i see you got smart
his conscience bothered him
i thought he would kill you when he saw what you had done to his shoes
sheepishly so did i
the men laugh
i dont know what im laughing at
look at what hes doing to my coat
holds it up look at it
yesterday a button off
and youve got it ripped here under the arm
besides all that falling down isnt doing it any good
firmly ive got to have it
it is the only one i can get on and still is tight enough to look funny
at the rate you are tearing it up its going to look a lot funnier
shooting past helmut and group and in f
toward the main yard where we see galt and uhlmann approaching
during the ensuing dialogue galt spots helmut nudges uhlmann and together they come toward him
give in franz
you know hes going to talk you out of it again
ill be careful
besides ive got to have it
i explained before
a clown cant change his costume
its his trademark
galt and uhlmann join the group looking to start trouble
interrupting why should he give it to a jew clown
thats got nothing to do with it
whats the matter with you bastards anyway
all he ever did for us was cause trouble but for them
nodding toward the other side he cant do enough
a beat i say hes one of them
coolly if he were hed be over there through this helmut remains silent his eyes focused on the coat
thats where he belongs
franz and keltner get to their feet
herman remains seated
whatre you so hot about
its no skin off your
cutting in weve got a good reason for not liking them
if it wasnt for them
we wouldnt be in here
this surprises the men
herman gets to his feet
whatd you mean
a bunch of them got picked up with papers wed sold them
and whatd they do
turn us in they did
so that was it
i can imagine the prices
supply and demand reverend
supply and demand
deliberately franz hands his coat to helmut
take it doork anytime you want it
helmut accepts the coat
nodding his head in the gracious manner of a ruler accepting homage from a faithful subject
he turns smartly and slowly struts away with as much dignity as he can muster in his big shoes which flap with every step he takes
the others stand and stare at galt and uhlmann
whats so terrible about what we did
lot of them got out of the country with our papers
they were damn good counterfeits
keltner without a word turns and goes off after helmut
calling to keltner very proudly and whats more we never charged for children
as keltner catches up with helmut
the camera moves back as they walk along the side of the barracks toward the door
ive been meaning to ask you
heard anymore about the request for a review of your case
helmut doesnt hear him as hes deep in his own thoughts
did you hear the laughs i got yesterday
not just from the children
but the adults too
you know where a lot of clowns make a big mistake
they play just for the children
its the parents the adults that buy the tickets
never thought of that
helmut stops faces keltner a sly smile on his face
they said i couldnt come up with anything new
keltner looks puzzled
at the circus
schmidt and the rest
waitll they see my act now
a beat isnt it
the children certainly enjoy it
helmut begins to move along again with keltner following
what i needed was time
time to concentrate on new material
a mans got to have time alone
glancing around you call this being alone
helmut takes a few more steps then stops short
do you think
theyd let me go to other camps and entertain
keltner is about to say something
but shrugs his shoulders
he knows theres not much point in trying to make helmut look at things the way they really are
helmut starts to walk again
id have to get to the commandant
would need his permission
they arrive at the steps to the barracks
helmut swings franzs coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps
if you have time later id like you to see something ive been working on
i hunch down and do a tiny soldier parading
think theyll like it
matter of fact the children of course
i thought the smart clown only played to the adults
helmut caught in a contradiction of his own theory of clowning gives keltner an annoyed look then goes into the barracks letting the door slam behind him
as he stands at the bottom of the steps he shakes his head and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in the pompous helmut as the little
gentle clown within him struggles to emerge
the camera is panning across the faces of about forty children behind the fence as they watch helmut o
some of them are laughing some clapping some squealing with glee and a few just watching quietly but with laughter in their eyes
behind them near the barracks on the non aryan side a number of adults also are looking on but they hang back fearful that getting too close to the fence
might provoke the always anticipated wrath of the guards
we see now that helmut on his side of the fence is performing for the children on the other side of the menacing barbed wire fence
behind him also at a safe distance because they still arent certain of the official reaction to all of this a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching his
but in spite of his talk about the importance of playing to the adults it is the children that helmut plays to and it is for their laughter that he
the camera moves in to and we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face
with charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows formed a wide black mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his cheekbones giving him the appearance of a clown at
once sad and happy
at the moment he is coatless but franzs coast lies nearby on the ground
for the stunt he is doing now helmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of cardboard
he is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he has gathered onto the cardboard but each time he tries the dirt goes over the cardboard and he must
sweep it into a pile again
after a few attempts he feigns exasperation and ponders the problem
he sweeps the dirt into a pile again bends over and very carefully sweeps it into the front of one of his shoes holding up the split top to let
this accomplished he is very proud of himself but when he tries to take a step some of the dirt comes out
frustrated he ponders again and again has an inspiration
he removes the shoe and puts it under his arm
but as he walks away with it all the dirt slides out through the open toe
the children roar with delight
she is a flaxen haired youngster of about five who holds a weathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at helmuts performance
he is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven
each time helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs himself and spins around
the girl is no more than four the boy about eight
he clings to her hand as they watch helmut unsmiling perhaps not understanding
the boy looks at his sister and a tiny smile tugs at her mouth
the boy smiles back
the girl giggles
the boy laughs outright
they have re discovered happiness
they look back at helmut both laughing
the older girl is ten or eleven her sister five or six tugs at her arm and the older girl bends down to her
the younger girl whispers to her pointing to helmut and the older girl picks her up
the little one puts her arms tightly around her sisters neck
both laugh merrily
he is putting on franzs too small jacket
he tries to button it but it wont go around him
he sucks in his belly but then his pants begin to slip and he grabs at them with an embarrassed look at the laughing children
deciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch his shoulders he tries that but now his shoulders must remain hunched
he manages to pick up the broom and puts it over his shoulder playing soldier
but when he tries to snap to attention the coat pops open again bringing another roar of laughter from helmuts audience
now he marches a few steps toward the camera stops snappily puts the rifle down at rest position and salutes knocking himself flat
another roar of laughter
as it swells we the laughter o
continues to swell as the camera pans across the faces of the adult jewish prisoners huddled near their huts
they smile fearfully at first then break into timorous laughter
as the laughter swells even more the camera moves over the faces of the political prisoners on helmuts side of the camp
they too are laughing some tolerantly some at helmut rather than with him but they are laughing
as the laughter continues to swell the camera pans over to yard guard
he is trying very hard not to laugh
the result is a self conscious giggle
as the laughter grows even louder the camera pans as though wafted on the waves of laughter up to a guardtower and we see two rifle armed soldiers in the
tower watching the performance below them
they gesture in helmuts direction and laugh
the camera continues to pan over to the administration building and up to an open window on the second floor
scharff handsome mid s stands with his back to camera at an open window in a small but luxuriously furnished office
the window through which he is looking opens onto the prison yard
an aide pokes his head in the doorway
in a loud whisper hes coming back down the hall
scharff nods quickly closes the window gives a look around the room and follows the aide out
as scharff comes through the door from the adjoining room
the aide is standing in front of a small desk
scharff takes his position beside the door into the outer office
after a beat the rooms other door opens and in comes col
heinrich bestler a slightly built pinch faced ss officer in his s
scharff and aide spring to attention and give him the salute
striding into his inner office as he passes scharff continuing come in
bestler goes directly to the desk and sits down
scharff stands at attention just inside the door
oh stand at ease
and close the door
scharff closes the door and moves over to stand near the desk
i dont have to tell you why your commandant was relieved of his command here
this prison is a disgrace
the latitude allowed by him will not be tolerated by me
scharff nods his head
bestler gets up from the desk and walks around it
that includes the staff
im going to turn this place into a model prison a credit to the reich
scharff again nods his head
bestler returns to his desk sits and opens a folder
he glances up to study scharff
this isnt the first prison the ss has had to take over from the military
military men are too soft to deal with those
he nods toward the window scharff starts to speak but quickly changes his mind
you were about to say something
was just going to say that i didnt hold with the soft treatment of the prisoners
taking papers from folder our first order of business is to prepare
he is interrupted by the sound of laughter o
he turns slightly and looks curiously at the window then turns back to read from the papers in the folder
our first order of business is to prepare all non aryan prisoners for shipment in two weeks
where are they being sent colonel
again the sound of laughter from o
and bestler looks quickly at the window irritated
scharff uncertain of his superiors reaction tries to cover up
speaking a little louder but we have about children some only babies with more scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the next day
theyre not going to be much use in a work camp
his attention diverted back to scharff im aware of that
this order covers only the adult prisoners over fifteen
we wont have to wet nurse the children for long
other plans are being made for
again he is interrupted by the laughter o
what is that
before scharff can answer bestler goes to the window and opens it
shooting past bestler through the window we can see helmut performing for the children
bestler watches for a moment
what is that supposed to be
scharff goes to the window and looks over bestlers shoulder
well you see sir one of the prisoners used to be a circus clown
sometimes he gives a little
a sort of show for the children
turning away from window a show
is this a prison camp or a traveling circus
he looks out window again am i correct in assuming that those children are on the non aryan side of the camp
almost in whisper yes sir
leaving window and the
bestler sits on the side of the desk and looks at scharff who tries very hard not to show how uncomfortable he is
am i to believe you arent aware of the general order absolutely forbidding fraternization
not worried i know about it sir
close the window
scharff carefully closes the window
bestler walks around desk to stand leaning against the wall
just what do you think fraternization means lieutenant scharff
giving aid talking
shrugs helplessly how long has this been going on
just the last two or three weeks
and the commandant approved
well sir children are very hard to handle
who is he
trying hard to remember its
its doork the great
not his clown name you idiot
if i have the colonels permission to leave i will check it at once
right now i want these performances halted
bestler begins shuffling papers from the folder
scharff uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not hesitates
bestler glances up
he salutes and bolts from the room almost crashing into the door in his flight
shooting past the children in f
to helmut through the fence as he bows to the applauding youngsters
behind him we can see a number of soldier guards coming through the cordon of watching prisoners and waving them to disperse
they do so reluctantly as the guard from helmuts barrack moves forward to helmut who is just about to start another routine
shouting thats all
everybody clear out
helmut stops startled
angled to include children across the fence
to helmut get back to the barrack
to children you heard me
the children dont move but stand staring at helmut as if waiting for him to tell them what to do
this frustrates the guard who isnt accustomed to being questioned
still the children refuse to budge
angry the guard goes close to the fence waving his arms at them
move damn it before i come over there and
the youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully but there they stop their eyes still on helmut
the guard turns to helmut
get them moving before somebody gets hurt
helmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly
thats all the show for today
go back inside
the children back away with long faces
finally convinced that helmut is through they turn and wander back toward their barracks but with many a backward look at him
helmut continues to encourage them as the guard looks on
thats right now go along
ill see you tomorrow
many of the children wave to him
the guard takes helmut by the arm turns him toward the barrack and hustles him off
the camera moves back as they come toward it the guard firmly propelling helmut along
get inside and take that stuff off your face
i dont understand
whats the matter
no more shows
but we werent doing any harm
the commandant thinks you are
the new commandant
just because i make them laugh a little
you know the rule
no mixing with jews
i wasnt mixing
i was only
the guard stops him and turns him so that they are face to face
the camera moves up to quietly threatening look its not my order
its the commandants
more kindly now do what i tell you and save yourself a lot of grief
he pushes helmut toward his barrack and then turns and walks off the camera pulling back to helmut watches the guard go then dejectedly shuffles toward his barrack
as he nears it keltner franz adolf herman ludwig and the other regulars intercept him
they crowd around helmut anxious to know whats happened
still bewildered he says ive got to stop with the children
nodding ive been expecting it
because theyre jews
because of the laughing
why should that bother them
when you rule by fear laughter is the most frightening sound in the world
silently the men walk up the steps and into the barrack the camera panning with them until we
it is a warm sunny afternoon and most of the prisoners on both sides of the fence are out warming their weary bones
on the aryan side a number of prisoners including ludwig and herman are having a makeshift soccer game using a bound bundle of rags for a ball
they play with fierce rigor for such emaciated men yelling at each other and kicking up clouds of dust as they try to work off their frustrations
on the non aryan side of the fence the children now about in number are grouped near the wire barricades staring across it their faces dour
it appears they are watching the game
shooting past the soccer players in f
toward the fence
through the men we can see the children but the play moves away from them
they continue to stare straight ahead obviously watching something else
suddenly many of them press close to the fence straining to see
helmut can be seen standing in the doorway
after a beat he quickly retreats back into the barrack
the camera moves backward down the aisle between the bunks as helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle nervously fingering his white ascot
the barrack is empty except for keltner who is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little trellis of sticks
helmut turns and walks back up the aisle to stand in front of keltner
i cant go out there
i cant take another day of them staring at me
theyll get over it
disappointment is no stranger to those children
they look at me as though it was all my fault
havent they been told why i cant
im sure they have
then why do they stare
holding up the plant its amazing how a thing like this can feed off itself
think how lucky we would be if we could do that
helmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up to his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to franz
he holds coat up for keltner to see
i sewed a button on
look all right
inspecting coat fine
helmut gently pats the coat then folds it and puts it back on his bunk
i did make them laugh
angrily i wish theyd get them out of here
prison is no place for little children
weve been all over that before
youve got to stop thinking about them
trying to convince himself youre right
ive got to think of myself
keltner puts the plant under his bunk and gets up
its too hot in here
im going to get some air
do you think theres any possible way i could talk to the commandant
maybe i could make him understand
the sentence trails off as helmut realizes how useless his suggestion is
theres nothing you can do
how can i
they were my own very special audience
and now they stare at me as if i had betrayed them
theyre children helmut
you cant expect them to understand the madness of adults
sudden thought if i could talk to them
to the children themselves that would help wouldnt it
keltner doesnt answer but he watches helmut with new interest
if i explain it to them then theyll know i am not mad at them
very deliberately you go near that fence once again
and youre taking your life in your own hands
you know that as well as i do
pleading i would just need a minute
a minute to talk to them
helmut goes to the door and looks out
the children are still pressed against the fence still trying to get a glimpse of helmut helmut stands just inside the doorway
i wish to god i didnt care
i wish to god i could forget them
helmut walks back to keltner
but i cant
helmut looks at keltner his eyes pleading for help
im going to ask you a question helmut and i want you to think carefully before you answer
the reason you cant get them out of your mind is it because you need them for you audience
helmut drops his eyes as he attempts to find the right answer
i want the truth
after a moment i know i cant perform for them anymore
i know that
a beat i really dont know what the reason is
i think its got something to do with
well i dont want those little ones to think ive turned against them too
thats why ive got to do something
keltner studies helmut for a moment
youll be taking a chance
a great chance
helmut nods that he know this
very definite all right
come on then
where are you going
you want to talk to the children
well i think i can help you
theres no reason for you to get involved in this
when war is waged against children
that is reason enough for the whole damn world to get involved
and it will believe me it will
keltner puts his arm around helmuts shoulder
helmut grins a broad grin of thanks
so come on doork the great lets start getting involved
they both walk quickly to the door
as keltner and helmut come out
in the b
we can see the soccer game still going on the players shouting excitedly at each other
keltner surveys the scene for a moment
he moves down the line of barracks toward the mess hall
as keltner moves among the men lounging around the barracks talking and watching the soccer game
trying to appear as nonchalant as possible we whispers something to a group of prisoners
they glance back at helmut and then nod
keltner moves on to another group taking care to avoid the two yard guards one of which is the guard in charge of barrack h
again keltner murmurs something to the other prisoners and again they look at helmut and nod assent
keltner goes on to another group
as he does the men in the first group casually disperse and start across the yard toward the fence moving around the soccer players
one of them goes up to ludwig who is playing in the match and whispers something to him
ludwig nods and the other prisoners move away
ludwig runs off chasing the ball
as he storms into a clutch of players including galt all kicking at the ball
low to galt kessler is going to talk to the children
mean who says so
evenly the reverend says cover him
so we cover him
the players around galt give him a meaningful look and he gets their message
i was just asking
as keltners plot takes shape we see a dozen or so prisoners wander apparently aimlessly across the yard and form a spectators section for the soccer game with their backs
to the fence thus providing a shield between the children and the guards
the game picks up tempo but the play somehow stays in the center of the yard strengthening the shield
as he watches the plan in action
keltner rejoins him
you know what to do
stay behind the men and keep an eye out for the guards on the other side
make it quick
you wont have much time
helmut nods again and starts away but keltner stops him and helmut keep the children quiet
we dont want trouble
helmut nods and moves off across the yard
the camera follows him as he circles around the soccer players trying to look as if he is just wandering over to join the other spectators
as he nears the other side the children spot him and react pressing closer to the fence and pointing to him
shooting past the children in f
toward helmut as he nears the line of prisoners who continue to ad lib shouts of derision and encouragement to the soccer players
the children begin ad libbing cries of greeting to helmut
he puts his fingers to his lips to silence them and takes his place in the line with his back to them
as he stands pretending to watch the soccer game with the others
shouting kick it ludwig
the prisoner next to him gives him a sidelong glance and nods almost imperceptibly
quickly helmut ducks behind the line
behind the line as he scurries bending over to the fence
the children flock to him
the camera follows him to the fence
doork doork doork is back
helmut tries to silence their squeals of delight
holding a finger to his lips shhh
the children quiet down and press closer to the fence
helmut drops to his knees looking around
do a trick doork
please doork please please
the guards wont let me
maybe some other day
this is the same flaxen haired little five year old with a doll we saw before
she regards helmut solemnly
smiling wryly at the simplicity of this appraisal helmut reaches through the fence and pats the head of the girls doll
eager to touch helmut another child take his hand others grab at his arm
still other youngsters following this lead try to reach through the fence to touch him
obviously enjoying this adulation helmut takes as many of the little hands as he can squeezing them affectionately
only one group of eight children hangs back
they do not seem to understand what this is all about
their little faces are fearful yet they are fascinated by helmut
suddenly one little boy gives a yelp of pain and backs away from the wire clutching his forearm
what is it
he hurt himself
wide eyed with fright the little boy takes his hand away from his arm to reveal a nasty looking scratch from one of the barbs on the fence
seeing his own injury the youngster bursts into tears
its going to be all right
to the other children be careful when youre near this fence
he consoles the little boy who continues to cry and holds up his wounded arm for helmut to see
helmut looks around frantically as if hoping to find help somewhere
then he quickly removes his ascot his precious trademark the symbol of his self accorded status and hands it through the fence
here wrap this around it
ill make it all better
the little boy goes on crying but some of the other children take the cravat and fashion it into a crude bandage around the youngsters arm
it fails to silence the boys crying however
worried hush now
look at this
he begins shuffling around on his knees imitating a duck in an effort to appease the crying child
as he goes helmut quacks softly
the boy stops crying but his face remains unhappy
the other children laugh in spite of helmuts efforts to keep them quiet all but the group of eight youngsters who only stare at helmut in awe
seeing that he is making progress with the crying child helmut next pulls his coat up over his head and still on his knees moves around like a headless man
groping ahead with his hands
his frown gradually dissolves and in spite of his sniffling he smiles timorously at first then broadly
finally he laughs
helmut shrugs his jacket back into place and smiles at the boy
there thats better
no more crying now
for the first time he notices the other group of frowning children
among the other smiling and laughing youngsters they seem to stand out
when helmut fastens a quizzical look on them they back away a little fearfully
whats the matter with them
we cant understand them
all they do is cry
theyre all the way from czechoslovakia
the eight just start at him wordlessly their fear naked in their eyes
to the silent ones theres nothing to be afraid of
everything is all right
when there is no reaction from the children who obviously dont understand him helmut looks over his shoulder wondering if he has time
the prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players but as helmut looks adolf in the middle of the cheering section turns and sees him
a hushed call hurry up
helmut nods to adolf and then turns back to the youngsters afraid but still unable to tear himself away
ill show you
no noise now
in pantomime he pretends to pull a hair from his head and threads it through an imaginary needle
finally accomplishing this he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket holding the thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews with his right
when he has finished he pantomimes that he has sews his thumb to the jacket
he pretends to be embarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket but in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes too
the children giggle then roar with laughter at his frantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket
the silent children press closer to watch helmuts antics
some look at each other and smile then grin
suddenly the entire group is laughing
helmut holds up his hands for silence but the grin on his face says he loves it
no no be quiet
the children go on laughing as if this is just part of the game
the sound of the childrens laughter floats up to two guards in a tower on the non aryan side of camp
one of them who has been watching the soccer game below nudges his partner and points down to helmut
between the children at the fence and the line of soccer spectators we can see only the top of helmuts head bobbing up and down
but that is enough
after a long look one of the guards picks up a telephone and starts to make a call
helmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus of the childrens laughter
he is on his feet trying a hand spring
he lands flat on his back but rolls over on his side and grins broadly at his audience which laughs appreciatively
this is the old doork
again helmut tries the hand spring and again he flops
a high angle with helmut and the children in f
and beyond them the aryan side of the yard
the soccer game is still in progress with the spectators on both sides of the action whooping it up
then in b
we see two soldiers two ss officers and the guard in charge of barracks h come bursting through the spectators near the huts and into the game itself
the players slowly subside as they realize what is happening
they watch the guard cross the yard
the cheering trails off and the yard becomes strangely quiet the prisoners warning to helmut
oblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the children again helmut is just pretending to slip on something underfoot
his arms flay the air as he tries to regain his balance but he falls
through this however the children seem to be watching something behind helmut and when he lands on the ground they do not laugh
again their faces are frightened as they look o
helmut looks at them puzzled
then realizing that something is wrong he turns and looks up from the ground
shooting past helmut in f
toward the guard ss men and soldiers who have come through the line of spectators and stand glowering at him
the prisoners have moved back warily watching for the next move
you wouldnt listen would you
almost wearily he goes to the fence
this isnt something he likes but his authority is at stake here and he has no choice
as the camera pans him to the fence we see that some non aryan adults have drifted over to see what the disturbance is
to the children go on
the children dont move
their eyes are on helmut
the guard shouts over to the adults standing behind the children
you back there get them out of here
the adults begin to gather up the children
they had nothing to do with it
it was all my doing
the guard turns and comes up to face helmut
he studies him for a moment then hits him a vicious backhand slap across the face
taken by surprise helmut staggers backward and falls
a murmur runs through the prisoners
the children still near the fence cry out with alarm
seeing their terror helmut is determined to make it look like just another act
with a painful effort he gets to his feet smiles at the children turns and salutes the guard knocking himself down again
a couple of children giggle
the first ss officer quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard
he holds a swagger stick in his right hand which he repeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand
he looks down at helmut
helmut struggles to his feet
he glances over at the children
they are all watching him
he takes a deep breath winks at the little ones then salaams before the ss officer and the guard
some of the children giggle
this infuriates the ss officer
he raises the swagger stick and brings it down hard on helmuts head knocking him to his knees
the children scream with terror
the ss officer raises the stick to hit helmut again but keltner in an almost instinctive reaction catches hold of his arm
not in front of the children
the ss officer turns and brings the stick down on keltner
he hits him over and over each blow more vicious
helmut turns away from the beating pulls his jacket up over his head and starts to walk around like a headless man stumbling and falling over his own feet
the children many still screaming turn their eyes away from the ss officer to watch helmuts antics
the horror stricken men stand frozen as the ss officer continues to hit keltner until he drops to the ground
suddenly franz breaks away from the men and charges at the first ss officer
franz runs into camera and attempts to stop the first ss officer
the second ss officer whips his pistol out aims carefully and fires a shot into franzs head
uhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded
beads of perspiration pour from his brow
adolf weeps bitter tears as herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort him and himself as well
ludwig dead to any emotion simply turns and walks away into the crowd
helmut is now more than ever the clown as he goes into a frenzied version of the clap dance
the complete incongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned
the children are no longer screaming instead they are watching helmut as though they are hypnotized
the guard fully aware that the sadist ss men may take action against helmut quickly motions for two of the other guards to take helmut away
the first ss officer still panting with exhaustion shows his approval of the action taken by the guard
the two guards seize helmut by the arms and begin dragging him off toward the administration building
the prisoners move away before the guards holding helmut forming a sort of line of march for them
as they drag helmut along he waves back at the children makes a funny face and moves his feet in something approaching a dance step
shooting from the back of the cell toward the door
the cell is about eight feet long and four feet wide with a steel door at the far end
the cell is bare
we hear men approaching and a guard opens the door letting in a shaft of bright light
two guards hoist the unconcious helmut into the cell and drop him onto the floor
he lies in a heap on the floor his face swollen from a severe beating
the guards walk out slamming the door shut leaving the cell pitch dark
window shade quickly rolls up letting in a steam of blinding sunlight
scharff is by the window having just rolled up the window shade
colonel bestler is on the phone and obviously exasperated by what he is hearing
on phone yes
yes i understand perfectly
however i dont see how we can be held responsible
pause our orders were very clear
we were to have the freight car ready to be picked up at midnight
pause of course im aware the operation must be kept secret
pause i just dont have the staff to send down there now and
yes ill wait
he puts hand over mouthpiece to talk to scharff
the freight car wasnt picked up
its still down there on the siding
some stupid mix up
if they think
the sound of the voice coming over the phone causes him to literally snap to attention
pause yes im as distressed about the situation as you are
long pause during which he nods his head yes
you can leave it in my hands
pause heil hitler
he puts down the instrument and turns at once to scharff
who did you leave in charge down there
apparently not reliable enough
the cargo seems to be raising quite a fuss
explanatory fifty children sir
in a boxcar
but the siding isnt far from town
the general doesnt want unauthorized persons getting curious
ill get some men down there right away
youll get yourself down there
and take at least a dozen guards with you
dont let anyone get close to that boxcar
under any circumstances
scharff turns to leave the office but after a few steps he stops and turns back toward bestler a look of concern on his face
bestler looks up
i wondered sir if you might have any suggestions as
how do we quiet children
use any method you can but shut them up
thats an order
scharff is disappointed at not getting some help from bestler
suddenly his face brightens
sir the clown
bestler looks at him quizzically
the one who amused the children out of the question
the mans being disciplined for that very thing
we cant change our position now
no one need know
scharff thinks this over
suddenly his face brightens
sir if i could guarantee hed never say anything
bestler looks interested
you see sir hes been trying to get a review of his case
claims hes here by mistake
i could tell him you would recommend the review
a man who wants something
very good strategy lieutenant
he turns to face scharff however when you bring him back here return him to solitary and keep him there
a beat ive seen the best of men after several years in solitary unable to remember even their own names
then i have your permission to take the clown
a small open truck with soldiers in the back followed by a staff car move along the road
driver is in the front seat helmut and scharff in the back
helmut has been cleaned up but still shows the effects of the beating and his stay in solitary
holding a small mirror he is applying his makeup
he occasionally closes or tries to shade his eyes from the light
they ride on in silence
scharff stares straight ahead
wish you couldve gotten the big shoes
the children laugh so when they see them flopping up and down
scharff makes no reply
helmut starts to put on his big black mouth
a touch of the old arrogance the commandant himself asked for me
a beat you say hes personally requesting a review of my case
why that means im practically on my way back to berlin
studies mouth in mirror should be red
mouth looks better in red
a beat know the first thing im going to do when i get to berlin
buy an overcoat with a fur collar
had such a coat
finishing the up turned corners of mouth its a good idea
moving the children
scharff reacts to this
he looks sharply at helmut
prisons no place for children
i said all along that it was some kind of mistake
uncomfortable finish your makeup
were almost there
know what johann keltner said
from my barracks
let me think
men who wage war on children
men who wage war on children
commit such a crime
a beat as he thinks such a heinous crime
men who wage war on children commit such a heinous crime that even the devil damns their souls
scharff looks as though hed just been slapped across the face
he quickly turns toward the window
helmut inspects his reflection in the mirror as he draws black vertical lines down over each eye giving him a very lost sad dejected look
as the truck and staff car leave the highway and jolt down a short roadway to a railroad siding where a boxcar sits on the tracks
uniformed guards stand watch on both sides of the car which has the door nearest the camera partially open
the truck and staff car pull up to the nearest boxcar
the soldiers jump from the rear of the truck one of them carrying a large burlap sack
as scharff gets out of the car from the boxcar comes the sound of children crying
to helmut in car wait here
scharff strides purposefully over to sergeant hoffman the guard beside the open door
hoffman salutes scharff
any word about the train yet
the last we heard it wont get here until evening
anyone been around
with all that wailing its a wonder
couldnt you keep them quiet
i didnt know what to do lieutenant
i was afraid to close both doors
to other soldiers keep a tight guard on the whole area
no one gets near here
to hoffman you post them
saluting yes sir
hoffman moves over to soldiers and begins giving them their orders
to soldier holding the sack leave that here
the soldier puts down the sack and hurries off after the others with hoffman leading the way
scharff turns toward the staff car
calling to helmut over here clown
helmut quickly gets out of the car and moves over to scharff
he looks toward the partially open door
indicating the sack take that in to them
helmut picks up the sack and peers into it
what is it
they wont wait so loud with their mouths full
how long have they been here
you just get in there and keep them quiet
you can do that cant you
scharff puts his hand on helmuts shoulder
helmut stiffens under his touch
do a good job and ill personally ask that you get a favorable decision on your case
helmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar the camera moving with him
just before he looks inside he puts a wide grin on his face
but when he does peer into the car his eyes cease to smile
in one end of the car the children are huddled together in one frightened wailing mass
they do not even notice helmut at first so great is their sorrow
the little ones cling to the larger youngsters who in turn cling together
the small ones weep hysterically as children do when they have been crying for a very long time
the camera pulls back so that helmut is in f
he slides the boxcar door open fully throwing more light on the children
this brings renewed walls of anguish from the youngsters who cluster together more fiercely
but one little boy sneaks a look at the door expecting to see more guards
when he sees helmut his tear filled eyes widen
he can scarcely believe what he sees much less verbalize it
he tugs frantically at an older girl he has been clutching
she looks first at him then at helmut
she too can hardly believe it
shrill with recognition its doork
the children begin untangling quickly
faces appear between legs around skirts and over shoulders
for a moment they can only stare at helmut speechless with wonder
gently so this is where youve been hiding
that breaks the silence and the children begin squealing ad libbed expressions of greeting and relief
they repeat his name time and again doork doork doork
the youngsters surge toward him
the little boy who first saw him reaches him first
he drops to his knees and puts his arms around helmuts neck hugging him furiously
helmut returns the embrace
i want to go home
take me home
now now theres nothing to cry about
were going to have fun
disengaging himself and picking up the sack here
i brought you something
he tosses it into the car the children pounce on the sack and tug at it unsure what it is except that its a gift from helmut
dont open it yet
waitll i get in
you help me
he backs up a few steps the camera pulling back with him
then he runs toward the car and with strength he really doesnt have jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor of the boxcar
he heaves himself forward partially into it and the children grab his clothes to help him inside
a couple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and finally pull him in
favoring helmut as he rolls over and jumps up waggling his head from side to side in the manner of a jack in the box
the children watch him big eyed
a few giggle
look im a jack in the box
he gestures around to indicate that he is indeed in a box
were all jacks in the box the same box
the children laugh and some begin imitating helmuts head movements
others do the same and still others including the czech youngsters until all are waggling their heads at each other and loving it
then out of sheer adoration the youngest of the children close in on helmut and hug him around his legs
slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can almost as if trying to protect them
suddenly the gaiety dissolves and the children go solemnly silent
almost in unison the children shout i am again forgetting their unhappiness
all right i want everybody to sit down
when i count three everybody sit
on the count of two many of the youngsters sit down
helmut feigns surprise
oh youre too fast
this brings a burst of giggles and the remaining children sit down
the czechs following the example of the others
helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces of black bread
the children grab at the chunks and gnaw it voraciously
when all of the youngsters have been given the bread helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great relish
after a few chews on the bread now
whatll we do
there is a long moment of silence then the little blonde girl with the rag doll speaks up timidly
i want to see my mommy
helmut is brought up short
for a beat he searches his brain frantically for an answer
then he goes to the child and kneels beside her
you know where she is
shes right here with you
i dont see her
thats because you dont know how to look
ill show you
close your eyes
to the other children all of you
close your eyes
the little girl closes her eyes and one by one the other youngsters do also
the czech children look at each other then at the other children then they too close their eyes
everybodys eyes shut
now think about your mommys and daddys
there dont you see them
cant you see their faces
the children marvelling at this feat ad lib expressions of assent
so you see
theyre right here with you
all you have to do is look in your hearts
putting her hand over her heart does mommy see me doork
deeply touched yes she does
she has you safe in her heart too
the silence in the car tells helmut that sadness has returned to the children
he brightens quickly and rises
ive got an idea
you all know my name but i dont know yours
so lets find out everybodys name shall we
he points to a boy of about ten in the group
come here and ill show you what well do
the boy honored at being singled out rises and comes to helmut who takes a stubby pencil from his pocket
whats your name
thats a good name
how do you spell it
ill just write that on top of your head
using the eraser end of the pencil helmut carefully traces the letters on top of the boys head
the youngster peers upward wondering
see this way well all be able to tell everybody elses name just by looking at his head
still looking up but now doubtful
did you really
of course i did
he pulls an older boy to his feet winks at him and points to the first boys head
to the older boy tell him what it says
giggling it says willie
he puts his hand to his head
dont smear it
he glances around lets see now
you shall be next
he points to a czech girl of about six
he motions for her to come over to him
she shyly bows her head
her friends push her forward
helmut holds out his hand to her she grabs it
what is your name
she looks at him then at the other czech children
they all giggle
squatting down beside her forgive me
i dont speak your language
he gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm around his neck
to others see
we understand each other
he points to willie willie
he points to himself doork
points again to willie willie
pointing to himself doork
the childs eyes light up and she whispers into helmuts ear
a beautiful name
now you tell all the children
almost a whisper inga
its such a pretty name
say it again
more sure of herself inga
she quickly bows her head for helmut to outline her name on the top of it
with a flourish of his pencil i n g a
there it is
the little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her group
helmut glances around at the children
lets see now
who wants to be next
the little girl with the doll presses forward
shaking her head she holds up the doll
so the little children will know her name
that way she cant get lost can she
whats her name
mock dismay frederika
he studies the top of dolls tiny head
then he holds up his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches in the air with thumb and forefinger
next he puts the dolls head between his thumb and forefinger illustrating that the head is too small for the name
couldnt we just make it freda
solemnly oh no
helmut shrugs closes one eye and begins writing in tiny letters on the dolls head
the children laugh delightedly
sergeant hoffmann is walking his post beside the open door of the boxcar
inside we can see helmut and the children and hear their laughter
the camera pans over to the staff car where scharff sits in the front seat smoking a cigarette and waiting
it is perhaps two hours later
sergeant hoffman is now leaning wearily against the boxcar near the door
the camera pans over to the staff car where scharff is dozing in the back seat
from within the boxcar we can hear helmut singing softly to the children
sergeant hoffman is listening
finally he takes something from his pocket goes to the door of the boxcar and sticks his head inside
the children are scattered about either sleeping or near sleep many of them cuddled close to helmut who sits near the door with his back against the side of the
clown can you play one of these
he holds out a harmonica
helmut leans over to get it being careful not to disturb the children
i got it to send home to my boy
but if itll help
he takes it you wont say anything to the lieutenant
he leans back and looks at the harmonica then he has a sudden thought as hoffmans head disappears
he leans back toward the door
hoffman reappears at door
its going to be dark soon
the little ones may be afraid
do you think
could you get some kind of a light for in here
angry want to get me in trouble
helmut nods that he understands hoffmans situation
trying to justify himself i would if i could
i know you would
again hoffmans face disappears
helmut leans back and begins experimenting with the harmonica
actually he can play it only slightly but he manages to get some sort of soft tune out of it
the camera pulls back slowly to include the children most of who are resting peacefully secure in helmuts presence
but suddenly a little dark haired dark eyed girl of about six sits upright and cries out frightened by a bad dream
the child looks around the boxcar as if she cant remember how she got there and begins crying inconsolably
some of the other children stir
helmut quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around him and picks his way over to the girl
he kneels beside her and the camera moves up to the child continues crying but more softly he wide wet eyes on helmut
gently whats the matter
she only stares at him its all right just a bad dream
he tries to put a comforting arm around her but she shrinks away continuing to sob softly
realizing that words wont help he turns to the harmonica for communication serenading her with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation
it is hardly a masterpiece but it has the desired effect
the girl stops sobbing and when helmut finishes the tune he makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to touch his make up but pulls
it back quickly
with an affectionate smile helmut takes her hand and runs it over his face pretending that her touch tickles him
as he laughs the child begins to smile faintly
he shows her the traces of chalk make up on her fingers and she giggles
his conquest is all but complete
he picks the youngster up and holding her like a dancing partner pretends to dance with her to a little tune he hums
she loves this and laughs outright
when helmut finally puts her down he kisses her on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for a return kiss
the girl shyly and quickly gives helmuts cheek a peck
grinning helmut pats the spot where she kissed him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift
the older girl we saw earlier calls to him in a hushed voice
helmut moves over and squats down beside her and the camera moves in to where are they sending us
shaking his head dont know
do you have children
helmut looks around at the children
he smiles sadly
i do now
scharff dozing in the back seat is awakened by the sound of an approaching train o
he listens glances at his watch shakes his head and gets out of the car
as scharff strides to the boxcar where sergeant hoffman has also hear the locomotive
he salutes as scharff comes up the camera following him
it finally got here
help them get the car coupled on
we want to move it out of here as fast as possible
be sure the doors are locked
and get the clown off
hoffman salutes and scharff moves off toward the approaching locomotive and freight cars being backed up to the boxcar
it is backing down the siding toward the boxcar
with a cautious look around he reaches under the waiting boxcar and brings out a box type battery operated lantern
he goes to the boxcar door and peers inside
calling all right clown time to get off
helmut appears at the door and looks down
what is it
train is here
they are hooking it up now
he hoists the lantern inside here
tell them not to light it up until the doors are closed
helmut gives him a look of deep gratitude
curtly and get off right now
just then the boxcar is jolted as the locomotive makes contact and hoffman runs off toward the front of the car
the jolt has awakened several of the children who gather around helmut in the dimness of the car frightened and bewildered
what was the noise
doork where are we going
forced gaiety its nothing
youre going for a train ride
what do you think of that
a real train ride
pressing close sensing his anxiety is it far
are you coming too
i dont want a train ride
oh itll be fun
i would like to come but i dont think i can
pleading please come doork
they want me to stay here
there are cries from the children whose pleading eyes make helmut terribly uncomfortable
he backs toward the door
ill come to see you
soon as i can
and i want you all to promise me to be very good
the children stare at him silently their eyes unconsciously accusing
with him goes all their security
helmut knows it but he has no choice
when he reaches the door
if you want me
remember just close your eyes
wordlessly she shuts her eyes tight
following the dark eyed girls example the smaller children one by one close their eyes
near tears with emotion he wavers
then with great control
he turns and sits down on the floor of the car with his feet hanging outside
he is just about to jump down when he is stopped by a loud wail of anguish from one of the children behind him
he turns and looks back at them
a boy of about six one of the czech youngsters is crying with the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything
the other little czechs and the older girl who first recognized helmut at the boxcar door are trying unsuccessfully to console him
between cooing and patting the boys shoulder the girl throws accusing looks at helmut
uncertain what to do helmut glances around outside
satisfied that the train isnt going to move at once he gets up and goes to the children
whats this now
after all the fun weve had
the boy only looks at helmut and goes right on crying
helmut looks helplessly at the older girl
its his birthday
he thought there would be presents
to girl hes a czech
do you speak
annoyed of course not
helmut is angry with the girl because he really wants to get off the train and yet cant because of the accusing look in her eyes
pointedly then how do you know its his
with typical child logic he told me
he speaks german
but he told you its his birthday
the girl nods firmly as do the other children
the boy watches it all wide eyed
helmut figures to put an end to this
what date is this
after thinking it over why its his birthday
this is too much for helmut to fathom
he turns his head away trying to think
dont you believe him
helmut turns back to them looking first at the girl then at the boy his little upturned tear stained face full of wonder
helmut softens recalling perhaps his own birthday disappointment
of course i do
pats boys head tell him i wish him a happy birthday
he knows that
but whatre you going to do about a present
helmut fans his clothes finds the harmonica and produces it with a flourish
aha the very thing
he can be the clown while im gone
as helmut bows and holds out the harmonica to him
the boy looks solemnly at helmut and the harmonica
he doesnt quite seem to understand what this is all about but the harmonica is enticing
he looks up at his countrymen for encouragement
they smile at him and he takes the harmonica examines it then blows into it experimentally
when he hears the sound that comes out he brightens
then the little girl with the rag doll comes forward and offers it to the boy
he looks at her strangely one of the older german boys scoffs
hes a boy
dolls are for girls
the little girl is hurt and looks to helmut for support
when you give something you love
it doesnt matter if its the right thing
he takes the doll and puts one of its hands in the boys hand the other in the little girls
they stand looking at each other and sharing the doll
helmut looks towards the door apprehensively but there seems to be no action outside and there are the eyes of the children on him
maybe we have time for a birthday game
a quick one
let me take a look
helmut goes back to the door
he glances around outside
there still seems to be time
he returns to the children
everybody line up behind me now and ill show you how a train goes
wait the harmonica
helmut looks around for the new owner of the harmonica
he goes over to him
may i borrow it back
for just a minute or two
the boy studies him dubiously with that indian giver look in his eyes
for just a minute then ill give it right back to you
trying a sort of sign language just for the game
finally the boy hands over the harmonica and manages a smile because he sees all the other children smiling at him
line up behind me
the children scramble into line behind him
helmut looks back at them
grab hold of the one in front of you
cause were going to be a fast express train
the children laughing and giggling grab hold of one another
calling out all aboard
he puts the harmonica to his lips and begins huffing and puffing on it imitating a train
he begins to shuffle his feet and move slowly down the side of the car
the children holding on for dear life and following him
their eyes shining with expectation as helmut begins to quicken his pace
dim shafts of light from the two small square vent openings near the top on each side gives the boxcar an eerie look
helmut stops abruptly as he hears the slamming of the door
the children pile up behind him
he moves quickly to the door and tugs at it
finding it locked he pounds on it
open the door
let me out
let but the train noises drown his voice
then the boxcar suddenly lurches and starts to move forward
helmuts pounding weakens and stops
he turns from the door his face reflecting his fright
the children not quite understanding what has happened gather around him and pull on him
he manages to control his fear and looking at the children he manages a big smile
guess im going with you after all
he switches on the lantern and holds it high so its rays cover all the children
lets play some more doork
helmut glances down at the tot started by the suggestion
then he nods in a stunned sort of way
he puts the harmonica to his mouth and begins puffing on it
scharff and sergeant hoffman stand watching the boxcar move away
im glad thats over
call in the sentries
he starts to move away
kessler in the car
looking around i
i guess he is sir
scharff races to the car with sergeant hoffman right behind him
the camera follows them
scharff peers inside and finds the car empty
with an angry glance at hoffman he hurries to the truck and looks in the cab
it too is empty
moving back toward hoffman i told you to get him off the train
i told him sir
he was standing right by the door
im sure he got off
did you see him
you told me to see that the car was coupled on
when i came back
why wouldnt he get off
the other soldiers come running from o
the clown prisoner is missing
he may have escaped
search the area
if he got off the train he must be around here someplace
the soldiers rush o
into the deepening darkness
you know what happens if he gets away
hopefully he cant get very far
scharff looks o
after the disappearing train
if hes on that train hes going farther than you know the rear of the boxcar is just disappearing from sight in the darkness
or he knows
it is the next morning
light is coming from the vents and the lantern which hangs from a peg in the middle of the right side of the car
helmut is asleep on the floor with the children huddled around him
he lies on his side with one arm thrown protectively over the little czech girl inga and willie
behind him the czech birthday boy and the girl with the doll are cuddled close to him
other youngsters have their heads on his legs and feet and all are as close to him as they can get
he is in fact a sort of human bed
from the train noises o
we can tell that the freight train is slowing down
then with a jolt it stops and o
we hear a truck engine approaching
helmut stirs and sits up trying to get his bearings
this arouses some of the children and they too sit up and look around
what is it
are we there doork
where are we
why are we stopping
i dont know
he untangles himself rises and stretches his numbed arms and legs
he starts toward the door but it slides open suddenly and a burly guard vaults inside
behind him we see a truck similar to a moving van being backed up to the boxcar
helmut blinks uncertainly at the light pouring through the door
the children are too startled to move
the guard notices helmut and reacts
who the hell are you
where are we
how the devil did you get in here
im from the other prison
got locked in by accident
shouting out the door sergeant
we see now that the train has stopped at an isolated siding
the truck has backed up almost to the door of the boxcar
a sergeant climbs down from the cab of the van and hurries to the boxcar door the camera panning him there
whats the matter
look at this
hes from the other camp
got in here with the shipment
how did that happen
i was taking care of the children back there and
accidentally got locked in
of all the
whats your name
realizing hes in big trouble doork
the sergeant fumes for a moment then
to the guard put him in the truck with the others
and lets get going
angle to the door as the sergeant disappears
reaching out the burly guard lowers the tailgate of the truck so that it forms a bridge to the boxcar
to the children all right in the truck quick now
the children most of whom are on their feet now hesitate looking to helmut for guidance
the guard seizes one youngster and shoves him toward the door
instead however the child flies to helmut and grabs him around the legs
i said move
to the children everybody up
up up up
he moves around helping the still seated children to their feet
when theyre all up
to helmut not you
dont you want me to stay with them
theyll be frightened without me
not for long they wont
to guard thats enough
get them inside and keep them quiet
burly guard starts to prod the children but they dont move their eyes are fixed on helmut
threateningly do as he says
and dont worry ill be with you soon
reluctantly the children march off
they look back frequently at helmut who waves to them
to helmut come along now
they walk over to a two story building
helmut looks back in the direction of the children then looks about the camp
this is just another prison
whatd you expect
i thought the children were going to a better place
the sergeant with an incredulous look on his face stares at helmut
the cell is a small bare cubicle containing only a cot and an open toilet
in the wall fronting on the prison yard there is a small barred window
helmut stops pacing and moves over to it and looks out
the camera swings so that it is shooting past helmuts head through the window
at the far end of the yard we can see the windowless stone buildings
as helmut stares out at them we hear approaching footsteps
helmut stiffens turns toward the door as the sound of the footsteps grows louder and louder
the camera swings toward the door as it opens to reveal captain curt runkel a slender impeccably groomed and thoroughly nazified officer of the elite s
he is the embodiment of all hitlerian ideals
runkel strides into the cell
over shoulder to guard at door close the door and wait out there
guard closes the door
runkel studies helmut coldly
without taking his eyes off helmut he pulls out a cigarette case takes out cigarette lights it and slowly inhales
youre a remarkable man
helmut stirs uneasily
have you any idea where you are
helmut shakes his head
this is auschwitz
a beat mean anything to you
before helmut can answer you may have observed were enlarging our facilities
he moves over to the window and looks out puffing slowly on his cigarette
still a great deal of work to be done
proudly its going to be our most efficient most modern prison
he turns and smiles and i might add most unique
walks back towards helmut studying him carefully yes you are a remarkable man
i always wonder about remarkable men
then evenly why did you come here
i got locked in the boxcar and
cuts in still bland ah yes
unavoidable i suppose
i was taking care i mean the commandant requested me to take care of the children
a slight note of mockery the commandant
runkel tosses his cigarette on the floor and very deliberately grinds it out with his boot
ive spoken to your commandant
he hs you listed as an escaped prisoner
finishing it for him it was an accident
his face close to helmuts are you one of them clown
terrorized at the thought of death no
im not one of them
runkel smiles moves away from helmut
you misunderstand completely
the judas goat is never killed
he isnt worth killing
moves to cell door im just asking you to lead them
his eyes plead no
i cant do it
even to save your own life
for a brief moment helmut struggles to find the courage to stand up to runkel but he has no courage and he sinks slowly to his knees his head bowed
victorious im glad to see youre not a self appointed martyr
runkel towers above helmut who sits back on his haunches leaning against the wall
now youre really one of us
the truth of runkels remark hits helmut like a devastating blow
he turns his face to the wall in shame
runkel walks to the door raps on it the guard outside swings it open
attempting to get to his feet sir
could i have a little time with them before before
his voice trails off
runkel looks at helmut while he thinks it over
he moves back to the middle of the cell
yes of course
he looks at his watch i can give you about half an hour
a little smile lights his face you see were not heartless men here
angle to the door as helmut and the sergeant approach from o
helmut has freshened his make up
remember what i told you
there wont be any trouble
helmut goes to the door and starts to open it
the camera moves up to with a great effort he composes himself and throws open the door
angle to the door where helmut stands wearing an enormous grin
the children are about the barren room in little groups
when they see helmut they leap up and run to him clinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves into the room
doork doork you came back
you came back
we thought youd left us
dont leave us doork
the children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear and delight at his return
helmut goes among them patting their heads comfortingly
its all right
its all right
everything is going to be all right
when the youngsters are calmed helmut holds up his hands for silence
now i want everyone to put on a big smile and sit down because were going to have more fun than weve ever had
slowly still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear the children sit on the floor
well start by seeing that we all have our names on our heads
the children begin to lower their heads so helmut can check to see if their names are still there
as he moves among them yes yes
theres fritz maria sadie inga josef nathan helga willie
the little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for helmut to see
ah yes frederika
i see all of your names
this is almost too much for helmut but he manages to control himself by turning away for a beat
then he turns back to the children his big smile back in place
on with the show
just watch this
their little faces are troubled worried
it is a half hour later and now the children are laughing at something helmut is doing o
the camera pulls back to helmut is walking an imaginary tightrope
every few steps he almost loses his balance but with comical gyrations he manages to complete the walk
he bows deeply to the children and falls flat on his face
the youngsters laugh applaud and squeal delightedly
helmut is lying on the floor near the boy
he looks up at the tot and grins
helmut grabs willie and holds him close while he fights back his tears
willie plants a big kiss on his cheek
helmut scrambles to his feet the camera pulling back to shooting past helmut to the door as it opens revealing the sergeant his face expressionless
to helmut its time
just a few more minutes
the sergeant shakes his head
ill bring them
the children are watching him puzzled
whats the matter doork
where are we going
you come with us this time
wherere they taking us
trying to think what to say they
they want us to move to another building
where well have more room
a beat tell you what
lets make it a big circus parade
everybody get in a line behind
he picks up willie and stands him near the door
continuing behind willie here
the children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the very proud willie
helmut looks around for the boy with the harmonica
now wheres our band
he sees the boy and goes to him
helmut pantomimes playing the harmonica and points to himself
the boy smiles widely fishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up
there we are
here we go
helmut takes his place at the head of the line like the pied piper leads the youngsters out the door playing a crude sort of circus parade music
the little children giggle excitedly as they troupe out
the older ones seem less certain but as long as helmut is with them they feel secure
as the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks with helmut dancing along at its head
the sergeant and the other two guards stand watching in disbelief as the line turns and moves along toward the first of the windowless buildings
they look at each other incredulously
what they are seeing surpasses their imagination
shooting from a high angle as the procession moves toward the camera
helmut looks back at his charges from time to time smiling and waving and always puffing away on the harmonica
the children smile back some timidly and some a bit fearfully but all smile
camera pans in on the children as they march behind helmut
we see some of them strutting their little arms swinging freely
some of the little ones have to skip to keep up with the others
they are all smiling
with each step helmut looks about his eyes searching heaven praying for the miracle that will save the children
the sudden blast of thunder the striking down of the guards
as they follow the parade warily almost as if expecting a trick
they wear scowls worn into their faces by long use
its steel door gapes open
through the open doorway we can see a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads jutting from the wall
a single ceiling light gives the room a stark appearance
the camera pulls back and up as the procession comes up toward the building
despair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no miracle
he looks ahead into the room his courage fails him and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him run into his legs
he turns and looks at them then back to the door
almost reluctantly helmut stands aside
he tries to smile but the result is almost grotesque
he tries to speak but no words come
the sergeant and the guard drift up toward him scowling
gently helmut tousles the hair of little willie and steers him through the door into the room
the other children follow him hesitantly
helmut puts the harmonica to his lips and begins playing again
theyve got to undress
the sergeant starts to move toward the line of children the sergeant grabs his arm and stops him
leave them alone
shooting over helmuts shoulder down at the children as they file past him
each one hesitates a beat before him and looks up at him
their faces are wondering but trusting
they smile tentatively
only the little girl with the doll hangs back waiting for something rather than fearful of entering
when all of the other children have gone in she goes up to helmut and wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to enter with him
in her eyes is the absolute certainty that he will
he looks down at her hand for a long beat
the little girl waits for helmut but he doesnt take her hand
shyly she begins to withdraw it
suddenly helmut reaches out and grabs her hand clutching it desperately as he needs her innocence to control the panic that is tearing at him
holding on to her to steady himself they walk together into the room the camera panning with them
angle to the door as helmut and little girl enter
suddenly the door slams shut behind them
helmut whirls to it instinctively as if to shove it open or cry out for help but he does neither
his face is pressed against the steel door
he fights the panic within him
then he quickly wipes his eyes and turns back towards the children
slowly he takes three chunks of stale bread from his coat pocket and begins juggling them at the same time waggling his head from side to side slowly at first
then more gaily
from deep inside him comes a tiny tiny laugh
the camera pulls back slowly to reveal the children in the f
suddenly helmut tosses the pieces of bread high high into the air and stretches out his arms to encompass all the children
as they gather around him they take up his soft laugh timidly at first then more assuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter
