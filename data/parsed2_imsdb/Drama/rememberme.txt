written by william fetters jenny lumet revised april th its very late
just the sounds of the city linda santana craig an attractive hispanic woman in her thirties waits at the elevated station for the f train
linda looks great
shes dressed festively but tastefully
next to her is her eleven year old daughter alicia
she is twirling about the platform still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in the city
alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag
we notice a charm bracelet with four leaf clovers on her right wrist
the mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform
two teenage boys wait at the other end
they speak soft slurred spanish to each other
linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates
she watches them as alicia spits a wad of gum into her moms open hand
the boys approach
at the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell
its quiet again
linda relaxes smiles at her daughter
the f train is rounding the final bend into the station
their focus is on this train
its getting closer louder
and so they dont see dont hear the boys coming back up the stairwell behind them
not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun
linda puts her arm around her daughter
alicia looks terrified
the train roars into the station as linda quickly hands over her purse her watch
she hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band
one of the boys yanks alicias little purse away from her
the other boy fumbles the wedding band
the ring clangs to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away
we hear mens voices echoing up the stairwell
now the boys are boxed in
and starting to panic
the boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform
through the window on the train linda stares at the boy holding her daughters purse her face hardening into a mask the boy clocks it
who does she think she is
when a hand with tattooed knuckles reaches out and stops the car doors from closing
a forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car
theres a muzzle flash
a distant pop
a cloud of smoke a mist of blood
and lindas body collapses on itself
alicias face shock terror and blood
a working crime scene lots of uniforms and light a white sheet draped over lindas body where it fell
blue and red light dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time
late thirties big plain clothes he is sergeant james craig
when he reaches the platform he stops
craig kneels before the white sheet
peels it back
we stay on him
we dont see what he sees
we just see how he sees it
then he turns
the wedding band
its been tagged and numbered as evidence
craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket
alicia wrapped in a blanket standing next to a round police matron
the matron is tenderly trying to clean alicias face
alicia locks eyes with craig and stumbles towards him her legs not quite working
craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground
alicia makes little gasping noises
trying to speak but cant
craig walking back now carrying his entire world
he reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee
the closest uniform puts a hand on his arm
a deep breath
then as quickly as he went down hes back up
craig looks back now taking it all in
is it real
sees all the cops looking at him then begins down the stairs
we drift up above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of manhattan where the twin subtitle eight years later tiny kitchen clutter
a messenger bike hanging from hooks on the wall a lot of books
there is a phone ringing under the bed
tyler roth early twenties handsome looking haggard
he is sitting on the floor shirtless bed head wrapped in a blanket
a guitar is on his lap
tyler has propped some well worn hand written pages of music against a box of off brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes frustration etched in his face
a forgettable blonde lies sleeping on the bed
tyler not a born musician is trying to teach himself one of the phrases of music in front of him
he is completely lost in the moment with deep grooves in his fingers
by the ashtray next to him we can tell hes been at this a couple of hours
the blonde in the bed re the ringing phone
out of it hello
tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone simultaneously glancing at the digital clock
his eyes widen in alarm
listens of course
im on my way
tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants
before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a tattoo that simply says michael over his heart
he searches through a beat up chest of drawers seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt
gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it
and scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher brush
i tend to agree with the first part
a cluster of mourners stand before a tombstone in the distance
they are not in funeral dress as this is not a funeral
its a memorial
a beat up gypsy cab with a west indian driver pulls to a stop
from the trees and the sky we know its late spring early summer
a gorgeous day
tyler gets out of the cab holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth
he sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver who screeches into reverse
time is money
tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke
he takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket
he begins towards the mourners
diane hoffman a beauty
past burdens etched in the lines on her face
dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian
she smiles like someone whos been crying but doesnt want anyone to know she has
sweetly hello your majesty
how are you
you look good
he kisses his mothers hand and hes moving to greet his stepfather
les hoffman unruly curls streaked in gray tweed jacket and tie
they exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos
the weight of tylers gaze falls to caroline roth his diminutive bespectacled eleven year old sister
shes holding a little paper bag
she flashes him a look
he kneels besides her and whispers
thanks for organizing everybody
caroline makes a face
turns her nose away from him
you smell like listerine and beer
he snorts and kisses her cheek
caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones on which she has painted the names mom tyler les dad caroline
she begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave
charles roth late fifties breathes power precisely dressed two hundred dollar haircut
aside to tyler you couldnt wear a tie
tyler holds his fathers eye
charles adjusts his own collar like its an explosive
pov the tombstone
the four adult family members stand side by side
they look like strangers on the subway as caroline sits on the ground arranging the stones
the family sits together in a booth
tyler rolls a bic lighter over his knuckles
caroline draws a funny portrait of tyler on her napkin
he is smoking nine cigarettes at once
diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention
les is eyeing the cheesecake
charles subtly aligns his silverware
this is nice
i think its nice that we still do this
im trying to purge nice from my vocabulary
michael would like that we still do this
tyler takes out a cigarette
without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass
to caroline did you tell tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait
caroline as bemused as an eleven year old can be looks at her mother then at her brother
she adopts a very motherly tone
tyler did i tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait
why no caroline
what did your art teacher say about your portrait
smiling you two
she flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes les hand
she was very impressed
she said i captured a moment like a young james whistler
the waitress brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table
les dives in
charles is having toast
he sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his patek phillippe
cause whistler really fell off late in his career
hes the michael jackson of european art history
she suggested your sister take pratts summer art intensive and thats hugely prestigious
caroline looks a bit sheepish tyler high fives caroline
diane again flickers a glance at charles
i would be the youngest one ever practically
tyler would you please pass the butter
caroline was speaking
to charles are you really this clueless
are you really dismissing her like this
diane touches carolines hair
caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed
caroline are you feeling dismissed
solicitous to caroline i didnt mean to change the subject
what was the subject
the subject we were discussing
what was it
nows not the time for your heroics tyler no
its the perfect time
charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar
father and son lock eyes until
whispering to caroline do you need me to take you anywhere
caroline shakes her head
ill stay with mom
diane glares at her ex husband
tyler rises and kisses his sisters forehead
then ill see you after school
he exits as caroline sips her lemonade avoiding everybodys eyes
tyler standing although there are a few seats available
the car window strobes behind him
he takes off his jacket and button down and ties them both around his waist
tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out of place amidst all the business types
he sits in the last booth facing the street
his tattered journal lies open in front of him a binder clip holds his page as he works quietly crafting an entry
the hostess tired in her s slides a piece of baklava on the table as she shuffles past
tyler gives her a huge grin
tyler and his roommate aidan brewer energetic inappropriate walking west towards n
young people in easy summery dress
aidan remembers something smirks
i sold your girlfriend a toothbrush
you sold my who
that voluptuous delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning
i sold her a toothbrush
got three bucks
are in order yes
because that sale inspired our newest business venture the s
i was unaware we had a previous business venture
the single ladys universal tote
its the one night stand travel pack for women
we throw in some make up toiletries cell phone charger cab numbers
retail it at s
maybe do an infomercial
and you think women would buy this
hey one night stands happen
its a part of life
like stubbing your toe
sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls
smell like cinnamon
nodding sagely of course
dont underestimate the novelty gift market
think about it
instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten inch purple dildo for her birthday you hook her up with the slut
everyone has a laugh and the implication that shell probably use it someday remains
what do you say
are you down
im down with getting you on some sort of medication
just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb
one of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at mickey ds or something
dennys was big in the th century
a tinted town car stops in front of a funky corner brownstone where caroline waits in a plaid jumper on the front steps
the driver opens the back door of the car
caroline in the cavernous backseat alone
her pink knapsack her only company
the town car stops at a crosswalk for a group of children in jeans and tee shirts on their way to a local public school
caroline sees them through the tinted glass
they couldnt see her even if they wanted to
its an unfortunate reality but a reality nonetheless
tyler sits in the back of the room
their professor addresses the few students paying attention
in the wake of terrorist attacks these insurance company actuaries are provided a unique opportunity to raise premiums and profits to protect against events that will likely never occur again
one girl a focused brunette with beautiful eyes takes notes relentlessly
she is present absorbing the material
she raises her hand
isnt that also an ethical question
tyler shoots her a glance
he takes in her lovely face her casual dress and the charm bracelet with its four leaf clovers
we realize this is alicia ally craig now
tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope
at the alice in wonderland statue where kids climb all over the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters
the statue is warm the bronze absorbing the late spring sun
tyler is perched on the mad hatter his face turned towards the sun while caroline hides with the dormouse
tyler lights a cigarette
an uptight mommy glares at him
why dont we make this a non smoking statue
emerging yeah tyler
why dont we make this a non smoking statue
he makes a face
you promised youd quit
youre gonna get emphysema and then youre gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere
you think that would be the worst part about having emphysema
everywhere you go tyler
even the bathroom
tyler takes a final drag
tosses it on the ground
why do you think dad doesnt wanna
like listen to me
dad loves you
caroline gives him a look
you can love someone and not want to spend any time with them
caroline is climbing around alice
her hands on alices hair
youve got that right
mom loves aunt sara
but at christmas last year she wouldnt let les leave them in a room together cause she said there would be a yule tide homicide
thats because aunt sara drinks
you dont drink right
so why would anyone wanna avoid you
caroline shrugs not convinced
a silent moment passes
michael used to drink
but michael was
all year olds drink because its new and exciting
aunt sara drinks because she wishes she was
a shared smile
tylers smile fades
tyler on a rolling ladder shuffling books around
aidan on the floor eating two pieces of pizza folded down the middle at the same time
what about atlantic city for your birthday this year
get a suite
couple of ladies
you could call toothbrush girl what do you think
i think id rather be sodomized
hey its your day
he gestures to the shelves
whats the point
how do you know where anything is in this place anyway
eight miles of books
i dont expect you to appreciate this but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together
and ended up dead or in prison
this is why chicks dig you
they like this freaky poetic crap
i ran into megan yesterday
shes bartending at don hills tonight
she wants us to stop by
she practically begged me
aidan visibly frustrated with tylers reluctance grabs the rolling ladder and pushes tyler into the romance novels
youve been a ghost the past couple weeks
you never wanna go out
im feeling unappreciated here
aidan contd i cant deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man
im ready to set up an intervention
a silent moment passes
you realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking
come out for one drink
whens the last time you had one drink
a hip venue on greenwich street
aidan and tyler make their way through the crowd to a congested bar where the cute bartender is swamped
she ignores him
you look great
can i get two heinekens
tyler snorts with laughter
genuine is she mad at me or something
girls are like that when theyre way into you
two nubile young girls approach aidan
tap his shoulder
aidan flashes a winning smile
could you take a picture for us
she holds out her camera
aidan hesitates then smiles
the girls pose
aidan takes the camera
turns it around
and promptly snaps a picture of himself
he casually returns the camera to the confused young woman
megan returns and practically flings the beers at aidan
youve met my roommate
i hope you die
tyler laughs his ass off
shes all over you
they clink bottles
tyler and aidan stand with the girls from aidans photo opportunity
all are thoroughly intoxicated
there is a knot of club goers halfway down the block drinking and having a fine time
i love this street
i love this city
where are you guys from again
miami barcelona rio
new york is it man
god broke the mold when he made this city
you ever actually been to any of those places
whats your point
theres a gust of wind
aidans girl shivers
shes wearing a tiny dress
what are we doing
shoulda worn a jacket
o s we hear a beer bottle crashing on the ground and from far away a ghostly plaintive girls voice disappearing into the night
mi i chael
tyler turns towards the sound
its as if hes trying to spot a train in the distance
his hand goes to his pocket and fishes out his pack of cigarettes
to aidan asshole
she walks away looking back at her friend annoyed
are you coming
tylers girl looks at tyler who is still preoccupied
to her friend hold on lauren
the girls step away
tylers girl appears to be trying to convince her friend to stay
aidan watches them hopefully
tyler isnt watching them
hes watching two cool looking musicians crossing the street with the light carrying sound a quartet of neanderthals pulls up at the light in front of them in a car
aggressive music playing
the neanderthal at the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch the car forward startling the musicians toying with them
musician glares but gives no further response he just wants to get across the street
the neanderthal revs and lurches again
musician slams his hand on the hood of the car
whats your problem
keep your hands off my car asshole
blow it out your ass guido
go back to long island
the cars four doors open and the neanderthals lope to the front of the car
the driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side
im from queens faggot a neanderthal shoves one of the musicians and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat
tyler watches as the neanderthals overpower them
the altercation has turned into a full on assault
the musicians are getting stomped into the pavement
so we were thinking we could go
tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her
under his breath god damn it
aidan runs off after tyler
tyler jumps fully into the thick of it swinging grabbing the beefiest neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the guys face
he fights like a pit bull
not feeling not stopping
aidan gets punched in the face
tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched aidan and it spurts blood
then someone hits tyler in the gut and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin
the musicians get back to their feet and fight back
its a brawl
aidans girl is screaming for the cops
tylers girl following the instincts of the inebriated has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself
a neanderthal swings at aidan and misses grazing the girl
she jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement splitting her lip on impact
tyler head butts the guy
an ambulance and two e
s are on site
the combatants from the brawl are lined up on the curb
sergeant james craig a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station is standing with the girl who is a mess
her nose bloody her dress torn
craig shields the girl with his body listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls gesture angrily at the neanderthals
craigs eyes flicker in the same direction
craigs partner leo african american a few years younger is on the radio to dispatch
craig snaps his fingers at one of the e
s and receives a blanket which he carefully wraps around the girl
then to his partner indicating tyler and aidan
cut those two loose
leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys
quiet take a walk
tyler takes a beat looking at the lineup
aidan rubbing his wrists gestures lets go
tyler looks at the bloodied girl and
craig going through the pockets of neanderthal
anything in here thats going to stab me einstein
craig finds a packet or a vial
you like to get high and hit women
aidan gives tylers elbow a gentle tug
tylers caught up in the action
i dont even know the bitch
rage flickers across craigs face
craig moves down the line to one of the musicians going through their pockets
how about you two
tyler compelled drawing closer to the action
it wasnt us man
that cocksucker kicked my car
shut up genius
to neanderthal eat shit pencil dick
everybody goes downtown
tyler steps forward interrupting
it wasnt them
aidan who has been edging away jerks around to his friend
quietly to the guys take a walk i said
craig big angry irish cop turns to tyler
they didnt do anything
they didnt start this
those assholes did
why do these guys have to go downtown
what are you still doing here
this is bullshit
it was those gorillas who started this
craig moves slowly toward tyler and starts going through tylers pockets roughly
he finds his wallet
starts rifling through
what makes you think i give a shit
youre a police officer
youre supposed to
what the hell
craig looks from the guy he was frisking to tylers girl wrapped in a blanket
she spits blood
he turns a bit to tyler
its a great relief to me mr
roth to know that youre on top of the situation
now go the fuck home
he turns back to work
tyler looks briefly at aidan
aidan looks desperate please
lets get out of here
tyler touches craigs elbow
aidans jaw drops
leo takes several silent steps in
craig looks at his own elbow then looks at tyler
the kid must be out of his mind
how about you do your job
craig takes tylers legs out driving his face into the pavement a gash opens above tylers left eye
tyler lies there dazed and disoriented as craig with one knee on tylers neck crushes his face into the ground
he slaps the cuffs on
who knows what time it is
a lovely assortment of perpetrators tyler and the musicians are in lockup
everybody looks like shit
tyler sits on a bench in the holding cell looking quite relaxed
the lock up door slides open and aidan is returned to the perch
the escorting officer shouts across the din to tyler
you can have your call now
the door slides shut behind aidan
thank god youre good
what are you trying to do
what did you want from that cop guy
that was a messed up situation
he cups his hands to make a megaphone
from off screen a chorus of faggot
candy ass faggot
there was no justice in that situation
okay green hornet
aidan contd you may not be actually matriculating in school you may be having a nice time by yourself lurking in the stacks of your book store but i actually
plan on graduating and having a career and a wife and a girlfriend and a divorce and a mid life stalking episode and erectile dysfunction and i will thank you to keep your complexes and nihilistic bullshit
did you just say nihilistic
i got it off a cereal box
the escorting officer returns with a white male lawyer wearing a two thousand dollar suit
tyler glares at aidan
yeah i called your dads office
ally with a cup of coffee is on the house phone
so when would that be available
no thats sooner than id thought
and is there any kind of deposit
craig comes in through the kitchen door takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink
ill call you back
ally hangs up
makes a quick appraisal of her dad
he has a little blood on his cuff
he splashes his face with water
on automatic pilot ally flips on the toaster pours some hot coffee into a sesame street mug pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser then flips
open a bottle of aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug
she packs up her back pack with school stuff as craig gulps his coffee
what did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight
the toaster dings
she extracts an english muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear
im breathing right now
who was that
the lady from student housing
we talked about it
ally grabs her sweatshirt
lippman is going to drive me
ill drive you
she flounces out the door holding her own cup of coffee and the english muffin
craig dries his hands grabs his jacket and a set of keys from the counter
outside their red brick row house at the end of a block of red brick row houses
ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag
craig comes around the drivers side and slides ally her keys across the roof
she drops them in her bag
lippman said shed do it
craig is in the drivers seat waiting
ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat
she hands him his english muffin which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car
she flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup
when you have a stroke im going to abandon you on a park bench
they start to back out
this drive is too long
tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area
english club chairs green baize on the walls
a receptionist types away across the room
tyler takes out a cigarette
draws the ire of
you know you cant smoke in here
tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him
its clearly never been used
so whats with the ash tray
it completes the room
tyler takes a long drag grinding out the ember on the pristine surface
he smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman
janine charles long time assistant late forties kind eyes watches tyler from the hallway
hes ready for you
tyler follows janine down the corridor
she looks him up and down doesnt like what she sees
youre too skinny
and you smell like french fries and cigarettes
nice to see you too
you want me to lie
tyler smiles he likes that she doesnt lie
janine scrolls through a palm pilot as she walks
they approach the double doors to charles office
try not to give him a heart attack
tyler bangs through the doors
a row of floor to ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds
sunlight glows behind them
theres a lot of leather brass and rich wood breathing power
theres a flat screen computer but no personal effects anywhere
charles sits at his massive desk
as tyler enters charles registers his injuries
a flicker of something over charles face
i came to see how much it costs because im giving you the money back
how much what costs
that lawyer tyler costs dollars an hour
in spite of himself
tell me about it
i wanted to make sure you understood it wasnt me who called you
you could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail i dont want to be bailed out of anything
charles looks at his son
ill get an invoice from janine
tyler leaves slamming the door behind him
tyler stops catching himself realizing the emptiness of the gesture
he looks up and sees janine looking at him
tyler in the same booth surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women
hes writing in his journal his foot tapping fast
we see the very act of writing eases him loosening his strangled grip on the pen slowing down the manic rhythm of his foot
its just after three caroline emerges from school in a cluster of th grade girls
one of them dips her head towards carolines ear as if to share a secret
whatever she says makes carolines face crumble almost to tears and the girls snicker
tyler hops from his perch on a parked car
his bike leans on a fire hydrant
to caroline hey
he looks at the girls sizing them up and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk cool as hell
the girls have a group swoon
he takes caroline by the elbow
excuse us were due in surgery
he gets his bike and leads her down the block towards fifth avenue
what happened to your face
horrible threshing accident
youre so retarded
dont mock the afflicted
here i brought you something
he hands her the book of myths
this was my favorite book ever
michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until i read it
its about all these god and goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings
the illustrations are amazing
caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek
these are cool
where are we meeting mom
whats up with those girls
they think im weird
sometimes i sort of space out
when youre drawing
other times too
madamoiselle fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today
and everybody laughed and they all think im a freak of nature
caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder towards the school
je mappelle freak of nature
mon dieu mon soeurette
je mappelle freak of nature
what are you going to tell mom about your face
i finally found something im good at
aidan appears to have cornered a professor on her way in or out of the building
the woman looks tired annoyed like she just wants to go
aidan talks fast even faster than usual
i know by every numerical measurement i didnt pass but what i was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass
my commitment to effort
my commitment to commitment
since the semester is nearly at its terminus
craigs car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags
ally gives him a kiss on the cheek
she gets out and walks up the stairs right past aidan
distracted i mean
lifes only about what we put into it
its about people
and what they put into it
and im ah screw it
aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps
tyler again with the guitar
aidan enters excited
hes got a daughter
the cop who busted your face all up
hes got a daughter
and shes hot
i smell revenge
what do you want me to do kidnap her
you introduce yourself
go on a few dates
be your charming gentlemanly self
and then flip the script
what does that mean
screw her brains out and make her call you daddy
steal her underwear and sell it on ebay
put her in clown shoes take lewd photos and post them on her high schools home page
i dont know
you should be incarcerated on general principle
what happened to you was very emasculating
tell me you dont want to get that asshole and ill drop it
i dont want to get that asshole
just meet her
i dont want to meet her
i dont care
youre meeting her
im not meeting her
a student hangout
the place is bustling
numerous nyu students move sit eat lounge
aidan scans the crowd
tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic
this is one of those moments im already regretting
she was here yesterday
what am i supposed to say to this girl
hey doll face your dad trampled all over my civil liberties wanna make out
well dont call her doll face
she wears a big sweatshirt
aidan spots her
tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of coffee
i know her
i mean i dont know her but ive seen her
shes in my global politics class
there you go
something to open with
now get over there
tyler sighs begins toward ally
aidan gives a big thumbs up
ally briefly looks up from her book
my names tyler roth
i was wondering if i could bother you for a minute
he gives her a charming smile
youre already bothering me
the smile usually works
um im doing kind of a sociological experiment
i was hoping you could help me out
ally looks at him a little wearily holding her place in the book
what are you kidding me
tyler is genuinely taken aback
may i ask your name
it means you dont have a shot
a surprised laugh escapes from tyler
okay anonymous do you see the guy across the room pretending to read a text book looking in this general direction
aidan holds a math textbook at an awkward angle to mask his obvious interest in ally and tylers conversation
i have this theory that an objective third party having no prior contact would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him
hes my roommate
and ive witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that im biased as a subject but im convinced that he has an aura that people can actually perceive
so just take a good long look
and tell me what you think
she looks at aidan briefly who shifts to avoid her gaze
then she takes a peek at tylers profile
who else do you plan on asking
no one here
the parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties
in their late teens
beat well look you typically get something for participating in these things and ive run out of those big foam fingers so i was thinking maybe i could take you
out some night
she looks at him
or you could just go out with me on the off chance wed have an interesting conversation
i dont date sociology majors
theyre a rowdy bunch
indeed they are
lucky for you im undecided
ally tries to hide a smile
she closes her book and extends her hand
caroline in art class amongst a sea of green plaid
the girls work in relative silence drawing painting
the art teacher walks amongst them looking over their shoulders sees a lot of amateur art work then she comes upon caroline and stops
the teacher finds herself captivated by
a comic portrait of diane and les kissing in the doorway of their brownstone
diane has a bit of a manic smile and les is half her size
caroline notices her teacher staring
she doesnt like it and shifts to block her view
the teacher gently eases her back
caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room
caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when
the bitchy girls weve seen before start whispering and smirking
one of them mouths
kiss ass freak
carolines smile shrinks away and she goes back to work
ally in sweat pants an ancient tee shirt her hair in a scrunchie eating mallomars from the bag and reading
craig yells from the bottom of the stairs
he carries a bag from a video store
dont be mad
dad weve seen freaking erin brockovich twice already
you always cry
i do not
her cell phone rings
youre going to stand me up
i can feel it in my bones
ill be devastated
i was just
you were just sitting around in your pajamas watching t
im not watching t
she wipes her hands on her sweats smearing them with chocolate
and im going to meet you at the place at
what time again
she hangs up
she whips the scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the bathroom
ally comes down the stairs putting on her earrings
craig looks at ally confused
im going out
i can see that
well youre a trained investigator
she is moving quickly grabbing her bag her wallet
craig tosses her keys
who are you going with
a boy from school
i wasnt asking for permission
sharply i know
more gently have a good time
heres cab fare
he peels off a couple of twenties
should i wait up
craig puts his hands in the air in surrender
a hole in the wall lower east side thai restaurant
tyler and ally sit together perusing menus
a waiter approaches
to the waiter what desserts do you have
dessert special fried bananas a la mode
great ill have that
a glass of skim milk
then the mussels please
tyler and the waiter share a look
pad thai and a sapporo
the waiter takes the menus
i have my dessert first
is this a political statement
a medical condition
i just dont see the point in waiting for something i know i want and am going to have
what if i die eating my mussels
is that probable
if an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant id die without having eaten the thing i wanted most
but the odds are i mean
ill tell you what you guarantee me
swear to me on your eternal soul that ill make it through my entree
and ill wait
tyler goes to answer
ally holds up a hand
before you answer keep in mind if i die youll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me but denied me my
my last wish
are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point
tyler thinks about it
tyler and ally exit out onto the street
tyler immediately takes out his cigarettes his lighter then he notices
ally looking at him disappointed
tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away
i had a nice time
you had a nice time or youre having a nice time
because if youre having one why rush to end it
they approach a carnival game one those ubiquitous basketball tosses
the attendant badgers passersby to test their luck
giant stuffed animals hang all around it
tyler pays the attendant gets the basketballs
tosses one two the third then nothing
did i tell you im caucasian
tyler pays again wipes out again
tyler pays again
hes visibly frustrated now
cant we just stroll while i feed you ice cream with fireworks in the background
if i stop he wins
who the attendant
no the frigging giant panda
tyler hands the attendant another dollar
ally carries a giant panda under her arm
tyler walking beside her with a self satisfied smile
i dont know what youre smiling about
paying off the attendant is not winning
i just paid a premium to cut out the middle man
thats free market enterprising
thats what made america great
by the way what happened to your eye
tyler touches the bandage
oh its nothing just a bar fight
im practically a pirate
okay captain morgan
laughing youve got some serious timing
its getting late
ill walk you to the train
ill take a cab
tyler is just hailing her a taxi
he stands there holding the door open
tyler leans in to kiss her
ally turns away
we goin or what
turn on the meter
tyler respectfully leans back
so dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid
kissing guy youre obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown new york night
she gives him a quick but tender kiss
youre really weird
she gets in the cab
to the driver im going to queens and i dont wanna hear about it
off she goes in the taxi
tyler watches her go
caroline exiting with the crowd
one of the bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes
tyler waiting on his perch catches it walks up to her
happy end of sixth grade
children climbing all over the bronze statue
caroline among them
she sits on a mushroom cap letting her legs dangle
tyler watches her from their usual bench his bike leaning next to him
they have me in this art program summer thing at pratt
its very prestigious due to my artistic greatness
i know youre proud
you should be
caroline allows herself a tiny grin
theres like a thing
sheepish a show where you show what youve done and stuff
will you come
let me check my book
abso freaking lutely
im camping out
im sleeping there the night before
caroline is secretly thrilled
youre so retarded
moms been hyperventilating with joy
im sure les was
your schools over right
yes its over
did mom and les get the beach house again
what are we going to do for your birthday
can we have a party
a little one
ill make mom behave
like thats possible
ally explores tylers living room with a tumbler of wine
its in a state of medium disarray
he clocks her looking
but we have coasters
i dont do coasters till the third date
she looks over his posters pictures etc
tyler scans a stack of cds he selects radioheads kid a puts it in
the hypnotic first track fills the room
ally comes across a framed photo of a band on stage
the lead guitarist looks like tyler with long hair
is that you
he looks like you
or you look like him
does he play around here
not any more
ally notices the old guitar in the corner
do you play
it depends who you ask
if i asked anybody
theyd say no
i try but it turns out you need talent
so what talents do you actually have
i come from a long line of falconers
theres a lot of money in that
hes actually a hair nervous
well there is one thing
tyler walks to the kitchen counter where a cleaned and polished covered cake stand sits
tyler lifts off the cover to reveal a german chocolate cake
hes written a message in the icing in case of ast and then a piece has been crudely cut out
it used to say in case of asteroid but i took a shower and aidan got high
ally and tyler stand in front of a sink full of dirty dishes up to their elbows in soapy water
so what kind of grade did you end up with from vogelstein
i dont actually get grades
im not technically enrolled
i worked out an auditing thing
and the strand is not a significant career choice
i like the books
he indicates the dishes
you dont have to help me you know
at the rate youre going dish washing is going to be your lifes vocation
i can say i knew you when
he flicks a bit of water on her shirt
ally takes a beat
this is the playful you get me all wet part
horsing around you make it sound so cheap
allys not having it
it is cheap
ive seen this scene a hundred times
tylers a little confused
you know what never happens in this scene tyler who doesnt really go to school
tyler who doesnt really care about his job
tyler blinks helplessly
an entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host
bits of spaghetti cling to him tiny tomatoes and zucchini on his shoulders like little barnacles
he sputters and gasps and blinks
no that usually never happens
she calmly goes back to washing dishes
spaghetti guy stares at her
she gives it right back to him new york city
in one move tyler slings ally over his shoulder
she grunts unglamorously
tyler bursts through the bathroom door
ally over his shoulder
never one to waste a moment she uses the opportunity to check out whats in his wallet
he turns on the shower
she has his drivers licence
your middle name is keats
your parents are pretentious as hell
tyler turns on the shower and tosses ally into the water
she dances to avoid the stream
ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him
tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray
they wrestle for the shower head
id rather eat monkeys
this cracks tyler up
he stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter putting up his hands in surrender
ally stands there holding the shower head giggling
they lock eyes for a moment
the air is charged
ally spritzes him in the face
oh my god youre relentless
he slides down the wall until hes sitting in the tub ally follows
victory at all costs
tyler and ally lie side by side drenched
their feet hang over the edge of the tub
tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet
he squeezes out water
he tosses them in a waste basket
you should quit anyway
are cigarettes like bad for you or something
ally playfully slaps him
she notices the tip of tylers tattoo peeking out of his undershirt
is that a tattoo
let me see
its not really
its very bad ass
all that ritualistic scarring
tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as ally offers polite applause
michaels name becomes clear
ally takes a long look
she sees tylers not smiling anymore
she gets it
i didnt realize
she looks at him
asking with out asking
he killed himself
when he was
he had just started working for my father
ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off tyler
i thought he was a musician
but he wasnt making a living doing music and my fathers a very compelling guy
ally looks away for a moment
tucks a curl behind her ear
then they look at each other
ally opens her mouth to speak
aidan bursts in
hes drunk loud wearing an irish flag like a cape
he carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of guinness
damn youre not naked
youre not irish
t what happened in the kitchen
it looks like somebodys water broke
notices ally hi
aidan takes allys hand
dont feel bad that youre more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them
ally looks at aidan closely trying to figure out where she knows him from it dawns on her
youre the assaholic
well i realizes what she said wait
tyler and ally laugh
aidans too drunk to care
alright you two
around the world party on the third floor
a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol
i cant i would id love to but ive gotta get home my dads waiting up
listen to me young lady
from any country
ill even put france on the table
and were gone
to tyler one drink
to aidan one drink
innocent shrug one drink
ally vomits in their toilet
tyler holds her hair back
aidan appears in the doorway still wearing that flag
hey how we doin
ally tries to speak all we hear is a series of groans
then she dry heaves again
tyler shoots aidan a look
what do you want me to say
that im sorry
you want me to say i m sorry
aidan contd you want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time
is that it
tyler just looks at him
tyler kneels down
ally pushes her purse at him she looks like shes about to pass out
i need you
tyler and aidan share a look
tyler pulls out her cellphone the battery is dead
your phones dead
just tell me the number and ill call him
tyler turns around to find ally passed out on the floor
he tries to gently nudge her awake
i know allys a good kid leo
the bedside clock reads
craig is on the phone while searching through allys desk drawers
he finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it
she was supposed to be back
shes not back
call ted proferes
and whats his face in the th
and call me back
just do it leo
craig hangs up the phone
he picks it up again and starts dialing still flipping through the notebook
ally wakes up alone in tylers bed hung over confused trying to put the pieces together then she sees the clock
and a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed
oh god oh god oh god oh god
tyler sleeps on the couch using aidans irish flag as a blanket
ally comes in pulling on her shoes
tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door
craig sits at the table dialing someone anyone
ally enters drops her keys on the counter
her father doesnt look at her as she pours herself a coffee
i fell asleep
craig squeezes honey into his coffee practically strangling the bear
not looking at her
ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone
you turned your phone off
i forgot to charge it
it dawns on her
from my desk
craig says nothing
just stirs his coffee
ally is furious
how could you
you were gone all night
i was trying to get some information
how could you go through my stuff like im a suspect
then stop acting like one
what is the matter with you dad
you have no respect for me and the way im feeling my privacy
we talked about this
youre totally paranoid
you watch your mouth
you dont do anything
you dont go anywhere except work
you have no life
my life is right here
in this house
the same place as yours
but youre spitting all over it
jesus christ dad
i went on a date
i smell alcohol
right back at him
so do i
he hits her hard open hand from across the width of his body
ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets
his face is contorted with panic and shame
her ears are ringing
her lip is split
a knot is starting to form where she hit her head
she straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is
craig tries to envelop her
with a guttural snarl she pushes him away getting a little bit of blood on his shirt
she scrambles up the stairs
sunshine beats down on a little make shift rooftop hideaway a few old beach chairs a stereo a weight bench
aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells
tyler sits on a beach chair trying again with the guitar
she just left
no good bye
tyler nods strumming like hes wearing boxing gloves
aidan finishes up a set
maybe she heard you play the guitar
you were the one dumping jello shots down her throat
you almost killed her
aidan lies down to do the bench press
theres a lot of weight on the bar
there are sins of omission and sins of commission my friend
ive dealt with mine and ive forgiven myself
you should do the same
its too heavy and falls to his chest
tyler forgoes his spotting duty lets him struggle
little help t
little help little help lotta help
tyler blows three perfect smoke rings
finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up
aidan panting rubbing his chest
what the hell was that
i have to get to work
tyler and aidan come into their apartment aidan still rubbing his chest
ally is standing there in the middle of the living area
a packed bag at her feet her face a mess
i didnt know where else to go
aidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a protein shake out of a blender
tyler comes out of his bedroom gently closing the door behind him
hows she doin
shes pretty shaken up
tyler takes a seat beside him
takes out a cigarette
weve really got to fix that dead bolt
you think shell sleep
you realize if she had had the if looks could kill
a silent moment passes
i told her she could stay here
are you alright with that
as long as she needs
tyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed
ally appears from the bedroom framed by the open door
she has slept in one of tylers button down shirts
can i get you anything
ill be out here if you need me
ally takes off the shirt and lets it fall
she stands there
we interrupt ally and tyler in the throes of passion
tyler sits on the edge of the bed
ally is on top
she kisses his neck
suddenly tyler throws her to the bed
he takes control
allys momentarily taken aback but doesnt stop him
theres noticeable aggression to their love making
in the midst of everything the pair slow almost to stopping a caesura
they stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition
young hungry aggressive
they lie eyes closed almost asleep entwined with each other
tyler gives a little sound of contentment
ally in her own haze reaches for him her hair all over the place
eyes still closed they fumble for each other starting in this dream state to make love all over again
the sheets have been torn loose from the mattress
ally lies asleep curled in the comforter
tyler lies awake beside her he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten
tyler gets out of bed
grabs his journal
a note propped up next to the bed please dont leave
ill be back
tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop
the place is empty
a few early risers get coffee to go
he sits in the same booth his journal held open by the binder clip
he writes a bag of bialys next to him
orders two coffees
she sees tyler smiles
she picks up her coffees and approaches him
i cant believe you still come down here
tyler looks up grins nods to her coffees
its not so far
i cant believe you still get his coffee
three sugars no milk
shrugs old habits
youre not writing anything bad about me are you
i gotta run
janine turns to go remembers something turns back
i probably wont see you before saturday so
tyler nods tries to smile
janine glances back as she goes
ill be sure to tell your father that you said hello
tyler nods sheepishly
tyler returns with breakfast
from aidans room a pathetic croak
tyler tosses him a bialy like hes tossing fish to a seal
ally lies on the couch
curled in a blanket
a cup of hot tea in hand
she sips it
it stings her lip a little
she shifts and curls next to him
where did you go
tyler pulls his journal from his pocket
hands it to her
theres a coffee shop
i brought you a bialy
new york is full of coffee shops
this one was our place
michaels and mine
we had breakfast there all the time
maybe not as many times as i think we did
but enough times
anyway we ate there that morning
it was the last place i saw him
so you go there to write
i dont know
but i guess i wanted to tell him about you
ally is moved you can see it in her eyes but she chooses not to overdo it
she flips through the journal
she hands it back to him
then out of nowhere
my mom was murdered eight years ago
the same year your brother died
tyler is stunned
you dont need to say anything i know youre sorry
everyones always sorry you know
its just i need you to know that my dad hes not an evil guy
ally contd i dont want you to think that because im here hes some kind of belligerent psychotic hes not
i dont know its just recently he seems really
she looks at tylers face
his eyes are so patient
ally tears up
our house is like the recovery room or the critical care unit or something
tyler strokes her hair
i dont feel like that though
i feel like im getting stronger and like im leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself
she is weeping
tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can
holding her and kissing her hair
sergeant craig standing with a rookie officer berating
tell me something matthews do you like paperwork
craig is working up a head of steam
nobody likes paperwork
but paperwork keeps our ship afloat
paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags
but i cant do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing
craig snaps his head around
leo gestures to speak privately
ally called sharon
she said to tell you shes with friends and shes fine
she didnt say
his partner nods
craig looks away
im sorry jim
listen why dont you come over this weekend
well get the grill going
sharon wants to see you
we can have some people nice people
you can circulate a little
craig goes back to his desk
leo looks after him
aidan sits in the living room trying to assemble an ikea television stand
a joint smolders in the ashtray
the buzzer rings
aidan goes to answer it
aidan its diane
oh hey diane
he throws down the keys then yells towards the roof
its your mom
with dianes knock the door swings open
he gives her a kiss on the cheek
you really have to fix that door
im so sorry to just show up
i called but your phone was busy
aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the hook as just the handset wrapped in duct tape is visible on top of the sofa
come on in
tyler and ally enter the apartment through the fire escape hey mom
im so sorry honey
i tried to call but
mom this is ally
ally this is my mom diane
nice to meet you
diane is thrilled
she has a huge mom grin
its lovely to met you
diane is pumping allys hand like shes drilling for oil
sit down mom
can i get you something
she navigates the ikea carnage and sits on the sofa the joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her
aidan ever the gent removes the ashtray to the window ledge
aidan would you bring back that spliff please
tyler looks completely befuddled
aidan passes diane the joint
she takes a deep hit
hows work diane
big exhale i just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks
so thats good
on the other hand i have six other families
the women measure each other
but tyler i wanted to talk to you
come on aidan
nice to meet you diane
she starts to drag aidan out the window back up the fire escape but he makes a brief detour
dont freaking bogart that joint diane
she hands it back to him and aidan and ally climb away
tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette
well first your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house
i wish youd told me
i wish shed told me
it was a unilateral caroline decision
will you make sausage and peppers
tyler your father is driving me crazy
i shouldnt even be discussing this with you
i cant get him to say hell come to your sisters exhibit
her art exhibit
he says hes in the middle of an ipo
tyler rubs his eyes
les says i shouldnt broker
i should let them be on whatever road theyre on
ill get him there
she cares about this even though shes pretending she doesnt
ill get him there mom
she looks relieved
she kisses his cheek and rises to go
he takes her to the door
why dont you bring that lovely girl to your birthday
a warning diane
i love you darling but this place reeks of marijuana
she goes shutting the door behind her
aidan and ally on the roof theyve arranged themselves in the deck chairs
that was weird
i assume most moms dont smoke weed in front of their sons
um piece of ass
you know youre a poet
i know one thing
i know that in the time ive lived with tyler he has never introduced a girl
to his mom before
its not like he had a choice
she ambushed us
yeah but he wouldve shoved you in a closet or something
or literally pretended you were a hallucination
i mean it
its the first time
did it ever occur to you that thats kind of weird
ally throws up her hands
tyler having pulled the decrepit house phone into the bathroom is leaning against the sink girding himself to call charles
he looks in the mirror and makes a face
janine pokes her head into charles office
charles is swamped with work and surrounded by underlings
charles its your son
charles is surprised
on the phone
he punches a button
tyler youre on speakerphone
its about carolines show
are you planning on attending
there are people here
youll have to speak up
tyler holds the phone away from his face and screams at it silently
what about it
ready to kill him you are coming right
well go to dinner first
to janine janine
ill make a reservation and have janine call you
he hangs up
tyler stares at the phone a sec then hits his head once against the bathroom door
tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with ally standing behind him with her hands over his eyes
caroline enters from the kitchen carrying tylers birthday cake
she has obviously decorated it herself
she has drawn as best as she could given the medium the characters from the alice statue in frosting
it reads a very merry unbirthday to you and has in numerical candles and to ungrow on written next to that
aidan ally diane are all singing
theres a flash from a camera off screen
caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song
tylers face in the candlelight as he sees carolines efforts
he takes a huge breath
make a wish
he looks at her and blows out the candles
everybody applauds diane longer than anyone else
her eyes are shining
the cake totally devoured
les is obsessively eating frosting
caroline is trying to teach aidan how to waltz in the living room
tyler rises from the sofa and takes over as carolines partner
she puts her feet on top of his feet and they waltz
one two three ally and diane are washing dishes in silence
youre the second member of this family ive washed dishes with
he was doing it to impress you
hes never washed a dish in his life
caroline at her desk sketching
her door is ajar
ally enters mouth agape as she lays eyes on carolines collection of artwork on the walls
carolines working on a portrait of tyler on a park bench cigarette dangling from his bottom lip
a perfect rendering of a fleeting moment
ally looks over carolines shoulder
thats exactly him
its like the cigarette is the last coca cola in the desert
i cant believe he smokes in front of you
dont worry im not that impressionable
caroline goes back to work
ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls
it stirs a memory
you know when i was younger we didnt have air conditioning in the house so during the summer my mom and i would go to museums to cool down
she loved them all but the met was always her favorite
the met is one of my favorite places in the world
i heard youve got an art exhibit coming up
skeptical you wanna come
was it that obvious
but only if youre ok with it
i dont want to impose and ill completely understand if you dont want some random girl there
caroline considers this
youre not random
youre tylers girlfriend
ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly
she seems a bit perplexed then grins
its okay with her
tyler wearing the suit we met him in its been dry cleaned
ally emerges from the bathroom looking gorgeous in a vintage black cocktail dress and carrying a pink wrap
lets just skip dinner and ill tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages
you just want to skip dinner
i got you a tie
she hands him a simple blue tie that matches his eyes
i was going to make a joke about how im not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope but i should
probably shut up and say thank you
tyler puts on his tie in the mirror
tyler and ally sip cocktails at the nicest table in the place
theres an empty seat
tylers eyes flicker towards the door
he touches his tie
have you ever been here
ally tries to lighten his mood
every tuesday with my pop
this goes right past tyler whose eyes flicker towards the door again
hes allowed to stand me up
but hes not allowed to stand you up
or my sister
tyler finishes his drink signals a waiter who glides to the table
ill have a whiskey
get me one too
like a stealth bomber
at least this moment rescued the men from actually having to greet each other
for the lady
im fine thank you
the waiter goes
this is alicia craig
ally my father charles roth
charles gives a courtly nod and takes her hand
an empty wine bottle
charles cuts into a one hundred dollar steak
youre going to be a social worker
but with an area of focused responsibility
its easier to find a job that way
what will your area be
when i was little i wanted to play first base for the mets
i dont think its any harder than that
the mets huh
arching an eyebrow im from rockaway
dads a yankee fan
it has something to do with the payroll
it has to do with significant ball playing
you were a yankees fan when you were little
you were lou piniella for halloween
blind familial allegiance
i didnt know what overpriced overfed fat bastards they were
serious as a heart attack whos fat
what yankee is fat
right back at him its a metaphor
charles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak
charles looks at his son
puts his fork down
silence at the table
back to the steak
charles looks up taken aback
tyler tries to get a word in
his mouth full of steak hes big boned
charles and ally burst out laughing
tyler rolls his eyes dessert
ally is working on an enormous profiterole
tyler another whiskey
how long has your dad been a cop
twenty two years
his cell phone lights up
charles gently puts his hand on hers
would you excuse me please
im so sorry
charles gets up from the table
tyler not able to help himself shoots him a glance
ally clocks it
its just a call
he held out til dessert
and your mother
she passed away when i was eleven
she was murdered
i was there
charles and tyler are stunned to silence
to tyler i never told you that part
why are you saying this now
i dont know
the men look at her
shes a hero
and here you are
here i am
there is an empty lean cuisine box and two empty beer cans on the counter
craig stands by the microwave as it counts down
he removes an eggplant parmigiana and slides it carefully on to a waiting plate
he takes it along with a fresh beer to the living room
he sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote unpausing erin tyler and ally wait in front of the restaurant as charles takes another call
a town car and driver wait as well
i think hes lovely
tyler puts his head in his hands
his face blank
dont say it
i have to go to the office
you have somewhere else to be dad
charles adjusts his tie
tyler loosens his
ally is unsure where to look
the exhibit runs til nine
you guys take the car
ill meet you
i dont believe you
thats all there is tyler
its not good enough
i dont have to justify anything to you
take the car
ill get a cab
ill meet you
he steps into the street to hail a cab
tyler watches his dad get into a taxi then holds the car door for ally
amateur artwork and picked over catering
the rest of the exhibitors are high school age even a college freshman or two
they mill with their friends and families
ally and aidan stand before a collection of familiar portraits charles reading the paper at breakfast les and diane kissing tyler on the park bench
caroline sits on a catering table tyler next to her
she looks miserable he looks furious
diane bustles over with a plate of cupcakes and a big stupid grin
i brought you every flavor
caroline looks once at her mom then
to tyler im ready to go home now
tyler nods takes her hand
les eating a cupcake and ally stand under a portrait of charles
ally picks up her purse
diane standing there with her cupcakes
tyler visibly agitated is letting ally in the front door to the apartment
he grabs his bike off the wall
where are you going
i have something ive got to do
ally reaches for his elbow
he yanks his arm away
are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour
do you need me here every minute or what
he slams out
ally looks like shes been slapped
charles in a meeting with several subordinates
everyone is in late night disarray
they are obviously on their way to pulling an all nighter
the door to the office flies open
tyler barges in
you cant just
its fine janine
there is space between the two men
tyler extends a rolled up piece of paper to his father
she drew you a picture
put it on the table
tyler holds on to the portrait
you have a daughter who sincerely believes you dont like her
if i have any questions about what my daughter may believe ill let you know
tyler gestures with the portrait dont you at least want to know her
shes telling you something dad
why arent you riveted
why isnt this the most important thing
at least for one night of your life
ive heard this song before tyler
we can come back
the subordinates rise
its fine khaleel
there is still distance between the two men
who is this display for
she knows i will take care of her
the subordinates rise again
we really can come back another
sit the fuck down
and that i love her
i love her
good god you toss that word around like currency
you have no idea what it means
maybe caroline doesnt either
where would she have learned it
i have provided her world
that does not mean youre allowed to shatter it whenever theres something better to do
who the hell do you think youre talking to
you pedaled down here on your bike for christs sake
you have to take care of nothing
you are responsible for no one
youre a kid
you think youre the first one to lose anything
do you think that there is anything you feel that i havent already felt
you didnt find him
i found him
and youre so tragically blind the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch
charles goes snarling for his son and tyler is more than willing
janine and one of the subordinates get between them
the men are pulled apart
tyler is white and trembling with rage
charles face is completely dark and closed
get out of here tyler
tyler runs for the door
stumbling over furniture carolines portrait crushed under his feet
ally still in her dress trying to excavate an ice tray frozen in the ancient freezer
theres got to be six inches of frost in there
she starts stabbing it with a wooden spoon
as she hears the door she turns and puts on her most blistering attitude like an overcoat
as tyler walks into the light his face white with anger practically crying her eyes widen
oh my god
she runs to him he falls into her
hes a mess
he wont let her see his face
she pushes at his hair trying to see and understand
he kisses her so she wont see
tyler is completely lost in the storm and alicia santana craig is going to get him through
she yanks his head up
she brings his hands up into her hair around her face
he kisses her like hes starved for her
tyler and ally wrapped around each other both deeply asleep
craig home from work
he hits the button on the answering machine
theres just one message

as he takes off his jacket craig hits rewind and plays the message again

diane beams at him
tyler smiles at his mom and les then at ally
diane takes a deep look at her son
her eyes shining

caroline travels through the living room with a popsicle
she is headed for her bedroom
a child could do berlin alexanderplatz you spaz
les snorts with laughter
diane rises dumping him to the floor
i want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides im ruining her life
on her way out diane pauses and gently pushes one of allys stray curls behind her ear
smiles down at her

ally stares up at diane for a beat her eyes shining
tanned and rejuvenated ally tyler and aidan sit together on the train back to the city
ally and tyler kiss
aidan watches them

tyler is laughing
ally thinks for a moment
aidan gives a satisfied smile
she works at the public library on th street
you slept with an eskimo

the car doors open and a man ushers his family through
its craigs partner leo in plain clothes

i dont believe you
while we were doing it i couldnt get this little like song out of my head
he begins to bob his head to a rhythm
inuit bum buh bum im banging an inuit bum buh bum buh bum
ally and tyler collapse in laughter as craigs partner passes he notices ally immediately
she doesnt see him
he takes a long look at tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the next car
the train makes a stop at patchogue
leo and family disembark
you wanna go to the library
the minute we get off this train
tyler are you coming
ill skip this particular bloodbath thank you
tyler his bag on his shoulder returning home fishing in his pocket for his keys
he sings the inuit song to himself
bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum
his front door is unlocked
takes a beat
scans the room silently dropping his bag
he reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door
wielding it he takes two steps into the apartment
craig in plain clothes sitting on tylers bed amidst the carnage of tylers stuff
he has been rifling through everything
the guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall
craig looks up
the men lock eyes
craigs eyes go to the bat
tyler leans it slowly against the wall
where is she
what are you doing in my house
craigs eyes flash
wheres my daughter
shes not here now
shes at the library
craigs face says it bullshit
does she know
cops never ask a question they dont know the answer to
i didnt think so
i figured youd probably leave that up to me when youre done with her
craigs face like his wifes so many years ago is pure contempt
with his body at this angle tyler can now see his gun
im not going anywhere
thats true tyler roth son of charles and diane
brother of caroline and michael deceased suicide by hanging
youre kinda lost arent you
taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class
im the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag
craig closes the distance
from tylers p
v he looks like a freight train
in a flash he gets tyler in a choke hold flips him on his back on the bed and puts his hands around tylers throat
silence except for exertion
tylers hands are on craigs wrists
he is holding craigs eye
his face is starting to turn colors
she needs you
it travels between the two men
craig grappling with it although he still has his hands at tylers throat
craig drops his hands pushes himself off tyler tyler rolls to one side coughing and gagging
craig leans against the wall for support
he is trying before our eyes to pull the shards of himself together
his gun visible at his waistband
tylers coughing his face still red his eyes travel briefly to the bat then to craig
craig closes his eyes very briefly then rises
not looking at tyler
looking at tyler
craig goes to the front door
get a fucking dead bolt
and then hes gone
the door bounces in its frame
and then its just tyler trying to remember how to breathe
tyler smoking standing at the window waiting for ally
he sees her walking up to the front door
he grinds his cigarette out
ally is running up the stairs tyler keats roth
she arrives at the door
he banged an inuit
shes really nice
i dont get it
whats going on
your dad was here
when i got home
i hate him
she lunges for the phone
tyler stops her hand
she looks like shes starting to panic
he knows me
before i met you
he arrested me and aidan
he gave me that gash over my eye
i dont understand
i mouthed off to him
then aidan saw you guys together at school
she isnt quite getting it
introduced myself to you
shes got it
im going to be sick
she bolts from the chair to the sink and dry heaves
tyler reaches out to comfort her
she reels around and cracks him across the face
not like a chick
like her dad
the sound hangs in the air
ally goes to the bedroom and starts throwing her stuff in her bag
tyler follows her
dont do that
what are you doing
do you realize what youve done
did you think i would never find out
i mean think about it
i had to find out eventually
you set it up that way
but it doesnt mean anything
i didnt mean to hurt you no
thats exactly what you meant to do
she pushes past him and out the door
ally heads down
aidan heads up
he smiles wide
ally pushes past him
tyler sitting on the ratty couch
aidan eats old chinese food from the container
he offers some to tyler
they sit in silence
you had to tell her eventually
this is no comfort
glass half full
you just saved yourself an awkward thanksgiving
shell be back t
tyler heads into his bedroom and shuts the door
sergeant craig working on a sink full of dirty dishes
he scrubs at a filthy pan with a piece of steel wool
hes manic but theres not a beer can in sight
you know youre not supposed to use that on non stick pans
craig turns finds her there in the doorway bag at her feet
it takes off the teflon
they stare at each other for a moment
you should let it soak
they look at each other
craig tries a smile
allys cool with him
moving towards him past him
im going upstairs
caroline and diane walk up to the doorman
caroline carries a gift a sleeping bag
diane smiles at her daughter
you look insane
diane cant help it try as she might
im sorry honey
like an end of the summer send off
caroline rolls her eyes
caroline goes into the lobby
diane heads back to her car
caroline gives her gift to the birthday girl who smiles
she follows her into the next room where the other party guests watch a movie
they all turn and look at caroline
caroline smiles sheepishly
some of the mean girls are there one of them gives her a perfunctory smile
jackie chans foot slamming through a wall
tyler and aidan are watching rush hour
aidan slurps from a super mega sized soda laughing enjoying himself
he turns to his friend
tyler sits completely drained looking like the loneliest guy on the planet
aidan gives him a nudge
tyler looks at the screen for a sec and half smiles then slips away again
aidan is genuinely concerned
the party girls mom is in a bathrobe
she looks horrified she has one hand covering her mouth and is whispering into a cell phone
caroline is on the kitchen phone
her long hair has been cut to pieces while she slept
she is crying
into the phone mom
ally and her father cook breakfast together
theres a knock
aidan paces nervously
craig appears in an apron
is this the uh that is does uh alicia craig
does she live here
you think i dont remember you
who is it dad
ally sees aidan
she touches her fathers forearm
craig steps back into the house
he backs into the hall
aidan and ally are alone
what do you want
look im a prick
craig popping back like an eel from a wreck
hes got the mangled honey bear
he goes again
aidans visibly relieved
she starts to close the door
this isnt really my thing
he lied to me
hes in love with you
hed like to think he is
aidan doesnt get it
i dont know what that means
ive seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you
shes a lot shorter and shares his dna
ally looks away
you dont have to forgive him today
just forgive him
craig reappears from the deep
thanks for stopping by
father and daughter go back into the house
diane is on the house phone preparing a tray of tea and cinnamon toast for caroline as she talks
are you telling me ms
spencer that you intend to let those girls stay in your school
of course theyre all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap
she slams a cabinet closed as les picks up the tray and we track him down the hall to carolines room
les is speaking on his cell phone
sotto into the phone shes pretty traumatized
i wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone
caroline and tyler are lying on carolines bed
her head is nestled on his shoulder
she looks even tinier than usual
tyler is reading to her softly from the book of greek myths his other hand stroking her butchered hair
she looks pale wasted
her eyes are sunken and shes fighting sleep
a losing battle shes exhausted
her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brothers voice
les at the door places the tray on carolines desk
on the phone theres no witnesses and it didnt happen on school property
the school wont do anything
theyll probably get away with it
tylers eyes registering anger and shock jump from the page as he hears this
diane opening the front door for aidan and ally
aidan wraps his arms around diane and gives her a hug
ally hangs back a bit unsure then embraces diane
tyler emerges from the hallway
to diane shes asleep
he sees aidan and ally
tyler alone on the top stair taking long pulls from a cigarette
ally comes out the front door softly closes it behind her
last one ever
i dont care
i know youre not here for me but thank you for being here
a silent moment passes
for what its worth i think youre amazing
its not worth much
you made everything between us a lie
im supposed to just forgive you
a bmw series speeds around the corner
stops in front of the house
charles gets out of the car sees his son
how is she
diane emerges from the house
charles strides quickly towards her
caroline asleep in her bed
charles stands in the doorway watching her sleep we get the feeling he hasnt seen her asleep in some time
diane appears at his side
how long do you think shell sleep
i think shell be out for a while
would you like to wait
ill call her later
ill tell her
diane looks at charles
hes still watching his daughter
carolines teacher prepares her lesson plan
she starts to write the date on the board when the door opens
caroline and tyler enter
the entire class is watching
its dead quiet
caroline puts her trembling hands in her pockets
tyler looks at a few of the girls
they look back unconcerned almost amused
tyler walks his sister to her desk
to caroline whispering you okay
caroline nods although her eyes are brimming
as she slips out of her jacket the contents of her pockets clatter noisily to the floor
tyler immediately bends to help her
have you done something different with your hair
i love it
caroline looks like a deer in headlights
tyler moves towards an empty desk
some girls keep snickering
suddenly tyler grabs the desk
throws it through the air
a janitor pushes a flat broom down the empty corridor when the glass from one of the classroom doors explodes as the desk makes impact
he stops pushing the broom and stares
pin drop silence
the students sit paralyzed
tyler stares at the mean girl
her arrogance completely gone
caroline stares up at her brother awestruck
tyler locked up among crack heads and petty crooks on a dirty bench with his hands behind his head and a bemused smirk
a bailiff approaches the holding cell
looks at tyler
charles standing in the waiting area
tyler is led out by the bailiff rubbing his wrists
he sees his father his face registering surprise
the men walk together towards the exit in silence
neither looking at the other
destruction of private property and felony trespassing
i didnt call you
i know you didnt
i have unleashed a raging shitstorm of epic proportions on the board of trustees of that pissant school that will not abate until those girls seek enrollment elsewhere
i give them a week
i know you think im a prick but i have my uses
can you come by the office to talk to the lawyers
charles appraises his son
try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime
charles walks ahead pulling out his cell phone
tyler calls after him
thank you for bailing me out
charles without turning around no problem
tyler leaning against the bike rack waiting
he sees ally running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the crowd
no mimes just dealers
ally with a girlfriend walking towards the east side
tyler catches up to her
shakes the friends hand
after a beat ally agrees to walk with him
he reaches for her hand
she pulls it away but walks next to him
tyler has convinced ally to come uptown and meet caroline with him
tyler and caroline climb all over the alice while ally watches from a bench
as befitting a seventh grader caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early september tanning possibilities
tyler walks over to allys bench sits next to her
using the little sister is dirty pool
carefully is it working
tyler has a smile the size of new york city
ally smiles back
bright sun pouring through the window
ally lying asleep
tyler is up and dressed now he grabs his journal off his desk kneels beside ally
he is bathed in the pool of light streaming in
ill be back in an hour
i have to stop by my dads office
sleepily do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast
whichever tastes better a la mode
say hi to your dad for me
tyler watches her lying there
if i said i love you
what would you say
laughing i love you
i love you too
tyler kisses her
then heads out into the
aidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he went out in the night before
tyler watches him sleep
without opening his eyes french toast
tyler smiles as he takes his journal and exits
charles waiting on the doorstep his town car waiting on the curb
diane answers the door expecting to find carolines driver shes confused to find
good morning diane
what are you doing here
tylers coming by the office but i thought id ride to school with caroline first
diane is speechless
this is a first
shes not ready though shes going to need at least twenty minutes
charles hates waiting
adjusting his tie all right
tyler chaining up his bike
his cellphone rings
he checks it
knows what its regarding before he answers
are you canceling all together or are you just running late
charles and caroline in the back seat
shes on one side with her pink back pack hes on the other
on the phone are you already on your way
tyler rounding a corner
im already here
im taking caroline to school
he looks at his daughter
she looks back at him then looks out the window
take your time
ill just wait in your office
it may be a while
tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the street
tyler riding in a handsome marble and oak elevator with a half dozen executive types
tyler steps on and presses the number
the doors close
tyler walks approaches the receptionist from the ashtray incident
he smiles pleasantly
cold she went for coffee
she getting me any
tyler heads down the hall
the receptionist rolls her eyes
tyler steps into his fathers empty office
its dark quiet
he opens the blinds
sunlight fills the room
tyler walks around the office
picking things up putting them back
tyler sits at his fathers desk in his executive chair
he leans back
puts his feet up and his hands behind his head
tyler notices the computer
he turns on the monitor and puts his hand on the mouse but doesnt move it
his hand just stops and stays perfectly still
tyler stares at the monitor where his dads screen saver is scrolling through photos
these photos are all of his family
michaels first christmas tylers eighth birthday diane in the hospital with caroline in a pink blanket charles and his kids build a sand castle at the shore
they just keep going
tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life
that line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off
charles town car rolls to a stop
caroline gives him a kiss on the cheek
it registers sort of
she gets out
charles watches her all the way into the school
his driver sees him watching caroline in the rear view mirror
charles gives the driver a look youre waiting for an invite
the driver peels out
ally has made a mess making french toast
aidan is yakking on his phone
charles in traffic
all around him drivers curse honk hate each other
charles rides not letting it bug him
caroline drawing at her desk as her teacher comes in and gets ready to start the day
tyler is still watching the screen saver when janine enters
good morning mister roth
did you know about this
janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of tyler and michael naked in the tub pop up
who do you think scanned all the pictures
janine smiles then a photo of michael comes up
those smiles fade
how old would he be
twenty nine last may
tyler stands and looks out one of the floor to ceiling windows separated by columns
he stares out at mid town and a perfect blue sky
janine looks befuddled
its really been that long
i couldve sworn it was
a silent moment passes
i should be able to remember that
tyler looks at her his face easy
carolines teacher writes the date on the board as caroline sits quietly doodling
the teacher looks her way
wide shot of the blackboard
its unmistakable were now looking at tyler from just outside charles office window and were pulling back
until we see tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily familiar grey metal siding
until we see can barely see tyler and the base of a giant white antenna
until we can no longer see tyler as hes disappeared into the composite of the building and weve pulled back far enough to reveal that tyler is standing in a
window on the
nd floor of the north tower of the world trade center
a moment of still perfect silence
the blue sky
then we hear the faint sound of aa flight s engines as it closes in on the north tower
we wait in it
whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because
charles roth steps out of his car
his gaze fixed skyward
all around him the other drivers mimic his behavior
its a good bet
diane sweeping cigarette butts off the stoop
nobody else will
diane joins a group of onlookers staring up from a street corner in brooklyn where the black smoke stains the blue sky
one of them has a radio to his ear
diane staring at it
someones been trying to tell me something
craig through a long lens standing by his car with the door open
he is crystal clear barking orders while waves of blue and slashes of orange float around him
maybe its you
aidan and ally absolutely frantic on the roof
craning to see
ash begins to float down on them
it gets caught in allys hair
her life even the nightmare parts seeped into me and i swear to god i can hear you better
a door flies open
caroline runs out into the empty hall to the exit
whats that about
ive always been the worst listener
the paper so much of it all of it singed smoke stained falling like snow flakes coating the streets and the sidewalks
amongst the memos and faxes that will now never be sent and never received we find
someone comes into your life
a light rain falls
two tombstones stand side by side
may may june september charles caroline diane and les approach the tombstones
a family mourning
diane slips her hand through charles elbow
the gesture seems quite natural easy
we find ally with a roommate putting up lively indian print curtains in their nyu dorm
caroline literally dragging charles into the rose building at lincoln center while he yells into his cell phone
and half of you says danger
stay in your cave
youre nowhere near ready
caroline has come to the end of her rope with her dad
she grabs his phone and throws it into the fountain spins on her heel and marches into the auditorium
charles is completely thunderstruck
and the other half and this is the part i think is you he is torn between his phone and his daughter for a sec chooses caroline and takes off
then comes running out by himself to rescue his phone
craig is wearing a jacket and tie
hes on a date with a pretty woman
in his confusion over the menu he knocks over a glass of water
says go get her
make her yours forever
a chaotic place filled with folk who need help
diane at a desk organizing families
im working on the forever part
aidan actually awake in class
he has a tattoo on his forearm
im going to have to step up my game
but im glad i listened
ally we find her as we first found her mother silhouetted against the lower manhattan skyline where two beams of purple light reach up forever where the towers once stood
i love you
her train pulls into the station
ally boards with a few other commuters
she takes a seat by herself across from
a mom and a toddler a little girl
the baby is squirming impossibly the mom looks exhausted
ally watches them remembers him as the faintest hint of a smile crosses her lips the subway lights flicker and we
dont be a stranger
