written by ring lardner jr
and terry southern based on a novel by richard jessup exterior scenes of st
louis particularly the riverside industrial district
even more important to establish than the place is the time end of summer
election posters would help with the republican ones stressing such themes as burst the roosevelt bubble save the american way of life vote for landon and knox
one of the most typical scenes of the day a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory
and the picketing is anything but peaceful the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike breakers
whatever the general action a small segment of struggle breaks off from it and it is this that our camera picks up some police chasing some pickets or some pickets
chasing some strike breakers the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent
a couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons
the fighting is bitter dirty and noisy
the eight men gathered here in a game of five card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside even though the sounds of it are very close coming through
window opening on the alley
in fact the noise is so loud that the dealer of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance
somebody shut the goddam window
let a man think
the player nearest the window shuts it
the dealer who also owns the restaurant is the talkative type of poker player
except for the cincinnati kid the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another gunmen labor spies extortionists what have you
the man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named danny and he and the kid have almost all the money on the table between them about a
hundred dollars in front of each
no other player has more than a few dollars left and now as fifth cards are dealt there is about forty dollars in the pot
only four men are left in the hand
possible straight gets a deals the card lovely little four
on the last hand even you couldnt give me a break
i put the brakes on your straight didnt i
he laughs no one else does he deals to the kid there you are son a gorgeous deuce
deals to danny and our lucky friend from chicago gets a queen with his pair of sixes
little lady make you happy buster
deal to yourself clown
dealer gives himself a deals card and groans i might have known
to danny bet your sixes buster
i told you not to call me that
then as the dealer turns away cost you counts out his money ninety four bucks
biggest pot of the whole game i got to drop
to first player interested
wouldnt call you if i had a pair highern sixes
which i aint
he turns over his cards leaving it up to the kid
dont seem like hed bet out without something better than the sixes does it
fingers hole card as if to fold cost me every cent ive won since yesterday afternoon
studies dannys face but i tell you i got this stubborn streak
call the ninety four dollars
he counts out the money which is almost all he has
indignantly you cant have better than a pair of kings
oh im not claiming anything that fine
turns over an eight making a pair of them just enough to beat the pair of sixes
you seen my hole card you bastard
indicating dealer he was dealing them high
attending to first things first the kid has been pulling in the pot adding it to his own stake and pocketing the total
now as danny accuses him again the kid looks him squarely in the face
you stole that dough
you better watch those loose lips of yours you want to have any teeth left behind them buster
he stands up
you wouldnt of shelled out ninety four bucks i called you on account of i didnt think you had another pair or another six and i know a punk like
you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand
he walks off disappearing through a door marked men
he is waiting when the door opens abruptly and danny appears his right hand in his coat pocket
the kids hand goes to his own pocket and as he whirls around a straight razor appears in it its blade snapped open
pushing danny to the wall with one hand he keeps him pinned there with the razor in the other while he bolts the door
danny gets his right hand out of the pocket with a gun in it but the kid moves the razor blade against his neck
as the gun clatters to the floor and the others force the door the kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum then swings at dannys middle with his
left dropping him then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window
danny recovers his balance and his gun unbolts the door just before it is smashed in and runs with the others to get out of the building and after the
the conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on
the kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards
a few moments later danny and four other poker players appear and run after him
the chase across the tracks goes on behind the credits
the kids pursuers split into two groups to cut him off and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing
down headed for the station
his dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train which with a burst of speed he manages to accomplish just in time
the passenger train divides the kid from his pursuers and we pan with the train into the depot
the train slowly stops
amid all the atmosphere of arrival in a day when the pullman car was still the ultimate in travel lancey hodges appears on a platform takes his bag from the
pullman porter and passes it on to a red cap before he has descended the steps
he walks with other passengers and red caps toward the center of the station
shooting through the meeting of the rivers fountain across market street to the romanesque building with its campanile
lancey getting into a taxi
lancey sits in serene repose in back watching the sights go by
the hackie steals a couple of looks at him in the rear vision mirror
what you looking for mister
do i have to be looking for something
i can pretty much tell
you can pretty much tell what
some guys come to town i can tell if theyre looking for something
what do you think im looking for
if youre looking for girls i can fix you up
i strongly doubt if you could fix me up
in that department
well what are you looking for
youre looking for a clout in the head if you dont keep your face to the road
a doorman takes lanceys suitcase as lancey pays the hackie and walks into the hotel
a second hackie whose cab is at the curb reacts to seeing lancey and steps forward
hey you know who that is
but the second hackie has followed lancey into the hotel
lancey crosses to the desk to register as the second hackie goes to a row of phone booths and enters one
he dials with his eyes on lancey registering
into phone shorty
want to hear who just checked into the park sherman
yes you do
he is talking on the phone while he hands out score sheets and shoes to some bowlers
he is just as excited by the report as the hackie is
the kid know
he is talking on the telephone behind the bar
somebody sure as hell ought to tell the kid
hangs up lancey hodges is in town
he reacts to the news in a big way
camera pans to another drinking man who is equally impressed
they exchange looks
kids been laying for him a long time
you ask me the kidll go after him as soon as he hears
whos got a better right
we are in the front room where the pool tables are
through an open door in b
we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment a poker game in progress
you going to tell the kid shooter
hell i cant not tell him
its where hes been headed for years
the kid enters the place through the front door still a little dishevelled from his escape
in greeting hey
what you say kid
where you been
boys been holding a chair for you in back
business opportunity come along
something too good to pass up
turn a profit
yeah did okay
except i almost had it took back
oh one of those
concerned you been in too many rough ones lately kid
you cant go on forever coming out in one piece
i got to build my stake arent enough chances in this town to let one go
youre too good thats your trouble
people who know youre the cincinnati kid they dont want to sit down with you for nickels and dimes
thing is ive about used up st
nodding the streets are getting full of guys youve hustled
been thinking about miami
theres nothing to keep me here
after a moment the hell there isnt as the kid looks at him lancey hodges in town
then the man himself here in st
louis i might just stick around shooter
lancey is on the phone sitting on the bed
into phone mr
how are you
and your enchanting wife
tomorrow is quite convenient
i generally prefer stud but you name it
your stakes are my pleasure sir
thank you why dont we make it after lunch
my diet these days is enough to spoil anyone elses appetite
a pleasure sir
please remember me to your charming wife
he hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him as if he had been through too long a sustained effort
his eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply
harold street leads to the river and we follow the kid and the shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk
lighting a cigar i been seeing it coming for a long time kid
i aint exactly been hiding it
no you aint been hiding it
well i got to know
sure you got to know
we all got to know
sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got
thats why i had to tell you
you ever sit down with him
yes i have
they walk along the shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully
well what happened
nothing at all
i didnt lose
im too good to lose when i set my mind to it
i play poker a certain way kid
ive had my lancey hodges
only with me it was whistling sam magee to new orleans
respectfully i heard about him
well then you know it all
about years ago it was maybe more
why i lost it
it dried me up on the inside for a long a very long time
i been where im going know what i mean
the kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river
along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile long hooverville that stretches up and down the mississippi
they walk out on the pier and eventually stop look out at the river watching the working boats
they have their thoughts the shooter smoking his cigar
you think im ready
after some time several seconds of thoughtful puffing kid i dont think youre ready
but youre not going to take my word for it are you
are you now
no i aint
i know i know
you got to find out for yourself
i dont figure to take him right away
but if i can hang in there long enough i can outlast him
if i can outlast him i got a chance
you admit that dont you that i got a chance
i already said i didnt think you were ready
did you think you were ready when you sat down with whistling sam magee
kid i thought i was the best stud poker player in the world
im telling you now i thought i was the best
well i dont think im just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards
i got something
no you aint no cocky square
and you probably got something
and i aint saying that you was either when you sat down with whistling sam magee
if you got the stuff being a little cocky dont hurt you none
well would you say if i got any chance at all
this much of a chance
if lancey is not right
if hes got a cold or his stomach ulcer is acting up or something like that
but then everybodyd see he wasnt right and it wouldnt prove nothing
listen we got to have it understood
if hes not right we call it off till he is
youre set on a real showdown arent you
your minds all made up
they start back off the pier
i got to
you said yourself i got to
yeah you been around a long time i was a lot younger than you when i went up against whistling sam but youd be kinda young too to be the
i gotta find out
after a pause want me to set it up
gratefully i wish you would shooter man
hey what if he turns me down
he wont the way ill spread the word
hell have to take you on someone in your class
if he ducked it thatd make you the man
you think he knows im around
he can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river
he knows youre around and hell sit down with you
you want to butt heads with the man ill set it up
ahead on the levee christian is seen waiting for the kid
she has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier
theres your woman
i wouldnt want to wait around too long
i want to get in and get it over with
he must of come to st
louis for a big money game
ill probably get asked do i want to deal it for them
and however long that takes hell have to rest up for you
oh well if hes tooling a dollar i can understand that
you got much of a stake
close to three grand
work on it
but three grand will give you a ride and even if you dont win why youll come away with a good idea of what youre made of
but once you go in kid you cant quit
you get that straight right now
two of you go in and only one of you can come out
christian sees them and moves toward them
well schools out
i damn sure dont want no lessons
i want everything hes got
its the only way to be kid
shooter turns away abruptly as christian arrives giving her a brief nod
the kid takes christians arm automatically he watches the shooter walk way down harold street
he and christian head in another direction
she is humming a mountain tune
when we leaving town kid
no i wont be ready
not for a while
i thought might even turn out we dont go
she is surprised by this and in her own hesitant way curious
you must feel different about it than you did saturday
he looks at her fondly and for one fleeting moment of weakness is actually tempted to tell her about lancey
but it is too sharp a break with tradition
yeah im feeling a little different
it is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window turning over the pages of
a mail order catalogue
the kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck
he opens his eyes and turns to look at her
the movement catches her eye and she instantly stops turning the pages afraid the noise has disturbed him
its all right
you dont have to act like a cat
youre not bothering me
you want me to turn out the light
im overtired thats why i cant sleep
sits up and swings his feet to the floor why cant you sleep
lightly undertired i guess
if a person rests all day she doesnt have much to rest up from at night
stands up why dont you have a nice hot bath
i could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath and then maybe you could sleep
she waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision
cant hurt to try it
she goes into the bathroom where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill
then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it
she stands in front of him waiting for him to move but the kid is singularly listless
not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow
she goes right to work on his shoulder muscles and she seems to know what she is doing
what did you do with yourself this time
last night i went to a movie with the shooters woman
they had the words in english at the bottom of the picture
but the shooters woman knew what they were saying without it
pigs woman or somebody told me she went to college
majored in man eating
i think maybe she really did go
but i never quite dared to up and ask her
i didnt know you ran with the shooters woman
we got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three day game down to cairo
course shes oldern me
and been around more
a lot more
what was the movie like
it wasnt a straight story where you knew whose side you were on the way you do in regular pictures
there were lots of things i didnt understand
what was it about
well theres this town in europe a long time ago where they get a message from a spanish general hes coming to spend the night with his troops
so all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them
nothing weird about that
but all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy
that dont make much sense
the way they handle it is they go to bed with the spaniards
and the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybodys happy
including the husbands and fathers
dont they suspect
thats part of what i wasnt sure of
i guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor
then they got their heads screwed on straight
honors just an idea
you cant see or feel it and you cant eat it and you sure as hell cant get any mileage on it
she slaps him on the rump and straightens up
ill just turn off the bath water
he doesnt move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes
christian humming softly turns off the water takes a large towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it will be more convenient for
she lingers to test the water with her finger and do anything else she can think of to assure maximum comfort for her man
then she steps back into the bedroom
the sight of him makes her advance cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep
melba the shooters woman is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to music turned up loud on a radio
the bedside phone rings barely audible above the radio
she answers it
into phone hello
yes it is
you want him
she gets no answer which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio
but the radio is across the room and its slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed shes on and go to the door of
the shooters room
she opens this and we see the shooter in bed in his own small quarters reading a magazine
he turns around inquiringly
phone for you
i always seem to be the one to answer it no matter who its for
getting up if youd rather we put it in my room are you kidding
the shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it he pantomimes to her that he wont be able to hear over the radio
she seems to regard the request as an imposition but she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little before she returns to her bed and
her cosmetic chore
into phone hello
what brings you to our fair city
little action maybe
lancey dressed for bed is on the phone
into phone how could you guess shooter
i was invited by a mr
william schlaegel into phone owns most of the schlaegel brewery
the shooter sits down on the edge of melbas bed the movement jostling her so she pricks herself with her tweezers
she exclaims in protest and gives him a dirty look that makes the shooter stand right up again
into phone as he put it rather bluntly i felt we dont want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they dont make any little
accidental errors by mistake
i told him a man couldnt ask for a better guarantee of a fair and square game than having the shooter deal it
so if youre willing were meeting at two oclock in the afternoon
ask for mr
schlaegels suite at the park sherman
im glad you can do it shooter
be a pleasure to see you again
then oh pretty much the same
just have to be a little careful about smoking and drinking and eating and breathing
see you tomorrow
he hangs up the phone settles himself in a comfortable chair and opens a heavy book
camera moves in close enough to reveal the title prescotts conquest of peru
it is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn to keep the daylight from disturbing the kid who is still asleep
christian dressed for the street moves from the bedroom to the kitchen living room which is the remainder of the two room apartment
finding paper and pencil she writes a quick note and leaves it on the kitchen table then starts out
featuring one bathing suit displayed among others in an end of season sale with some such advertising message as all bathing suits reduced for clearance
the particular suit is a two piece one exposing two or three inches of bare midriff the first modest forerunner of the trend that led eventually to the bikini
would you wear it in public
camera pulls back to include christian and melba looking at the display
wouldnt be much point wearing it in private
sure why not as long as you dont have a bulge to hide
they start walking
i dont know melba
looking her over my guess is there isnt anything about you needs hiding
but ill give you a more definitive opinion at the bath
startled at the what
after were through shopping
im treating you christian
i never been
im not even sure what you do
you dont do anything
thats whats so marvelous
they do it to you
camera finds christian and melba among the perspiring females
the third time i stayed
never went back to the boarding house except to pick up my things
and that side of its held up
no complaints in the bed department
well just one
the nights he isnt there
he really does that to you does he
you got one of the rare ones
christian and melba are on adjoining rubbing tables a curtain separating them from the waist down only
their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say
you find a guy you love him and thats it
its supposed to just go on like that for life
according to the propaganda right
but it isnt my life its his life with me tacked on
you have any idea what its like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant
no honey the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss
its hell if youll excuse the word
but i didnt want to quit
the kid made me
i felt i ought to hang on to something that was me away from him
you know what i mean
some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy
having children might take care of it i dont know
or this is really a terrible thing to admit
your most sordid secrets are safe with me
if he was rich or famous why dont you give him both
smiling why not
well if he was rich and famous maybe i wouldnt mind so much just being just a woman to him
do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow
are you sincere sweetie
reacting to the masseurs touch oooo divine
to christian isnt this heaven
im not sure
in a way it seems soft of she is at a loss for a word
christian looks blank
thats what i meant by heaven
lancey shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably padded chairs around a well appointed poker table
everything about the game is in sharp contrast to the one the kid played in
it is played with chips expensive ones there are a couple of bottles of wine on ice fine cigars a tray of sandwiches etc
lanceys opponents are all wealthy types two of them could be texas oil men
the youngest a good looking man of thirty is bill schlaegel
the shooter as nonplaying dealer distributes fifth cards to the four remaining players in the hand and both lancey and bill end up with four cards of one suit showing
as he deals still queens possible flush no help possible flush
queens check to the possibles
bill silently tosses in two of the rarest and highest ranking chips on the table
and up two
biggest pot yet
a phone rings and the third wealthy type answers it
call the two thou
turning over queen of his suit queen high
indignantly jack high
can you beat that
he just did
to second wealthy type its your office
dallas or tulsa
she just said office
the third wealthy type takes the phone and speaks on it during the ensuing
the second wealthy type crosses to the bar and fixes himself a drink
lancey takes in his winnings
bill hasnt recovered from the blow
there is a hiatus in the game
how the bloody hell did you figure out i didnt have the king or the ace
i recollect a young fellow putting the same question to eddie the dude
it was a game in the grand lounge of the j
white third the largest paddle wheeler ever built
son eddie told him all you paid was the looking price
lessons are extra
turns to shooter first time i heard of this cincinnati kid was in new orleans at yellers
i knew right away id have to play him someday
youll enjoy his game
i may admire it
but if hes all that good i doubt if ill enjoy it
the tougher the competition the better you used to like it
ive learned to take everything in moderation
it is early evening
the kid approaches the restaurant with christian on one arm melba on the other
to melba have a drink with us
shooter said theyd break at seven and he has to have his food first then his nap
looking the kid over you know theres a day in your life im looking forward to
in my life
the day the kid becomes the man
she smiles at them both and goes off
they move to enter the restaurant
the plates with the remains of their main course are in front of them
the kid pours whats left of a bottle of beer into his glass
howd you sleep kid
i slept okay
i hope you dont mind my not being there when you woke up
no i dont mind then what she was talking about shooters woman im going up against a big game soon
she told me
its a very big game i hear
will it be long
then whats the matter
i thought thought what
id go home and see mama
i wouldnt be able to spare you much change
oh i wouldnt want much
bus is really the best way to go
would a hundred fish do it
for the bus and something nice to bring your mama
that would be fine kid
when would you want to go
theres no reason for not going right now unless she lowers her eyes finding it hard to say the words
unless you wanted to go to bed first
do you want to
would you like it
id like it
you want dessert
shakes head coffee
i dont need it
neither do i
he looks o
raising a hand to summon the check
it is dark in the room and dark outside the street lamps furnishing only enough light for a faint border around the window shade
christians head and nude back move into the shot she pulls the shade aside to look out
the time is a few minutes before ten
she lets the shade fall back into place
moving quietly in the darkness she begins to dress
camera pulls back and pans to include the kid lying on the bed with a sheet over him
he seems to be asleep until he speaks
you still havent said it
if youre coming back
christian abandons the process of dressing herself and sits down in the easy chair to answer this question
maybe i ought to stay with mama and papa a while and see
whats to see
i never did like city streets
the promise didnt fulfill itself for me
come to the city and all
electric lights and flush toilets
all the pretty dreams it was all promise
oh i see
i dont know if you do or not kid youre city and im country you grew up with it
i dont think thats why youre going because you like it so much better in the country
she doesnt comment one way or the other nor does he press the point
what will you do
well ive got that big game
i heard hes the man for you
if i won there would be a lot of money
you been coming on strong a long way
this is your time
then after a long moment come home with me to mamas kid
finally im sorry
gently i know you are honey i know it
she gets up and begins to pack her clothes in an old suitcase
after a moment the kid gets out of bed
ill go down to the bus with you
you dont have to
starting to dress ill go down with you
after a pause kid yeah
this is going to sound kind of funny to you but i want to ask it
do you think theres any chance if you do win this big game that you might do something else besides cards
hastily i dont mean never play poker
i just mean not have it be the only thing you do
hell its the only thing i know how to do
what else is there for a guy never finished school
college graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs trained people engineers scientists
i realize not letting her speak when youre the man you dont have to hustle when youre the man the best the big money comes around on their knees just
beggin to hustle you
im not goin to quit
im goin to win
yes i can see that
of course i didnt say quit
well you see how it is
thats all right
after a moment christian you arent doing this to be off my back in case i lose
i been thinking about it a long time
i been planning to go home and see how i felt about things
and this just helped you decide
then dont go
firmly no this is your time now you go on honey and you play the man ill be at mamas
she closes the suitcase and puts on the one dress she hasnt packed
the kid dressed now watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt
he takes five clean twenty dollar bills and counts them on to the top of the dresser snapping the crisp leaves gambler style
then he stoops down again and takes out two more twenties adding them to the pile
i wish it could be more
thats all right
he doesnt actually hand her the money
he leaves it on top of the dresser and she goes over and takes it folding the bills and putting them in her change purse
the kid picks up her suitcase and she leads the way into the other room
at the front door she stops and looks back at the little apartment for a moment
i dont guess ill ever forget these rooms kid
i dont guess i will either
you going to move
if i win it wont be good enough
if i lose i lose it all
she looks at him for a moment then exits
the kid and christian sit in silence
she puts her hand on his
the kid and christian sit on a bench in the waiting room still silent
he has her suitcase between his legs and a pile of magazines on his lap
she looks at a clock and gets to her feet
he follows her to the door carrying the suitcase and magazines
christian boards a bus that has seen better days
on the steps she turns to take the bag from him but he follows her on
christian takes a seat
the kid puts her suitcase in the overhead rack and hands her the magazines none of which would be classed as heavy reading
they dont kiss
he turns and goes out
there are not many passengers boarding this bus
after a couple of moments the driver closes the door and starts off
christian waves from the window and the kid waves back to her
when the bus has gone he walks around the outside of the terminal to the front
there are a couple of cabs at a taxi stand
one of the hackies offers his services to the kid but the kid declines
he wants to walk
it is midday and the poker game is almost twenty four hours old
our attention is focused on bill schlaegel who is writing out a check
the shooter takes advantage of the lull in the proceedings to move to the telephone
thank you for the entertainment gentlemen
my particular gratitude to you lancey
its been a rare pleasure to watch a great artist at work
thank you for the privilege
lancey gives him a quick look finding this a bit thick
well now son youre quite welcome
cant say i recall another man in all my days on the three rivers who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money
bill puts his check down in front of the shooters place and gets to his feet
good day gentlemen
youre welcome to use the premises as long as you like
camera moves with bill as he passes the shooter who is waiting on the phone while the hotel operator dials his number
bill gives him a friendly pat on the back and speaks in a low harsh voice for the shooters ears alone
i want to see you
bill goes out
shooter looks after him as his party comes on the phone
into phone hi kid
listen i told the woman id take her to the ball park but im still working
how about you and christian take her out
into phone christians gone home to see her folks
into phone oh
then well listen would you mind taking her yourself
the gangll be there in the section
he hangs up returns to the table and starts to shuffle the cards in his own spectacular way
a game is in progress between the cardinals and another national league club
the batter at the plate connects for a long one
camera follows the flight of the ball
they are making their way to meet their friends in the section they prefer
they stop to watch the ball as the fans around them rise to their feet
the section they have just reached is in the sun overlooking the outfield
an outfielder races back and makes a difficult catch
they start on their way again
camera pans ahead of them to a group consisting of hoban hobans woman still sexy in her forties pig whose name could derive with equal justification from either his looks
or his manners and sokal who talks colloquial american with a central european accent
the group as a whole is notable because its members have not risen to their feet with everyone else because all the men are basking in the sun with their
shirts off because they view the action on the field with detachment and because nevertheless they are constantly placing bets on details of the game
now as people around them resume their seats sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught
to hoban you owe me two fish on the out plus three on the inning minus two on no strikeouts so far
the kid and melba join them
getting yourself in shape for the man
to melba shooter still on the job
in a whisper lay off that
whatd she do take off
so did mine
dont lose no sweat kid theres plenty more where they came from
all shapes and sizes
he and melba sit down
to sokal boyer
one to two on the sacrifice
five to three ill give you
two fifty against one fifty
i figure theyll walk him
fill up first
not with whos coming up
ill take the same odds
while he is talking melba unbuttons his shirt
get some of this sun
to the kid mark it
to melba guess i will
he takes his shirt off
melba finds some suntan lotion in her bag and applies it to her face and arms her eyes rarely straying from the kid
the bunt is fielded by the first baseman who throws to second for the out
there is no play at first
so they pitched to him
i still win
to kid everybody been on the phone to everybody about coming to watch you and lancey
big spriigi yeller to norleans old lady fingers
theyre all coming
to kid let me give you some of this
keep you from burning
i dont think cant hurt you
without waiting for his approval she goes ahead and spreads the lotion on his skin painstakingly as if she were applying paint to canvas working it in one area at
a time with her fingertips
to sokal chance to invest your profits
bet you an even fin he make first
looking toward plate who we got warwick
you got yourself a bet pal
the men concentrate their attention on the diamond
camera moves in to melbas fingers playing across the kids midriff
from the field comes the sharp crack of a bat against a ball followed by a shout from the crowd
camera pans up to the faces of melba and the kid as he looks at her and she meets his gaze with inviting eyes
not your day hoban
calling to a vendor hey beer
softly mais tu es charmant with the same look of invitation in her eyes
come here please
camera pulls back
wearing the same clothes as at the ball park she is sitting in a chair with her legs tucked under her
the kid is sitting on a straight chair at a table on which he has a cup of coffee
they are alone in the apartment
any special reason
he stands up but doesnt move toward her
sure you are
youre the shooters woman
and maybe ill go on being the shooters woman even after you and i have had our little romp
what do you think about that
first place old shooterll come barging through that door any minute
he said they were winding it up
he doesnt have his key with him
stands up have to buzz from downstairs
moves toward him provocatively so we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come
the kid stays where he is as she comes up against him
also it dont mean anything to you youre christians friend
honey she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus
you know that
her arms around him i have a shaky sense of security kid
dont make me feel unwanted
he kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while then pulls away
you know damn well how good it was
wheres a pack of cards
what do we need cards for
gin or casino you name it
all i know is were switching to another indoor sport
the poker game is over
two of the wealthy types have already departed one is finishing a drink on the way out another is putting his winnings into his wallet a third is writing out
lancey and the shooter still sit at the table in f
lady fingersll want to come i bet and shes right on the edge of her stake
she could spell me dealing
havent seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years
well thats it then
monday night room three eleven at the dorset hotel
and may the best man win
yes thats how it usually comes out in the long run
you think this boy is going to give me trouble shooter
yeah hes going to give you trouble
i dont want it to be one of those marathon games
not any more
like the session with the portugee at jollys in omaha
longest game i ever played though i was a kid on my way to the klondike gold rush
at soapy smiths in skagway
four nights and three days
depends how you look at it
when we wound up the yukon river had frozen over and you couldnt get through to dawson city till the following june
made myself a hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush
you been around a long time
that is undeniably true
but it doesnt mean im ready to retire
how old is this boy of yours
twenty six twenty eight something like that
well now makes me feel a whole lot better knowing that
i was thirty six when i sliced up eddie the dude
this kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years
he is standing by an elevator in f
keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game
felix is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet deferential manner
when he sees a door open he moves so as to be out of the shooters sight as the latter comes toward him
it isnt until the shooter rounds the corner in f
and presses the button for the elevator that felix makes his presence known
excuse me mr
shooter sir but mr
schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you
the doors of the elevator open
felix yields precedence to the shooter and they enter it
the doors close
an elevator opens and the shooter and felix come out
i ought to call my woman
yes of course
they always like to know it if youre going to be late for supper
camera moves with them as the shooter leads the way to a row of telephone booths and enters one
they are sitting at the table in a game of casino
she plays an ace from her hand adds a seven from the board and lays them both on top of a three card pile
still building eights
thanks for putting it together for me
he plays an eight and takes in the whole pile
its not my game
the telephone rings
she stands up
want to know what is
camera follows her to the phone
she picks it up
into phone hello oh hi sugar why not
she reaches a hand around to the back of her neck fiddles with her dress a moment then beckons in the kids direction
he doesnt understand what she wants but he gets up and comes to her obligingly camera moving with him
into phone whats the switch
she points to the hook and eye fastener at the top of the zipper that runs down the back of her dress
the kid pantomimes the question what for
but she just wiggles her finger impatiently at the fastener while speaking into the phone
into phone whose idea was that
the kid still doesnt know what she has in mind but it seems easier to humor her than not
he unfastens the hook
melba smiles her thanks and to his consternation reaches back and pulls the zipper all the way down
she places her hand over the mouth piece of the phone
to kid hes not coming home now
she steps out of the dress
into phone whatever you say shooter man
into phone explain to the kid will you
melba in her bra and panties snuggles against the kid
into phone hell understand
into phone tell him they decided to play a little longer and ill call him at his place later when the games over
he hangs up the phone and emerges from the booth
camera moves with him as he joins felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance
the kid his policy toward this new situation still unresolved holds her lightly while he tries to think it out aloud
listen melba i have to tell you first
youre sitting down with lancey next monday night
i wish it was sooner
i wish it was tomorrow
shooterll give you all the details later
i dont like waiting that long
lets not kick a gift horse in the teeth sugar
weve got this time together
lets try to fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run
she invites a kiss and he obliges her
but there is a contrary force at work inside him
listen what i was going to say before i dont want you to think im being some kind of jerk or i dont feel youd be great to sack up
then lets cut the filibuster
ive made dolls that were friends of mines wives
i figured if they were willing they were doing it to their husbands i wasnt
any other attitude youre degrading the woman
youre not treating her as a person with a mind of her own but as somebodys property
again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment
only thing is its different with the shooter than anybody else
hes so straight i got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people
so do you
on account of we both owe him plenty
i thought we just agreed that what you and i did was strictly between us
decisively pulling away from her with a pat of dismissal shooters the closest thing to family i got
its almost like he was my old man
dont you see how thats got a bearing on us
he starts out
melba stares after him scarcely able to believe what is being done to her
sure it means im your mother
an expensive automobile with felix at the wheel and the shooter next to him in the front seat approaches the main house of a lavish estate in a st
it continues along the driveway past the house
in swimming trunks bill is spoon feeding a year old baby in a highchair
he waves in greeting to the shooter
he walks from the parked car toward the pool returning bills salutation
shooting from behind the shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes besides bill and the baby a five year old girl who is having her hair brushed
after swimming by rosanna schlaegel her beautiful mother
a family dog completes the picture
bill continues to feed the baby as he hails the shooter
shooter very generous of you to come on such short notice
rosanna you know and i think youve met my daughter june
indicating baby no point introducing you to william the fourth
he has a bad memory for names
greeting them in turn mrs
how are you june
whats it all about bill
little something id like to sound you out on
but the least i can do is offer you a drink
like me to fix it love
why dont you do a batch of your bloody marys
if thats okay with you shooter
as she goes off rosanna cautions june about her hair
just dont let it get wet again
as soon as his wife is gone bill goes right to the topic he doesnt want to discuss in her presence
ive been quite busy on the telephone since i last saw you
theres a lot of interest all over the country in this game with lancey and the kid
jack doyle in new york is giving twelve to five on lancey
same odds in reno
ive taken fifty thousand of it so far
ill probably go for more but i didnt want to rock the odds
i knew you liked the kids style but why you going in so deep
first i want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me
second as long as thats going to happen i dont see why i shouldnt make some money out of it
but how can you be so sure
the kid could do it we both know that but could isnt good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as i do
hes going to need help from the best man with a pack of cards between omaha and new orleans
not a chance bill
you ought to know i never ever use what i got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game
sure i know it
thats why youre the man they choose to give them a square deal
thats what makes it so perfect
nobodyll be looking for it
the great thing is theyll be so close the kid wont need much
three or four key hands
understand this bill
id like for the kid to win and i sure as hell dont want to see you lose all that money if i did id have to collect that twelve
grand you owe me
my collection agents
you knew poor wildwood jones didnt you
ok but im paying it off
its comin in aint it
six grand already
then as bill just looks at him bill you got to listen to me
no i dont
its quite the other way around
you have some delusion youre a free agent but youre not
i own you
for gods sake
ill cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash
and you can tell the kid if he needs more of a stake ill put it up
and smiles marvelous
heres rosanna with what you need
camera moves to include rosanna carrying a tray with glasses and a pitcher full of bloody marys
for that dry feeling on the roof of your mouth
it is raining dismally
he is lying on one half of the bed with the covers thrown back his hands clasped behind his head wearing pajama bottoms
he turns his head and stares at the white expanse of unoccupied bed
the weather is clear as the kid wanders idly along a residential street of well kept nineteenth century buildings
he is drinking a bottle of beer slowly
camera pans to another bar stool where a customer is having his shoes shined by a negro boy who slaps his rag against the shoes with a fine sense of
finished he collects his dime and nickel tip and moves to the kid
shine them up for you sir
fetch you a newspaper maybe
how about a singy song then
i play good
the boy takes out a tobacco can with the lid torn off and the top flattened down and shakes it producing a sound like the rustle of dry leaves
then he produces a similar can that makes a rattling noise when he shakes it
dry corn in this one
blue shale stone from the river in this one
yes im ready
the boy looks at the bartender who has moved closer to see whats going on
to bartender you ready
hell im ready for anything
the boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds then begins to shake the can with corn in it
after a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can
at the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure delicate voice
it is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes christian likes to hum
when the song is over thank you very much
that was nice
where did you learn to do that
i picked it up from herman
who is herman
my friend i pick it up from
is he a good friend
i dont know bout that suh
he just a frien who teach me some things
well i dont want a shine but heres fifteen cents
thank you sir
and heres another dime for you fella
he rings up a no sale and flips a dime to the boy who is astonished and then worried by this munificence
suddenly he grabs his tobacco cans and his shoe shine kit and runs out into the street
nice little colored kid
mostly to himself yeah
jansen a masseur is at work loosening up the kids neck and shoulders
monday night uh kid
i sprung for some of the action
a yard and a half of that five to two
in pain hey
we got to get you loosened up
i never felt you this tight
he is in the middle of a call
into phone just tell the shooter ill be there on the dot monday night
over the phone and until then
he doesnt have to know
into phone im not asking for him
he hangs up the phone rather than continue the discussion
camera follows him as he comes out of the booth picks up a small duffel bag and walks to the door that leads to the busses
he goes out into the night and gets into a bus
a bus drives along a main road in the ozarks heading toward camera
as it comes close the name of its destination fayetteville can be read
the bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings around an intersection
the kid is the only passenger to get off here
as the bus continues on its way he goes to an attendant in a gas station on one corner and asks a question
referred to a general store and post office on another corner he crosses and goes into it
the storekeeper comes back outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to go
it is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the store
the kid starts up the road
the kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the crossroads and looks down into the valley between this hill and the next one
he starts down an even narrower road leading to a little farm on a hillock in the valley
it consists of a modest cabin a single barn a fenced cow pasture and a few cultivated fields
christian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house carrying two five gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder
a little dog yaps and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate
she looks in that direction and camera moves to include the kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her
after a moments hesitation she moves to meet him gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out
can i help you with those
taking if off is harder than taking it on in
she turns toward the side of the house and walks to the kitchen door
the kid follows
hows the shooter
you havent played yet
craigie christians mother opens the door for them giving the kid a sharp appraising glance
this is eric mama
hes come to see me
how do eric
christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back
craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board
she and christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump
we lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning
the kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it and the table alongside with a half dozen hampers of green beans
and sour ham and bread in the warmer if youre hungry eric
as soon as they are finished with the pump mrs
craigie and christian turn to the table where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove
you know anything about canning you know we cant stop now
if wed been looking for company we never would have started
spring beans you have to cook them fast
but you find yourself some breakfast
im all right
bus stopped for doughnuts and coffee
you can stay with us tonight and still make it back to st
lou on the sunday schedule by about midnight
i told mama and papa about the man
where is mr
to the barn
why dont you go down and introduce yourself
christian and mell be at this another hour or two
i think i will
i think id like that
to christian okay
and ill see you a little later on
then as he starts out papa dont know everything
about you and me
the kid looks quickly at her and then at mrs
craigie who keeps her gaze fixed on the beans
he is pitching manure from all over the cow lot into a pile banked against the side of the barn working a long handled shovel with practised ease
he looks o
and sees the kid approaching but continues his work as the kid enters the shot
nor does he stop shoveling while they are talking except at moments of particular significance to him
how do you do mr
im eric stoner
you seen her
shes helping her mother can
you minding to marry christian
the kid looks at him a long moment then you got any objections if i do or if i dont
craigie takes a couple of steps toward the kid his boots sucking in the muddy ground
son thats what i call a sharp answer
it was what i call a sharp question
we dont know much about you christians mother and me
im whats known as a three river man
which just means i go around playing stud poker wherever i can find the kind of action im looking for
you met christian when she was working to hot springs
i was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop
we went out
i told her i thought she could get a better job in st
now how did you happen to tell her that
maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side
i said it because i wanted her in st
anyway she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since
the kid takes his time before deciding how to answer this one
yeah living together
how come she come home now
she going to have a baby
not that i know of
you two have a fight
she must have had a reason
well youve known her longer than me
then look mr
craigie let me and christian find out a few things then maybe i wont have to answer your questions
i never run across anybody like you
i guess i dont understand gamblers
thats all right
i dont understand farmers
you say things that sound smart alecky
but im not sure if they really are smart alecky
well i cant take into account what somebodys going to feel every time i say something
are you a believer
in some things
i mean in god
thats a tough one
i dont disbelieve in him but i couldnt say i believed in him either
i guess i just never paid him much mind
didnt seem important
god not important
i dont mean what he does isnt important if he exists
i mean its not important to me whether he exists or not
christian was raised in a christian home
is that so
i didnt know then im not aware of the difference
pause im not asking permission to marry christian you know
if i was the only person id be asking it from is her
after a moment who is this fella christian says youre going to play thats so important
hes the king of the stud poker players
and youre going to play him
are you any good
im this good
the man has got to play me
what happens if he dont
then im the man
that important to you
i been trying to figure that out ever since i set it up
you playing because of money
after a moment not really
christian said you never was much worried about money i been worried about money most of my life up until i figured out it wasnt so important
no its necessary but it isnt so important
well how come you want to play this king fella
ambition maybe security like that
is it aspiration to be the king or just uncertainty about the future
i aint looking for security if thats what you mean
not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down
that would figure into it
but that isnt all of it
its important to me
now son which is more important to you this king business or christian
if you got the guts to ask that question mr
craigie i guess i got the guts to answer it
christian if you came right down to it is not as important as doing what i have to do
craigie has finished piling the manure
he puts away his shovel
well son i had to know
there never was a man worth a damn to my mind who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do
then i got to go now see what i can do for a sick heifer
why dont you take christian when her mama lets go of her and tell her i said you should go to the old spring
its a good place
ill tell her
craigie walks away
it is a small shack against a rocky bluff
camera pans christian and the kid as they come down the path and enter
it stays warm all winter
camera moves to reveal christian and the kid who are in the pool without clothes treading water
papas mama used to bring her wash up here
we liable to draw an audience
its on our land nobody uses it
she starts to swim camera moving with her upper back as she reaches the side of the pool and pulls herself on to the bank lying on her stomach
the kid joins her first drawing himself up on his stomach alongside her then turning on his back to look through the slats at the sun
you must have said something to papa gave him the picture on us in st
else he never would have spoke to you about this place
i told him on account of he already knew
never any sense feeding a man a lie hes not going to believe
even if he did know im glad you told him
she raises herself up so that she is directly above him
in mock protest hey youre all wet
so are you foolish
the two men are sitting just outside the kitchen where mrs
craigie and christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier
the paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the mens heads
the light comes from a kerosene lamp inside
let me get this straight in my head
cards is all a matter of luck who gets dealt the best ones
the kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket
during the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double thick cards
one of these has two faces another two backs and the third a back and a face
so when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your what do you call them customers clients
the technical term is suckers
their chance of winning is just as good as yours except if you got a way to control it who gets what cards
thats cheating and its not any part of what were talking about
then how do you win
ill show you
he displays his three cards
you see one of these cards is white on both sides one is red on both sides and the other is white on one side red on the other
what about it
the kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall
i put the three cards in a hat and shake them up and then i ask you to draw one card out blind
put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side
craigie does as instructed
the ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top if its white the words red and white will be reversed in the dialogue
okay red on top
that eliminates the all white card right
so the card youve picked is one of two the all red or the red and white
one out of two is an even chance an even money proposition
right you follow me
i think so
so if i said ill bet you a dollar to seventy five cents the other side of that card is red youd take the bet wouldnt you
and that answer makes you a sucker
because the odds are two to one the other side of that card is red and i ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy
but if there are just the two possibilities
there are three possibilities
indicating card on table that can be the red side of the red and white card or it can be either side of the all red card
in two cases out of three the other side is red
and id win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it
dubiously you would
its obvious when i explain it isnt it
except if theres only two things that the bottom side can be red or white take my word for it the odds are two to one
and knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker
not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are
in a poker game there can be a million different situations each with a different set of odds to figure
the man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much
the sucker is still took advantage of isnt he
the gambler knows something he dont know
sure like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guys
or two business men are in competition or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom
whatever your line is the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better
seems like there should be something else to it there is making the man youre playing against think hes got the best hand and making him pay to find out
he is lying on a cot in the darkness next to the big wood burning stove
christian enters the shot and slips under the covers with him
i cant stay long
papall be getting up to milk
im the one cant stay
i got to head for that bus
why did you come kid
well hell i dont know
i had kind of a rough time after you left
tuesday there was a ball game but then the cardinals went on the road
i never known time to drag so i was all torn apart because of the poker game coming up
thats how i read it but i was reading it wrong
it wasnt lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides what else is there could give you such a bad time
i finally figured it
i located where the trouble was
it was you
she is genuinely surprised at this and at first a bit dismayed
but her more considered reaction is one of pleasure
oh she kisses him
when you talk about doing something besides poker if i get to be the man you dont mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a
i sure dont
i told papa wherever money comes from it feels the same when you spend it
you were going to do some thinking down here
i done some
then they both react as craigie can be heard getting up
ill be back after the game christian you wait here for me and ill let you know
all right eric good luck monday
she gives him a quick kiss and stands up
i got that made now
you said it right
my times come
the sun hasnt risen yet as the kid boards the bus for st
louis outside the general store
the kids bus crossing the endless plain in the afternoon sun
the clock above the loading platform says it is a little after two in the morning as the bus pulls up and the kid groggy from the long ride gets
he enters wearily goes straight into the bedroom and collapses on the bed
after a moment he summons the energy to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off
but that completes his preparations for sleep
the shooter is awake because he cant sleep and melba is awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she considers prudent
he sighs deeply as she solicitously pours him a cup of coffee
twenty five years i been building a reputation
handle this thing right and your reputation will be better than ever
lancey is also awake confronting a row of medicine bottles
he finishes laying out an assortment of four different pills and capsules pours himself a glass of hot milk from a carafe and proceeds to take the pills one at
a time with a sip of milk after each
the kid looking completely refreshed is readying himself for the game
he has chosen casual comfortable clothes and now he collects three items to take with him a large bottle of mouthwash a green sun vizor and finally his stake
when he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer we can see the pile has increased in size
the kid finds an envelope to put it in and he is ready to go
he starts out but in the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch
it is too early
he crosses to the stove pours himself a cup of coffee and sits down to drink it
lancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game and this time he goes for the old fashioned velvet smoking jacket and silk foulard
over this he puts on a light overcoat
then he assembles medicines toilet articles and money putting them all into a small satchel
finally he puts on his hat and goes to the door
we follow lanceys progress as far as the elevator
melba and shooter have finished dressing and he waits by the door while she does the inevitable last minute things to her makeup
i made up my mind to this
i aint going to give him any help till he needs it
im glad youre taking a stand
hey what if he starts off lucky and stays ahead of the game the whole way
it could happen you know
youll make it happen baby
ive got faith in you the hands are at
the kid is looking at the clock tower
once more around the square
the taxi drives away from camera following the kids instruction
camera pans to the front of the dorset hotel which they have just passed
it is fifty years old or more no longer elegant but still respectable
he is standing at ease among old friends sipping a creme de menthe frappe
its a friendly town st
ive always said that
camera moves to take in the people around him one after another
the shooter is there and pig and sokal and hoban and melba and hobans woman and a couple of other women whose main attributes are physical and bill schlaegel
out of town representatives include lady fingers who is about fifty down on her luck but still cheerful and remarkably energetic and yeller a light skinned negro who has achieved
stature in what is mainly a white mans world through diplomacy and a quick wit
the room is the large living room of a once splendid suite there are enough chairs and couches around the walls to accommodate a good many spectators while the middle
of the room has been cleared for a round table with seven chairs
we aint seen much of you though last seven eight years
in my declining years i spend more and more time in florida and the gulf coast
lot of folks been figuring another reason you was keeping clear of the three rivers
what reason is that lady fingers
laughs that the way it is lancey
you been scared of the kid
should i be scared of him
damn right you should
im telling you that boy going to make your stomach ulcer bleed before the night is out
hes close to murder
i seen him give a fella the shakes so bad on a fourth card it took a pint of corn liquor to settle him down
thanks for the warning
lancey notices that most of the people around him have turned to look at the doorway
he glances in the same direction in a casual sort of way
he saunters toward lancey
almost everyone greets him and he responds to as many as he can
melba intercepts him
mow the man down sugar pie make it quick and bloody
been too many lean years for all of us
i intend to take shooter right along with lancey
im not talking about the old shooter
hes been factory rebuilt
a new spirit dwelleth in him and his gaze is on distant hills
the kid would like these cryptic words explained but lady fingers descends on him
so you showed up after all
youre a braver boy than i thought so much the worse for you
you think ill be sorry i come
that lancey aint human hes one of them barracuda fish
hes liable to bleed to death right on a flush hand before he give up to you
i seen him gut a fella so bad the fella quit and got up and spit red in the john and went square
the kid sees lancey approaching and turns to him
pleasure to know you
i been looking forward a long time
you seem to know about everybody
yeller from new orleans
what do you say yeller
still feeling salty with me
forgiven long since
to lancey we had a little jurisdictional dispute
i hustled a couple of boys right in his territory
so i tried to tell him our rules down there
colored marks are for colored hustlers
and i tried to tell him how i got no prejudice
when im on the edge of my stake i hustle anybody at all regardless of race creed or color
anybody at all
including my girl
hell i figured i was doin you a favor
suddenly they both laugh over a private memory and shake hands obviously old friends
to lancey did you know old cottonhead died
no i hadnt heard
heart give out in a high low game
turning to the kid how you feel kid
you think maybe we ought to see if we can stir up some action
whatever you say lancey
youre the correcting himself youre our guest in this town
well im kind of in the mood to play a little cards
i think we ought to be able to get a game together in this crowd
but first you take a look at things make sure everythings the way you want it
i already been around
ill do that
he turns toward the center of the room
the shooter follows him
the old solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket
the cloth is tied down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat tight and cushioned by the blanket
the kid presses his fingers into it to test these factors
its an old table
everythings pretty old in this hotel
its solid thats what counts
and you got the top fixed perfect
lancey comes into the shot behind them
light all right for you
two hundred watt bulb
okay with you
shooters set us up just great
thank you gents
tried to do the best i could
looks from one to the other cards
good a time as any
to kid and lancey you both know joe hoban
hes a draw poker man but clean and straight as they come
hoban comes into the shot with a dispatch case which he sets on the table
he unlocks it with a key and turns it upside down
thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table
they come from the st
louis bridge club but theyre poker size cards
they been bonded by the club steward and i seen him take them out of the safe
shooter lady fingers and me pick them up and come straight here with them
hobans selling them to us at five dollars a pack with the usual guarantee
if its proved any deck is spooked he pays off the losers
louis bridge club eh
steward still that old yard bird okra
disturbed thats him
not noticing to kid old stud man okra
i dont know him
quite a character
quite a character
anxiously nobody heard from me what the cards were for kid
there is a quick exchange of glances all around as the other three realize what the imaginary suspicion is behind hobans defensive reaction
to kid been ten years since i seen or spoke to old okra
dont worry about it lancey
whos sitting down with us shooter
four of us
me pig yeller and doc sokal
if thats all right with you both
to kid shall we have a look at the decks
with the pile of decks and the empty dispatch case on the table in front of them
they start checking the decks one by one each putting the ones he has covered in a pile for the others consideration
they examine the seals and the cellophane visually and they also sniff both ends for the odor of a hot iron
by the time they are through with this process the kid has found three decks he isnt satisfied with and lancy two
the kid passes his three rejects to lancey who tosses them back into the dispatch case without looking at them
then lancey tries to submit his two to the kid but the kid waves them away and lancey throws them too into the case
well kid whats your game
camera pulls back to include the other four players who have come up to the table still not taking chairs until lancey and the kid have chosen theirs
though lanceys question is purely ritualistic they look to the kid for his reply
i dont mind stud poker if thats okay with you
i got no objections to stud
to the others gentlemen
consulting the others is a formality but all four of them yeller shooter pig and sokal nod or grunt or otherwise indicate assent
across the room he is indicating to the shooter that hed like a word with him before play begins
he detaches himself from the group and sidles inconspicuously over to bill
tell the kid i have a suite on the fifth floor
he can drop up during the breaks
bedroom all for him any time he wants a nap
thats thoughtful of you bill
im a thoughtful man
i hope you are
the kid gestures to lancey to choose his seat
lancey acknowledges the courtesy glances at the window and picks himself a chair facing away from it
privilege of age
cant take the glare of the morning sun in my eyes
the kid following protocol moves to a seat directly across from lanceys
the shooter takes his place at the table halfway between the kid and lancey and pulls the twenty five eligible packs of cards to him
you want to have the usual brandy and coffee on hand kid
anything special for you lancey
why yes shooter
creme de menthe frappe
glances around you got that hoban
to the table gentlemen if there are no objections im the dealer
these rooms have been contracted for and there will be an ante of ten dollars per chair per day
during the breaks for me old lady fingers has agreed to deal but she dont care to be a player do too care
camera pans to reveal lady fingers as she steps from among the spectators to a place behind lancey
cant afford to play thats the real truth
had a bad year and im way over my edge
lady fingers will get three dollars an hour from the ante plus her room and food and a five minute break every hour
fine shooter man
kay with us
if you dont see me when you need me call room three oh eight
taps lanceys shoulder you know who else aint with us no more
miriam widow used to run the kitchen game to south chi
lost two months relief at blackjack coal dealer cut her credit and she froze in her bed
the kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting it out rapidly
the other players watch interested to see how much he is putting out
after counting out one stack of thirty hundreds he distributes the rest in stacks of twenties tens and fives folding each bill over once as protection against picking up more
than one at a time
gentlemen this is a game of five card stud poker
there is no limit
a dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game
the kid has completed his count
he takes the money from his satchel
nice tidy sum
ill put out the same
camera pans to yeller
i swear i dont know what im doing sitting down with you titans but maybe its worth putting up five thousand for the educational value
camera pans to pig as he brings out a roll and drops it casually in front of him
ill play with what i have in my pocket till i have to send out for more
twenty seven twenty eight hundred i dont know
camera pans past the kid to sokal who is counting out bills from an impressive roll
five gs im with it
dont mean im goin blow it all though
camera pans to the shooter who is counting out a smaller stake than anyone
last and certainly least he puts his money out without counting it takes a deck of cards rips the cellophane off it takes the jokers and tosses them offhandedly to
one side not seeming to take aim
heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison landing inside the shooters familiar hat which is resting crown down on the mantelpiece
the spectators gape at the display of dexterity
he begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him not from suspicion but from pure admiration
he is in peak form shuffling six times once for each player and then slapping the cards down before lancey who is to the right of him with an empty
chair in between
he waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod
the shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort of gesture
then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the players money and in
clear view of everyone at the table
with sokal in b
it is notable that as the shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands
he calls the cards as he deals them
seven nine trey nine ace and the shooter guns up a ten
call the sawbuck
he looks at his hole card an ace
the shooter deals again
king to the seven pair of nines deuce to the trey queen nine ace eight
nines bet twenty bucks
each other player folds in turn
the shooter pulls in the cards and the kid pulls in the seventy dollars
the shooter shuffles and deals again
queen ten king four ace again and a king for the shooter
ace bets ten dollars king over
they are perched on the back of a love seat at the far end of the room with their feet on the arms
this gives them a view of the table through a pair of opera glasses they share but they are far enough from it to be able to discuss the hands
shooter wont stay on a king or an ace if theres another one showing
whats he have to have in the hole
ten or better
with no other ten showing
the second round has been dealt
sokal has a queen eight the kid a pair of tens pig a king seven lancey an ace five
yeller like the shooter has folded on the first card
the kid makes the same bet of twenty dollars and the other three remaining players drop
unhesitatingly the shooter pulls in the cards separates them into four or five piles and tears each pile in two
he glances around and hoban comes up behind him
the shooter hands him the torn up cards and unseals another pack going through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his hat
it is around midnight and there is a more settled look to the game some of the players have removed their coats and there is a good deal of smoke
in the air
the kid has a cup of coffee by him presumably with brandy in it lancey has his frappe pig is drinking whiskey the shooter and yeller have bottles of bear
it is the end of a hand
with about six hundred dollars in the pot pig who has been called turns over his hole card triumphantly
aces over eights
waits for a challenge but the others turn their cards thank you gents
as he pulls in money to yeller be a laugh if the two champs ended up cleaned
he barely notices pigs remark
he barely notices lanceys reaction to pigs remark
camera moves among the spectators who also have a more settled look about them
there is a bar attended by a uniformed hotel bellman and most of the people are drinking
we see in passing a couple go through the door to the bedroom and close it behind them
camera holds on the love seat as bill rejoin hoban on their perch
shrugs what do you expect first five or six hours
still feeling each other out
pigs ahead about a grand shooter maybe three hundred
sokal gets a nine of clubs the kid a six pig a queen yeller a king lancey a jack and the shooter a four
camera pulls back to show the players
there is less oral accompaniment to the betting now
king says twenty
lancey calls shooter drops sokal calls the kid drops
in for twenty
dealing to the nine a ten to the queen a seven to the king a jack and to the jack a jack
pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars
who has the nine and ten of clubs showing im in
after studying the board up two hundred dollars
folding leave it to the rich folk
lancey could be laying for him with three jacks
pig dont think so
call the two hundred
lancey puts in his money and so does sokal
shooter deals another round an eight of clubs to sokal a second seven to pig a ten to lancey
possible straight flush pair of sevens
pair of jacks are still high
check to the sevens
trying to be casual bet the size of the pot
nine hundred and eighty dollars
in for nine eighty
whats with lancey
i thought hed raise with three jacks or drop with two pair
he probably thinks pigs faking the queens
anyhow docs liable take them both with a straight or a flush
there is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as the shooter deals
sokal gets a five of diamonds and his disappointment is too great to conceal
busted no flush no straight
pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine
to the pair of jacks a trey
counting his money trying to be calm pair of sevens will bet whatever i got here
twenty four hundred bucks
ill call your twenty four hundred he watches lancey puzzled this isnt what he had expected
and raise you whatever i have left
the kid relaxes this is more the way he figured it
lancey is completely calm
pig is shattered his whole world suddenly blown apart
comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars pig
dont imagine youll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour plus whatever you care to raise me
all eyes are on pig which doesnt make it any easier for him
he just sits there his hands shaking
fourteen fifty to the queens
you want to take your half hour pig
there is another long moment before pig flips over his up cards
no im out
out of the game
he looks at lancey with malevolence
lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of the shooter
pig suddenly lunges toward the cards wanting a look at lanceys hole card but lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack the shooter is
to pig you tap city
pig is suffering weighing the advantages and disadvantages of making the dread admission
finally he nods
the shooter takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake and the other four remaining players each add a ten
the shooter pushes the money toward pig
i got a woman
i thought you and hilda were quits
the other players look at the shooter to see if he is going to accept this statement at face value
he nods that he does and each man contributes another ten
the shooter passes the second fifty to pig
see you around pig
ad lib so long pig see you night
getting up so long
camera follows him to the door
the spectators make room for him no one saying anything
at the door pig turns back for his valedictory gesture
good luck kid
he goes out
he has been rearranging his money but pigs words make his head jerk up and toward the door
camera pulls back to reveal the other players who react in dismay to the breach of form
he shouldnt have said that
not after taking tap city from the table
his womans been giving him a rough time
wants him to quit and go square
at his age
he wants to wish anybody luck doesnt bother me
personally i dont figure the kid needs it
with that the tension is gone
but just to make sure the shooter pushes his chair back
i know its early men but what about taking a little break
melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to the shooter
to melba it always distresses me a man reaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next weeks income
i know what you mean
i like a man to have plenty of assurance
the shooters gaze wanders o
camera moves to feature the objects of his attention who are lady fingers lancey and the kid
the two men would like to talk to each other but lady fingers is monopolizing lancey and he doesnt want to offend her
spider man died kind of slow
first he give them a kidney then his gall bladder and then they taking his whole damn stomach
you remember spider man run the dice table down at turks club to memphis
oh spider man sure sure
he died kind of slow
the shooter comes to lanceys rescue
need your help lady fingers
to make arrangements for food and shelter
he whisks her away
lancey and the kid finally facing each other alone dont quite know how to begin
nice looking broads
thats a fact
that was a pretty thing to watch what you done to pig with those jacks
from you thats nice to hear
when he bet out first he was ready to think you had them back to back
even when he bet the size of the pot he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him
but when you called him i could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens and i knew you had him hooked
you knew did you
before i raised
oh sure i seen what you were pulling all along
lancey is a bit taken aback by the kids confident assertion but he manages a smile
you been to miami kid
beautiful town lot of loose money around
you ought to come down some time
you mean it
lot of room down there
another spot you ought to work someday is reno nevada
you got to have nerves though
so much going on
action everywhere you turn
you lose the feel of the cards when youre in so much action day in day out
id like to make it out there
theres different levels of action there youd find yours any kind you could ask for
i generally stick to stud
sure sure for eating money
but you know how it is i like to lay off once in a while and try craps
nothing serious i dont even think of it as work
oh i do that
ill take a night off and shoot a little casino
or even blackjack
your age you dont need a regular vacation every year
but me i have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks
i go to this place near delray beach and the whole time i dont play anything but bridge
i could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners
im not keeping you from your woman am i
after a slight hesitation no
were shes gone away for a while
were not sure were looking for the same thing
im sorry to hear that
i was hoping christian would run with me and wouldnt try to make a big deal out of it
but she tried
yeah and now i dont know
i dont figure a man can change his way because the way i see it a mans lucky hes got something going for him that he can hold on to
a man cant change his way for a woman
nooo a man cant do that
i been wondering if it isnt maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing
just tie in to something nice when youre away from the action and enjoy it and let it wear itself out
after a long moment thats very interesting you should say that
youre pretty young to have figured things out already
well she didnt understand how it was with me and warmly between us
there aint but a few people i guess who would understand as the kid doesnt finish kid youre the best stud man ive seen in years of action
you know that
well thank you
and when it comes to broads which is getting to be an academic problem i can look back now to the two or three i ever considered i might want
to spend the rest of my life with and you know what
i like it
looking back on them that is then i always got a lot of companionship out of a good book
its very educational hearing what its like for a man your age
glad to be of help
and its good we had this little talk so i know we can be friends regardless what happens
that sounds good to me
i didnt think you was coming in at me like a grudge match
no room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud
i learned that a long time ago
ready for some action gentlemen
they look at each other and then exit
lady fingers is sitting in shooters place rippling and shuffling the cards
yeller sokal and the shooter are all either sitting at the table or standing near it
lancey followed by the kid returns to the table
its a whole new deal
good hands all around
prosperity for everybody
youre still good fingers
getting crippled up lancey
not many of the old gang left
you heard whistling sam was gone
no i didnt hear
i was the one got called to the morgue to identify him
i dont suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve ton bulldozer
no cant say that i have
dont go out of your way
morning sunlight is streaming in
the kid facing the sun wears his eyeshade
the shooter has resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to sokal the kid and himself
bet the pot
four hundred and twenty dollars
makes me exactly even
this kind of a game thats a smart place to quit
takes his money off the table just do the dealing if thats all right with everybody
it is later in the morning
three players are left in the hand on the last card yeller with nothing higher than a jack lancey with a king queen showing and sokal with an ace king
ace king is the high man
shoot the works
counts it out nine hundred and thirty bucks
putting out the money what have you got
unhappily doesnt matter
if you can call me you beat me
ace king high
turning an ace ace king queen high
to the kid i had them both with a pair of fives
winds it up for me men
and i cant say its been a pleasure
despairingly that one i was sure i could steal
lancey has a built in burglar alarm
im also withdrawing from the field of battle gentlemen
settle for the seventeen hundred ive already dropped
yeller pulls in the money in front of him
there is now about left on the table in front of lancey in front of the kid
to the kid well just the two of us
yeah just the two of us
deal them shooter man
there is around in the pot
shooter deals an unhelpful card to lanceys pair of aces and a nine to the kids king queen ten
cost you a grand
compulsory call kid
the kid turns up a jack and pulls in the money
the last bet has been made and there is about in the pot
lancey exposes his hole card
two pair jacks up
he takes in the money
there is in the pot
lancey shows a pair of kings the kid an ace and three odd cards
the shooter deals a nine to lancey
he is watching the shooter intently
the dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as the shooter gives the kid an ace
lanceys hand reaches into the shot to turn over his up cards
he takes the money in slowly his eyes on the shooter
now the distribution of money has been reversed
the kid has something under lancey something under
he avoids meeting the kids gaze
on the fourth card lancey shows a pair of sevens the kid a pair of eights and a ten
two thousand dollars
the kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten
call two thousand
he turns to watch the shooter
again there is no indication of improper dealing as the shooter gives lancey an odd card and the kid a ten completing his full house
two thousand more
i cant beat three sevens
then as the shooters eyes flicker with surprise id like a break to get some food and sleep im winners so it isnt up to me to say it but
im saying it anyway
after a moment the shooter follows
lancey watches them go then rises apparently still fresh and strong
lady fingers joins him
pleasantly my dear that young man is a stud poker playing son of a bitch
gettin to you lancey
lancey looks at her a moment then smiles
softly not yet he isnt
he moves through the crowd then exits
they are alone in the room
shooter is uncomfortable and would like to be elsewhere but the kid is standing in front of the closed door
now just what the hell are you trying to pull
trying to bluff it nothing what are you talking about
the kid grabs him and slams him against the wall
you shooter man you been feeding me cards for an hour
angry and ashamed the hell i was
he waits a brief moment then eases away from the kid christ kid even if i was you couldnt spot it im too good a mechanic for anybody to spot
grabbing him and slamming him against the wall again but i was looking for it shooter four times you give me the cards i need
a little shrill you seen it before often enough
one player draws four good ones
never in a game when i been told ahead the dealer has a stake in my coming out on top
slumping my woman told you
she told me enough to make me start thinking
almost pleading why should you bitch if i give you a little help
why you dumb bastard
you have to ask me why
ready to hit him i could break you apart for what youve done
backing off kid you got to understand
it wasnt my idea well who the hells was it then schlaegel
hes got the squeeze on me kid and hes meaner than hell
hell cut me up if i dont come through
then you think i wanted to deal a phony game
you think it dont mean something to me
i never done a crooked thing before in my life
my ass bleeds for you now you get straight on this
you come along straight or i blow it wide open
hes liable to kill me
he aint goin to do nothin to you except pay off because im goin to win
it is a hell of a chance to take
you got no choice
he aint goin to like it
almost yelling at him he aint goin to know
then quietly shooter im goin to win this one win it my way and you ride with me or youre out finished
i ride with you
you better not forget it now beat it
i need some sleep
shooter looks at him then moves towards the door
schlaegel i accept his offer to use the room
the shooter goes out
the kid crosses to the phone
into phone i want to be called at p
on the nose
for sure thanks
in the privacy of his room he shows how close he is to exhaustion
wearily he sits on the bed and begins to remove his shoes
then catching his reflection in the mirror straightens
not yet he isnt
but he damn well might
she is in the final stages of undressing
camera moves with her as she steps to the kids bedside and gets into bed with him
having accomplished this without waking him she speaks into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator
good afternoon sir
its exactly four oclock
he awakens in considerable confusion
melba is amused by his difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances
its really only about twenty five to four
you can stay right where you are
i dont want you to think im getting too personal but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here
you mean you dont remember last night
we drank all that champagne and you said lets get married right away and we chartered a plane to can it then wheres shooter
i locked the door
its incredible the way you invariably worry about the shooter
its incredible the way you invariably dont
worrying takes time and we dont have a lot
were supposed to sit down again at half past four
does it really matter so much to you now that sense of obligation to the shooter
thinking about shooter i got no obligations to the shooter
then to melba or to you
obligations are not what i have in mind
he is shaving
apparently much stronger but his hand is shaking
he looks at it
after a moment he smiles a little
camera is on the shower door as the sound of running water ceases
the kid can be seen indistinctly through the door
reach me a towel
melba who is dressed again and applying her lipstick comes into the shot takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him after he opens the shower door
he gives himself a quick once over with it the secures it around his waist steps out of the shower stall and begins the process of shaving
melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup
you any idea how much the shooter has involved in this game of yours
if schlaegel bet as much on me as i heard i guess hed pay a nice piece of change to be sure i won
its worse than that
schlaegel staked him for three years
he has his hooks so deep in shooter man hell take out his liver when he pulls them out
the kid stops shaving and looks at her
you asking me to go along with the fix
im asking you to consider whether your ego is worth destroying another mans whole life
youre still working for him
on my time youre still working for him
what kind of switch is this
you criticize me for trying to chippie on him then i get a little loyal and youre at me for that
no i dont hold it against you
you wanting to make things right for him but this game i handle my way win lose or draw
there is a knock on the door
rolls and coffee for the hard headed hero
camera pans to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door talking as she goes
believe me kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own
she has paused at the door to finish her sentence
now she unlocks and opens it to christian
melba is so taken aback she cant do anything but stand there holding the door open
the kid in the bathroom in f
is similarly frozen in his tracks
after a moment christian advances into the room
the scene as it looks to christian is circumstantially incriminating
camera moves with her gaze from the kid to the one mussed bed to melba
the faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances
a pause you said wait home til you let me know
yeah thats what i said
we took a break in the game to catch some sleep
shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up
yeah i woke him up
it dont take much
no i didnt find it any trouble
awkwardly well you children dont need me thats for sure
see you downstairs
to christian you too honey right
ill be around if the kid wants me
see you melba
por nada as they say
it was nothing
she walks past camera and a moment later comes the sound of the door closing behind her
the kid who has moved into the bedroom crosses to his clothes on a chair and picks up his undershorts and trousers
he returns to the bathroom using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers
you been to the place
no ive got my bag downstairs
maybe ill take it over later on tonight
hows your mama and papa
hows the game going
the kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap
its come to be just me and lancey
he comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing
as his movement brings him fairly close to christian he realizes he hasnt kissed her and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on
after the kiss i was wondering
i got my mind on the cards
and i dont want to rattle you
we got plenty to talk about but it can all wait
except i want to say this
i came back because i figured if it was going to work with us its silly me sitting home with mama while youre playing your big game
i mean if im any use to you at all this is when its most important
to the kid preoccupied by the game and the fix feeling both affection and guilt
the idea that she can be any use to him against lancey is one he cant grasp
im glad you came christian
you got as much right here as anybody
then more right i should have said
the change i come out with when i win this one youre going to be the one to spend it
he moves toward the door
eric turning back look i said im glad you came and thats all until i wrap this up im a poker player remember
she looks at him
after a moment he exits
it is evening
lady fingers deals a first up card to the two players
the kid gets an eight lancey a jack
the eightll try two bills
turning his card no stay
lady fingers scoops up the cards shuffles them into the rest of the deck submits it to lancey for his cut and deals them another two cards apiece all in
the space of seconds
the kid gets a queen lancey a nine
turning his card no stay
camera starts on yeller who is stretched out on the loveseat with his eyes closed and pans up to include hoban who sits at the observation post with the binoculars
yeller speaks without opening his eyes
naaa kid paired kings
he wins a hundred
camera moves on past a window showing it is night outside past a group of other spectators past bill shooter and melba who watch the game grimly and finally to
the table where the shooter is dealing again
the kid is down to his undershirt and even lancey has made a few concessions to comfort
the players have just been dealt their third cards
christian moves up to stand behind the kid
queen bets another c note
folding take it away
he looks up at christian
go read a magazine honey
then moves away
lancey watches this
it is later at night
the magazine lies open on christians lap she is staring absently into space
all right gents
im declaring a break
the announcement rouses christian from her reverie
lady fingers is in the dealers chair
the two players look pretty weary
i dont want a break
well i dont either
lady fingers puts down the deck
picks up a new one
snapping same deck is good enough
i want a new deck
alright alright a new deck then jesus
lady fingers looks at the two men for a long moment
puts the cards down
you want to deal
then deal them yourselves
im going to the john
im going to get something to eat and im going to take a nap
you barracudas can snap all you want but at each other im taking a break and if you dont like it you can both go to hell
she turns and stalks off
lancey and the kid look at each other for a moment then both grin
i guess we been told
looks that way
rising see you in about of an hour lancey right
make it an hour
old bones need a little more time to loosen up
meaning it listen i think it is amazing youve been able to keep going this long
as he heads for the door lancey reacts to this
then stands and looks around the room
groups of people stand in the shadows watching silently not hostile but certainly not friendly
he is the man but he is getting beat and nobody is sorry
after a moment he turns and leaves from a side door
camera pans to hold on christian as she stops the kid by the door
taking his hand eric simultaneously your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him
theres nothing to talk about
you better kid
you dont youre only making worse trouble
christian scans both their faces as they talk
if you think so
to christian sorry
nothing nothing you have to worry about
ill see you later
he heads for the door
christian looks after him
get something to eat
bill and the kid are sitting at a room service table
bill nibbles at some cheese and crackers while the kid tackles a large steak
felix the chauffeur stands in attendance on them
i thought it would be better if you and i sat down together to see if we couldnt work out our differences
he motions to felix indicating a wine bottle on the table
felix steps over and refills the kids glass
what i told the shooter goes
are you saying no before weve even discussed it
am i to feel all my arguments will be wasted
the kid just looks at him then returns to his meal
ill skip to the final argument
then more salad perhaps
he makes a peremptory gesture to felix who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to the kid
the shooter will be back dealing when you start again
he will give you an occasional helpful card
thats an argument
thats a fact
im coming to the argument
ill give you a fact
i wont let it happen
is that knife sharp enough
felix jumps into action again
he moves to the kids side reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade which he clocks open an inch or two from the kids neck
it is an extremely ugly looking and menacing weapon
see if it cuts better with that
felix hands the knife to the kid who tries it on his steak
but it dont cut any ice with me
he jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade
rising not this time
as the kid exits christian is waiting for him
he moves down the corridor preoccupied
did you eat
stops looks at her irritated why not for chris sakes
eric moving away you should eat something
loudly stopping ive got to talk to you
he stops looks at her
fumbling its about us
whats going to happen
interrupting whats going to happen
whats going to happen for chris sake is im going to win the game
then more softly you go back to the apartment honey this might take two more days
flatly if i go im not going back to the apartment
if i go im just going
after a long moment well thats up to you christian
he looks at her a moment longer then moves up the corridor
she watches him then turns
standing in the open door some distance away are schlaegel and felix
shuffling the cards
camera pulls back enough to see his face as he looks across at the kid
camera pans to a close shot of the kid and then past a couple of spectators including christian and melba to bill whose eyes are on the kid
finally camera pans back to the kid
i told you shooter i wont go for it
both the shooter and bill are aware of a portentous note in the kids tone
the shooters not well
he didnt want to spoil the game but he ought to be resting
he ought to be in the hospital
well we got lady fingers
or we can deal ourselves
what the kids talking about is nothing
its just not important
it is to me
you want to kill yourself do it on your own time
lancey looks from the kid to the shooter sensing that there may be something more behind this but not knowing just what
i got to go along with that shooter
rising from her chair
like eddie the dude said on his deathbed im as ready as ill ever be
the four cards showing are the ace ten and two little clubs
as camera pulls back we also have time to note the kids stake
he is still ahead
lancey counts out five hundred dollars from his stake leaving about thirteen thousand and puts it into a pot that already contains around a thousand
i cant persuade myself you have the flush
the kid turns up the jack of clubs
now i can
the kid pulls in the money
both men are showing the strain
perhaps lancey the most as he appears to be consistently losing
showing are two nines and two odd cards
im going to pay the price to look at that third nine
the kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money
new deck please
he shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against lanceys pair of queens
he takes another look at his hole card and we see that it is of no help to him
pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars
they are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now
the binoculars pass from one to the other
both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game
ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time
camera moves to the other four remaining spectators christian melba the shooter and bill
they are close enough to see the cards but too close to discuss them
the kid has almost half the money in front of him now and is playing with increasing assurance and pressure
turning his cards im not that curious
excitement in his voice the kid is pushing it and making it stick
camera moves to the other four spectators as they react to the kids successful streak
in a low voice hes getting to him
and it looks that way
lancey appears old and unsure
the kid sharp and cold
a young barracuda moving in for the kill
camera moves in close to christian as she tries to catch the kids eye
thinking she has it she smiles her encouragement
he looks right at her and doesnt seem to see her
lady fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand and lancey is high
and up five
amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider
the kid shows two jacks and two odd cards lancey a pair of aces and two odd cards
lancey puts about eight hundred dollars into the pot
betting the jack isnt there kid
the kid exposes his hidden jack
greed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces as they watch lancey falter
the shooter whispers to bill just loud enough for the girl to hear
were in i think hes got him
christian looks at them then at the kid
hesitates a moment then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door
only melba notices her and even she doesnt have time to question her
camera follows christian to the suite entrance where she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table
the place where christian was sitting is right in his line of vision but he hasnt observed her departure
she goes on out the door
the second dawn of the contest is near at hand
the room continuously lived in for so long by so many people is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates empty bottles full wastebaskets and ash trays and frayed people
at the poker table lady fingers is dealing a new hand
a jack and a ten
camera moves in close enough for us to see the cards
lancey has the jack of hearts the kid the ten of clubs
jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars
the kid takes his first look at his hole card
it is the queen of hearts
and up five hundred
lancey looks at him a long moment
his face pale and shaken
the kid is beating him
pushing buying always pressing and lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time not badly but consistently and inevitably
his age and fatigue are a strong handicap for the long pull
then his face settles as if he had come to a decision
he smiles lightly summoning some last reserve of strength almost as if he knows this will be the last hand win or lose
call your five hundred and five hundred more
after a brief hesitation call
fifty to one hundred says lancey paired his jacks
lady fingers deals the ten of diamonds to the kid giving him a pair and the ten of hearts to lancey
pair of tens
jack ten of hearts
your five hundred and up one thousand
the raise is a surprise
the kids eyes go up to study lanceys face even though he knows what a futile effort that is
fifty to seventy five hes got the jacks wired
mark it could be a high heart
queens the best but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce
specially having one of the kids tens
one thousand to the tens
dealing a third ten and a nine of hearts to the ten jack
the kid lancey shooter melba schlaegel yeller hoban and others as they realize this could be the big hand
hes beat on the board anyway you look at it
even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one against improving
he wont run and i dont think hes got the jacks
i think hes going for the flush
after a moment two thousand five hundred dollars
lancey looks at him then at the cards
the moment stretches
finally two thousand five hundred dollars to the three hearts
lancey looks at her
his face briefly showing his anger
the kid notices this and reacts
finally casually reasonable bet
two thousand five hundred
he counts out the money to lady fingers deal them
knowing this is it hes going for it and the kids got him
hes going all the way
dealing a queen of diamonds to the three tens
a note of excitement in her voice and an eight of hearts to the possible flush
possible straight flush
three tens bet
the kid checks the amount of money in front of him
they exchange a quick look of satisfaction and then their eyes go back to the cards
they each take a quick turn with the binoculars
if the kid bets into the flush hes filled up with a queen in the hole
if the man has a flush or a straight he goes under
then but not with both
he looks at his hole card
it is still the queen of hearts
he has a full house which has to be the winning hand unless lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack seven of hearts and to raise the
kid with a jack ten seven
bet whats in front of me
make it fifty four hundred bucks
he counts out all his money except a few smaller bills
he takes his time before he responds
fifty four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money
counting it out i see the bet and raise sixty seven hundred
slowly and deliberately revealing nothing in his face he reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet and begins to let the bills flutter out on the
the kid looks at him frozen
bill hisses softly into the shooters ear
kid has him doesnt he
but the shooter like the kid is white faced and frozen by the raise
they crowd in close to the table hoban yeller bill the shooter and melba
after a long moment im taking my half hour to raise my stake
i declare a thirty minute break
leave your cards and money on the table
the game will start again at five forty five
ill take your marker kid
i can raise it
i know you can
long as you know
he raps the table call
turns up a heart seven straight flush to the jack thats you owe me kid
there is nothing to be gained from a poker face now and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show
camera moves among the spectators hoban and yeller who are sorry for the kid and admiring of lancey bill who is all the more angry at his defeat because his
hopes were up the shooter who is a very unhappy man and melba whose anger at the kid is balanced by her fear of schlaegel and what will happen to the shooter and possibly to her
lancey pulls in the money while the kid stares at him dumbly
lady fingers riffles the cards
are you playing kid
you got a half an hour to raise your stake
no im through
formally gentlemen this game is over
youre one hell of a poker player kid
that was a rough hand
whats the tab for the whole show
as he settles up the camera follows the kid to his brandy bottle
as he pours himself a slug melba and shooter join him
you had to do it didnt you you had to go for it your own way
then as the kid doesnt answer well sonny i hope you learned something
i know we sure as hell did
shes got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser
then sorry kid
then i should have known he had it shooter man
i walked into it
trying to grin as schlaegel and felix move up well kid its like i said you just wasnt ready
to the shooter are you ready shooter man
were having a meeting and i suggest you join us
shooter looks at him a moment and nods and taking melba by the arm moves toward the door followed by felix
why me im not part of this
jerking her forward oh yes you are you and your big mouth youre part of it all right
hes right my dear
now run along with felix
were going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours
melba starts to protest but felix jerks her out the door
shooter hesitates then follows
schlaegel turns to the kid
i was wrong
i figured you for brains
but youre a loser kid
you had a chance to play with grownups and you ran
then as lancey and lady fingers approach they werent playing your game
they were playing mine
think about that while you find a place to hide
but hide good kid because i got a message for you and im going to see it delivered
the kid looks at him looks at lancey and lady fingers wondering about what schlaegel has said angry about it
schlaegel nods moves to the door
lancey and lady fingers join the kid
never thought id see the day
you raising tens on a lousy three flush
gets down to what its all about doesnt it
making the wrong play at the right time
sharply thats what its all about
then as lancey looks at him and doesnt answer you were crazy odds are three hundred to one against
after a moment i dont play a percentage game
i play stud poker my way
and i got the money and you got the questions
figure that out
then not unkindly youre good
but as long as im around youre second best kid
and you might as well learn to live with it
the kid looks at him and doesnt answer
look me up if youre in miami after christmas
he smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door
lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations
the kid watches for a moment then takes a long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and out the door
as the kid moves down the hall and enters the elevator
as he moves through the almost deserted lobby into the street
series of angles of the kid walking alone through the city
during the above there is an impression someone is following him
he turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path
suddenly three men move in behind him
he turns trapped
the men are four of the original seven players he hustled in the opening scene
note during the progression of the game first one then two then all four men will be included among the observers
always in the background never positively identified
their presence should be felt if not recognized
so it aint eric stone from the foundry
its the cincinnati kid king of the stud poker players
no not the king not much of anything right now
moving towards him well start with giving you back what you gave me
he moves toward the kid
eric the men hesitate
as christian gets out of a taxi
as she moves toward them tell her good bye sport
you aint going any place
i know that
he crosses to christian
are you all right
then werent you going to say good bye
i said good bye
yeah i guess you did
then you dont know if i won or lost do you
no it doesnt really matter
then after a long moment i love you kid and its not enough
yeah i know
calling listen lady its coming on the morning rush
i got to have one fare after another or im behind for the day
christian doesnt answer
she looks at the kid for a long moment then turns and goes
he watches her
she enters the cab and it leaves
the kid just stands there
danny and the others move up around him
the kid ignores them
after a moment danny swings from behind and knocks him to the pavement
he lies there stunned for a moment
they look down at him
then he comes up
he flattens two in the process of being badly beaten
they leave him
as the city awakens
finally he stirs stands and walks away
