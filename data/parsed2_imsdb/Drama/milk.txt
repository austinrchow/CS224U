this is harvey milk speaking on friday november th
this is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination
reveal harvey milk sitting at his kitchen table in a cluttered san francisco apartment
during one of the early campaigns i started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature
in street clothes trying to corral an angry mob on city halls steps harvey lifts a bullhorn
hello im harvey milk and im here to recruit you
harvey at his kitchen table making his recording
if i was speaking to a slightly hostile or mostly straight audience id try to break the tension with a joke
harvey is in a plain ill fitting brown suit making a campaign speech to a crowd of stone faced union boys
i know i know im not what you were expecting but i left my high heels at home
harvey gets a laugh from the audience
return to harvey speaking into his tape recorder
i fully realize that a person who stands for what i stand for an activist a gay activist becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure
terrified afraid or very disturbed themselves
police officers and press race through the halls of city hall their walkie talkies squawking
something terrible has happened
a stretcher is wheeled out of an office
on it a filled body bag with a white sheet draped over it
the press rush to get a shot
the police officers quickly load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight
a shell shocked dianne feinstein wades into a throng of reporters
those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd
as president of the board of supervisors its my duty to make this announcement
both mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk have been shot
gasps from the reporters
dianne struggles to be heard
police are looking for a suspect
supervisor dan white
the very picture of loveliness mary ann white finds her husband dan white sitting in the pews praying
hes a handsome devout all american man in a three piece suit
she sits by him
a weight hangs
he cant make eye contact
something has happened
she puts her arm around him feels a gun at his side
she holds him firmly gripping the revolver in his holster to conceal to keep him from using it potentially on himself
return to harvey speaking into his tape recorder
knowing that i could be assassinated at any moment i feel its important that some people should understand my thoughts
i think that pauses not sure what to say i wish i had time to explain everything i did
almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay movement
clean white letters on a black screen read amilk title new york city
harvey is heading up the stairs from the subway platform
he is wearing a suit but hes less than clean cut
his hair is brushing past his ears
harveys very interested pov scott smith a sexy curly haired hippie in tight jeans and boots is heading down the the stairs
harvey tries to make eye contact
todays my birthday
scott laughs no today is actually my birthday
and believe it or not i dont have any plans
people took me out after work
looking him over work
so that would be
let me guess
ma bell or at t
the great american insurance company
im part of the big evil corporate establishment that let me guess you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from vietnam to diaper rash
you left out bad breath
falling for it harvey covers his mouth
they both smile realizing they share a wry sense of humor
a train is coming harvey has to work fast
youre not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you
gently teasing listen harvey youre kind of cute for a suit
but i dont do guys over forty
well then im in luck
because im still thirty nine
showing scott his watch and its only eleven fifteen
in a tight two shot scott is pressed against a wall with harvey pressed against his back having sex
harvey is the aggressor completely uninhibited
opera music plays on a record player
wagners tristan and harvey feeds scott spoonfuls of cream pie from a tray full of food that rests on the bed between them
ice cream cookies milk berries
its over the top and adorable
where are you from
well this isnt jackson but you still cant respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform
its too dangerous
now you tell me
theres nothing tougher than a new york city cop
theyre arrogant and theyre everywhere
ill show you the cruising spots if you want if you promise youll be careful
little scottie san
are you on uppers or what
this is just
plain old me
youre afraid of the cops
im just discreet
i know a lot of people here
if they found out i could lose my job
meaning a closet case oh
youre one of those
examines harveys eyes i think you need a change of scenery
i need a change
looks at the clock youre forty now
just the truth forty years old and i havent done a thing im proud of
re the desert tray you keep eating like this and youll be a fat ass by fifty
laughs it off no
dont you worry
i wont make it to fifty
scott distracts him playful like a newlywed at a wedding he rubs a slice of pie in harveys face
wipes the pie from his eye and tackles his young frisky new lover
the mess getting everywhere
harvey brushes it out of scotts hair
an idea half jokingly why dont we run away together
return to harvey speaks to the tape recorder
throughout the film these scenes should feel intimate as if harvey is telling us things no one else knows
in those days san francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go
to drop out
to fall in love
mm home movie montage of harvey and scott dressed full out like hippies long hair beard beads sunglasses driving
through the redwoods over the golden gate bridge and into san francisco
but by the haight was boarded up
the new place for us refugees was this run down irish catholic neighborhood in eureka valley
six blocks square
harvey lifts a nikon camera and starts snapping photos of castro street
a liquor store empty buildings boarded windows
harvey points the camera toward the marquee of the castro theater big letters spelling out
c a s t r o
harvey points his camera across the street at the gray haired owner of a liquor store
harvey snaps photos of his face an expression of distrust
harvey snaps a sign in the liquor shop window that reads harveys camera focuses on two cute young hippie boys walking past one puts his arm over the other
to harveys eyes its a very new site
harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a for rent sign hanging out front
the place is filled with opera music from a record player
harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera
scott is getting high lying in the sun that pours through the large empty windows
i cashed my last unemployment check yesterday
well i hope you did something useful with it
i bought an ounce of pot
i was just wondering if you had any
plans or thoughts
about us doing something to you know bring in an income
harvey straddles scott
he begins snapping photos of him
i suppose i can wait tables
i want you right here with me
did you see place downstairs is for rent
i was thinking we could open a shop together
what kind of shop
one with very little overhead
not too much work
a little one just like morris and minnie milk of woodmere new york
harveys empty store front has been converted to a camera store with a few not very impressive products
harvey is out on the sidewalk directing scott who is inside the stores large window hanging a sign castro camera
just a little to the left
the old liquor store owner from earlier mcconnelly crosses the street to watch
harvey gives him a warm welcome hello there
im harvey milk
youre the new renters
welcome to castro camera
harvey extends his hand
mcconnelly shakes but is wary
i want to join the um
what is it
the eureka valley merchants association
i want to help in any way possible
im no interloper
a jew perhaps but i hope youll forgive that
mcconnelly looks from harvey to scott in the window
i dont think your application will be approved mr
this is a family neighborhood
your kind are far more welcome on haight street
trying to keep it friendly what kind do you mean sir
not playing along the merchants association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors
based on what law
theres mans law and theres gods law in this neighborhood and in this city
the san francisco police force is happy to enforce either
to mcconnelly as he walks away thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood
we pay taxes you know
harvey grabs scotts hand
keeps him from heating up from pouncing
its not the time for them to bite yet
scott is sitting on the bed while harvey is talking a mile a minute from the kitchen totally energized
well form our own business association
start with the gay owned businesses
well take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film
well ask them what they want to see done here
what they want changed
well get money rolling into this neighborhood
can i come in now
one more minute
back to his new scheme ill go to the neighborhood banks
they must have some gay customers
whats with all this political activist crap
i thought you were a goddamn republican
harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of food
he sets them out on a small dining room table still rambling on to scott in the bedroom
im a businessman scott
i think businesses ought to treat their customers right
even their gay customers
for gods sake this is san francisco
its just like every other city in this country
people hate us
we should have at least one block in one city right
start there and take over the neighborhood
a smile okay you can come in now
scott heads toward the kitchen
the table is laid out with a home cooked meal candles and a huge bouquet of flowers
harvey smashes a cream pie into scotts face
scott chases harvey around the apartment trying to smear some of the cream pie onto him
the street is shut down for the first ever castro street fair
the crowd is mostly gay the majority congregate outside toad hall bar
angle on some of the old school irish locals milling about eyeing the scene skeptically
harvey moves through the crowd with scott shaking hands
thanks for the party mr
thanks for joining the castro village association
harvey arrives at a long line of gay men winding out of the irish liquor store from earlier
he squeezes past them into the store leaving scott outside
excuse me gentleman
finding the shop owner hello
mcconnelly at the register is overwhelmed with all the new business
i just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing
so you dont mind all these homosexuals in here do you
mcconnelly grins uncomfortable
the line of gay men is curious about the hubbub
point made harvey does a
just a joke
mcconnelly here loves our kind
to mcconnelly tell your wife hello for me
harvey spots scott in the crowd and pulls him toward him kissing him on the mouth
its quite the show
they step back out onto the street where an irish band is now playing
gay men watch
harvey grabs scott and spins him through a sharp waltz
off the pair at home in their new neighborhood
and people started hanging around our store
activists kids folks who needed a home away from home
a new sign goes in the window we are very open
a few young men are hanging out in the shop the beginnings of harveys entourage
harvey moves among them sharing a clipped sunday cartoon lecturing them on politics or the arts and checking out the cute ones
there was danny niccoletta a cute art student who id picked up at toad hall
turns out he was also good at running the camera shop
something scott and i found we had surprising little interest in
on danny niccoletta young waif like somewhat helpless
opera is passe harvey
its about street theater now
what youre not getting is the spectacle of it the bigger than life emotions
danny jumps up and imitates the larger than life gestures of an opera diva making harvey laugh
a great mind
a great wit
a harvard graduate which nobody cared about in those days in the castro
jim rivaldo flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of harveys desk
he seems to be looking for something to occupy his keen mind
a sharply dressed young man s dick pabich walks up to peek over his shoulder
and somewhere along the line jim picked up a protege a cute political kid from wisconsin
and of course there was dennis peron who ran a very popular business with the new kids
dennis peron hands scott a free joint
and on occasion we actually had a real customer
but only occasionally
across the room scott is waiting on a customer hes out of place straight gruff a union man allan baird s
this guy wants to talk to you
approaches allan welcome
what can we do for you
hi im allan baird
teamsters representative and director of the coors beer boycott in california
everyone this is allan baird
hes a very big deal so behave yourselves
i was told you were like the mayor of the castro said you organized the cva you might know some people in the bars
i do have friends in awfully low places but just so you know its not official yet
the mayor part
ive considered gathering an army of queers to march up to city hall and secede but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans
but if i could be of any use im all ears
we cant get coors to go union
these guys are like me they cant be out of work too long
harvey pulls allan aside away from the audience easing his nerves
its harvey at his best
im just curious
are we your first stop or your last
clearly his last its been a tough one mr
well you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer
if were going to fast for your sake i think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight dont you
is that what you really want
ill have coors out of every bar in the castro by the end of the week
nods sincere thank you mr
jump to allan is on his way out
harvey walks back behind the counter to scott
no more coors beer
its gotta come out of every bar
gay and straight
whats he giving you
nothing for me
thats a convert
a convert to what
a still photo montage jim dick scott and danny get bar owners throughout san francisco to unscrew their coors taps throw out their coors stock put on boycott coors buttons
and tape up dump coors posters
i got my people to get coors out of all the gay bars
million bottles worth in san francisco alone
coors beer immediately fell from number
one week later union man allan baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive teamsters trucks
we werent just a group of pansies anymore
we had a neighborhood
we had the unions
and for the first time we had a little bit of power
maybe that was the day someone first called me the mayor of castro street
a knowing grin or perhaps i invented it myself
harvey jim dick scott danny and dennis debate the merits of working within the system versus dropping out
everyone is talking over each other
a young gay man runs into the store
the fucking cops man theyre up on castro street
harvey and the guys race out of the store
harvey scott jim dick dennis run up the street toward one of the castro gay bars where police are getting out of squad cars and approaching customers crowding around the
clear the sidewalk
some of the gay men move out of the cops way but some of them dont move fast enough
the cops start beating them
harvey scott and the others try to break into the crowd to get closer to the fight
to pull the cops off their friends
danny hangs back snapping photos of the event
scott shoves his way past the cops
a cop brings his night stick down hard on scotts head
scott sits on the toilet
harvey rinses blood from a white washcloth and goes back to cleaning scotts head wound
if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests youre
gonna run for supervisor is that the idea
i could go right for mayor but i think i should work my way up to it
youll be my campaign manager
because i have so much experience in politics
politics is theater
it doesnt matter if you win
you make a statement
you say im here pay attention to me
harvey you do that every time you cross the street
coors looks like it might cave
the union boys will owe me
imagine if we get their vote
itll be fun
harvey starts kissing him all over
well make it a spectacle
harvey walks down to market st
with a box
he waves shakes flirts with everyone
his warmest hello is from a gruff union man
behind harvey scott pushes a loaded shopping cart
harvey sets his box down right beside a sfpd officer
it reads asoap box
a harvey steps onto it
a crowd forms
a week ago police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals and to jail
the charges blocking a sidewalk
like a round girl at a boxing match scott parades around a blown up photo from his shopping cart two sf cops dragging let us have our tax money go
for our protection and not our persecution
worry about gun control and not marijuana control
school supplies seniors not what books i read scott displays an old muscle boys magazine
harvey does a well timed take
a few hoots from the eclectic crowd
my fellow degenerates i would like to announce my candidacy for san francisco city supervisor
scott unfurls three hand made milk for city supervisor banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart
we see scott danny jim handing out flyers to a variety of sf citizens gay boys older people chinese people scared straight people heckling high school boys
harvey eagerly approaches anyone and everyone shaking hands if theyll let him reaching out to old people straight people gay people even buttoned down businessmen who cross the street to
try to get away from him
harvey hands out campaign literature to a passersby
public dental care for retired people
legalize pot vote milk
harvey is distracted
a young long haired cleve jones passes
at he looks
harvey tries for his attention hey i like the way your pants fit
where are you from kid
sorry old man not interested
im harvey milk
im running for supervisor
whats your name
jones we should walk up to my camera shop and register you
elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation
is that right
do you trick up on polk street
only half joking if i need the cash
but im selective about my clients
tell me one thing before you get back to work then
what was it like to be a little queer in phoenix
i faked a lung disease to get out of pe
what are you some kind of street shrink
but what im saying is phoenix can change
but we have to start with our street rent control police abuse pot parks seniors
turns to go well good luck with all that
you know what i think cleve jones
that youre gonna get somewhere if you keep talking
that you need to do what youre good at
be a prick
fight city hall
fight the cops
fight the people who made you come here to do what you do
sorry old man im leaving for spain tomorrow
got all the cash i need in my back pocket
a group of cleves friends shout at him to join them
harvey watches him dart across the street to his friends
i didnt come out until very late in life
there was nobody to look up to no hope for a better life
those that did were outcast
and the young ones who did escape home
and who arrive in san francisco and then what
angle on paramedics placing a bloody victim into a body bag
the afruita was walking home with his atricka when they were jumped
reveal harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the street the mans last attempt to call for help
from the victims wallet names robert hillsborough
did you know him
he used to come into my shop
are there any witnesses
just the trick
jerry wasnt a trick
they were lovers
call it what you will
hes our only witness and he says he cant identify the attackers
thered be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe
youre the mayor of castro street now right harvey
you really wanna help
get your people to show some discretion on the streets huh
harveys pov the paramedics pull up the zipper on the body bag
we follow the zipper past the victims bloody hands his torso his face
to hand during the following political meeting
we catch a glimpse of the photos and see naked skin
well it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in san francisco are going to back dianne feinstein and other straight candidates they consider gay friendly
who cares about those old queens
scott is laying down on the big red couch
why isnt my campaign manager leading the meeting
im beat harvey
i passed out flyers for seven hours straight
in the bathhouse
giving it right back people in bathhouses vote
im taking a nap
scott heads up the stairs to their apartment
a customer comes in
danny quickly gathers the revealing photos and puts them back in the envelope
just checking the exposure
that a new boyfriend
hes very cute
taking the photos embarrassed um
to jim so who are these so called gay leaders
and who appointed them
and what are you suggesting jim that im supposed to go and solicit their endorsement
past harvey we see a grandmotherly volunteer thelma opening the mail casually reading a letter then rising and approaching harvey
were down here on the streets trying to help people so where they hell are they
david goodstein is the publisher of the advocate and he has a house a mansion in atherton
clearly shaken harvey you should read this
close on the letter as it goes from thelma to harvey
scott reads the letter
harvey sits very still
harvey milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell a night of horror
you will be stabbed and have your genitals cock balls prick cut off
im calling the police
they probably wrote it
off scotts anxiety hey if somebody tries to kill me ill get the sympathy vote right
could be just the push we need
you think this is funny
look at it
reluctantly harvey takes the letter from scott
its a complete joke
close on the letter someone has drawn a stick figure of harvey being tortured bullets knives fire etc
harvey makes a decision he sticks the drawing to the refrigerator the first thing hell see in the morning
dont do that
if you put it away hide it in a drawer itll just get bigger and scarier
now its there
well see it every day
it cant get us
all this energy
to make yourself a target
and what for
something we have no chance to win
harvey wraps his arms around him
i keep telling you its not just about winning
harvey in his work boots and jeans watches as a large gate slides open allowing his entry
scott even scruffier looking than harvey stands next to him
the top gays in san francisco were david goodstein and his lawyer sidekick rick stokes
david was a
rich old queen whod bought the biggest gay magazine the advocate
he had it delivered to subscribers in brown paper bags so no one would know
thats how he lived his life covered up discreet
harvey and scott are shown to the pool area by a house boy
statues and potted plants and expensive marble
everything shouts good taste
scott strips off his clothes and dives into the pool
harvey has lunch with the gay establishment david goodstein gold and turquoise jewelry and goodsteins protaga rick stokes reserved
rick cant keep his eyes off naked scott in the pool
i worked for a financial institution
i was very discreet
but someone spotted me at the opera sitting in a box next to my lover
and i was fired
thats when i decided to do something
so i bought the advocate
and i use my money and my influence in quiet ways to do what i can
endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us
yes if theyre friendly to our cause
politics is complicated in san francisco and supervisor is a citywide office
political alliances need to be built
you cant simply move here from across the country and run for office
but i am running for office
im on the ballot
i have the union rank and file the seniors and i could use your magazines endorsement
harvey were like the catholic church
we welcome converts but we dont make them pope the same day
and why havent you run
its too early for a gay candidate for supervisor
especially one from the castro
its bad for the communitys image
scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table naked and sopping wet
whats wrong with the castro
nobody works there
its all sex and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own problems
the cops come into our neighborhood and beat us
they turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered
then we file a lawsuit against the city
we go to our political allies in city hall
there are no real gay allies
yes our friends may sense our struggle but they cant feel it
its not life or death for them
we need our own in office
you cant demand acceptance overnight
how can we ask them to respect us if we dont show ourselves some self respect david
the more aouta you make us the more you incite them
step back and quiet down
go back into the closet
is that what youre saying
because i know the closet
i lived in it for more years than i care to remember
rising to go i dont need your endorsement
im not asking anyone for acceptance
i dont have time to ask
for you politics is a game a lark
like putting on a rock festival or staging a love in
youre too old to be a hippie harvey milk
harvey turns around ready for a fight
im not a candidate im part of a movement
the movement is the candidate
theres a difference
you dont see the difference
but i do
getting harvey out thanks for the swim
im sorry i pissed in your pool
a slow motion montage of the citizens of the castro are turning out to vote
young old gay straight
but a weight hangs over the day
when the vote came in on election day
out of candidates vying for seats
we came in th
just a handful short of being the first big eared gay as a three dollar bill cock sucker ever elected to public office
i went for it again in
with just a few
close on harvey looking through a hole in the bottom of a pair of well worn wing tips
he tries them on anyhow
jump to harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit
his hair is cut short his face is shaven clean
its quite a transformation
scott and the old owner lily size him up
the shoes are hideous and i hate your hair
youre not fooling anybody
im not gonna let the pacific heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail
i like it
scott is horrified
harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs from its inner pocket
lily is this from one of my kind
you wont run into the owner
he died in that suit
this isnt sexy harvey
harvey grabs scott kisses him
then playful too bad
no more pot no more bath houses for me and little poo
montage more activity inside and outside the shop
the printing press burns through flyers
we ran and we lost the supervisors race a second time in but with
more votes than ever
so in against everyones advice i really pissed off the democratic political power houses because i ran against their boy art agnos a part of their political machine
and this time we werent running for city supervisor
this time it was bigger california state assembly
its a firestorm of words as harvey debates art agnos
its a racket
its and you still have to be straight white catholic and male to get into the san francisco police force
how many people do you consider enemies harvey
ive counted five already
chuckles flutter through the audience
youre right art
and many are your closest friends
you see i dont think state assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the democrat machine
machines operate on oil and grease
theyre dirty dehumanizing and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator
milk ive worked for years as a social worker in this city
i know sacramento
i know how to get done what we all need done there
tell me mr
right here in the castro robert hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner
the last words he heard were faggot faggot faggot
and you say youre outraged but why wont your liberal establishment return our calls
why wont they bring these murderers to justice
art agnos puts his arm around harvey as they walk out
you know harv your whole raps a real downer
my god youre handsome up close
i cant tell you how much im looking forward to licking you
in the polls
you talk a lot about what youre against
what are you for
in this town you gotta give em a reason for optimism or youre cooked
art gets into his car and goes
harvey has no car
he stops and ponders arts words
they stick with him
scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta struggling to operate in the kitchen that is filled with harveys political entourage and volunteers
he finds harvey jim and dick having an impromptu strategy meeting in the adjoining bedroom
get some union boys in the audience they love me
i cant control whos in the audience
harvey you need to eat something
scott steps back into the kitchen
ladies and gentlemen
our apartment is officially off limits
chases the volunteers out of the kitchen out of his bedroom
down the stairs
time to go
harvey emerges about to intervene
dont say anything
for once harvey keeps his mouth shut
jim and dick sneak past scott sheepishly
when scott and harvey are alone
sit down and eat
harvey and scott eat dinner in tense silence
if you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where youre speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need
ill stab you with my fork i swear to god
i just wanted to say
this is the most delicious meal ive ever eaten in my entire life
harvey gives a warm smile
scott gives a laugh but he looks like hes about to lose it
if we lose this one itll be just me and you again
thats exactly what he needed to hear
harvey walks castros streets alone toward his apartment
a car pulls up behind harvey
a man jumps out of the car and the driver speeds around the block
harvey turns a corner
the man follows
harvey picks up his pace
he searches his pockets for a whistle a weapon and beelines it to his shop his nerves are failing him
he gets to the doorway of his camera store and runs face first into cleve jones
hes not the feisty young kid he met on the street earlier
hes been sitting on harveys steps waiting with wet eyes
off cleves smile we should go inside
harvey locks the door behind them
harvey pours two cups of coffee and delivers one to cleve who is pulled away on the big red couch
you staying up with me
the elections tomorrow
i wont sleep
was he good looking
he was hideous
hard to tell whats worse
with me my boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with
i thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together
guess what cleve jones
youre going to meet the most extraordinary men the sexiest brightest funniest men and youre going to fall in love with so many of them and you wont know until
the end of your life who your greatest friends were or your greatest love was
is that supposed to help
maybe a little
i went to spain last month
in barcelona there was this memorial march for gay people who died under franco
the police tried to break it up
it started a riot
a bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp his wig flew off but he kept fighting
there was blood literally running in the gutter
we could have a revolution here too
but you cant just use the castro to cruise
you gotta fight
you think youll win
winning isnt my strong suit
well i dont do losing
maybe i should run for office and you can work for me
off harveys laugh if you can do it i can do it
can you assemble a thousand people in an hour
all right if i run again youre my man
polls open in hours
lets hit the bus stops
harvey is on the back of a motorcycle
the driver heads up market street
folks stand in voting lines flags outside of polling places
city halls tall dome grows nearer
and we lost that assembly race too which made me a bona fide three time political loser
close on the tv set playing a s orange juice commercial featuring runner up to miss america anita bryant
come to the florida sunshine tree great tasting orange juice naturally orange juice with lots of vitamin c from the florida sunshine tree
harvey is alone in the shop surrounded by remnants of a celebration party that never happened
jim rivaldo lets himself into the store
jim has his maps rolled up under his arm
trying to cheer up harvey we lost but we lost by less
more votes than ever
harvey fake grins i remember when that used to work
i want to show you something
this is remarkable
jim starts laying out his trusty maps color coded with precinct results from that night
the red is where you did best tonight
if we can get the initiative on district elections to pass and we can we can our new supervisors district will go right up market
right around the castro
the district jim outlines is all bright red
if you run for supervisor with this new district its a potential landslide
youll be the first up front gay man elected to major office in the u
i dont know if i have another one in me
but harveys gaze deceives his words
hold on harvey contemplating a fourth run for office
the group gathers around the tv which shows nationwide news clips of anita bryant celebrating her election victory in florida overturning a pro gay statute
a chyron reads landslide defeat for florida gay rights law
tonight the laws of god and the cultural values of man have been vindicated
the people of dade county the normal majority have said enough enough enough
gays in florida can now be removed from their jobs and prosecuted if their deviant lifestyles are uncovered
harveys pov out a window furious gays pour out of the bars blowing whistles raising trash cans
it might turn into a gays cant reproduce so they must recruit young people into their lifestyle
bryant a spokeswoman for the orange juice industry vowed to
bring her campaign to the rest of the country
harveys phone rings
he snatches it up
im sorry sir
i read about you in the paper
i cant talk right sir i think i want to kill myself
you dont want to do that

off the boys tears you wont be alone
there are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you
youre not sick
youre not wrong
god does not hate you
just get on a bus
i cant walk sir
im in a wheelchair
are you there
harvey forces himself to sound calm
its going to be okay
over the phone harvey hears the sound of an adult voice someone finding the boy on the phone then
the line goes dead
its all too much for harvey
theres nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this
harvey is overwhelmed
dick comes upstairs
harvey you better come down
theres gonna be a riot
moving in a daze stunned by the call harvey digs out a bullhorn and heads out
from inside scott watches his lover jumping back in the frey
a weight hangs
he doesnt follow
cleve rushes into the bar on fire with righteous fury and blows a police whistle to get everyones attention
out of the bar and into the streets
anita bryant is coming after you
angry young men mill around the streets their rage building
someone tosses a trash can and it rolls
a policeman in riot gear comes up to harvey
if you cant control em we will
give me permission to march them
surrounded by the massive crowd harvey climbs the large box that covers the subway construction at market and castro
its a stage of sorts
harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips
i know you are angry
i am angry
follow me through the streets of san francisco to share our anger
harvey jumps down and begins walking not sure if the mob will follow
finally they do
cleve catches up
are they following in back
where are we going
i dont know
off cleves concern we have to keep them moving
march them till they drop
we cant have a riot tonight
harvey lifts the bullhorn
he starts a marching chant
the crowd starts following along
jump to gays glare at cops
cops beat their nightsticks against their chests and power poles
anger burns as harvey marches the mob toward city hall
dick and jim catch up
theyre still too hot in back
theyll burn the joint down
help me turn them up van ness
well go all the way to broadway
dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd
harvey continues marching
harvey arrives the crowd still hot
cops beat their nightsticks against their shields
some jab protesters trying to incite a fight
harvey climbs the steps his stage
he lifts his bullhorn
my name is harvey milk
and i want to recruit you
the crowd roars approval
i am here tonight to say we will no longer sit quietly in our closets
we must fight
not just in the castro or san francisco but everywhere the anitas go
anita bryant did not win tonight
anita bryant has brought us together
she is going to create a national gay force
the crowd roars and the young people in richmond minnesota or jackson mississippi or woodmere new york
who are coming out and hearing anita bryant on television telling them that theyre wrong theyre sick that there is no place for them in this great country in this
theyre looking to us for something tonight
his big moment realizing his true mission and i say we have to give them hope
the crowd goes wild
harveys speech crosses the cut to
harvey speaks to the parent teachers united for better schools group
hope for a better world
hope for a better tomorrow
hope for a
better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great
harvey speaks to a hall filled with teamsters
hope for the worker who awakens from the american dream to find that all the jobs have left the country
we gotta give em hope
pan faces of teamsters several minority faces
close on pre lap an intimate tone when san francisco changed the voting rules harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder
they allowed people to elect supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods
a black neighborhood could elect an african american
chinatown could elect a chinese supervisor
and the castro could choose me or rick stokes
but decent art begs for balance right
so little district two miles south of the castro camera moves along the street catching glimpses of churches shops and tidy houses
promised to stay the same as ever
conservative irish catholic and with just the right touch of poetry they found themselves a handsome ex cop
dan white holds a small press conference
his words are fiery but his delivery and stage presence are lacking
im not going to be forced out of san francisco by splinter groups of social radicals social deviants and incorrigibles
you must realize there are thousands upon thousands of frustrated angry people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury that will eradicate the malignancies which blight our beautiful city
harveys suit is laid out
a record turns
wagner blasts from the windows
scott is folding his clothes into a box
evelyn lears in town at the opera house in tannhauser
what if she strolls into the castro for a cocktail
scott keeps packing just one more
we cant let rick stokes take it
let rick have it
nobody thinks youre a fraud here harvey
youre not in new york youre not a closet case asshole anymore
people respect you here
relax for a year
get us back on our feet
if people are ever going to take me seriously i have to win this one
since when did you care if anyone took you seriously
anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps
rick stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to california
i have to be in office to protect us from them
i cant do another one
harvey says nothing ill be back for my sheets
if youre not here ill see you in the shop next week
scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the apartment
harvey not meaning a word if you leave me right now
i can find someone new
youre a catch
harvey is in shock unable to comprehend the loss
unable unwilling to reverse the choice hes made
the entourage is completely caught up in the new campaign cleve jim dick and newcomer michael wong asexual and devoutly political
harvey is ranting ripping down an assembly campaign poster
ring out the old ring in the new
this is over
i dont want to see anything that says fucking assembly
this three time loser faggot is running for supervisor goddamn it
anne kronenberg parks her motorcycle outside walks into the camera shop and plants herself behind harveys desk
cleve mike jim and dick are staring at anne
who the heck is she
suddenly cool our new campaign manager
she called last week to volunteer and i asked her to help
help or take over
what about scott
we need new blood
off their puzzled looks shes a woman
a woman who likes women
odd isnt it
rick stokes isnt pulling out
hes officially filed to run against you
my friend at the advocate says david goodstein is backing him
a gay candidate against a gay candidate
theyll split the gay vote
the straights will divide and conquer
try to find out when theyre going to announce
you replaced scott with a lesbian
anne worked on a recycling campaign up north
shes very organized
how do you know shes not a plant from rick stokes campaign
are you guys always this paranoid
they take after harvey
shouldnt you be doing someones laundry
right after you redecorate my house
pointed at jim rivaldo sir my girlfriends say you guys dont like women
just asking is there a place for us in all this or are you scared of girls
gentleman we already have a tinker bell a lotus blossom jim and dick in your three piece suits
we need someone to manage things
a woman this time
shes the right price and she has bigger balls than any of you
just give me whatevers left over in the register at the end of the day
so should i call the chronicle about getting us an endorsement
off the group of misfits considering the addition
pan off a large rick stokes supervisor district poster to reveal anne kronenberg outside the hall handing milk signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are
flanked by a peeved aid rick stokes rushes out of the lecture hall and confronts anne
young lady you must be confused
this is my night not mr
as pleasant as can be no sir
im harveys new campaign manager
then you should know this race is for district the castro not for all of your lesbian
compadres a tough lesbian kisses anne and stares rick down as she heads in
rick looks uncomfortable around all these women
are we distracting you mr
id hate to screw you up on your big night
dick runs up looking for more fliers
taking rick even more off his game dick is flirtatious
hi rick handsome suit
annie do you have any more hand cards
these people are not from this area
they need to leave
guess where we found them all rick
a slew of them
way up on valencia street
living right there in our district
and you see as it turns out annie here is very very popular with the ladies
dick puts his arm around anne
rick is stupefied
dozens of supporters hold milk for supervisor signs in a long line along market st
waving to commuters
anne walks the long line handing out new signs to arriving volunteers
harvey is handing out flyers
he is exhausted his throat is raw
the campaign is nearly over
a weird moment a boy walks up to harvey and hands him a flier
all sound goes dead on the soundtrack as harveys eyes lock into the boys eyes
harvey reads the flier aunite and fight for dan white
a harvey looks back to pat the boys head but hes gone
he looks to the sidewalk for the kid
harvey is still looking at the flier
anne is leaving with a stack of sf chronicles
cleve comes in pulls one off her stack and looks for the article
theyve accused me of many things but never as blatant a lie as this
first ever newspaper endorsement
reading the article they endorsed you for being a good businessman
has scott read this
hell piss himself
go show him
cleve starts to go
cleve maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with
just in case
im going to the stud
meet me out
his energy is boundless
harvey sits alone watching the bargoers return home through his front window
a bitter sweetness lingers
a couple waves one shouts out gonna win this time milk
they walk on not waiting for an answer
then a drunk cute latino jack lira stops
he stares in at the political ads in the window
harvey watches him sway drunk out of his mind waiting for him to fall
the two make eye contact
jack tries to
harvey picks up a folding chair and walks it out to him
re poster in the window youre more handsome in the posters
where do you live
too drunk to hear flirting palominos are my favorite horse
theyre fast and compact
do you think im more like a palomino or a stallion
jack smiles out of his mind
then he sits falls down into the chair and slides off
harvey stands above the passed out young man
a wounded bird
completely nude jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction allowing harvey to hold him then wriggling away
dancing against harvey then biting his shoulder
lying on the bed then rolling away when harvey tries to hold him
a perfect release for harvey
harvey holds jack after lovemaking
my father beat me when he found out
so i came here
i stay in this mans house
but i dont like him
shh its okay now
no ones ever going to beat you again
a long comforting beat between them
i love you
smiles playful do you even remember my name
a beat jack shakes his head he cant remember harvey
i love you harvey
harvey stands in a voting booth
he goes down the list of names
he finally punches the one next to harvey milk district and pulls the lever
the chads fall
and for the first time in my life it all came together
the union boys the women the seniors the minorities
all of the uss showed up
tv lights blast castro camera
a raucous crowd pours into the streets to greet the roar of motorcycles
anne pulls up with the sheriff on back
harvey is passenger on a second bike
harvey is victorious
he is instantly swarmed
the shop is packed
its a giant celebration party
anne and cleve are working the door
scott smith watches from the crowd outside the shop as rick stokes and david goodstein try to get in
we just want to congratulate him
were all full
seeing harvey inside harvey
its too crowded
jack lira shoves his way toward the door
harvey pulls jack inside right past goodstein and stokes
harvey catches a glimpse of scott outside
but scott fades into the crowd
harvey with jack at his side is pulled back into the party
eyeing jack skeptically the new mrs
i give it a week
the crowd harvey is this all for you
are you this famous
we do this all the time
do you like it
jim is calling out names of the other winners
carol ruth silver
its the most liberal board in years
what about dan white
did he win
well deal with him tomorrow
harvey is doused with champagne
jump to harvey is interviewed by a tv reporter
jack squeezes his way under harveys arm and into the picture
does this mean as many straights are concerned maybe the gays are taking over san francisco
are you going to be a supervisor for all the people
i have to be
thats what i was elected for
i have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people all their problems the problems that effect this city effect all of us
toasts the camera thank you san francisco
set to music in his old brown suit harvey walks to city hall with a crowd of supporters
the familiar faces now include jack lira
on city halls steps mayor moscone swears in harvey
i harvey milk do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of california against all enemies foreign
and domestic and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which i am about to enter and during such time as i hold the office of supervisor city and county of san francisco
a light rain begins to fall
umbrellas go up
anita bryant said gay people brought the drought to california
looks to me like its finally started raining
harvey is emboldened
off a tv in scotts new apartment we see a s
morning show featuring new supervisors harvey milk and dan white
this will be the first time in many years that weve seen so many new faces on the board of supervisors
do you think such diversity will cripple the board
the name of the game on the board is six votes to get anything passed
so like it or not dan and i are now in bed together
the camera reveals scott watching the program
hes been up all night
ive assured harvey here that my brochures comments about social deviants referred more to junkies than to his people
see im about to have my first child
i have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him
the segment over sound assistants help harvey and dan remove their microphones
harvey tries to draw dan in how long were you a fireman dan
a couple of years
and before that
you were a police officer
dan studies harvey suspiciously
whats his point
you have something against cops
they tend to have something against me
seeing dan react uncomfortably but firefighters
now those are true heroes
they supported me in the last campaign
i support them fully
i appreciate it
i meant what i said
id like to work together
dan hesitantly accepts harveys handshake
its a step
cracking a smile ill see you at the office mr
harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and finds cleve in a new suit waiting for the elevator
what do you think of my new theater
a bit over the top
whats with the suit
i got it from a friend
harvey leads cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase
when you come here i want you to wear the tightest jeans possible
never blend in
and no elevators
always take the stairs you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs
harvey leads cleve down the hall of supervisors offices passing dianne feinsteins open door
and street talk only around feinstein
shit goddamn fuck
it bugs the hell out of her
they arrive at his lead aides desk its anne kronenberg
morning annie lets set cleve up on mail
come into my office
harvey walks in
michael and jim are in a strategy session
the first order of business that will come out of this office is a city wide gay rights ordinance
just like the one anita shot down in dade county
what do you think lotus blossom
i think its good
then make it brilliant
i want anitas attention here
in san francisco
i want her to bring her fight to us
this bill needs a unanimous vote
we need headlines
dan white wont vote for this
harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall indicating dan is down there
harvey whispers dans fine
hes just uneducated
we can teach him
dan pops his head into harveys office
harvey committee meets at
oh hi michael jim
to harvey hey did you get the invitation to
my sons christening
i invited a few of the other supes as well
ill be there
all smiles dan leaves
cleve mocks him
off mike wongs expression that was bizarre
are you going
ill let him christen me if hell vote for my gay rights ordinance
we need allies
we need everyone
the neighborhood is booming
storefronts and sidewalks filled
this is not the rundown castro that harvey moved into years ago
harvey heads home greeted by his proud constituents
he stops at the camera shop when he notices a broken window near the side entrance to his apartment
harvey rushes up the stairs into his apartment and finds jack lira lighting a candle on the table which has been set for a lovely romantic dinner
welcome home harvey
i hope youre hungry
i only know how to cook one thing but i make it good
i asked the boy downstairs to let me in
he wouldnt let me in
so i came in this way
your friends arent very nice to me
avoiding the fight i have a town hall meeting tonight jack
you work too hard
im sorry about your window
ill fix it tomorrow
turning on the charm are you surprised
jack i have to go
i have an invitation to a party tomorrow
lots of rich people politicians
we could get all dressed up
jack turns up the music takes harveys hands and guides him through a simple dance
so i could be the first lady
i watched tv here today
i saw all my children
they killed margo
i knew it was going to happen
they try and trick you but it never works
enjoying this you always see it coming
killing the blonde
im good with that
gets slow sensual i think now the old lady is going to have an affair
then shell get killed or married
always one or the other
dead or married
jack starts dancing with harvey again
its sweet intimate
if i make you a key you wont break my windows again right
the dance lesson is a lovely distraction
harvey wont be going back to work tonight
harvey watches water pour over an infant boy
he tries hard to feel comfortable but hes the only jew and likely the only gay man at dans childs baptism
dan looks to harvey the proud father
harvey and dan have pulled themselves away
im proposing a citywide ordinance
it ensures that a person who already has a job cant be fired for their orientation
im not sure my constituents would favor that
dan looks over to his wife and newborn son
is anyone else here from the board
youre the only one who showed up i think
were you christened here
my grandma immigrated here when this was an irish catholic city
the city of st
a lots changed here since then
youre more like one of us now
youre not like most homosexuals are you harvey
do you know a lot of homosexuals
smiles then say where do you stand on the psychiatric center the citys been pushing into my district
well id have to study it
getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform
it only attracts arsonist rapists all that you know
a campaign promise
a big one
what do you say we watch out for each others interests
id like that
id like that too dan
mary ann white approaches with their child
its awkward as if shes walked in on something intimate
slipped into some shop talk
the gay rights ordinance
seems an inappropriate subject in here dont you think
hey dont knock it till youve tried it
his attempt to break the tension goes down in flames
she cracks a polite smile
theyre from very different worlds
harvey is under pressure from his own advisors michael dick cleve to vote against dans bill
supervisors silver and lau are asking you to vote to keep this psychiatric center in dans district
itll go down to if you vote to get rid of it
its a youth campus harvey
these are kids that would be displaced from their families if its moved
i cant just dump dan
the guys got nothing going for him
here we go harvey to the rescue
isnt it enough we have to put up with jack
he registered voters last week
so do any of your volunteers but you dont make them all first lady
what does dan white do for you
he intrigues me
i think he may be one of us
cleve camps it up dear god say it aint so
its just a theory
you just think hes cute
i know what its like to live that life
you can see it in dans eyes
the fear the pressure
anne kronenberg walks in
shes got that look in her eyes
good or bad
state senator john briggs is anita bryants go to guy in california for sure
hes filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them
a pall falls over the room
this is worse than expected
how many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot
he can get them in two sundays at church in orange county
instead of fear excitement bubbles up this means the fights coming here where we can do something about it
wichitas one thing kansas city
but anitas heading for san francisco
shes not going to know what hit her
this is the fight weve been waiting for
ca state senator john briggs delivers his message to the press the tv crews and a mass of protesters
harvey and his group are amongst the crowd
my proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles including the ones who
do it in our public schools
its time to root them out
in the crowd is teacher tom ammiano colorful worked up and how are you going to determine whos a homosexual
sir my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals
will you be sucking them off
sir you can argue with me but you cannot argue with god
its getting ugly fast
briggs is whisked away by two officers
he trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up
dans house is filled with relatives for a birthday celebration
dan is glued to the news watching briggs
dans relatives gather around the tv
mary ann puts their baby into dans arms and returns to wrangling kids
look what happened in germany
now anita bryant already says that jews and muslims are going to hell you know shes got a shopping list
we are not going to let john briggs or anita bryant legislate bigotry in this city
hold on dan watching harvey on tv
cleve and anne sit in the entry way cleve in his tight jeans and shirt
hes very out of place amongst all the suits
harvey walks in
cleve and anne rush to his side
david goodstein and rick stokes turn to greet milk
harvey doesnt stop
your boyfriend is in the closet
excuse me david
the latino hes locked himself in the coat room
milk phil burton is here
hes likely the next speaker of the house and a much needed ally against prop six
we dont need a scene
harvey is at the door
jack is locked inside the room
youre right i know i was late by twenty minutes
im sorry jack
who were you with
i was at work
come out sugar pea
you embarrassed me
i didnt know anyone
these are not good people
i dont want to be here
then go home jack
ill wait for you
a tight smile from harvey as he looks up to cleve
harvey cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room for a meeting with the democratic party establishment
congressman phil burton leans on a desk listening
the briggs initiative is polling at percent for approval statewide
percent in other polls
some even have us losing san francisco
condescending to cleve so its important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this or well have riots and only increase this backlash
good point david
lets just roll right over
make it easier for briggs to fuck us up the ass
rick and david are horrified
phil burton rises above it passing out copies of his new anti briggs initiative flier
were taking this very seriously in my office
we want to send one of these to every home in california
well need money to do that
reading the flier proposition six is an affront to human rights
an invasion of the state into the private lives of california citizens
points to the pictures does it even say the word gay on this thing
no harvey purposefully not
with the heat bearing down on your movement right now we think its best to dodge the gay bullet
go for the human rights angle
people need to know whos affected
this flier needs at least one old queen on it
a dig to goodstein why dont you volunteer for that david
an olive branch corey wares is an out gay
cutting rick him off this is shit
shit and masturbation
its a cowards response to a dangerous threat
a beat then i think you should leave
in the face of phil burton most the others seem to agree
harvey puts phil burtons flyer in the fireplace on his way out of the room
harvey knocks on the coat check door
jack its time to go
to cleve get everyone together
i want young people women fresh heads
fighters and organizers not politicians
as if jack cant spell what about s c o t t
off harvey knowing scott would be an asset
jack opens the door and grabs harveys hand
harveys clan is assembled jim dick mike cleve anne jack denis along with fiery teacher tom amiano and many a handsome pizza delivery guy is setting down boxes of pizzas
theyre in for the night
the atmosphere is degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting
were not interested in working with those old democratic party shits
the door opens and someone new enters
hes holding the hand of
they are obviously a new couple
scott and his boyfriend find a place on the floor
harveys and scotts eyes meet across the room
but we cant afford infighting anymore cleve
we have to bring together every group
even the old school democrats
taking over is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy or are we just gonna stare
people start chipping in for the handsome pizza guy
if were gonna convince the to give a shit about us
we have to let em know who we are
his big new idea everybodys coming out
the entire state
no matter where they live
come out come out wherever you are
beat the room gets quiet were going to tell everyone in the state to come out
every gay doctor lawyer teacher dog catcher
we have to leave the ghetto let all those people out there know that they do know one of us
and if people wont step out of the closet we open the door for them
the whole state is not san francisco
it could be dangerous
there is such a thing as a right to privacy
privacys our enemy
you want real political power
lets tell the truth for a change
if theres anybody in this room right now who hasnt told their families their friends their employers
my folks know already
the room is silent
dick looks ill
i havent told my father yet
a beat then people vote two to one for us if they know just one of us
cleve show dick where you keep your phone
its in the bedroom
after a moment dick rises and follows cleve out of the room
people are stunned by harveys outrageous demand
harvey sees scott glaring at him
the meeting is breaking up and scott lets his new boyfriend go ahead
harvey ducks away from jack and intercepts scott
i thought you were done with politics
not the movement
what the hell was that in there
the movement needs people to be up front
why were you fighting me
you were the biggest closet case alive in new york
you told me and all your boyfriends to keep our
you were the hypocrite in there
my parents are gone
my brother knows
im sure they knew
i had to listen to your phone calls home to mom
hear you deny that i existed
you want to be normal as bad as any of us
more than any of us
those are kids in there
youre asking them to lose their families
if their families wont love them for who they are who they really are then they should lose them
thats fucking insane
re scotts new boyfriend whos he
do you live together
someone im seeing
hes good for me
he makes me stay home at nights out of the bars
quietly so jack doesnt hear i miss you
oh harvey dont
eyeing jack down the street whats that about
calling out har veyyyyy
he needs me
thats always been harveys achilles heal
he walks away from harvey leaving him alone
dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman
i have told no lies here supervisor milk you will today or to supervisor white come to order
in the past i want it noted that i never promised to back moving any mental health centers
i greatly respect supervisor white but i would like his remarks stricken
we will take a recess before recording the vote
fellow supervisor carol ruth silver leans over to harvey
thank you harvey
harvey is preoccupied with dan approaching
he leans back
can i have a moment with harvey
alone please carol
she politely recognizes the tension and gets up
why are you turning on me like this at the last minute
what did i do
i didnt have all the details
ill help you craft a different version that doesnt displace any kids
harvey i cant go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this
dont do this
im getting a lot of pressure dan
you strung me along
and now youre throwing me to the wolves
you only need one more vote dan
there are other supervisors you could convince besides me
dan grabs harvey
a new side of dan
ill vote against your queer law
ill get quentin against it
itll still pass
you cant keep alienating yourself here dan
i gave you a chance harvey
i really did
you blew it
you really blew it
dan goes the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit
harveys mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder
across the country a handful of city councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people against discrimination
but anita bryant and her right wing christian fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash
now she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances
while we were preparing for the battle against briggs and prop six anita bryant was taking her show on the road
sweeping the country
her next stop was wichita kansas
chyron landslide wichita says no to gays
anita talks to a reporter
briggs is among the supporters at her side
i give thanks for all of our foot soldiers of god here in wichita
but we must push on
look what happened to sodom and to the world of noah
onward christian soldiers
lifting her hand with on to california
a telephone tree montage starts with cleve on a pay phone on castro street hi
were losing wichita
market and castro
a multiplying frame effect the person he called calls two others they call four then more and more as the tree grows
harveys pov on the violent death threat letter and drawing that is still tacked up to his refrigerator
outside the sounds of a riot in the making
harvey rips down the threatening letter and throws it away
harvey bounds down the stairs and into the shop
cleve rushes into the store breathless
i dont know where but
did jim call the press
shouting at danny get out there with your camera
press is covered
but we dont have a permit to march
digs for his bullhorn when i got coors out of the bars the union gave me this
i want you to have it
what do i do with this
youre an activist
off cleve unsure march those people up to the front doors of city hall
when it looks really bad the citys first gay supervisor will come out and play peacemaker
we save the city from a riot
we can turn this night into more political power for the cause
i cant do it like you do it
i wont always be here
somebody else will have to take over
looking him in the eye i need you to be the scary one now
a massive angry crowd has gathered
baby faced cleve takes a makeshift stage
he lifts the bullhorn and with nerves reads a speech
its pages blow about
cleves pov harvey watches from afar
forty years ago tonight the gay citizens of germany found out they no longer had civil rights
tomorrow morning the gay citizens of wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights
you have whistles
you use them when we have been attacked
tonight we have been attacked
initially cleve is successful but then the crowd turns marching toward city hall without him
cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd to get to the front
he gets on his walkie talkie
get the press to the overpass
on harvey ducking through empty streets trying to get ahead of the crowd and beat them to city hall
cleve gets to the head of the crowd
charging up what are you doing
were shutting down traffic both directions
cleve looks up at the press thats arrived on the overpass above and turns to two hippie kids near the front
disconnect the power arms
the boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms
the press snaps photos
the angry protesters march past the large glass windows of twin peaks bar
unlike the dade county march the bar is empty
the patrons are already in the streets
harvey races to his office
he stops at a mirror to straighten his tie and collect himself
outside the sound of the angry mob on city halls front steps
civil rights or civil war
someone throws a rock at the city hall doors
harvey rushes out the front doors pushing past the police to greet the mob on city halls front steps
through the glass doors we see cleve rush up and hand harvey his bullhorn hello
my name is harvey milk and i want to recruit you
an enormous cheer rises i want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the anita bryants and john briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry
we have a choice to make
the fight is at our doors
we must either go back in the closet and shut it tight or fight
that if we continue to fight we
jim dick anne michael frank and cleve are all in the office
the front page of the examiner features a picture of cleve and harvey arm in arm on city halls steps
cleve is jazzed
theyre calling it a successful mediation
youre a god damn hero
it came this close to a riot

your job is just to say into that bullhorn what theyre all feeling
youre just jealous it wasnt you out there

harvey steps away hot pensive
anne gets quiet
every papers calling prop six the main event now
we lose this well have anti gay laws in all fifty states and briggs wont return our calls for a public debate
hes ignoring us to death
steaming back in we need something populist
whats the number one complaint about city life
the piss smell in the tenderloin
if you cleaned up all the dog shit in the city you could be elected mayor
i like it
cleve searches frantically for something
he sees a pile of dog poop
he scoops it up and runs it back to city halls front lawn and plants it in the grass
in the very same spot cleve just was harvey with a clump of reporters a red and white no on button pinned to his lapel henceforth its a fixture
dog mess is a hazard and on top of that its disgusting
under the ordinance dog owners that dont clean up can be fined
this really is the bottom line
he smiles at his own joke punctuating it by accidentally stepping in cleves well placed dog shit
a big grin
these flashes transition into harvey studies his own photo on the front page of the chronicle making his announcement about dog poop
the supervisors are assembled for a vote
the clerk wraps up his roll call supervisor lau

moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen
harvey leans over him
the press captures the moment
dan sits at his desk agitated
dans pov the front page of the examiner featuring moscone and harvey
harvey comes to the door
what are you working on dan
if you have something to discuss you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide
listen i know youre disappointed about the psychiatric center
what else do you have coming up
now you need something from me
you want my me to join in with the queers on this prop six business
we prefer the word gay dan
just as im sure you prefer the word irish american to mick
harvey our society cant exist without the family without the church
were not against those things
can two men reproduce
a smile no
but we keep trying
youre channeling anita and briggs

you introduce an initiative for supervisor pay raises
anything but that its a bad time politically
i have an election next year
you asked for something
introduce pay raises
i cant take care of my family on our salaries
you dont have that problem do you
dans aide steps into the doorway
she seems surprised to see harvey in dans office
milk youll excuse me i have a development meeting
a crowd sings ahappy birthday
a one after another harveys guests throw cream pies in his face
rick and david goodstein included
a peace offering
harvey wipes pie from his eyes

scott wipes pie cream from harveys jacket
i remember when your birthdays were a bit less
who invited you
my boyfriend got an invitation
i was his plus one
it was a tough ticket to get
congratulations to you
looks like youre part of the machine now
harvey looks away toward jack you can do better
when i come home to jack i dont have to talk politics or talk intelligently
or even talk
and wheres an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man right
youre not so old
you look handsome
looks like youre gonna make it to fifty after all mr
scott gives harvey a birthday kiss
harvey still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket waits for jack to come out of the rest room
harveys one of the last guests to leave
waiters are clearing tables
approaches footsteps echoing on the marble floor
harvey braces himself
emerging from the shadows dan white
he approaches harvey with a bottle of chivas
dan is super friendly as if nothing unpleasant has ever happened between them
sorry i missed the party harv
no problem dan
good to see you
its a good one
but its a real problem
i mean god knows how many problems it causes
all kinds of diseases birth defects probably i mean stuff you cant even
drifting off drunkenly hey i got you a little something
you didnt have to at the same time you didnt have to why do people always say that
you didnt have to
i mean of course right
but thats what they always say
they always say things like that
dans attempts to be witty and erudite like harvey only leave him confused and tongue tied
harvey has no idea why dan is here
are you okay dan
harvey i just
i just want to say
dan puts his arms around harvey for a sort of macho but really weird birthday hug
harvey stiffens its such a peculiar moment
dan steps back looks him over
ive really learned a lot from watching you harvey
i doubt that
no i have
you gotta get out there
thats how it works
but you have an issue
thats your advantage
its more than an issue dan
a beat one last try to get through to him dan
ive had four relationships in my life
three of those four tried to kill themselves
i know it was my fault they did it
i told them to stay quiet
most of my life ive been closeted
thats what living this life is like for most of us
the way things are
this isnt just about our jobs or any issue its our lives were fighting for
jack emerges from the bathroom barely together and leans on harvey
dan steps back from harvey and jack his moment alone stolen away
ive learned a lot from you harvey
im going to get my picture in the papers too
ive got my own issue
dan whites got an issue
stock footage along market street people have shown up for the parade many holding signs naming their hometowns newark san antonio lincoln
a montage of the various marchers floats parents and friends of high camp drag queens etc
harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck a fistful of white flowers in one hand and in the other a hand written sign
im from woodmere ny
to a news camera come out
just come on out
driving the car anne keeps a close eye on the parade watchers
any one of them could be an assassin
i see naked men walking around naked women walking around which doesnt bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity but its not proper
we wouldnt allow it for any other parade in san francisco and it should not be allowed for the gay parade
just off stage
anne hands him a typed postcard
it came in the mail today
you get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone
looking for a silver lining looks like the publicitys working
you dont have to go up there
it could happen any day any night any time
off the roaring crowd thats waiting for him the nations eye is on us
i have to do this
jump to pov shots of cops and loners amongst the massive audience hint at harveys paranoia
like diving off a cliff harvey launches up to the microphone
the deafening cheers surely would have drowned
out gunfire but when it fades hes standing
he delivers his impassioned call to action my name is harvey milk and i want to recruit you
i want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy
brothers and sisters you must come out
come out to your parents
i know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth
come out to your friends if they indeed are your friends
come out to your neighbors to your fellow workers
once and for all break down the myths destroy the lies and distortions
for your sake
for their sake
for the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from dade to eugene
on the statue of liberty it says give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to be free
in the declaration of independence it is written all men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights
briggs and mrs
bryant and all the bigots out there no matter how hard you try you cannot erase those words from the declaration of independence
no matter how hard you try you cannot chip those words from off the base of the statue of liberty
that is what america is
love it or leave it
he scans the crowd as he steps off stage
a bit surprised to still be alive
cleve grabs him
the mayor says briggs is on his way here
he could intercept him for us
we could get him face to face
he couldnt ignore us anymore
get the press
john briggs rides in a limo watching the afreaks outside
as he nears the parade stages his police escorts take an unplanned turn
he leans forward
the parade is the other direction
theyre taking us another way sir
the limo pulls in
briggs cautiously steps out
greeting him are moscone the police chief sfpd officers a gaggle of press and harvey milk
its a showdown
i have a right to be here mr
im afraid its not in the interest of your safety or my publics safety to let you into that parade grounds
finally face to face harvey extends his hand
its a show for the flashing cameras
briggs is clearly uncomfortable
hi im harvey milk
its quite an honor to meet you mr
sad youre too afraid to fight this out in public mr
i would love to have a public debate
im very interested in the details of your argument
you know the details
as do the people
look at the votes across this nation
the public is with me
yes sir today they are
but with my citys mayor and the san francisco press as my witnesses im challenging you to a public debate
john nods stiff
he can no longer avoid harvey milk
he gets back in his limo
harvey sits with john briggs at a table facing forward
we hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience
senator as a christian its interesting that you dont seem to understand what christ was about
he was about accepting people and giving love not carrying a bible in one hand and hatred in the other
cheers from the audience now all the gay myths have been shattered all the fears all the not in my mind they havent thats it
in your mind they havent and im wondering why mr
milk we dont allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children and the reason we dont is because it is illegal
but its not illegal to be a homosexual in california
and your law goes even further
any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired true
but gay people dont have children of their own
if they dont recruit our children theyd all die away
thats why they want to be teachers to encourage our children to join them
how do you teach homosexuality
i was born of heterosexual parents i was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society
so then why am i homosexual
and no offense meant but if it were true that children mimicked their
teachers youd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around
the audience eats it up
it feel like the harvey milk show
briggs makes a statement to the press
if theyre going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a gun salute every time somebody goes by them those people are going to be in
danger of being removed their job
continuing on with his recorded will
we were really genuinely frightened by proposition six and with the backlash gaining strength we were very pessimistic
we didnt think there was any chance we could beat it
what we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose there would be a revolt
that all hell would break lose
harvey pacing decisive
people are coming out though
we met with groups in bakersfield redding a dozen people showed up in a library basement in fresno asking for our support if they came out
last sunday the reverend of st
marys came out to his entire congregation
were still losing to
we have to take the show on the road
call briggss office
do a press release
tell them he can pick the town the audience and ill ask our supporters not to attend
their audiences are insanely devout
well get killed
get me orange county
jack is flipping out storming around the place
you just have to go down to la and guess the right things on tv and theyll pay us
you have to use your fame now while you have it
we could have nice things
i dont have time to do game shows right now
this stops jack cold
you are horrible
i have worked on this surprise for you for weeks
are you drunk right now
you are an ungrateful asshole
jack ill have more time soon
youre ashamed of me
thats not true
i think youre smart
no matter what your family or your father said
i believe in you
we should figure out something for you to do
i could get you a job
ill never be good enough for you
jack throws a piece of pottery at harvey
it misses crashing through the window onto the street below
ill get a broom
jack collapses into a chair
tv cameras roll
theyve gotten their orange county debate
briggss supporters jeer harvey as he rips into their state senator
their vehemence frightens dick in the audience
harvey lifts a briggs flier
if in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue why do you put out literature that hammers it home why do you play on that
myth and fear
same thing with vd harvey we put out publications about vd so you can avoid it
with a grin but youve even admitted that theres more molestation in the heterosexual group
so why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers
boos from the conservative audience
we are not talking about homos
child molestation the fact is at least percent of the people are heterosexual
if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out you know what wed have no teachers wed have no teachers no child molestation
so youre saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation
getting more lost no no im not saying that at all
thats what you just said
im saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so lets cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group harvey laughs in disbelief
at the asinine argument
briggs looks down to his notes lost
harvey takes the opportunity to rip into the state senator directly to briggs sir in your own drive for personal power how many careers are you willing to see destroyed
how many lives will you destroy in your lust for power and when will you stop
the crowd boos rails
this isnt san francisco its orange county
in the audience dick pabich sweats taken aback by the level of hatred
harvey tries to maintain his composure
harvey heads home from work
he starts into his store
he sees jack liras shadow through the curtains upstairs and turns instead to the cafe next door
harvey sits down at the bar
the waiter pours a coffee for him
harvey looks up to the tv
harveys pov dan white on tv talking to a news reporter
it feels as if dan is talking directly to harvey
all im really saying is if we dont protect ourselves with this kind of legislation a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching
and they cant refuse to hire him
harvey rushes from a packed session in the supervisors chambers to his office
anne is behind him
he picks up the phone
it seems urgent
hey jack whats wrong
i just want to know when youll be home
you just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance
did you do this on purpose jack
its poop harvey
arent i more important than poop
i dont know when ill be home
harvey hangs up
his patience is slipping
he looks up in time to see dan heading down the hall with his briefcase
harvey catches up to dan who is on his way out
hows the baby
you didnt bring up supervisor pay raises
in fact i heard you plan to publicly oppose them
i heard you planned to vote against them too dan
were you trying to set me up
its not a good time for me to bring it up
dan theres a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement give me that and ill consider backing pay raises
suddenly very dark i dont trade votes
unlike you the way i was raised we believe in right and wrong
moral and immoral
black skin and white in your police department
dan steams dan even ronald reagans come out against proposition six
youre looking more and more out of touch
if i come out against prop six its only for the invasion of states rights issue
smiles trying to lighten and the potential witch hunts against you straight people right
dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response
his behavior is alarming
he sets down his briefcase
you underestimate me milk
youre very very wrong about me
i dont know what you mean
dan is on the verge of tears hot angry tears
what is it dan
you can tell me
you cant humiliate me
and you will not demean me
anne appears down the hall
dan has more on his mind but the moment has passed
he picks up his briefcase and walks out of the building
off harvey concerned
harvey walks home
a passerby shouts youre the asshole that just passed that dog shit thing arent you
what the hell do you have against dogs
with his trademark charm sir blind people cant see shit
what the heck do you have against blind people
the young folks surrounding the passerby laugh and hoot at harveys joke
even the harassing passerby cant help but crack a grin
opening the door harvey finds a trail of voter registration cards anti briggs literature and coors beer cans
pushing through his fear he carefully follows the cans and flyers up the stairs and through his apartment
odd notes are taped to the walls
they all lead to a black velvet curtain with a note attached youve always loved the harvey pulls back the curtain to find jacks body cold and discolored hanging from
a beam by a noose
harvey cant move
he is mesmerized
he grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting jack down
he cuts through the rope and falls to the floor with the heavy scott arrives
sitting very still harvey is being consoled by cleve and anne
tears in his eyes harvey wont look up
look at me
look at me
you did everything you could
no i didnt
what else could you have done
i could have come home at six oclock not six fifteen
scott puts his arm around harvey
harvey buries his head
anne helps cleve take down jacks many hidden notes
cleve quietly reads a prominently placed one beware
into the recorder as if re living the event over again
jack was gone
i didnt have time to mourn
there was no choice but to keep on
to keep fighting
harvey sits in a make up chair
a make up artist is painting him up to look like a clown
several other city officials are in chairs beyond him
harvey turns to the make up artist
with sincere enthusiasm thank you for this great honor
but do you think once the magazine is done snapping pictures maybe i could keep the suit for a while
still made up from head to toe as a clown harvey walks the streets of san francisco
he waves smiles poses for photos with tourists
its a rare moment of grace
he jumps on a trolley headed toward castro
he instantly captures the imagination of a small girl wearing a knit hat
re their hats would you like to trade with me
what the heck are you
im an elected official
i run this city
he makes a show of it
he hands her the flower hes been holding onto all afternoon
this is the moment
harvey watches aides on the phones comb districts for voting results
jim fills up a map on the wall
san bernadino is coming in
of course not
how not good
same in fresno
dear god little lotus blossom
harvey is stunned
other districts follow with similar results
they go up in red on the map
imperial is for so far
put it up on the board
harvey tries to stomach this major defeat loss after loss
he starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot
cleve comes up to harvey concerned
the whole world is watching this
this is san francisco were about to lose
are you ready
i can have people in an hour
but theres gonna be riots if this thing passes
darkens pointed there goddamn better be
stops a beat then what are you telling me
i cant say it because im a public official but for gods sake if this thing passes fight back
cleve is stunned holding the weight of harveys words
harveys focus is interrupted when anne brings him the phone
don amador down in la
reluctantly answers kind of a bad time don
no sir this is paul
don just gave me the phone
you talked to me on the phone a year or so ago
im from minnesota
im in a wheelchair
reveal the boy in his wheelchair on the other end
a beat to take it in then i thought you were a goner paul
i should have called
when i read in the paper that you won the supervisor seat i got a friend to put me on a bus to la
who did you know in los angeles
thats the uh
i just didnt want to die anymore sir
harveys at a loss for words i met your friend don down here
i voted today against prop six
thank you mr
you did this all by yourself
i dont think id be alive right now without you sir
you were right about la
its like gay disney world
then you have to see san francisco
don wanted me to um
congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight
harvey turns back to the map
jim rivaldo is now coloring in la county with green
on the other end of the phone harveys friend in la don amador is back on the line
it looks like weve taken la county harvey
i gotta go don
frantic to the room la by put it up
put it up
the tone in the room is changing
jim storms up
the polls were off
briggs is going down by more than to
the only district where its leading in san francisco is dan whites
harvey takes a moment to absorb the map
anne dick jim all the volunteers
what this apparent win means to him to his people
to cleve well crap cleve now what are we going to do tonight
re a giant jock strap wearing lady liberty cover up lady liberty
the cameras will be coming our way
tv cameras roll
lady liberty is covered with a no on six poster
a brass band marches dramatically into the hall
harvey mounts the stage to incredible cheers
to the gay community all over this state
my message to you is
so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition six and now we owe them something
we must destroy the myths once and for all shatter them
we must continue to speak out
and most importantly most importantly every gay person must come out
tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us
and now that they do they see we are not sick
they can feel we are not wrong
and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world
a message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there
to all those afraid of this wave of hate
to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns
tonight we know there is a place for us
my brothers and sisters
we can come home again
the crowd goes wild
moscone walks up onto stage and lifts harveys hand
harvey is now a member of the s
cleve watches from afar as harvey steps off and disappears into the crowd
dan watches harveys victory speech on the local news
the party behind him harvey scans the block
cleve catches up looking at harvey probing whats the matter
you ever heard of sore losers
well im a sore winner
i thought we were goners
id started looking forward to the riots
i told you i dont do losing
i think maybe were best with our backs to the wall
its too quiet
a new idea whats next i think we should march on washington d
milk youre a decent politician a mediocre businessman but youre a lousy gay man
harvey knows what hes getting at take some time off
fiftys right around the corner
a devilish grin nobody will want you after that
i can handle d
smiles incredulous the people voted for us cleve jones
theres nowhere to march tonight mr
lets go back inside
turning back they savor the moment like father and son walking to castro camera growing ever smaller in the frame
dan white slides a sealed letter across a desk to an aide
its addressed to moscone
he seems oddly calm
could you give this to the mayor for me
as soon as possible
harvey walks down the hallway to his office a spring in his step
there are nods hellos if not outright deference from most passersby
his newfound political muscle is evident
he comes face to face with dan white
i just resigned
im sure youre pleased
harvey doesnt know what to say
dans right it does make him happy
but its not that simple
youll be the next president of the board
im sure we could work together dan walks away from harvey
he doesnt want to hear anything harvey has to say
harvey watches as dan is met in the hallway by an officer from the police officers association
just got word
can we talk to you for a minute
dan heads for his office
the association meeting room
harvey watches as dan follows the officer down the stairs to an association meeting room on the next floor
when the door opens harvey sees several representatives from the police department wearing somber expressions
it looks as if dan is about to get reamed out
actual footage channel reporting from dan whites street most people were surprised when dan white quit last friday citing financial difficulties
now weve heard that white is asking for his supervisor job back
but many say harvey watching on the small tv set in his office
white gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements
the news story transitions in the b
as harvey gets up
the city of san francisco is in disbelief
four hundred bodies have been found thus far in jonestown guyana
leader of the peoples temple jim jones
harvey heads to dans office
he toys with the nameplate
something bittersweet lingers
he walks in
harveys pov on city halls lawn dan is with the press
he looks up seeing harvey in his office window
they make eye contact
it bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost
with adolescent frustration in evidence dan is with his wife the press and a few supporters
it was a major decision on friday that i had to come
to arrive at
but since that time people unknown to me plus my family and friends have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office that they support
so im asking the mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people
harvey is firm his hands planted on the mayors desk
he gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the police officers association and comes out demanding his job back
what do you think they promised him
or worse how did they threaten him
a man has the right to change his mind
give me some peace
how many of our propositions has dan shut down
we could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense
cement rent control
its his vote on this board that stands in our way
i get it harvey
ive been lobbied all week
let me just remind you that youre up for re election
if you re appoint dan you lose the gay vote
they listen to me
you wont get elected dog catcher
stern silent a beat then ill make my decision on monday
as harveys on his way out with a wry grin you know what you sounded like just now
boss tweed or mayor daly
returns the smile a homosexual with a bit of power
rather scary isnt it mr
hes come a long way
harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled darkened opera house next to brazilian opera star bidu sayao
hes enraptured by a production of tosca
on stage its o scarpia we shall meet before god
refusing to be taken prisoner tosca jumps from the walls of the castle set to her death
mary ann offers the phone to dan
dan takes it
into the phone yes
this is dan white
im barbra taylor from kcbs
im interested in your reaction
ive received information from the mayors office that you wont be getting your job back
i dont know anything about that
dan hangs up on her
harvey cant sleep
he dials the phone
he lets it ring and ring
finally a voice picks up on the other line
reveal scott half asleep
sorry to wake you up
i went to the opera tonight
guess who my date was
bidu sayao herself
she was in the first puccini i ever saw
the crowd went wild
it was like i was young again seeing my first live opera
if you go to the opera again you should call me
scott gets out of bed considers his words
id go with you
id like that
harvey is quiet a rare moment of reflection
an unexpected tear rolls down his cheek
look out the window the suns coming up
you should get some sleep
i dont want to miss it
harveys single word answer means life
off harvey neither wants to hang up the phone
the sun rising in his own living room dan white has been up all night too
the coffee table is covered with coke cans and junk food wrappers
waiting for a man inside to turn away dan sneaks in through a side window at city hall
the man calls after him hey wait a minute mr
my aide was supposed to come down here and let me in the side door but she never showed up
and you are
im dan white
we follow dan down the hall and into the grand entry way
harvey walks through city halls metal detectors
he picks up his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase
like ships in the night harvey just misses dan exiting the elevator
dan heads into mayor moscones office
with dianne harvey is thrilled rubbing it in
whos it gonna be
is he replacing dan with that god damned liberal lefty don horanzy
thatll really shake up the board huh
all i know is that were getting a new supervisor today
if dan shows up just avoid him
we dont need a scene today right harvey
grins ear to ear heaven forbid dianne
the mayors secretary sits at her desk
shouting can be heard from inside his office
moscone leads dan white to the bar beside his office
dan is enraged
moscone lights a cigarette
you cant take this away from me
moscone has his back turned pouring them cocktails
the issue is whats fair for the people of your district
take some time off
spend it with your family
moscone finishes pouring two cocktails and turns to see dan white brandishing his revolver
moscones secretary and a waiting man note the three dull thuds not so different than a backfire
the secretary looks out the window concerned
the waiting man checks his watch
still gripped in his hand moscones cigarette burns a hole in his tie
dan walks past dick pabich past diannes office
harveys voice can be heard down the hall
he sounds up beat this time next year were marching on washington d
itll look like market and castro but with a million people
write that down
tell president carter were coming after him next
im going to deposit this
ill be back in minutes
dan arrives at harveys office door
harvey is with a friend preparing to leave surprised to see dan in his doorway
say harve can i see you for a minute
dan walks harvey down the hall to his old office
harvey walks in first
dan stays between harvey and the door
dan closes it
harvey smiles sensing something is off
dan draws his revolver
harvey raises his hand
the bullet rips through harveys hand and down his arm
n dan fires again silencing harveys cry for help
harvey turns away
another bullet rips into his chest and he falls to his knees now facing the window
he staggers toward it
the moment is extended as we see harveys pov of the opera house outside the window and the castro beyond it
hold on harvey gazing out at his beloved city
dan puts his revolver to the back of harveys head
and just like that harvey falls
last week i got a phone call harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder
from altoona pennsylvania and the voice was quite young and the person said
youve got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know theres hope
hope for a better world
scott and anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service
most of the seats are empty
the speaker is unfamiliar some appointed city official
finally crumbling tears roll where is everybody
didnt anyone give a damn
harvey speaking into the tape recorder
i ask this
if there should be an assassination i would hope that five ten one hundred a thousand would rise
i would like to see every gay lawyer every gay architect come out walking back out onto the street anne and scott turn to look down market street the camera
pans and drifts to reveal
thousands of san franciscans of every religion nationality sexuality all of the familiar faces and many new ones
they all march silently up market street to the palace harvey dreamed could be his own city hall
if a bullet should enter my brain let that bullet destroy every closet door
and thats all
i ask for the movement to continue
because its not about personal gain not about ego not about power
its about the uss out there
not only gays but the blacks the asians the disabled the seniors the uss
without hope the uss give up as the thousands of mourners arrive at city hall they place their candles around the statue of lincoln
i know you cannot live on hope alone but without it life is not worth living
so you and you and you
you gotta give em hope
you gotta give em hope
harvey closes his note pad puts down his pencil and pushes stop on his recorder
push in on castro camera
the sign still in the window were very open
