written by adam green january peace
fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side
tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released
tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion
wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of skiers
even wider to reveal a long line of skiers and snowboarders awaiting their moment to step up to the chair
the camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line decked out in their winter gear
angle on dan walker college age shaggy hair holding a snowboard and a helmet in one hand as he studies the situation
next to him stands an impatient joe lynch college age goggles on his head and a face full of fresh stubble standing on skis
i dont see her
the shift change is late
parker oneil college age red hair holding a snowboard sighs and stares back at the lift lane
are you sure about this
weve been doing this forever
this lady loves lynch
she always goes for it
lynch smiles at parker
just then jason a ski mountain employee approaches the front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair
is that her
its cool its cool
to parker look all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him what
this is your thing
parker listen listen
its so easy
all you do is tell the guy that you and your friends girlfriends
you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you cant pick up your lift tickets
he grabs a wad of cash out of lynchs glove and shoves it in parkers hand
dan contd start at
thats what we usually give the other lady
hell take it
you do it
i feel stupid
youve got this
you can totally do this
parker youve so got this
the worst thing that happens is he says no
he wont say no
no one ever says no
cause youre a girl
a very beautiful girl with a very charming smile
he unzips her jacket a little bit showing some more of her body
dan contd there
my charming smile
dan and lynch smile back at her
she exits reluctantly towards the lift line
parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of the line passing all of the skiers who are waiting
she approaches jason who is now running the lift
he lights a cigarette
jason looks up at her
parker contd could i bum a smoke
she flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly obliges with a cigarette
parker contd thanks
he lights her cigarette
parker contd im parker
he looks around not all that sure why a cute girl is talking to him for more than just to get a smoke
my brothers name is jason
yeah so i dont want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything
this is gonna sound so stupid
jason is all ears
parker contd my girlfriends and i drove all the way up here from salem state and i was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that i could cover the
lift tickets on my moms credit card
but then i left her credit card at the gas station
jason totally sees where this is going
no but i mean we totally have some cash and stuff
we just dont have enough to cover all lift tickets you know
jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets onto the lift
jason scoffs and starts the lift
i could lose my job
he looks around
lynch and dan watch parker at work
hes not going for it
will you shut up
hes gonna go for it
its either stand there and do the job for minimal
minimal what is it
minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more
lynch sighs then changes the subject
she had to come skiing with us
dan looks back at him offended
you said you didnt mind
i dont mind
dont mind at all
lynch contd im just saying you havent done dollar pitchers at fezziwigs with us since last semester
you never come around for monday night football nobody has seen you at i watched the game with you last week
for ten minutes dan
football games are more than ten minutes
theyre lots of ten minutes es you know
dude i have a girlfriend now
i love this girl
i dont know what you
no no its fine
im just saying the mount holliston day trips were our thing you know
she doesnt even know how to board yet
shes getting better
then now i feel like a dick
you should have said something if it was a problem
its not a problem
forget i ever said anything
they see parker hand jason something
he pockets it and she glides her way back to the end of the line
she looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then excitedly waves
proud of herself
dan smiles at lynch
lynch and dan join parker and slowly work their way up the line
they always go for it
i did good right
you did great
oh so wheres my change
there isnt any
you gave him the full hundred
he wasnt going for it at
so what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there
like i dont know or maybe even
you gave me two s
what was i supposed to do ask for change
i would have asked for change
its still way cheaper than paying for tickets right
dan is disappointed
i would have definitely asked him for change
they get up to the front of the line
jason looks at dan and lynch behind parker
scoffs at parker girlfriends
parker gives him an apologetic smile
the three get in front of the chair
it descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air
the threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes its way to the top
look at that
all these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski
all thanks to you baby
teasing oh now im baby
you never call me pet names
im just not a pet name guy
to lynch he calls me parker
its your name
yeah but youre supposed to call me something affectionate you know
like honey or sweetie
i hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed
it was so weird
your hair is so soft
do me harder lynch
it was like i was throwing it to dan over here
dan looks back to parker
at least i dont call you oneil
you dont touch my face enough either
to no one imparticular third wheel
parker reaches across and playfully taps lynch
watch it lynch
hey thats not fair
im not dating you you dont get to make my life suck
parker shoots dan a look oh really
i never said that
i never said you make my life suck
then forced sweetie
after a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face
nothing sweet or sensitive about it but hes trying
to parker dan tells me youre getting the hang of that board
i wouldnt say that
but last time we went i did pretty good right
you did awesome
im telling you the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it its like riding a bike
dan contd to lynchs skis are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board
snowboards are too emo for me
give it ten more years and that fad will be dead
thats what they said about rap
parker removes a cigarette and lights it
smell that fresh mountain air huh
kind of smells like
you know what i am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts
at least pot does something for you
cigarettes are just gross
especially out in the cold
it like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old mans used floss
where do you come up with this shit
have you ever sniffed your floss
dan and lynch both crack up at this huge
no i have never why would i ever sniff my floss
why am i friends with you
parker blows more smoke out
dan contd gimme a drag
he takes her cigarette from her
what time do you think well get back
i have about weeks worth of chapters to read tonight
she broke the rule
to parker parker you just broke the first rule
no worrying about the bullshit of real life
the whole point of this is to relax and have fun
worry about school when you get home
but i havent read a the chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly
the sound of the chair lift cuts out
a deep silence takes over quickly like the type of silence that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a test and the radiator that you never
even noticed was on would suddenly shut off
random skiers and boarders in the surrounding chairs express their disgust for the delay
parker instinctively grabs dans hand
is someone afraid of heights
so it doesnt bother you when i do this
lynch rocks the chair back and forth
parker grabs hold of the safety bar
dan motions to lynch to stop
parker contd im not afraid of heights
i just dont like them
baby in the whole history of time only one chair has ever fallen off of a lift
points for calling me baby but you just made that statistic up
yeah statistics dont work on smokers
nervous laughter oh shut up
lynch turns around and yells behind him
laughter echoes from the chairs behind him
he yells forward
lynch contd actually i paid good money
yeah but im gonna pay you back so its like the same thing
with a lurch the chair starts moving forward again and the whirring sound of the cables above them start up again
applause is heard from all of the other chairs
lynch contd dan lets go of parkers hand and gives her a smile
she smiles back
he playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame
the three begin to get situated with their boards and skis
why do i have to wear a helmet
but you guys dont wear them
she looks around
parker contd i only see little kids wearing them
cause theyre still learning too
come on im not gonna argue about this
even extreme boarders wear helmets
nobody makes fun of them
she begrudgingly puts on her helmet
shes not happy about it
dan and lynch smile
youre just doing this to make fun of me
no im not
you look hot in a helmet
off to the side lynch spots shannon cute brunette s struggling with her boot strap
she falls down on her ass
lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side
need some help
laughing do you think
lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost directly into his face
parker and dan watch from afar as lynch helps her with her boot strap
he has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is fastening the strap with his other
aww check out lynch
from their point of view they watch lynch helping the girl
almost as if on cue ryan an enormous dude s stomps over and shoves lynch down into the snow
what the hell
lynch tries to get up
i was just trying to help
instantly dan moves over to lynchs aid
parker follows slowly behind him
shes clearly not too good on her board
ryan what the hell
he had his hands all over you
no he didnt
i can take care of myself
she shoves him back
ryan just shakes his head at her and shoves off away from the group
he waits for her down the hill a few feet
dan and shannon help lynch to his feet
shannon contd i am so sorry about that
he can be such an asshole sometimes
i was seriously just trying to help
i mean how could i even compete with a catch like that
he waves to ryan
ryan just looks away
laughs are you ok
yeah im fine
well thank you for your help
i am so so sorry about that
then im shannon by the way
calling to her shan
shannon rolls her eyes
well it was nice to meet you
she takes off after ryan
to his friends i was like one second away from beating that guys ass
i know you were man
dont sweat it
seriously that guy was such a dick
come on boys
we can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom
lynch starts down the hill
i know you are
they push off out of frame
dan parker and lynch move down the mountain on their snow boards and skis
quick cuts of dan helping parker learn
lynch impatiently waits
finally parker comes to a stop on her own next to dan and he claps for her
look at you
are you kidding
we are totally doing this every weekend
in fact if they were open during the week id say we should cut class too
lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder
last one to the bottom is buying dinner
he eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass
parker and dan take off laughing while lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet
parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while dan and lynch pick at whats left of a pizza on the table in front of them
we gotta take a weekend trip up north one of these days
hit up killington or okemo and really do it up right
why dont we just do it over christmas
you and me
when i stayed with my cousin out west two years ago it was like the stuff you see in commercials
we had to take like lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see
well speaking of good skiing
its been cool doing the bunny hill all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight
dan feels bad
dude you didnt have to stay with us
its totally cool if you want to go off for a few
parker is now walking back to their table behind lynch and is pretty much right on top of them
no its fine
im just saying lets step it up a notch at some point
its been cool watching parker fall on her ass all day but i would like to actually ski at some point
parker feels horrible
you know ive probably had enough for today anyway
i can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go now lynch feels horrible
no no no thats not what i meant
i didnt mean it like that
parker looks to dan
i told you i didnt have to come
parker i didnt not want you to come
dan tries to help
it was his idea that we invited you in the first place
i was like hey man why doesnt parker come with us
and you were like i was like ok that would be cool
parker isnt buying it
she puts on a smile
its ok you guys
the last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on guy time
i wont be offended
ive got stuff i could do anyway
to dan actually can i have the key
i should check my messages
no locker key
i can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell
she does not
dan looks to lynch
ready for this
two nights ago we were watching a movie and her mom kept calling and calling
to parker and what did she want
dan contd she wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with christmas dinner
four weeks away and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup wed prefer
what did you say
you said chicken
hell yes i said chicken but thats not the point
to parker the point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from annette
parker looks to lynch
im sorry if i ruined skiing for you today
you didnt at all
you missed the part before you walked over here when i was all like dude this has been so cool
parker and dan are beaming at him
he knows hes beat
lynch contd frustrated what
parker dan and lynch come out of the lodge
from their pov the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty
they start to move to the empty lift line when
to his friends wait up
lynch walks over to shannon while dan and parker move towards the lift line
i just wanted to apologize again
oh no big deal
hes just lucky he didnt make me mad
you know i just look half your boyfriends size
hes my ex boyfriend
were you know trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see thats not really gonna work
teasing no way
a group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well whatever
its a whole story and she looks over at dan and parker
shannon contd i dont want to hold you up
but that was just really embarrassing
so i just wanted to say sorry
then are you gonna be here next weekend
yeah probably yes
well my roommate and i come like every sunday so maybe ill see you
that would be
a nice time
see ya later
she turns and starts walking away
lynch walks away
he gets a few steps and then turns back and jogs after shannon again
actually you know what
would it be cool if i got your number or something
that way ill
know how to catch up with you and stuff
lynch pats his pockets
dont ski with my phone
its in the locker with everyone elses stuff
do you have a pen
she laughs and shakes her head no
dont ski with a pen
just shoot then
ive got a really good memory
ive only smoked pot like times so im good
shannon gets serious
you know its a gateway drug right
joe is nervous
shannon contd kidding
thats so like you
dan and parker are in a heated debate with jason the chair lift operator
he puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the mountain
but we gave you a hundred bucks and weve only gotten like runs
its not my decision man
theyre closing early
youre only open three days a week
you cant afford to close early
why dont you write a letter
lynch pushes himself up behind them
to dan remember
to jason come on just one more run
honestly id slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have
to jason hey man do you have a pen
jason ignores him
its not about the money
they need to clear the mountain
weve got weather coming in
theres nothing i can do
what if we promise to run straight down
like the quickest run ever
he sighs and looks around
there are still plenty of skiers coming down
thank you so much
well be wicked fast
like the wind
jason sends them up the lift
he checks to make sure no one is watching
parker dan and lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again
for a hundred bucks youd think he could cut us some slack
i know right
theyre supposed to stay open until on sundays
whatever happened to night skiing
wachusett still has night skiing
we should have gone there
its kinda like ward hill but not as lame
then hey you remember the numbers i told you
good for you lynch
you got her number
what did he man have to say about that
steroids shrink your dick
then wait shit
what were my four numbers
parker will you remember
jason reaches for his cigarettes
hes all out
disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash
a fellow employee rifkin approaches
early night huh
youre not gonna hear me complain
pendergraft wants you to stop by the office
something about next weekends schedule
im not working next weekend
rifkin gives him a look
thats what you thought
jason contd oh come on
its my brothers bachelor party
i put in for it two months ago
go talk to the boss
hes getting ready to leave
im the best man
under his breath shit
rifkin takes his place
ready to shut down
as jason runs away he turns back
theres three more on their way down
wait for them then its all set
the three continue to talk
im not waiting til we get back to campus to eat
why didnt you have some pizza
you mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate
that wasnt pizza
that was like roller skating rink birthday party pizza
theres a papa ginos on our way back
its like minutes down the road from the mountain
i am gonna eat a whole real pizza myself
dan spies something
check it out
they look down to see three skiers hit a huge jump one after the other
dan contd we are so hitting that jump
gotta make it count
the wind blows the chair really hard
parker holds on
the guys just laugh
its just wind parker
dont you mean baby
parker starts laughing
to lynch who invited you
rifkin warms his hands with his breath
the temperature is dropping fast
he checks his watch dancing back and forth
heyman another employee runs by him on his way to the lodge
do me a solid
heyman looks back him
his face already says no
rifkin contd ive gotta piss so bad i can taste it
can you just take over for minutes
heyman points to his ears as if he cant hear what rifkin is saying to him
he keeps running
rifkin contd asshole
a low distant thunder roll echoes far away
do you hear that
its the mountains
it snows every night
the chair moves on in silence for a few moments
im gonna eat a whole pizza
a few beats im not even kidding
rifkin kicks his feet around
he spies jasons discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes
just then the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him
a voice from the top lift cuts through the radio
last chair is through
rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain
last three just hit
clear up here
he hangs up and moves over to the lever
tight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him
the chair lurches to a stop
once again the comforting white noise of the motorized cables goes away leaving them in silence
the wind blows hard against them
oh come on
parker instinctively grabs his hand
the cold bites through their layers of clothing
yelling to the sky they sit and wait in silence for a few seconds
its gonna start again right
then anyone got any jokes
what did the fourteen year old girl from new hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity
get off me youre crushing my marlboros
i told you that
from this distance the mountain looks like a giant night light of converging white strings
even in this darkness the menacing clouds are visible over the trees
the three sit in the freezing chair
lynch is really getting impatient
what do you think the worst way to die would be
thats not morbid
thats kinda spooky dan
i think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go
beat not if it was like one of those surfers where they get hit from behind and they dont even know what happened
beat you know
cause it like came up from beneath them
beat like on the jaws poster
the chick on the jaws poster was hot
i dont know
she was naked
naked chicks are hot
but if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water
that would be worse than actually getting eaten
knowing that this animal is coming for you but you cant get away
and that its going to eat you
like youre gonna get eaten alive
have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal
thats why i only swim in pools
i think burning to death would be the worst
well yes and no
because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them
i remember watching tv for like days straight after
that footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the trade center
can you imagine how bad it was inside to know that jumping was a better way out
but they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you dont even feel it
ok then lynch
what is the worst way to die
no you have an answer for everything
whats your biggest fear
lynch has been waiting for this
the sarlaac pit
the sarlaac pit
from return of the jedi
being slowly digested over years
teasing i dont know why i never have a girlfriend you guys
the wind starts blowing again and parker nestles close to dan
why hasnt it started again
give it a minute
this is nothing man
at stowe last year me and solet were stranded for like minutes
this big chick fell getting off up top and twisted her leg
it was like move her to the side and keep the line going people
they had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to boom
the lights go out
across the mountain all of the trail lights go out one by one
they sit in darkness
at first no one can speak
dan reacts first
yelling come on now
this is messed up
dan tries to laugh in frustration
are they fucking kidding
i kind of just shat in my pants a bit im not gonna lie
parker is starting to shake
quietly no one knows were up here
they forgot that were up here
no they didnt
they couldnt have
im sure they have a system or something
theres probably security cameras on us right now
he starts waving around his hands
dan contd what if they dont start it again
what if everyone went home
angered out of panic will you stop
recovering they didnt go home
stop freaking me out
then remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down
this is horse shit
what did you say to the guy
well clearly you pissed him off enough to do this
i didnt do anything
he knows were still up here
then why are the lights off dan
is that part of their policy
shut off the lights and scare the customers
they just lost power or something
im sure its gonna come back on any second
then they didnt go home
after a few more moments
this is so messed up
its a power outage
theyll come up with a ladder if they have to
parker is starting to whimper
in a few more seconds she may even be teetering on full on panic
we need to get down from here
we cant just sit up here
why isnt the goddamn chair moving dan
what the hell
well you being all psycho about it isnt gonna make it move
just chill out
another few beats
dont yell at me
i wasnt yelling at you but you need to relax
this stuff happens all the time
can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night
free lift tickets
what other people on the lift
there was no one in front of us
she made a good point
we wont be stuck here all night
we wont be here all night
she starts crying its fucking sunday and they arent open again until friday
sobbing well be stuck here all week
silence as dan and lynch take this in
parker contd were gonna die up here
lynch tries to be the voice of reason
were not going to be stuck here
parker look at me
even if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here we can jump
i see people jump off of chair lifts all the time
ive done it before
you just get tired of waiting you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump
its actually kind of fun but they can ban you from the mountain for it
looking below them it is way too far a drop to be jumping off of the chair
hysterical she cries into dans shoulder
i know youre scared
im scared too
but any minute now theyre gonna turn the power back on and were all gonna be laughing about this
more moments pass in silence as they survey their situation
i have to pee
they all share an uncomfortable laugh
parker contd i have to pee wicked bad
that makes two of us
ew lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me im gonna puke
well what do you want me to do
i gotta go
how am i supposed to go
dan moves the safety bar a little
well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you
parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up
are you crazy
put the bar down
its just the safety bar
it doesnt really do anything anyway
well i like the safety bar and i like it down where its supposed to be
then how are you going to piss
i can hold it
for a whole week
dan and parker glare at him
lynch contd sorry
then shes the one who said wed be here for a week
parker takes a deep breath
i can hold it
im telling you five minutes from now well all be laughing
lynch lifts the safety bar up whips out his business and starts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below them
i hope they catch you and throw you out
i hope they ban you from the mountain
thats so nasty
ban me from the mountain
you couldnt pay me to come back here
make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn fisher price lift working
not coming back
lynch finishes his business
lynch contd there
a low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chilling wind picks up
they continue to scream their heads off for a few moments until freezing sleet starts falling all around them soaking them through to the bone
almost instantly giant balls of hail stream down at them
ping ing off of the metal chair and pelting their faces
the wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather
parker sobs quietly into dans shoulder
quietly put the safety bar down joe
louder put the bar down
lynch pulls the bar down and sulks looking away from dan
the hail sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence
another loud thunder clap hits
this time much closer
the sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below
ski tracks fill in with the wet rain
the entire mountain is covered in dark clouds
the three stranded kids huddle together for warmth as the hail pours down around them in sheets
suddenly a beam of light begins to shine up at them
dans head snaps up
a snow cat slowly makes its way down the hill towards the bottom
its headlights shine across the trees in front of it
dan begins to cheer
what did i tell you guys huh
woo oh thank god
the snow cat is now really close
it is literally coming right for them
dan and parker wave their hands in the rain
the snow cat continues on right underneath them
it doesnt look like its going to stop
panic sets in yet again
why isnt he stopping
steve the driver concentrates on the path
the roar of his engine is almost deafening
his radio chimes in
steve picks up his radio
go for steve
we got a problem here
below them the snow cat slows down to a halt
the three kids cheer
its nothing but ice at the bottom of wildcat so youre gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side
thats gonna take me minutes
sorry brother but its a frozen swimming pool down here
he puts the snow cat in gear and begins to back up
below them they see the snow cat start to back up and turn to the right
what is this asshole doing
the snow cat switches back into drive
quickly dan and lynch start to ball together the slush on the sides of the chair
they throw them at the snow cat but keep missing by a few inches
desperately lynch throws his goggles at the snow cat
they land just shy of the drivers side window
parker takes off her helmet and throws it down
steve turns the headlights in the opposite direction just missing the helmet falling past his windshield
though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three kids unless you knew they were there or were looking for them
you would have missed them too
as the windshield turns the other way one of lynchs skis slams into the ground just out of the headlights view
the snow cat drives away
lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesnt even come close
parker sobs hysterically
it has stopped hailing
the moon shines down on the mountain
it glistens like a block of ice
the three shiver uncontrollably
my face is burning
the power is coming back on soon
no it isnt
it has to
the wind makes eerie sounds as it whistles through the frozen trees
dan contd anyone know what time it is
i dont wear a watch
i use my phone
hold on let me just run back to the locker real quick and ill find out
no one laughs at his attempt at humor
lynch contd ok top breakfast cereals of all time
lynch contd ill go first
dude quit it
and im gonna go out on a limb and say lucky charms pre purple horseshoes
lynch contd theres just something weird about eating purple horseshoes am i right
everyone went home
they left us up here
top celebrities youd do
then me first again
someone has to jump
they steal glances at each other
they are soaked through
parkers hair is frozen
dan contd we cant just sit up here until next weekend
no one acknowledges him
he sighs and closes his eyes
parker starts to cry
neither of the guys even try to console her
finally dan puts an arm around her
dan contd shhh
his voice is getting hoarse
aside to dan i dont want to die up here
aside to parker youre not gonna die baby
i wont let you die
i promise i wont let you die
aside to dan im so scared
aside to parker its alright
snow starts to lightly fall around them
dan contd hey
they shiver together
then best christmas present you ever got
parker chimes in first this time
disneyworld in th grade
guess that leaves me
im gonna go with
how ironic huh
parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette
as she struggles with the lighter the glove falls out of her lap and lands on the ground below them
thats where smoking gets you
she keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives up
she throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed hand back in her pocket
the snow falls around them
dan pushes the safety bar up
parker contd what what are you doing
im gonna get help
lets talk about this
no dont leave me up here
dan takes her face in his hands
and probably for the first time
parker i can do this
even if i get hurt as long as i can get to the bottom i
your skin is so red
youre getting frost bite
you cant get frost bite that fast
its only been what like
how long has it been
a few hours tops
dan inspects parkers face
its tough to see in the dark but the tip of her nose and her right cheek the side facing into the wind is discoloring
quietly dont leave me
ill get help
lynch is here
hell be with you
lynch is looking down below them
dan its a far drop
i dont know
heated do you have a better idea
im telling you ive totally jumped off of a lift before
if we can wait til morning i bet someone will come up here
like a snow groomer or some shit
and why would they come groom the snow on a day when they arent open joe
a day when they still have a full work week before they open again
lynch says nothing
dan contd i can do this
he positions himself to try and jump off
parker grabs his arm
no no no
please dont jump down there dan
youll get hurt
how are you going to find your way in the dark
ill stick to the trail
ill ride to the bottom
then you dont get a fresher run than this right
dan drops his snowboard down
it lands sticking up straight in the snow
dan contd parker and lynch look back at him
they dont know what to say
lynch tries to grab on to dans arm
dan shrugs free
he is determined
parkers tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick by
dan contd two
lynch takes a deep breath
when enough time has elapsed to think dans gonna jump he suddenly looks up at lynch instead of jumping
dan contd remember when i was saying how i jumped off one of these things before
lynch stares back at him
dan contd i totally lied
im scared shitless right now
lynch musters a laugh
its forced but its a laugh
dan laughs back at him
he turns to face parker
she tries to smile but is frozen with fear
dan whispers to her
dan contd whispered youre gonna be ok baby
and he is gone
from his point of view the camera pointed down at his feet we drop without cutting from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below
both of dans legs shatter from the impact
viscera protrudes out of his snow pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees
parker calls down to him
oh my god
dans cries turn to quiet breaths below them
it is tough for parker and lynch to make out what exactly is happening
dan say something
are you alright
more quiet breaths from below
i broke my fucking legs
can you move
she starts to panic hold on
hold on baby
lynch stops her
what are you doing
i have to get to him
youll just get hurt too
to dan talk to me danny
dont get off the chair
how bad is it
dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is bleeding
bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants
its really fucking bad
starting to cry dans screams can barely be heard from this distance
the blanket of snow muffles all sounds of life on the mountain
parker sobs into lynchs shoulder
you gotta stay strong for me parker
can you do that
he looks every which way trying to come up with a solution
lynch contd if we go to pieces were never gonna get through this ok
what are we gonna do
were gonna die up here
to dan below buddy can you move at all
i cant even stand up
you cant like
i dont know slide down the hill or something
my legs are shattered asshole
im bleeding to death no i cant alright alright
so much blood
to dan below can you stop the bleeding
she takes off her scarf and tosses it below
it blows away into the trees
it doesnt even make it halfway
parker contd lynch removes his scarf and balls it up
here you go dan
im throwing mine down
i cant see
just feel for it ok
here it comes
he drops the balled up scarf
the scarf lands right next to dan
what do i do with this
tie it over your leg
tie it off above wherever its bleeding
like a tourniquet thing
dan fumbles with the scarf and ties it just above his right knee as tight as he can
im so cold
parker starts to take off her coat
here take my coat
dont you take off your coat
you need it
no ill be ok
i can huddle next to lynch
please parker keep your coat on
dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together
his fingers are so numb that it takes several tries
once tied he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee but it is useless
dan contd shit
you gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding
ive got it
are you sure
dans left leg is definitely still bleeding
thunder shakes the mountain side
moments pass with only their breathing
are you sure you cant try and get down the hill buddy
dan falls onto his back panting from the pain
he struggles to flip himself over but it hurts too much
i cant move
i cant move
lynch holds his head
once again lynch starts looking all around
lynch contd maybe
if i could climb up to the lift cable
maybe i could like scale across to the other chairs until i find one that isnt quite so high up from the ground
you think you can pull yourself across that many chairs
lynch looks back at her
i cant even do a pull up
you never even tried to do a pull up you asshole
you had your mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause youre a pussy
there was no reason to embarrass myself
i knew i couldnt do it
you can too
remember jenny bluth
she fucking did it
you can do it
even if i made it across to the next chair
how many more would it take before i found one closer to the ground
every lift pole has an emergency ladder on it
they look forwards and backwards
the chair behind them is not near the pole
but the one behind that one is
the chair thats two back
does it look like its near the pole
i dont know
i cant see
shit thats far
he and parker just stare at it
lynch contd just
just give me a second
he starts taking deep breaths
trying to psyche himself up
what if you fall too
if we just sit here were gonna freeze to death
maybe in the morning someone else will come up here
maybe theyll need to do maintenance on the lift or something you know
whats going on up there
were right here baby
we didnt go anywhere
i think im gonna try and climb back to the pole
if the chair is close enough maybe
maybe i can jump to it
dan is in agony
please do it now
just hang in there dan
its gonna be ok
lynch starts to maneuver himself in the chair
slowly he pushes himself up so that he is sitting on the chair back and holding onto the connecting post
the chair swings back and forth in the wind
above him it is a solid feet before the chair arm connects to the wire
but i was never afraid of heights until like
what can i do to help
just hold on to my legs
you cant really stop me from falling
but its you know
psychological or something you know
parker maneuvers herself to hold joes legs
joe tries to move into a standing position but panics
lynch contd ok
just give me a second
i think we should wait til morning
we can make it a few more hours
then but not him
the gravity of this settles in
as lynch gets ready to try and stand again
we hear something in the surrounds
again a sort of moan rings in the distance
baby is that you
they listen again
this time clear as day
a wolf howl
lynch tries to control the panic
its alright man
its just a coyote or something
theyre scared of people
it probably wont even come anywhere near us that sounded like a fucking wolf
whens the last time you heard of a wolf attack in new england
even in the pale moonlight it is easy to see how white dan is becoming
i read about one on line somewhere last year
wolves around here are pussies
they arent even that big
they stop and listen
but there is only the sound of the rain
it could be worse right
how the hell
could this be worse
it could be the sarlacc pit
they cant believe it
but dan and lynch both actually laugh
its uncomfortable and forced as hell
but its a laugh
parker coming through with the tension breaker look out
to dan shes alright walker
your girl is alright
he focuses on the task at hand again
lynch contd ok
here we go
slowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again
with one hand on parkers shoulder and another on the back post of the chair lynch gets to his feet
looking down at the drop he instantly crouches down again
lynch contd holy shit is that high up
what can i do
just be quiet
he psyches himself up again and starts to rise up
you can do this lynch
youve got it
please stop talking
he puts one foot up on the top of the chair back
but it slips off to the side
lynch contd woa
the whole back of this thing is ice
together he and parker start hitting the chair back
shards of ice fall down around dan
he covers his head for protection
hold on down there
i think once i can stand on the back i should be able to reach the top
more chunks of ice shower down around dan
finally the falling ice subsides
dan takes his gloves away from his face
only to freeze in horror
not even feet away stands a wolf
silently the wolf watches him from the bushes
quietly at first you guys
the wolf gives a low growl
dan contd really loud what
theres a wolf down here
lynch and parker look down
from their pov they can see that the wolf is standing right next to dan watching him
gasps oh shit
dan doesnt take his eyes off of the wolf
he is shaking in fear
what the hell do i do
the wolf sniffs at the air and then growls again this time baring its teeth
it smells the blood
dan contd the tension builds in the stand off
neither the wolf or dan look away
lynchs other ski lands between the two of them
screaming the wolf steps back and snarls
parkers snowboard comes down and skids away into the trees pushing the wolf further back
the wolf darts back into the bushes
though it can no longer be seen we can hear it moving away through the brush and back into the darkness
growls come from the surrounding bushes as the wolf angrily retreats
are you alright man
lynch slides his remaining pole in between the bars on the chair back and rests it there
what did i tell you
theyre more scared of you than you are of them
i dont know
im pretty scared i gotta be honest
its just a dog
thats all it is
he wont be back
are you keeping warm down there
as warm as i can
then i cant feel my legs anymore
is that bad
i mean it doesnt hurt as much
but thats bad right
youll be alright
quietly to parker thats probably really bad
i gotta move so i need you to
he looks closely at parkers face
the tip of her nose and the tops of her cheeks look as if there is black soot on them
lynch contd hey
go like this
he motions wiping his face
parker follows suit but winces in pain
it feels like
pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove
im not an expert but i think thats frost bite
look at me is my face changing color anywhere
parker looks as closely as she can
i cant see anything
i dont know its too dark she starts rubbing at her cheek again
stop touching it
dont touch it
but it itches now
i know but if you keep touching your face its gonna rub off
parker is terrified
lynch contd just try and cover your face
try and stay warm
staying warm is absolutely impossible
parker hides her exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket
icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their clothing
winded you gotta move faster up there
im trying man im trying
lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair which bends at an awkward angle
from above him we can see the long drop down and as he slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair arm the height looks
stomach droppingly scary
i think the silence
lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable
it is frozen over with a thick layer of ice
the distance to the next chair seems about times as far now
lynch contd to himself i can do this
if jenny bluth could climb the rope i can totally do this
slowly he wraps his arms around the wire now with his full body weight on the back of the chair
the bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to creak
it bends slightly but seems to hold firm
lynch contd he starts to pull himself up onto the cable
dont look down
with one hand in front of the other lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air
gritted teeth slippery
do you got it
he slides out a little bit more his feet dangling high above the ground
the cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of lynch
the noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered wilderness
with another deep breath lynch moves another two feet out over the sky
he is straining hard
another two feet out
he looks down for the first time
he sees something that scares the shit out of him
lynch contd oh god
he starts to pull himself back to the chair quickly
come on lynch
you had it
lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries to balance his weight on it
his foot slips off of it and he almost falls
but parker grabs onto his coat
i got you
lynch scrambles into the chair and huddles next to parker
parker contd whats wrong
he looks at her icy tears in his eyes
his face is white
parker contd what happened
finally lynch grabs her face in his hands
he gets close to her
dont look down
he grabs her head forcefully trying to cover her ears
dont look down there parker
the camera booms up and above them
as it tilts down at them
we reveal dan splayed out on the ground below
out of the darkness of the bushes
a pack of six wolves slowly and silently descends on him from all angles
whats wro dan hears the first growl
the hungry wolves circle around him
the smell of his freezing blood makes them drool
dan contd yelling up lynch doesnt look down
he just stares at parker
fighting tears crying lynch is trying to cover parkers ears
but she can hear what they are saying
she forces her head free and steals a glance down
she sees dans untimely death approaching and instantly starts to scream and cry
lynch holds her head in a vice grip
he presses his forehead into hers
her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves
dont listen to it
as we push in tight on the two of their faces below them we hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey
first one growl and a bite
dan shrieks in pain
dont let her look
below we can hear him put up a fight
but the attacks and bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful
contd dont look
dont you fucking look down here
the sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers his cries
lynch continues to hold his hands over parkers ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of dans demise echo through the night
the sounds of clothes being shredded flesh being torn and bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below
dan doesnt scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony
the camera never sees it
only lynch and parkers faces
after what seems to be an unbearable minute
the sounds from below begin to dissipate
eventually dans remains can be heard dragging away
silence once again
finally lynch lets go of parkers head
he sobs into his own frozen gloves as parker hysterically screams out into the night
parkers screams echo across the dark wilderness
somewhere in the distance birds take off in fear
lynch and parker sit on the frozen chair shivering
they are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after what must have been endless screaming and crying
only the occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake
finally lynch breaks the silence
he starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to continue his climbing effort
emotionless why did you let him jump
lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief
you cant be fucking serious
it was too far
he said he could do it
you didnt try and stop him
then i cant believe this
youre blaming me
im not blaming you
youre his girlfriend
i didnt see you throwing yourself in front of him
he wasnt going to listen to me
oh but he would have listened to me
i said it was a bad idea
i said it was too far a drop
but i didnt hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it
dont you fucking blame me
youve been his girlfriend for what
a year maybe
ive known him my whole fucking life
you should have
parker looks at him uncertain
lynch contd say it
it should have been me
i didnt say that
but you want to
i get it
it should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me right
parker feels terrible
she puts her hand on his shoulder
no no i lynch shrugs her hand off of him
you know what
if we hadnt spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have
just gone home
maybe if you hadnt fucked with our thing
maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life
maybe my best friend wouldnt be dead right now
thats not fair
and its not fair that my best friend is dead
parker begins to sob
i didnt mean it
im just im just fuck you
lynch is numb
he sits expressionless
in her crying parker slowly keeps moving towards him
like a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you to love it again
finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his chest letting it all out
eventually lynch cant help but feel compassion for her
he puts his arm around her
lynch contd quietly im sorry
im sorry parker
snow has now almost completely covered any of dans remains that were left on the scene
only the tip of a boot and a piece of jacket are visible
parker and lynch are shivering together
after a beat they begin to banter again
everything is said in a monotone voice
they never even look at each other
they only speak to be speaking
shit what was it
im so gonna call that girl when we get home
and you know what
im gonna marry her
no messing around
im just gonna be like hey shannon its me joe from the chair lift
will you marry me
and then were gonna get a house and have kids and a dog named steve
parkers face is expressionless
whos gonna pay for the house
shannons got a great job
what does she do
lynch makes something up
but continues to have no expression in his words
despite his talk his spirit is shattered
orthodontists make a lot of money
i bet you guys will be really happy
a wolf settles in the bushes and looks up at the two pieces of food on the chair high above
another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree
they wait like vultures
who names their dog steve
steves a people name
you dont like walk into someones house and have them say heres my dog steve
steves a good name for a dog
here meet my cat chris
just a dog
shayna must be so hungry
lynch tries to change the subject
what kind of pizza should we get at papa ginos
parker doesnt hear him
as she continues wet snow starts to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up
the poor thing
shes just a puppy
she wont understand that i died
shes gonna think i left her
that i forgot about her
all she wants is for me to come home
shes probably waiting by the door for me right now
every sound she hears in the hallway shes probably cocking her little head to the side waiting to see if im going to walk in
but i wont
i wont ever walk in
and shaynas going to starve to death
the poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and its all my fault
she wont starve to death and youre not going to die
no one else has a key to my place
the neighbors will break the door down if she doesnt stop barking
someone will figure it out
shell be fine
beat and so will you
so will we
he puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to shield the wind
i would have had shayna for a year this month
i got her a year ago for christmas
but youll see her again
dan and i were spending christmas with my parents this year
we wont be there though
then i want to see my mom and my dad
then i want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can eat
shes always late
but she brings all of the desserts
and she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg
its so good
and after dinner my dad always passes out on the couch cause its his one day off and hes had too much eggnog
and my sister my mom and i watch a christmas story until the marathon is over
and thats how you know christmas is really over
when ralphie gets his red rider carbine action two hundred shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming
parker contd its kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for christmas again
then its the same routine every year
then i just want to see my mom and dad
the camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness
slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls
dawn is breaking over the trees
lynch and parker are still
their bodies are huddled together but neither is moving
in fact at a first glance one might think they are both human popcycles
the dark splotches of frost bite on parkers nose and cheeks have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black fungus on her skin
lynch has the start of his own frost bite on his ears and nose
slowly parkers eyes flutter and she awakens
her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in
she adjusts in her seat and feels something pull
she winces and looks down
slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand gripping the icy safety bar
but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal
beginning to panic she jerks her hand hard taking the bar up about half an inch with it
painstakingly slow she begins to peel her hand off of the bar
a sound that resembles jeans slowly tearing can be softly heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand from the skin that is attached to the metal
after what feels like an eternity she gives her hand one last jerk freeing it from the safety bar
parker contd ruuugh
her movement startles lynch awake and he bolts upright as if from a falling nightmare
discombobulated lynch turns back and forth frantically trying to get his bearings
parker is crying and holding her bloody hand parker contd shhhh
lynch bug eyed takes in the world around him
a fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches of peaceful white bliss
below them the snow has completely covered dans remains
there is nothing left to show that there was ever even a struggle
parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat away from lynchs eyes
thought i was dreaming
i thought this was a dream
he turns to look at parker
it takes everything he has to not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks
your frost bite
she starts to touch her face
how bad is it
lynch stops her
its not as itchy any more
just dont touch your face ok
when we get out of here well get you to a doctor right away and theyll fix it
you have some dark spots on your face too
theyll fix me too then
just dont touch it
he looks around front to back
in daylight its easier to see the other chairs
his breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist
lynch contd well its morning
maybe someone will come up here now
i dont know
besides when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us
no ones gonna look for me
i skip class all the time
by the time anyone notices im gone ill be dead
can you please just think one positive thing
no one knows were here
to the sky his voice echoes off of the frozen trees almost as if taunting him
he turns around to look at the chairs behind him
lynch contd alright
if i can get to that chair
i could make it to the ladder on that pole
i think i could make it down
parker doesnt speak
lynch contd help me
are you sure you dont just wanna give it a few more hours
what if youre right
what if someone is going to come up here even though theyre not open today
lynch doesnt respond
the look on his face says that no one is coming but he decides theres no harm in waiting just a little while longer
lynch tries to yell for help again though his soar throat is making it almost impossible to scream
he re settles in his chair
i just wish i could stand up
get out of this position for a minute
if you want you can stand on the chair and i can hold onto you
well if anythings gonna get you over your fear of heights its this
quickly sternly no
the bottom of the mountain looks like it has been abandoned
empty ski racks
an empty lodge
an empty parking lot
a still chair lift
all covered in white still snow
lynch is sleeping
his head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck hes ever had
parker is ancy
she looks all around
finally she squeezes her eyes shut
her snow pants turn dark around her bottom
slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and lynch
below them the urine falls into the snow and disappears
parkers eyes swell as she begins to cry whats left of her tears
she is emotionally degraded and devastated
as her nose begins to run she instinctively wipes her hand across it
taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it
she doesnt even feel it
they both sleep
finally lynch stirs and checks parker to see if she is still breathing
it appears she is not
he lightly shakes her
lynch contd parker wake up
he shakes her harder and she comes to with a gasp
shit i thought you stopped breathing
he notices her skinned cheek
her ear tips are now completely blackened
she studies his eyes
clearly something is very wrong
lynch contd how about you help me up again and we try and get out of here
from beneath the chair we see shards of ice and snow fall onto the ground
lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as parker holds him steady
he hoists himself up onto the cable briefly but after just a few seconds he returns his feet to the chair back
parker holds onto his legs tightly
lynch contd i feel like i gained about pounds overnight
it was all that pizza talk
i have no strength
then dont do this
lynch tries again
he hoists himself up but bails instantly
like a trainer giving up on his th pull up
he settles back down into the assumed position on the chair
like im gonna feel better if i wait a little longer
i should have done it last night while i still had some strength
theres more snow fall on the ground and its all fresh
maybe the jump wont be as bad now
even if it was a foot deeper it wouldnt break that fall
i should have just climbed across last night
i had strength
i had adrenaline
what do you want me to do
lets sit and do nothing
she reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes
the box is damp but the cigarettes inside are still dry
she starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack
the pack of cigarettes falls into the snow
the two are bundled together as the evening winds start to pick up
again they speak without emotion
its conversation just to let themselves know that they are still alive
how come you never have a girlfriend
how am i supposed to answer that
i mean youre a decent guy
girls dig you
but you never stay in a relationship
i had a serious girlfriend once
high school doesnt count
no post high school
this girl annie
i met her at orientation
we emailed all summer and when we started school it was like we were already going out
i totally just felt it with her you know
we were into a lot of the same stuff which was cool
she was way into aerosmith
i had seen them fifteen times she had seen them twenty
how cool is that
same favorite movie as me
it was like soul mates and that stuff you read about
same old shit
you know what happened
she liked another guy
this fucking fraternity douchebag named dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff
i dont know who it was exactly but every time id go to her room some guy named dean had left her notes and shit
why did she keep it
was she trying to make you jealous
i dont know
i think she just liked getting attention
so she dumped you for a frat guy
i dumped her
we were in the cafeteria right
and i was sitting facing her facing the wall
and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me
and i kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like almost laughing
so i was like who are you laughing at
like what the hell is going on
and shes like deans making fun of you
beat so i turn around and im like ready to kick the shit out of this guy
and all i see is a sea of fucking random people
just all of these faces
this guy could see me and was making eyes with my girlfriend
but i couldnt see him
thats messed up
ive never felt so stupid and bad in my life
then so i left
you just walked out
told her to go laugh with dean the frat guy
i was out
maybe i shouldnt have been so quick to walk out
maybe i needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch i dont know
sometimes i think i was just insecure and maybe i screwed up
you should call her
when you get home
you could tell her that
laughs shes dating dean
emotion has fought its way to the surface again
parker and lynch share a nervous laugh together
she turns away from him
after a few seconds her laughs turn to tears
i should have done something
there was nothing either of us could have done
i sat here and let him die
no you didnt
we didnt let him die
there was nothing we could have done
he jumped down there to try and save us ok
he was the one
he was the boy i was gonna marry
first grade we all get left there for the day by our moms
you know alone in real school for the first time without our folks around
dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little
lynch contd nah fuck it
he was a fat ass
parker laughs harder
lynch contd and all the moms left and he just wouldnt let go of his moms hand
he just stood there after she left at the front of the room crying like a total pussy
sounds like dan
you have no idea
but then the teacher
what was her name
she was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying
and so she says well dan is there anyone else in the class that you know
you know like maybe theres a friend youd like to sit with
and the fucker points right at me and says him
i had never seen this kid before in my life you know
but for whatever reason he points right at me
and so he had to sit with you
for a week
for my whole first week of school im sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass
parker laughs through her tears
lynch contd douchebag
i never let him forget it
i loved him so much
lynch is determined
but if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here thats bullshit
so i need you to pull it together and were gonna get out of this shit
were gonna get out of this for dan
lynch bites his severely chapped lips
help me up
lynch feebly climbs up on the chair back and reaches up for the cables
lets try this again
he steadies himself on the chair which sways in the wind
tight on the bolts connecting the arm to the cables
the metal is bending with a light squeaking sound
are you ok
do you have it
lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his weight
the camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find footing on the chair back and the ground far below him
he pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling
as his foot pushes fast on the chair it swings at an impossible angle
tight on the connecting bolts as one of them snaps
oh my god
the chair leans hard to the right side forcing parker to slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair
the chair is still in place but it is now hanging by one bolt and at a severe angle
parker contd joe
joe tries to look back over his shoulder struggling to keep himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet clothing
hold on just hold on
another grunt and lynch makes another big move forward
the camera booms up above him shooting straight down at the distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground
tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the metal cable
lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward
behind him parker looks on in agony
she is holding her breath and whispering
whispered please god
the metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the one remaining bolt is under
looking at the arm in this state it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place
lynch takes another move forward
you can do it
please do it
lynch reaches forward again
and his hand slips on the icy cable
he momentarily hangs by one arm
he reaches up and grabs hold again
his strength is weaning
through gritted teeth got it
another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway across to the next chair
from lynchs point of view we can see his feet floating above the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat
his own pained breathing fills his ears
its only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him from the bushes
lynch contd motherfucker
the wind blows hard against him swaying his body back and forth as he momentarily rests
lynch contd ive got an audience
parker looks down just in time to see one of the wolves duck back into the bushes
her movement makes the chair groan harder
the cable twangs loudly between lynchs shaky movements and the twisted metal that holds the arm in place
the chair is gonna fall
no its not
slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair
he drops down onto it sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below
he quickly sits down breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair
lynch contd take that jenny bluth
you made it
he looks behind him at the next chair
just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole
and a ladder
lynch contd please
he stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable
he is weak
lynch contd parker
i want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way
she cant quite hear him
i said throw my pole as far as you can this way
when i get on the ground ill need some defense
she takes lynchs ski pole and tries to throw it as far as she can back at him
the action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the arm above her and her chair swings back and forth from the motion
the pole lands under the second chair splitting the distance between where she is and where the tree is
parker contd sorry
halfway to me is better than up there with you right
to himself shit
he starts to pull himself up again but turns back to parker one more time
the chair has settled down
lynch contd stay perfectly still
im gonna get you home ok
he pulls himself up straining hard
lynch contd rrrrugh
this gets the wolves attention
in the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire cable
with reserved strength lynch shimmies across the cable as quickly as he can
back at parkers chair she eyes the bending metal bolt that is keeping her from plunging to the ground
tears stream down her face again
whispered please god dont let me fall
dont let me fall
he stops once to catch his breath but begins moving as quickly as possible
finally he reaches the second chair behind them and drops down into it
looking at the lift pole from this position he can clearly see that it wasnt as close to the chair as it looked
but its possible
parker needs to yell to hear him now
he assesses the situation
its going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder and he is winded beyond belief
to himself the two stare at each other from the distance
both of their weather beaten faces are a mess
parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the ground holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady
stoically lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath
he climbs up onto the chair back and looks down
parker closes her eyes and prays
the wolves below do not break their stare
their hungry eyes are willing lynch to fall from the chair
its now or never
lynch contd yaaaaugh
he throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder
he lands and hooks his arm around a rung
with a snap his arm dislocates from its socket but he is hooked on to the ladder
lynch contd rrrrugh
with his bad arm dangling by his side lynch works his way down the icy metal ladder
finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a thud into the snow
the wolves ears are at attention
they watch carefully from the safety of the bushes
one the leader takes a cautious single step forward and waits
then the wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk towards lynchs body
one step at a time
as the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and towards lynch
it is revealed that he is only winded
he feels his body for damage wincing at what can only be a broken rib or two
his right arm is twisted at an odd angle and by the look on lynchs face it must be either broken or fractured in addition to being dislocated
the wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks
the other wolves watch from the bushes
lynch gets himself to his feet
his body is in massive pain but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight through it
he moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair
the leader growls
drool drips down from beneath its hungry mouth as it takes a step back
the wolf leader advances on lynch
lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature
lynch contd come on
try something fucker
the wolf stares back at him growling
their eyes are locked
lynch swings the pole at it angrily
the leader shies away but growls harder
lynch contd a second wolf rushes lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth
lynch contd the rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill
parker looks from lynch to the ground way below her
crying lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm
finally he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolfs body
the wolf shrieks in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack
the impending wolves stop their slow march and wait
this food still has some fight left in it
he moves as fast as he can towards the area under parkers chair swinging his weapon like a madman all the while
the wolves only stare
finally he reaches the area and grabs dans snowboard still sticking up in the snow
lynch contd parker im gonna go get help
dont move and ill be back as fast as i can
just dont move
im getting help
without hesitation lynch throws down dans board and lays his body on top of it
pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill
from parkers pov she watches him disappear down the hill
but mere seconds later the pack of wolves gives chase and follow suit behind him over the horizon
only the creaking of the strained metal chair arm can be heard now
parker sobs quietly to herself
from a distance parkers broken chair dangles dangerously in the night air
her body is slumped in the corner
parker is not moving in her chair
the morning sun hits parkers pale face
is she dead
parker opens her eyes
she must have drifted off for the night
she looks to the tree line around her
the sun is coming up
she tries to move her body to look back in lynchs direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise
to herself lynch
there is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down the hill behind her
slowly a look of great determination comes over her face
she raises the safety bar
there is no more time to think
she is going to die one way or another
slowly parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair
holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair she beings to lower herself inch by inch off of the side
the lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap
parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair
a gust of wind pushes against the chair straining the arm
parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as she inches her body even lower
smoothly slowly almost there snap
the bolt gives way
the chair lurches down at an even greater angle sending parker off of the side
parker contd whirrr
no longer attached with the safety bolts the chair falls several feet and then stops
it is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line
parkers hands catch at the base of the chair and she is dangling fully beneath it
while it is still a long drop
her feet are now a good feet closer to the ground if not more
the metal wire will not hold for more than a few seconds
the chair is going to fall
parker closes her eyes
all sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her heartbeat
the camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the wind
slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall
the camera inches closer in to her face from below
her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally
she lets go
as her body falls from the chair the flimsy wire finally gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down to the ground after her
parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her
she rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot
she is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years
surveying the damage her ankle is badly broken underneath the side of the chair that landed on it
her boot is at an unnatural angle
adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it
she looks around for her snow board but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone
parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can
parker comes down the hill gaining some speed on her awkward coat sled
as she makes her way she spots a tree
with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it
cautiously she slows herself down
from parkers pov the camera slowly reveals what is just beyond the bloody tree
but the look on parkers face tells us everything we need to know first
there in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree is the pack of wolves
some still feeding
others resting attentively
they are circled around lynchs bloody half eaten remains
quick shots of his jacket his boots and his gloved hand all flash before parkers devastated eyes
she slows herself to a complete stop now
not knowing what to do
one of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see parker just a few feet away
it is the pack leader
lynchs blood pools from its jaws
its ears go back and it growls loudly at parker
she makes eye contact with the beast who stares back at her almost daring her to try and take its treasure
others from the pack look up distracted briefly but then go back to feeding
parker and the pack leader lock eyes
finally the leader turns away from parker back to his food
back to his family
though her face is emotionless parkers eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side
she is free
parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls around her
occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill from her awkward coat sled
but she pulls herself back on and continues to make her way down the hill stoically
parker reaches the bottom of the hill
grunting and crying from the pain she crawls over on her belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot
parker drags her devastated body into the street
just as she gets there
a honking car races past with its windshield wipers blaring
narrowly missing being splattered she collapses in the dirty road
there are no more cars to be seen
she is alone
all that she can do is clutch the ground
another car approaches in the distance
she holds her hand up weakly
a driver male s is cautiously driving down the wet icy road
he reaches down to adjust the radio
he looks back up to reveal parkers body in the road in front of him
he swerves with a loud skid
partially off the road in a skid his car comes to a stop
instantly he jumps out and runs to the body on the road
are you ok
parker is not moving
he runs over to her side
driver contd lady
are you alright
parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief
driver contd hold on hold on were gonna get you help
he lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car
the driver drives frantically speaking into his cell phone
into phone i dont know
i found her laying in the road alone
looks like she was in some sort of accident
right outside of mount holliston
im taking her to you now
through the passenger side window we see parkers blank face
if we didnt know better wed think she was a rotten cadaver at this point
reflected in the glass are the lights of a papa ginos restaurant store front that goes past
her eyes blink at the sign
hold on maam
the hospital is minutes away
youre gonna be ok
the camera is tighter on her eyes
driver contd youre gonna be ok
tight on just one eye
driver contd now in dans voice youre gonna be ok baby
her eye closes
