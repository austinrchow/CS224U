written by tracy letts foreboding
heat lightning in the distance
miles of unforgiving summer scorched prairie
life is very long
two lanes not a car in sight
cracked asphalt undulates over gentle browned hills disappears into an infinite horizon
not the first person to say it certainly not the first person to think it
an empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock
but hes given credit for it because he bothered to write it down
at the end of a long gravel road
surrounded by towering black walnuts and lace bark elms
a farm once no ones put a plow to earth here in decades
so if you say it you have to say his name after it
life is very long ts eliot
absolutely goddamn right
wrap around porches forgotten gardens
imposing in the gathering gloom
a single downstairs window glows
give the devil his due
very few poets couldve made it through eliots trial and come out brilliantined and double breasted and anglican
august final white draft
and now a face fills the screen beverly weston
a craggy wise and deeply sad okie
we take a long moment just to study that face
not hard to imagine faced with eliots first wife lovely viv how crane or berryman might have reacted just foot raced to the nearest bridge olympian suicidalists
stares out the window at the darkening ominous horizon
not eliot after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it
he sits at a cluttered desk his face damp with sweat
nurses a glass of whiskey his staggered delivery due more to his careful selection of words than drunkenness
hes talking to someone we do not yet see
god a mighty
you have to admire the purity of the survivors instinct
from somewhere upstairs a thud
he looks to the ceiling
she takes pills sometimes a great many
among other things her equilibrium
fortunately they eliminate her need for equilibrium
full of shadows
she sits up slowly from rumpled sheets
were on her profile close silhouetted against the faint light from the open bathroom door
she hesitates on the edge of the bed getting her bearings
finds a pack of winstons lights one
listens to the voices filtering up from below
august final white draft
beverly shifts waiting for the sound of more movement from the rooms overhead
when there is none my wife takes pills and i drink
thats the bargain weve struck
she gathers herself to stand
moves to the door
we follow her closely
her hair unkempt her steps unsteady into the reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential
the hallway walls lined with photos of long dead pioneer ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters
the facts are my wife takes pills and i drink
thats the bargain weve struck just one paragraph of our marriage contract
and these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional american routine
she makes her way to the stairs starts down
rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship ive chosen to turn my life over to a higher power and
join the ranks of the hiring class
the light from the study slices across the living room
its not a decision with which im entirely comfortable
i know how to launder my dirty undies
done it all my life but im finding its getting in the way of my drinking
she can see a portion of beverlys desk a womans legs

sorry about the heat in here

she does not believe in air conditioning
as if it is a thing to be disbelieved
i knew your father you know
bought many a watermelon from mr youngbloods fruit stand
he did pass didnt he

he had a heart attack
fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes

she stands in the shadows of the living room confused
am i looking through window

she steps into the study emerging from the darkness into light to reveal violet weston
dissipated dishevelled late sixties

by night within that ancient house immense black damned anonymous
and my last refuge my books simple pleasures like finding wild onions by the side of a road or requited love

beat here we go round the prickly pear
prickly pear prickly pear
here we go round the prickly pear
light fractures and scatters above
the surface undulating gently as we glide through a lakes dark tenebrous waters on a moonlit night
a rowboat slips across our field of vision
its aluminum hull cutting through the calm above sending out small waves as it makes its way slowly past
oars dip in on either side propelling the small craft toward deeper water
we wait watch and then suddenly something large hits the surface above indistinct exploding the calm coming towards us sinking fast as titles end prone silhouetted against a sunlit window
across the room
a body her back to us
the phone rings
the body doesnt move
a girls voice calls from downstairs
the phone continues to ring
still no movement
the ringing stops
a moment of silence followed by irritated teenage footsteps on the carpeted stairs
the hallway door opens were in august final white draft
jean fourteen precocious sticks her head in
a sound from the body still no movement
you didnt hear the phone
if its your father tell him to fuck off
its aunt ivy in oklahoma
she sits up
close on barbara fordham late forties fully dressed
she gropes for the phone
barb stands moves slowly to the window
outside identical suburban homes neutral house colors lawns
we study barb as she listens
greying roots no make up a few extra pounds
a woman who for reasons we dont yet understand has decided to stop giving a damn
jean passes in the hall
stops watching as her mother slowly dissolves reaches for the sill lowers herself to sit
a battered honda civic makes its way up the long drive from the highway below dust swirling behind it
the honda parks
ivy weston forties shy and soft spoken attractive enough but expert at hiding it climbs out
stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house
the precarious old barn out back and untended flower beds

johnna washes a dish at the sink
watches ivys arrival through the kitchen window
makes no motion to go to her ivy steps into the dark house
drapes drawn lights off
no answer mom
steps into the open door of her fathers study
his vacant desk chair untouched papers dust mots settling in the sunlight
she takes a moment then heads upstairs
carrying us with her
finds violet in her bedroom sitting in front of her vanity in near darkness smoking and on the phone
youve been out there
barely acknowledges ivys arrival
the room is unruly
clothes draped over chairs
dresser and night stands cluttered with pills tissue boxes creams and lotions
youre going out yourself
ivy wanders into the bath
more pills wet towels on the floor
she turns off the dripping faucet
picks up towels
violet is off the phone standing in hall watching ivy
ivy stops briefly chastened
violet opens a bottle of pills

this isnt your place
the body needs sunlight
jean has on headphones listening to her walkman in the back
barbaras estranged husband bill fordham drives the rental
barbs in the passenger seat beside him watching the brown countryside pass by
what were these people thinking
the jokers who settled this place

bill slows the rental car to turn
barb looks down the road and across the field to where the farm house peeks out through the trees beckoning threatening ominous
bill pulls the rental in front of the house
turns off the ignition
neither moves to get out
jean realizes theyve stopped pulls off her headphones
im gonna grab a smoke
jean heads for the relative privacy of the fence at the edge of the yard
leaving bill and barb alone watching
youve encouraged that
i havent encouraged anything
you admire her for getting hooked at fourteen makes her seem even more mature
barbara climbs out
goddamn its hot
bill unlocks the trunk begins unloading luggage
suppose your moms turned on the air conditioner
remember the parakeets

so she went to the pet store and raised hell and they gave her another parakeet
that one died after one day
august final white draft
so she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too
so the chick from the pet store came out here to see just what in the hell this serial parakeet killer was doing to bump off these birds
they head for the house with suitcases wilting in the heat
it was too hot
they were dying from the heat
these are tropical birds all right

johnna keeps working jean watches
i like your necklace
a beaded pouch in the shape of a turtle
did you make that

my umbilical cord
ewww are you serious
when a cheyenne is born their umbilical cord is dried and sewn into a pouch
august final white draft
like that movie powwow highway

if we lose it our souls belong nowhere and when we die our souls walk the earth looking for where we belong
johnna starts back for the house with her mint
off jean a screened in back porch off the kitchen
bill and barb sit at an old linoleum table
this was when
violet stands smoking unhappily watching charlie and mattie fae climb into the caddie and disappear down the gravel drive heading back to tulsa
the indian girl made us biscuits and gravy
we ate some he walked out the door this door right there
got into his truck
and that was it
johnna enters with her mint crosses into the kitchen
he just left
i went to bed saturday night got up sunday

i didnt make much of it thought hed gone out on a bender
why would he do that
not like he couldnt drink at home
unless you were riding his ass
i never said anything to him about his drinking never got on him about it
august final white draft
barbara i swear
he could drink himself into obliv uh obliv en um
so sunday still no sign of him
i started getting worried dontcha know
thats when i got worked up about that safety deposit box
we kept an awful lot of cash in that box some expensive jewelry
i had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars johnna returns with glasses of iced tea each with a sprig of mint delivers them to bill
wait wait wait im missing something
why do you care about a safety deposit box
well i know what youll say about this but your father and i had an urge ment
if something were to ever happen to one of us the other one would go empty that box
the money and jewelry gets rolled into the estate bank seals the box until probate is settled
can take months
right thats right youre such a fucking cynic
august final white draft
i knew you would disapprove johnna cuts into a freshly baked apple pie in the kitchen
okay what about the safety deposit box
i had to wait for the bank to open on monday
and after i emptied that box i called the police and reported him missing
and you only had ivy call me today
i didnt want to worry you honey jesus christ
vi you sure there wasnt some event that triggered his leaving some incident
you mean like a fight
johnna places pieces of pie in front of bill and barb
and we fought enough
but no he just left
maybe he needed some time away from you
thats nice of you to say
good old unfathomable dad

ivy enters with her coffee cup runs water in it at the sink
outside her mother sister and bill on the back porch

johnna stands joins ivy at the sink
ivy hadnt seen her there

he didnt ask me just hired this woman to come live in our house
few days before he left

ivy looks to johnna embarrassed
but johnna just takes ivys cup from her finishes cleaning it
you have a problem with indians violet
i dont know what to say to an indian
theyre called native americans now mom
who makes that decision
its what they like to be called
august final white draft
they arent any more native than me
in fact they are
whats wrong with indian
whys it so hard to call people lets just call the dinosaurs native americans while were at it
she may be an indian but she makes the best goddamn apple pie i ever ate
johnna smiles nods to ivy
leaves the kitchen
he hired a cook
it doesnt make any sense
we dont eat
and now you get biscuits and gravy

favorite dont pretend you dont know that
barbara follows bill
ivy finds iced tea pours herself some
tries to make herself invisible its not hard to do
id prefer to think my parents loved all their children equally
violet trails behind them into the kitchen
im sure youd prefer to think that santy claus brought you presents at christmas too
if youd had more than one child youd know a parent always has favorites
mattie fae was my mothers favorite
i got used to it
you were your daddys favorite
august final white draft
barbara notices ivy standing there christ
this isnt a conversation shed like to be having in front of her sister
violet sees ivy too could care less

youre wrong there
you never wouldve gotten beverly weston out of oklahoma
daddy gave me his blessing

now youre going to tell me the true story some terrible shit daddy said behind my back
everybodys on edge beverly didnt say terrible things behind your back vi come on he just told me hes disappointed in you because you settled

i dont know what it is about dad splitting that put mom on hymen patrol
then dont say anything about mom and dad okay
they want to play it low key
bill stands in beverlys empty study
absorbing the room the man the stillness
picks at the papers on the desk without specific purpose
turns to one of the many bookcases eventually finds a book smiles
barbara sits on the front steps
its dark now but still very hot
moths bat at the porch lights
bill comes out carrying a coke shares it with barb

first edition hardback mint condition
academy fellowship wallace stevens award
this book was a big deal
it wasnt that big a deal
in those circles it was
those are small circles
he opens the book perusing the first pages
dedicated to my violet
christ probably every word he wrote after this he had to be thinking what are they going to say are they going to compare it to meadowlark
jean go to bed
just turned out the light
youd think at some point you just write something anyway and who cares what they say about it
i dont know will you shut up about that fucking book
you are just dripping with envy over these thirty poems my father wrote back in the late sixties for gods sake
bills taken aback but doesnt want to overreact
i have great admiration for these poems august final white draft
my father didnt write anymore for a lot of reasons but critical opinion was not one of them hard as that may be for you to believe
what are you attacking me for
i havent done anything
im sure thats what you tell sissy too so she can comfort you reassure you no billy you havent done anything
why are you bringing that up
theyre all symptoms of your male menopause whether its you struggling with the creative question or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer

barbara heads into the yard to get away from him
jeans on the small bed in the darkened room
staring at the ceiling listening to her parents argue
bill chases barbara into the yard
ive copped to being a narcissist

oh men always say shit like that as if the past and the future dont exist
jean listens in the dark to her parents fighting as she has many times before
heads out into the hallway to screen door leading to the upstairs porch
its just horseshit to avoid talking about the things theyre afraid to say
im not necessarily keen on the notion of saying things that would hurt you
we have enough on our hands with your parents right now lets not revisit this
when did we visit this to begin with

jean sees her father coming hears his footsteps approaching across the wooden porch below the screen door opens quietly
she slips back into her room and bed but he doesnt stop
jean waits listening for her mother
she doesnt come
were on the old wooden dock watching a man walking away from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the dock in the moonlight
he leans down to untie the boat looks back at us directly into camera beverly
now were traveling below the surface of the lake through its dark tenebrous waters on the moonlit night
the rhythmic slap of gentle waves
were underwater light fractures and scatters above us
weve been here before as a rowboat slips across our field of vision
its aluminum bottom cuts through the calm above
oars dip on either side propelling the small craft
we wait watch until suddenly something hits the surface above exploding the calm coming at us fast sinking
johnna wakes with a start
sits up listens intently
johnna steps out onto the second floor porch balcony finds a police car approaching in the distance headlights cutting through the dark country night
barefoot johnna quietly descends the stairs
approaches the front door left open to let in the cool night air
undoes the screen door latch
watches the car arrive
the drivers door opens a sheriff gets out silhouetted against the police flashers behind him
august final white draft
barbara bleary eyed moves quickly down the dark hall in her robe
bill follows in his boxers and t shirt pulling on pants
barb goes to vis door knocks
she opens the door
over her we find violet entombed in her room
squinting against the intrusive hall light

bill shakes the sheriffs hand
the sheriff speaks earnestly to barbara and bill
we cant hear whats being said only murmurs until barbara sinks to her knees
bill holds her
august final white draft
johnna enters snaps on the light starts a pot of coffee
a big pre dawn sky is changing from black to blue
the sheriff walks to his cruiser kills the flashers
bill joins him still barefoot
couple old boys running jug lines in the lake hooked him
pulled him up
thats how he died from drowning
bill looks off
song birds begin their pre dawn chatter
is there any way to determine if he
i mean is this an accident or suicide
theres really no way to tell
whats your guess
and now the full weight of it hits bill
after a moment how does a a person jump in the water
and choose not to swim
barb pulls on clothes rakes a brush through her hair
jean appears in the door watches her
after a moment august final white draft
what about aunt ivy
i guess well stop on the way
christ i need to call karen too
why the fuck am i brushing my hair
she drops the brush
and then an odd sound intrudes from downstairs a song lay down sally by eric clapton
the music is loud
we follow barbara and jean halfway down the stairs to reveal violet high as a kite doing a jerky little dance by the stereo
the sheriff stands uncomfortably by the door his hat in hand
she shuffles over to him
did sum beer ley come home
cig zezz cig zizz
she laughs at her inability to speak
he takes a pall mall from his shirt pocket hands it to her
lights it for her

the suns just topped the horizon throws long early shadows across the flat expanse of prairie
scattered trees a ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake telephone poles
were high above the country road following the sheriff cruiser below
barbs rental sedan trails behind
i used to go out with that boy
bill drives ivy up front with him
barbara sits in the back with jean

the cruiser slows pulls through a pipe gate and over a cattle crossing heads for a small collection of emergency vehicles parked around a brush strewn cove
bevs old chevy pick up truck sits to one side

thank god we cant tell the future
wed never get out of bed

a resolute bill returns to get barbara and ivy
the sisters climb out follow him to the waters edge
jean waits a moment then steps out of the car
watches her father lead her mother down the small cracked concrete boat ramp to where the sheriff waits by a covered body
as the sheriff pulls back the tarp white walls bright overhead light
were close on a mans pale lifeless hand
another hand enters frame with a sponge begins cleaning off the mud filth
the weston clan walks to beverlys lincoln bill jean

beverlys sodden shoes are removed his socks
august final white draft
his limp greyish arm is guided into a starched white shirt sleeve
the buttons carefully buttoned
jean beside him
barbara and ivy sit in the back seat flanking violet
they ride in silence
we study their faces the brown countryside outside
bill notices something in his rearview a red speck coming up fast very fast
a sports car
its suddenly right behind them filling his mirrors
it waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales to pass in the opposite lane then roars around
a ferrari its throaty v rumbling as it screams past accelerates down the road
bill and jean exchange a look watch it disappear
strong male hands lift beverlys now dressed body carefully and place it into the casket
adjust the pillow comb his hair into place fold his hands across his chest
we never see his face never see his whole body
only these small intimate pieces
a few mourners enter the church as bill pulls in to park discovers the ferrari already there
a woman emerging

made and where were we going to vacation that winter and hed surprise me with tickets to belize and wed kiss
barbara drives karen beside her
heat radiates off the road
they follow charlies caddie vi and ivy visible in the caddies back seat window ahead of us
i mean id kiss my pillow and then id tell him id been to the doctor that day and id found out i was pregnant
i know how pathetic that sounds but it was innocent enough
then real life takes over cause it always does uh huh here comes the red speck in the rearview again
the ferrari roars up behind them pulls around to pass honks as it goes
barb catches a glimpse of jean in the passenger seat bill jammed into the tiny back seat
things dont work out like you planned
that pillow was a better husband than any real man id ever met this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations all of them so much less
than daddy or bill

oh now youre still beautiful
one of those lies we tell to give us comfort
women are beautiful when theyre young and not after
men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age
not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists
some men can maintain a weary masculinity
women just get old and fat and wrinkly
i beg your pardon

what makes her that way
taut skin firm boobs an ass above her knees

women arent sexy when theyre old

were inside the bus sitting next to a man little charles thirty seven rangy and awkward
he stares pensively out at the passing pawhuska storefronts as the bus slows pulls into a parking lot next to the bank
he spots charlie waiting drinking a coke
little charles exhales stands

barbara bursts out of the back porch screen and into the yard heading to the old barn
phantom of the opera you dont remember what it was like to be fourteen
shes old enough to exhibit a little character
but thats something you normally learn from your parents
thats a shot across my bow right
i missed something
august final white draft
instilling character our burden as parents
i got that part
and you really havent been much of a parent lately so its tough to just because you and i are struggling with this gordian knot doesnt mean nice gordian knot
but her fourteen year old self might view it differently might consider it abandonment oh come on shes a little more sophisticated than that dont you think
barbara kicks at an old stuck door
enters makes her way to the back where old dinner chairs hang from nails pounded into the overhead beams
pretty fucking sophisticated the restored whatever from phantom of the opera i know that makes your dick hard barbara precocious little shit

barbara hands dusty battered chairs back to bill

oh forsook you and the horse you rode in on each now with chairs in hand head out into and the blinding sunlight
start back for the house

im sick of the whole notion of the enduring female
cause while youre going through your fifth puberty the world is falling apart and your kid cant handle it
august final white draft
our kid is just trying to deal with this goddamn madhouse youve dragged her into
this madhouse is my home
think about that statement for a second why dont you
jean is here with me because this is a family event
jeans here with you because shes a buffer between you and the shrill insanity of your mother
yknow youd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility
you cant resist can you
youre a pretty easy mark
youre so goddamn self righteous you know
youre so surely you mustve known when you started porking pippi longstocking you were due for a little self righteousness just a smidge of indignation on my part maybe i
split because of it
theyve reached the back porch stairs
she turns on him
is this your confession then when you finally unload all
august final white draft
youre thoughtful barbara but youre not open
youre passionate but youre hard
youre a good decent funny wonderful woman and i love you but youre a pain in the ass
bill pushes past her up the stairs disappears inside
violet stands in the middle of the room
sunlight streams in through the windows surrounding her
approaches beverlys swivel chair touches the back

jean so im curious when you say you dont eat meat you mean you dont eat meat of any kind
and is that for health reasons or
when you eat meat you ingest an animals fear
i thought she said how do you do that
you cant eat fear
sure you can
what happens to you when you feel afraid
doesnt your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions
adrenaline and and your body goes through a whole chemical process when it experiences fear
august final white draft
yep and cortisol dont you think an animal experiences fear
you bet it does
i used to work in a cattle processing plant lot of fear flying around that place
so when you eat an animal youre eating all that fear it felt when it was slaughtered to make food
you mean ive been eating fear what three times a day for sixty years
this one wont have a meal less theres meat in it
i guess its the way i was raised but it just doesnt seem like a legitimate meal less it has some meat somewhere if i make a pasta dish of
some kind hell be like okay thats good for an appetizer now wheres the meat
wheres the meat
isnt that some tv commercial the old lady says wheres the meat

she pulls a bottle from her pocket holds them up
august final white draft
ysee these little blue babies

barbara lunges at the bottle she and vi wrestle for it
gimme those goddamn pills ill eat you alive girl
bill and ivy try to restrain barbara mattie fae tries to restrain violet
others rise ad lib
holy shit barbara stop it
hey now cmon
oh god violet wrests the pills from barb
bill pulls barb back into her seat
violet shakes the bottle taunting barb
barb lunges again grabs her mother by the hair toppling chairs they crash into the tumble to the floor
the family rushes after them into the living room
barb has her mother pinned on the floor and is strangling her
bill and charlie struggle to pull barbara off pry her fingers off violets throat and get her away
johnna and mattie fae rush to violet get her to a chair
goddamn you barb
johnna help ivy in the kitchen bill and jean upstairs with me

karen call dr

this is my house
this is my house
you dont get it do you
she strides to her mother looms over her
the hallway is empty but we hear the sounds of the search coming from the bedroom
barbara appears looks through the linen closet looking behind stacked towels and old electric blankets
finds a bottle of pills in the back
ivy comes upstairs followed closely by karen
hold out pill bottles barb adds them to the ones shes already collected in a large ziplock bag
thats all we could find
barb heads for the bathroom lifts the toilet seat
begins dumping pills into the bowl
karen examines the bottles
burke write her so many prescriptions
doesnt he know
its not just him
shes got a doctor in every port
august pink draft
you knew this was going on again
finished emptying the pills barb flushes the toilet steps to her mothers open bedroom door looks in
violet lays motionless on the bed in the semi darkness facing the wall still fully clothed
ivy and karen join her
they stare at their mothers comatose form
finally now what
lots of wine
barbara ivy karen and the remains of the dinner wine sit around the table in the backyard gazebo
think we can goad mom into giving burke her greatest generation speech tomorrow tell him about the claw hammer
august yellow pages
wont do any good hes part of the same generation
greatest generation my ass
what makes them so great
because they were poor and hated nazis
who doesnt fucking hate nazis
remember when we checked her in the psych ward that stunt she pulled
big speech shes getting clean making this incredible sacrifice for her family shes let us down but now shell prove shes a good mother
i wasnt there
she smuggled darvocet into the psych ward
in her vagina
theres your greatest generation for you
she made this speech to us while she was clenching a bottle of pills in her cooch for gods sake
god ive never heard this story
august yellow pages
did you just say cooch
the phrase moms pussy seems gauche
youre a little more comfortable with cooch are you
what word should i use to describe our mothers vagina
i dont know but moms beaver
oh god barbara
as their laughter slowly dies down one thing about mom and dad
you have to tip your cap to anyone who can stay married that long
he killed himself
is there something going on between you and little charles
i dont know that im comfortable talking about that
august pink draft a
because you know hes our first cousin
give me a break
you know you shouldnt consider children
i cant anyway i had a hysterectomy last year
barbara and karen stare at ivy
august blue draft
i didnt know
neither did i
i didnt tell anyone except charles
thats where it started between us
and hear it from mom the rest of my life
she doesnt need another excuse to treat me like some damaged thing
you might have told us
you didnt tell us about you and bill
because its you and not me
because divorce is an embarrassing public admission of defeat
cancers fucking cancer you cant help that
were your sisters
i dont feel that connection very keenly
i feel very connected to both of you
we never see you youre never around you havent been around august blue draft
i still feel that connection
i cant perpetuate these myths of family or sisterhood anymore
were just people some of us accidentally connected by genetics a random selection of cells
when did you get so cynical
thats funny coming from you
bitter sure but random selection of cells
maybe my cynicism came with the realization that the responsibility of caring for our parents was mine alone
dont give me that
i participated till you had enough and got out you and karen both
im not criticizing
do what you want
you did karen did
and if you didnt thats not my fault
thats right so dont lay this sister thing on me all right
when i leave here i wont feel any more guilty than you two did
i cant believe your world view is this dark
you live in florida
august pink draft
youre thinking of leaving
charles and i are going to new york
barb bursts out in derisive laughter
karen joins her
what are you going to do in new york
we have plans
none of your business
what about mom
what about her
you feel comfortable leaving mom here
then you think she was tough when he was alive
think what its going to be like now
to karen youre going back to miami right
ivy stands gathers up her wine glass
august blue draft
there you go barb
you want to know what were doing about mom
karen and i are leaving
you want to stay thats your decision
but nobody gets to point a finger at me
ivy starts back for the house
the weston women head for the house
my girls all together
hearing you just now gave me a warm feeling
violet sits on the swing in the semi darkness smoking her hair wrapped in a towel
they hadnt seen her
how long has she been there
august blue draft
you had a bath
you need something to eat
no honey im fine
then this house must have heard a lot of weston girl secrets
karen moves to her mother sits next to her on the swing
barb leans against a fence post ivy hangs back
i get embarrassed just thinking about it
karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse
nothing to be embarrassed about
secret crushes secret schemes
province of teenage girls
i cant imagine anything more delicate or bittersweet
some part of you girls i always identified with
no matter how old you get a womans hard pressed to throw off that part of herself
to karen re hand creme that smells good
you want some
violet puts out her cigarette
karen passes her the creme
i ever tell you the story of raymond qualls
not much story to it
boy i had a crush on when i was thirteen or so
rough looking boy beat up levis messy hair
august final white draft
but he had these beautiful cowboy boots shiny chocolate leather
he was so proud of those boots you could tell way hed strut around all arms and elbows puffed up and cocksure
i decided i needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and i convinced myself hed ask me to go steady
hed see me in those boots and say now theres the gal for me
violet lights another cigarette
found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy praying for those boots rehearsing the conversation id have with raymond when he saw me in my boots
mustve asked my momma a hundred times if i could get those boots
what do you want for christmas vi
momma ill give all of it up just for those boots
bargaining you know
she started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up about the size of a boot box nice wrapping paper
now vi dont you cheat and look in there before christmas morning
little smile on her face
christmas morning i was up like a shot boy under the tree tearing open that box
there was a pair of boots all right
mens work boots holes in the toes chewed up laces caked in mud and dog shit
lord my momma laughed for days
please dont tell me thats the end of the story
thats the end
ivy shakes her head goes inside
shes had enough of violet to last a lifetime
you never got the boots
august pink draft
no huh uh
okay well thats the worst story i ever heard
that makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story
my momma was a nasty mean old lady
i suppose thats where i get it from
an awkward moment
youre not nasty mean
youre our mother and we love you
thank you sweetheart
karen leans her head against her mothers shoulder takes her mothers hand
off barbara watching this barbara wakes takes a moment to get her bearings
early sunlight pours in
bills still asleep
she sits up studies him
surprised to find him beside her
august pink draft
barbara stands in the door
closes her eyes letting the early morning sun warm her
after a long moment johnna appears with a coffee mug
barb takes it nods her thanks
last time i spoke with my father we talked about the state of the world and he said you know this country was always pretty much a whorehouse but at
least it used to have some promise
now its just a shithole
i think maybe he was talking about something else something more specific personal
there was something sad in his voice not sad he always sounded sad hopeless
as if it had already happened
as if whatever was disappearing had already disappeared
and no one saw it go
this country this experiment america this hubris what a lament if no one saw it go
fordham are you going to fire me
but ill understand if you want to quit
i mean theres work
and then theres work
im familiar with this job
i can do this job
i dont do it for you or mrs
or even for mr
i do it for me
i need the work
johnna did my father say anything to you
august final white draft
he just seemed like maybe he had
he talked about
beat he talked a lot about his daughters his three daughters and his granddaughter
that was his joy
that makes me feel better
knowing that you can lie
barbara sits opposite dr
burke a genial charming and remotely creepy small town doctor
violet is visible out in the waiting room karen sitting with her
the chemotherapy and the radiation coupled with the overuse of pain medications right and without the benefit of more thorough testing an mri or ct scan i believe your mother
is showing signs of mild cognitive impairment
mild cognitive impairment
it may be time to consider placing her in a long term care facility
id certainly feel more comfortable knowing she was receiving that level of supervision
that would make you comfortable
you would be comfortable with that
of course its a family decision
august final white draft
you want us to send her to where a psychiatric hospital
well beverlys gone
not gone so much as dead but i see your point
ivy suppresses a laugh
burke looks at ivy confused
legal guardianship for you and your sisters with my recommendation should be a simple leave me out of this thanks
so youre thinking that if the three of us cooperated with you on a commitment end around wed be less likely to sue your ass
mild cognitive impairment
are you fucking kidding me
you really want to go before a judge and make a case for a couple radiation treatments and some chemo causing brain damage
think you can make that stand up in court
when im sitting at the other table doing this
barbara pulls out the ziplock bag throws a pill bottle at dr
burke bouncing it lightly off his head
all right i think throws another pill bottle at him
know whose name is on these bottles
she hits him with another pill bottle
august final white draft
your mother is a very she hits him with another pill bottle
she hits him with another pill bottle
he relents waits for her to get it out of her system
only one problem with that idea though she hits him with another pill bottle
another pill bottle
and another pill bottle
it seems shes done
but then another pill bottle
well hang on to the bucket of these we have at home
for your trial
she gets up to go gets to the door turns and fires one last pill bottle at him
ivy lingers grins at burke
the sun parched indian grass and turkey toot are wilting but stirred by prairie winds
bevs old lincoln follows a thread of blacktop through the tall grass
barb drives ivy up front
karens in the back with violet
pull the car over
well be home in a few minutes
pull the car over
beat im going to be sick
barbara looks back sees her mother means this literally pulls to the side of the road
violet gets out quickly
we stay with barbara as she climbs out of the car stares across the road waiting for violet who can be heard retching
karen and ivy still in the car
august final white draft
the sound fades as barbara contemplates the prairie and for a long moment
loses herself back to this land to her home
her expression is unreadable enigmatic
then behind her out of focus we become aware of violet running away across the prairie through the tall grass
barbara turns simply to get back in the car sees violet running through the field
violet keeps running
where are you going
barbara watches for another moment
barbara takes off after her
ivy and karen climb out but dont follow
shield their eyes to watch the chase
its an odd sight the two women racing through the grass
one almost seventy the other nearing fifty
barbara is slow in her pursuit at first maybe because of her shoes or maybe because she just feels silly
then realizes that violet is not stopping
not unless barbara stops her
violet runs through the tall grass puts a foot wrong goes down
barbara catches up out of breath collapses
they lay on the ground wheezing sweating
where the fuck are you going mom
and now we see the full beauty of the land the distant horizon the high cumulous clouds the endless blue sky
barb and violet two dots lost in the unforgiving prairie
theres nowhere to go
barb pulls the lincoln in beside charlies caddie and ivys honda
shuts off the engine
ivy and karen climb out start back for the house
barbara turns to violet
august final white draft
please honey no its important i say this
i lost my temper at dinner and went too far
the day the funeral
i was spoiling for a fight and you gave it to me
they take a long moment then what now
how do you mean
dont you think you should at least consider a rehab center
karen turns realizing theyre not following
should she go back to the car
she decides no continues inside
i cant go through that again
no i can do this
you got rid of my pills right
all we could find
i dont have that many hiding places
mom now come on
you wanna search me
august final white draft
if the pills are gone ill be fine
just need a few days to get my feet under me
i cant imagine what all this must be like for you right now
i just want you to know youre not alone
if you need any help i dont need help
i want to help
i dont need your help
i dont need your help
ive gotten myself through some
i know how this goes once all the talkings through people go back to their own nonsense
i know that
so dont worry about me
i get by
violet gets out heads inside
barbara watches her go
ivy finds little charles watching television
is the coast clear
ivy waits until karen passes through heads upstairs
what are you watching
august final white draft
can i watch it with you
i wish you would
she sits beside him on the couch
i almost blew it last night
she nods are you mad at me
they hold hands
i was trying to be brave
i want everyone to know that i got what i always wanted
and that means
im not a loser
he turns to look at her
youre my hero
he considers this
then breaks into a huge smile mutes the tv goes to the ancient oak electric piano turns it on
come on help me push the pedal
she joins him on the piano bench
i wrote this for you
he plays and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song
its charming touching
august final white draft
she smiles he smiles back
midway through mattie fae enters watches for a moment
then breaks the spell
get yourself together we have to get home and take care of those damn dogs
theyve probably eaten the drapes by now
charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag
im sure the house is fine
notices the tv oh look honey little charles has got the tv on
no i was just this one watches so much television its rotted his brain
im sure thats not true
what was it i caught you watching the other day
i dont remember
mattie fae you do so remember some dumb talk show about people swapping wives
i dont remember
you dont remember
to ivy too bad there isnt a job where they pay you to sit around watching tv
august final white draft
cmon mattie fae still to ivy yknow he got fired from a shoe store
mattie fae were gonna get in the car and go home and if you say one more mean thing to that boy im going to kick your fat irish ass
onto the highway
you hear me
what the hell did you say
you kids go outside would you please
ivy and little charles go
i dont understand this meanness
i look at you and your sister and the way you talk to people and i dont understand it
i cant understand why folks cant be respectful of one another
i dont think theres any excuse for it
my family didnt treat each other that way
maybe thats because your family you had better not say anything about my family right now
i mean it
we buried a man yesterday i loved very much
and whatever faults he may have had he was a good kind decent person
and to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors beverlys memory
weve been married thirty eight years
i wouldnt trade them for anything
but if you cant find a generous place in your heart for your own son were not going to make it to thirty nine
she takes a moment to collect herself turns to follow finds barbara standing out in the open kitchen door
theres an awkward moment
august final white draft
i didnt mean to eavesdrop
thats you have a cigarette hon
no i quit years ago
so did i
just sounded good to me
i thought at dinner
at that horrible dinner last night seemed like something might be going on between ivy and little charles
do you know if thats true
oh this is
im not sure what to
is it true
that cant happen
this is going to be difficult uh
ivy and little charles have always marched to their own
and id expect this to be toughest on you barb
theyre in love
or they think they are
whats the difference right
honey i know its unorthodox for cousins to get together at least these days theyre not cousins
august final white draft
but believe it or not its not as uncommon as you might listen to me
theyre not cousins
little charles is not your cousin
hes your brother
hes your blood brother
he is not your cousin
he is your blood brother
hes your fathers child
which means that he is ivys brother
do you see
little charles and ivy are brother and sister
karen and steve enter from outside
were just going to go away
karen and steve retreat
barbara stares at mattie fae
you and dad
mattie fae nods who knows this
and you do
uncle charlie doesnt suspect
weve never discussed it
weve never discussed it
august final white draft
did dad know
yknow im not proud of this
you people amaze me
what were you drunk
was this just some i wasnt drunk no
maybe its hard for you to believe looking at me knowing me the way you do all these years
i know to you im just your old fat aunt mattie fae
im more than that sweetheart theres more to me than that
i dont know why little charles is such a disappointment to me
maybe he well i dont know why
im disappointed for him more than anything
i made a mistake a long time ago
i paid for it
but the mistake ends here
if ivy found out it would destroy her
im sure as hell not gonna tell her
you have to find a way to stop it
you have to put a stop to it
its late the house still
we move through dark rooms drawn to the murmur of sound and a faint sound coming from outside the kitchen you werent kidding this stuff is strong
number one industry
august final white draft
slowly discover jean and steve sharing a joint out by the fence
she wears a long t shirt he wears sweat pants and a sleeveless t shirt
both are barefoot
number one by far
want a shotgun
off her look you dont know what a shotgun is
i know what a shotgun is
not that kind of shotgun here
just put your lips right next to mine and you inhale while i exhale
he puts the joint in his mouth lit end first
their lips nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a steady stream
she nearly chokes
dont let it out
she finally gasps exhales coughs
thats a kick huh
johnna makes her way down the attic stairs and into the second floor hallway the whispers below unintelligible
johnna steps into the main hallway
drawn to whispers and giggling from outside in the yard
show em to me
i wont look
august final white draft
if you wont look theres no point in showing them to you
youre just an old perv
christ you got a great set
show you mine if youll show me yours
i dont want to see yours perv
johnna approaches carefully cant yet see them
you ever seen one
what are you doing
youre gonna get us both in trouble
im white and over thirty
i dont get in trouble
johnna pushes out the screen to discover steve kissing and groping jean sliding his hand down between her legs
johnna grabs a shovel leaning against the storm cellar door
jean and steve clothes in disarray quickly separate
oh my god
johnna approaches steve menacingly
hold up there lady you dont johnna swings the shovel barely misses steves nose
bedroom lights above snap on
august final white draft
hey goddamn it careful
she swings again hard
the shovel smacks into the arm he puts up to block her smashing his head with the spade
he holds his arm in pain
she wades in with a strong swing and connects with his back
he goes down
johnna stands above him arm cocked watching for him to try and get up
karen rushes out sees steve on the floor
he was messing with jean honey youre bleeding you okay
he groans tries to sit up
bill and barbara run in
jean what are you doing up

ill murder you you prick

to jean tell them i didnt do anything

karen manages to get steve up the porch steps and into the house
barbara bill jean and johnna remain
son of a bitch is a goddamn sociopath
what is the matter with you
will you please stop freaking out
why dont you start at the beginning
what are you even doing up
please sweetheart we need to know what went on here
nothing went on
can we just not make a federal case out of every thing
i came down for a drink he came in
end of story
august final white draft
thats not the end of the thats not the end of the story
we smoked pot alright
we smoked a little pot and we were goofing around and then everything just went crazy
what have i told you about then johnna just chose to smoking that shit
what did attack him with a shovel
its no big deal nothing happened

he didnt do anything
whats the big deal
the big deal jean is that youre fourteen years old
which is only a few years younger than you like em
barbara slaps jean jean bursts into tears
i hate you
yeah i hate you too you little freak
jean tries to head into the house
bill grabs her
jean let me go
jean pulls free runs off
bill gets in barbaras face
whats the matter with you
august final white draft
bill exits pursuing jean
barbara and johnna are left standing there then we follow barb into the kitchen and up the stairs to karen is pulling on a sweatshirt grabbing their clothes stuffing them
into a suitcase
i can do without a speech
where is he
out at the car
back to florida tonight now
me and steve together
want to give me some grief about that
now wait just a goddamn you better find out from jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers
cause i doubt jeans blameless in all this
and im not blaming her just cause i said shes not blameless doesnt mean ive blamed her
im saying she might share in the responsibility
its not cut and dried black and white good and bad
it lives where everything lives somewhere in the middle
where the rest of us live everyone but you
karen hes not perfect
just like the rest of us down here in the muck
im no angel myself
ive done some things im not proud of
things youll never know about
i may even have to do some things im not proud of again
cause sometimes life puts you in a corner that way
august final white draft
and i am a human being after all
you have your own hash to settle
before you start making speeches to the rest of us
ill be in belize
doesnt that sound nice
karen pushes past barb rolling her suitcase behind her
karen bursts through the screen door rushes down the steps to steves waiting ferrari its lights already on engine running
throws her suitcase in the back
barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses slams into gear and accelerates down the drive spewing gravel as it goes
bill comes out watches it disappear with barbara
then im taking jean with me heading back to colorado in the morning
but barbs still focused on the distant ferrari
shes too much for you right now
im sure youll find a way to blame me for all this
beat i cant make it up to jean right now
shes just going to have to wait until i get back to boulder
you and jean have about forty years left to fight and make up
august final white draft
confused why what happens in forty years
i mean no
as a mother as a daughter as a wife
no you dont
ive physically attacked mom and jean in the span of twenty four hours
you stick around here and ill cut off your penis
thats not funny
he starts back inside
youre never coming back to me are you bill
never say never but
even if things dont work out with you and marsha
august final white draft
even if things dont work out
and im never really going to understand why am i
seems he might have more to say but then probably not
she watches him leave
fights back tears
a blistering hot late august day
the weston house sits in bucolic heat weary silence
the driveway no longer crowded with cars
barb stands nearly where she did the night before in her sweats and robe
watching yet another car go
their rental bill behind the wheel backing up
jean in the seat beside him
jean stares blankly at her mother as she rolls past
bill never looks back
the rental heads down the drive passing ivys honda arriving
bill slows for a moment to let ivy pass
then continues on its way back to tulsa and the airport
ivy pulls in next to bevs big lincoln
walks to her sister looks back to the rental leaving
where are bill and jean going
barbara doesnt answer just stands there
barb turns heads for the house ivy follows is she clean
shes moderately clean
august final white draft
you dont like moderately
then lets say tolerably

barbara heads up the porch steps and into lot of fish in the sea
surely you can rule out the one single man in the world youre related to

returning to violet mom charles and i little charles charles and i little charles barbara you have to say little charles or she wont know who youre talking about
little charles and i
ivy will finally get to say the words
little charles and i are little charles and you are brother and sister
i know that
no listen little charles ive always known that
i told you no one slips anything by me
mom dont listen
august final white draft
i knew the whole time bev and mattie fae were carrying on
charlie should have known too if he wasnt smoking all that grass
its the pills talking
your father tore himself up over it thirty some odd years but beverly wouldnt have been beverly if he didnt have plenty to brood about
mom what are you
better you girls know now though now youre older
never know when someone might need a kidney
ivy looks from violet to barbara
suddenly lurches away from the table knocking over her chair
why in gods name did you tell me this
hey what do you care
come on now monsters
whos the injured party here
ivy flees from the dining room pursued by barbara august final white draft
ivy listen leave me alone
when mattie fae told me i didnt know what to do ivy runs from the house
ivy rushes to her car still followed by barbara
i was trying to protect you well go anyway well still go away
ivy gets in the car starts it revs the engine
barbara tries to open the car door
this is not my fault
barbara pounds on the car window
i didnt tell you mom told you
it wasnt me it was mom
the car window slides down
theres no difference
ivy floors the car roars out of the driveway leaving barb standing there
after a moment barb turns stares up at the house angry resolute
starts back inside
finds violet still at the table lighting a cigarette
august final white draft
we couldnt let ivy run off with little charles
just wouldnt be right
barbara doesnt respond keeps her distance
shell be back
shes a sweet girl ivy and i love her to death
but she isnt strong
not like you
you knew about daddy and mattie fae
i never told them i knew
but your father knew
he knew i knew
but we never talked about it
i chose the higher ground
and then if id had the chance there at the end i wouldve told him i hope this isnt about little charles cause you know i know all about that
if id reached him at that motel i wouldve said youd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history
i called over there on monday after i got into that safety deposit box
but it was too late hed checked out
how did you know where he was
violet is growing agitated with the interrogation
he said i could call him over at the country squire motel he left a note
and i did i called him on monday
august final white draft
after you got the money out of your safety deposit box
we had an arrangement
you have to understand for people like your father and me who never had any money ever as kids people from our generation that money is important
if you couldve stopped daddy from killing himself you wouldnt have needed to get into your safety deposit box
well hindsights always twenty twenty isnt it
barbara stares at her mother for a long moment
then did the note say he was going to kill himself
if i had my wits about me i mightve done it different
but i was your father and me both we were
barbara looks off quietly you were both fucked up
you were fucked up
you are fucked up
youd better understand this you smug little ingrate
theres only one reason beverly killed himself and thats you
think theres any way he wouldve done what he did if you were still here
no just him and me here in this house in the dark left to ourselves abandoned wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort
august final white draft
so stick that knife of judgment in me go ahead but make no mistake his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine
barbara is reeling trying to comprehend
he did this though not us
can you imagine anything more cruel to make me responsible
just to weaken me make me prove my character
so i waited to get my hands on that safety deposit box
but i would have waited anyway
you want to show whos stronger bev
nobodys stronger than me goddamn it
when nothing is left when everything is gone and disappeared ill be here
violet yells up to the empty house
whos stronger now you son of a bitch
barbara feels sick the floor giving away beneath her
she takes a moment
then youre right mom
youre the strong one
she goes to her mother kisses her
turns heads into the hall grabs her purse and bevs keys from the dish
violet only slowly realizes barbaras gone
hears the sound of the screen door opening and slapping shut
violet follows her into the hall stops at the screen door
you and me
barb doesnt turn around keeps moving
quietly august final white draft
sees barb heading across the yard for beverlys pick up
im nothing like you
watches barbara climb into the truck back slowly out go
barbara drives off
the driveway now empty again
violet alone outside on the walkway
she turns back to the house yelling moving from empty room to empty room
ivy you here
the dining room the kitchen
and into the living room bevs study
she stumbles to the stereo puts on her clapton
stares at the spinning album
she reels to the stairs crawling up barbara is nearly catatonic as she drives the house receding in the rear window behind her
a few large rain drops splatter her windshield the rumble of distant thunder lightning and towering ominous clouds in the distance
august final white draft
violet climbs the staircase on all fours
johnna sets down her ts elliot goes to violet holds violets head smooths her hair rocks her
quietly and then youre gone and beverly and then youre gone and barbara and then youre gone and then youre gone and then youre gone johnna quietly sings to violet
this is the way the world and then youre gone and ends
then youre gone on barbara as she drives
this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends
and then youre gone and then youre gone
we stay on barb as she slowly pulls herself back together
brushes tears from her cheeks
notices her hands are shaking from the adrenaline
slows pulls the pick up to the side of the road at the top of a small rise
climbs out stares out over the miles of prairie
the wind gently ruffles her clothing her hair
