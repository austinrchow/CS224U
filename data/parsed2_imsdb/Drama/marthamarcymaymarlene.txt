written by sean durkin it is a hot summer day
a large run down farm house several sheds a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry uncut grass in a serene isolated valley
two men tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock
three women work in a vegetable garden
two women hang wet clothes on a clothes line
two men work in a cluttered garage on an old car
four women sit in a circle on a broken down buckling front porch
one woman breast feeds a new born
the others knit a large blanket
two women and two men swim naked in a swimming hole
a man in his forties sits alone in a room reading
a man chops wood
a bare foot toddler plays alone in the driveway
a large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor
two women are in the kitchen preparing food
martha sets a table for eight
martha is beautiful but appears run down
she is years old but her weathered face makes her look older
a bell rings off screen
the men sit around a table eating dinner
one man sits at the head of the table this is patrick
patrick is older than the other men
to his right is watts a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard
the women are scattered around the kitchen waiting
the men finish dinner pass through the kitchen and walk outside
the women file into the dining room clear the mens dishes put more chairs around the table and bring out a new serving of food
the women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food
katie sits at the head of the table
the kitchen is filled with dishes
two babies sleep next to each other in an old broken crib
a teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib
people are strewn all over the house sleeping
suddenly a figure passes quickly through frame
martha walks out the front door across the porch and up the driveway
she carries a small bag
her pace becomes increasingly faster
she looks back to see a teenage girl sarah standing in the window watching
martha turns and walks faster heading straight for the woods
as she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run
off screen the house door slams shut
a man urgently yells out marcy may the camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind
for a moment everything is quiet
suddenly a man and two women enter frame and run into the woods chasing after martha
the woods are dark
martha runs as fast as she can
she hears the mans voice calling her from a distance
a man and two women are chasing her
martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill
she keeps running at full speed then slips falls and rolls
martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent
martha holds still listening as the people chasing her pass by
martha uses a pay phone at a diner
she dials and waits
she is struck by the voice that answers she transforms from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion
oh my god
where are you
im not sure
upstate i think
youre in new york
when did you get back
martha doesnt know what to say she bursts into tears
i dont know
i should go back
go back where
i have to go i cant stay gone
no no no
what are you talking about
sorry for calling
dont hang up
do not hang up
do you want me to come get you
i cant wait that long
what do you mean
tell me where you are and ill come right now
its okay you dont have to i want to see you martha
martha thinks for a moment
martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries
she devours the food like she hasnt eaten in days
the entrance bell rings
martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth
a family walks in
they are seated
martha returns to eating
it is watts
his voice paralyzes her
what are you doin
martha stops eating
he slides into the booth and sits across from her
watts reaches over and takes some french fries
he eats them slowly enjoying every bite
she cant look at him
we were worried about you
patricks worried about you
i just wanted to come into town
i couldve brought you
i wanted to walk
through the woods
can i get you something
the waitress goes to take marthas plate
watts puts his hand out to stop her
you not gonna eat that
watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth
the waitress clears the plate
watts takes marthas napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews
you ready to go
martha doesnt respond
not right now
the waitress drops the check on the table
watts stares at martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers
he sorts through them and separates a bill
he stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket
he grabs her hand places the money in her palm and grips it closed
ill get this
he lets go
her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table
she does not look at him
he leans in and forces eye contact with her
watts growing increasingly tense stands up and glances around the diner
it is very busy
he does not want to make a scene in front of all these people
he leans down and kisses martha on the cheek
she doesnt kiss back
he holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts
she reluctantly kisses him on the lips
martha watches him walk outside
as soon as his back is turned she gets up runs through the diner and suddenly cuts through the kitchen
martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop
she does not look well
she turns and vomits behind the bench
martha hides between two parked buses
she watches a black bmw pull into the parking lot
lucy a well dressed woman in her early s gets out of the car
martha walks towards lucy
lucy rushes over and hugs martha
martha wrapped in lucys sweater leans her head against the window watching the road behind her in the side view mirror
its nice to see you
lucy notices that marthas left ear is bruised
whats going on
you were pretty upset on the phone
i over reacted
we had a fight
me and this guy
martha doesnt answer
did he hurt you
are you sure
lucy is skeptical
did you guys break up
how long were you together
i dont know
maybe a year maybe more or less
and you were here the whole time
youve been back in new york for over a year and you havent called me
lucy is upset but manages to remain calm
well im glad youre here now
lucy makes the bed
martha enters the room wrapped in a towel
her hair drips on the floor
i made you some tea
lucy takes a small hand towel and dries marthas hair
ted should be up from the city soon
hell cook us some dinner
im pretty tired is it okay if i just go to bed
get some sleep youll be as good as new tomorrow
martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her wet towel
lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of red wine
the front door opens
she puts on a smile as ted enters
he speaks with a british accent
he sets down his bag and gives her a hug and a kiss
she seems okay
what did she say
not much shes pretty tired
wheres she been
she had some boyfriend they were living in the catskills
not really lucy
shes here now
ted keeps his comments to himself
well how longs she staying
i dont know
i told you she was fine
you spend all that time worrying
ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a scotch
the house is completely dark
martha finds her way through the hallway and into the kitchen
she drinks water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst
the kitchen has large windows through which a bright spot light lights the porch but pitch black darkness is beyond that
martha is scared to look outside
she forces herself to slowly turn and look
she puts her head down and quickly returns to her room
martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor
why are you on the floor
martha does not know where she is
a moment passes before she starts to come to
its okay you were in a deep sleep
come have some breakfast
lucy and ted eat at the kitchen table
great to finally meet you
you sleep alright
how do you like the house
its just a rental
well i love it
lucy puts some eggs on a plate for martha
i didnt know there was a lake
do you still like to swim
you dont live in the city anymore
this is for weekends and holidays
ted and lucy eat martha takes miniscule bites
teds finishing a new building down town and when its done were taking one of the new apartments
you want to see pictures
lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room
martha sniffs her food
ted doesnt notice
do you think shes excited to have you back
lucy re enters with her digital camera
this is the view the interiors are obviously not finished
its nice right
we were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted so itll just be a little while longer
yep just a little while longer
okay sorry no more work talk
lucy notices that martha isnt eating
arent you hungry
not really sorry
well youve got to eat
its okay i can fix you something later
martha feeling on the spot forces down a big bite
martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the lake
ted naps while lucy sun bathes reading the mother where are we
how far are we
lucy is confused
she tries to make sense of the question
you mean where i picked you up
lucy goes back to reading
martha lies down and stares at the sky
a light banging sound starts to echo over the lake
the sound is the same as the lake a light breeze in the trees and the water gently hitting the dock
patrick and two men build a fence
martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with zoe a girl in her early twenties
martha is younger more energetic and confident
they are laughing and talking when zoe notices patrick walking towards them
put out your cigarette
just do it
they put out their cigarettes
zoe buries them in the grass
patrick approaches them
is that him
is this martha
howre you doing
patrick crouches down over zoe but smiles at martha
youve got a really nice place here
its as much yours as it is mine
he glances at her legs then back up to her face
he turns his attention to zoe
i thought you quit
dont apologize to me its your body
patrick gestures towards martha
look after this girl properly zoe she deserves some real care for once in her life
shes been great everyones been great
you look like a marcy may
marcy was my grandmothers name
well there you go
he continues to walk through the field
zoe and martha recline into the grass and continue talking
im going for a dip
anyone want to join
martha stands up and brushes herself off
martha turns to zoe but lucy is there instead lying on the sun bed lost in her book
lucy does not answer
ted runs down the dock and dives into the water
ted looks back to see martha stand at the end of the dock take off her clothes and dive in naked
martha swims lost in her own world
lucy notices martha grabs a towel and walks down to the end of the dock
ted swims back and gets out
brilliant choice of swim wear
lucy is not amused
ted walks away laughing
he turns to sneak one more glimpse of martha
what are you doing
would you put some clothes on you cant swim naked
you just cant
there are kids around and people come by
so you cant
we dont just dont
i have a bathing suit you can borrow
martha gets out of the water
lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away
martha dries off
she feels embarrassed
lucy notices the bruising on marthas ear
ive been trying to wake you
you should get up or you wont sleep through the night
martha wakes up
you should eat
im just going to sleep a little more first okay
im sorry i got frustrated with you before
martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep
shes not coming
shes in a really deep sleep
i cant wake her
she seems a bit off no
shes just really tired
shes had a bad breakup
i want to give her a couple days to get situated you know
has she always been like this
a pain in my ass yes
martha sits up in bed wide awake
she turns and stares out her window into the dark trees that surround the lake house
an old brown car pulls out of the driveway
martha sweeps the front porch
she notices the car pull away
max a young man in his early twenties comes outside and sits down next to her
max is warm nice and care free
hes not very bright but he is a good time to be around
where do they go at night
i dont know i never get invited
he jumps over the banister and reaches under the porch
you want to have a drink with me
he pulls out a little flask and shakes it
a mischievous smile grows on his face
they wont be back for a few hours
im not going to drink for awhile i think its a good idea for me
its cool im good at hiding it
people are scattered around a large room sleeping
watts enters and bangs two pots together to wake everyone
martha other girls get dressed in the communal closet
martha does dishes katie clears the table
we switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things
do you knit
i can learn though
its okay youll find your role
it takes time for people to find their role in a new family
katie pours the cleaner on the floor it sloshes around
we sell blankets in town
we still need some money but when the farms up and running well be self sufficient and well never have to worry about it again
when do you think thatll happen
hopefully by the end of the summer but well see
its hard to get machinery and live stock without cash
thatll be nice
katie accidentally drops a plate
martha gets down and starts to clean it up
martha watts max zoe and a few others sit around and listen to two men play guitar
everyone is talking and laughing and having a nice time
he observes everyone for a moment he seems agitated
he speaks above everyone and above the music
hows everything going so far marcy may
the guys stop playing music
you like it here
yeah its really nice
i want you to feel at home
people have abandoned you your whole life
i dont blame you for not trusting anyone
if you ever want to have a meaningful relationship you need to let your guard down
martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot
its not your fault but its there
if you feel safe here and i think you do let us in
we just want to help you
yeah we think youre fucking awesome
if youre going to live here then really be apart of things
lucy is putting away groceries
how are you feeling today
theres this great juice shop in town i got us a couple of juices
this one is kale with ginseng
it gives me energy so i thought it might help you
martha takes a sip
it tastes terrible but she drinks it
i got pineapple orange too if thats better
maybe thats better
i also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack
martha watches lucy put the groceries away
why is the house so big
its not that big
for two people its huge
we like to entertain
our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties
its just good to have space
so no one else lives here
of course no one else lives here
it is hot sunny and peaceful
martha sits cross legged
ted reads the newspaper
martha notices they wear wedding rings
earlier this year in the spring
there is an awkward silence
i tried to get in touch with you apparently you got rid of your cell phone
i lost it
you never got a new one
i got used to not having it
martha shakes her head
ted walks to the back of the boat
martha has to stand up to let him pass through the narrow walk way
he brushes up against her as he squeezes by
was it a big wedding
no about forty people
mostly his family
did aunt dora come
did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything
shes not that bad
you never had to live with her
you lived with dora
she lived with me after mom died
where were you
lucy picks up her polaroid camera and frames up martha
well im sure shed love to know youre okay
she hates me
she doesnt hate you
look at me
i hate her
martha notices the camera and quickly turns away
relax i dont have any pictures of you
jesus youre gorgeous
martha cracks a smile
lucy snaps the shot
there you go
lucy hands martha the polaroid she shakes it
dont shake it thats a myth
martha looks deep in thought she continues to shake the polaroid
is it true married people dont fuck
ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at marthas ass as he passes
martha is embarrassed
she stares at the polaroid
martha sits on the bed watching lucy go through her closet looking at old clothes
lucy holds up a summer dress
put this on
your clothes are disgusting martha just try it
why does it matter
it just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable
martha slips on the dress and a funny pose
it looks good you little shit
whatever makes you happy mama bear
youre making fun of me and i think it looks really good
they both laugh
martha wears lucys dress
ted lucy and martha sit around the table eating dinner
ted picks at the food
its no good
its good its just a bit dry
its not dry
ted starts laughing
lucy tries it again
it just needs a little salt
what are you laughing about i cooked for you your whole life
you microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks
ted and martha continue to laugh
lucy gets up from the table
she comes back with salt and dumps it on the food
ted and lucy get ready for bed
she seems better today
i wish i didnt have to go tomorrow
let me take you
no i dont want to leave her alone
youll be nice to her right
im always nice
they laugh and kiss
martha lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling
she is lost deep in thought
martha seems like she has been drugged she has a white robe draped around her
katie consoles her and makes her drink water
i know you feel like something bad just happened marcy may but you have to trust me that was not bad it was truly good
weve all been in this situation and we wouldnt all still be here if what happened in that room was bad
we all love each other very much we are all together on this you have to trust us
do you believe me
zoe and martha share a single mattress on the floor in a small dark room
martha is still wrapped in the robe she is still dazed
youre so lucky id give anything to have my first time again
yeah its so special
i cant remember anything i just woke up on the floor and felt this pain thats the cleansing
it means its working if you cant remember things
youre cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins
martha is distant
you need to share yourself dont be so selfish
so smile then enjoy this amazing night
it only happens once
zoe rests her forehead against marthas forehead
they curl up together in a very intimate way
zoe kisses her on the lips
martha is caught off guard
they have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep
the group sits around listening to max finish playing a song
everyone claps for him
patrick who sits in the back stands up and walks up to the stage
everyone gets excited
he tunes his guitar
this ones called marcys song
martha sits in the back listening
everyone turns around to look at her
she watches on as patrick begins to play
the song is a beautiful intense and haunting folk song
the whole group is entranced
martha is mesmerized by him
well she shes just a picture
who lives on my wall well she shes just a picture and the reason reason reason it is so small
with a smile so inviting and a body so tall she shes just a picture just a picture well you stand there stand there with the nightshade her dripping ripping
down your hands and you ask me ask me about the and the lady lady lady she understands its a dream for the future and the water for the sands and the strangeness is wandering through many callin lands ted walks into the kitchen
martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen floor
ted gets a six pack out of the fridge
he cracks a beer and drinks it
what are you doing
i thought id help out more
im going to take the boat out do you want to come
is lucy coming
she had to run to the city
ill teach you how to drive the boat come on
ted drives the boat with a beer in his hand
he moves over and motions for martha to take the wheel
ted slowly lets go and moves over so she can take the helm
they brush up against each other
martha is driving the boat
she bounces up and down like an excited little girl
martha and ted sit on the back of the boat
ted gets a beer out of the cooler
you want one
ted hands her a beer
she stares at the beer and hesitates before taking a giant chug
how have things been with you and lucy
is it strange to spend time together
its been a long time
i dont know its normal i guess
she hasnt changed much
martha takes a swig of her beer
where is she
at the doctor
shes getting a check up
were trying to have a baby
martha laughs to herself
the beer is affecting her
i cant imagine it lucy holding a child
she wouldnt know what to do with it
do you want a baby
he gets up and opens two more beers
i want what lucy wants
if shes happy im happy
he hands one to martha and sits down again
so youre unhappy
shes relieved to have you back
you had her worried
you havent called in two years
i lost track i guess
its good to let people know where you are martha
i didnt think lucy would worry about me
well she did
there is another awkward silence
they both drink their beer
can i go swimming
you dont need to ask
martha takes off her clothes
she is wearing a bikini that lucy gave her
it does not quite fit
the bathing suit sags and top of her ass shows
ted tries not to look
martha brings her head above water and she is with a group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming hole
martha watches as watts jumps off the cliff into the water
everyone cheers him on
patrick swims up behind martha
you jump yet
watts swims by and guides her out of the water
watts and martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a rock face
sure you can
martha stands alone at the top of the cliff naked
everyone is looking up at her cheering her on
she builds up the courage and jumps
she hits the water everything goes dark
the frame fills with tiny bubbles she comes up for air exhilarated
she continues to swim the camera follows her under water
the darkness of the water makes the screen go black
the hallway is dark the space is unclear
martha walks down a hallway and we learn its the farm house
she walks into patricks room
she gets into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep
she looks safe and happy
he welcomes her the room looks warm and comforting
something hits the roof
martha wakes up
martha sits up and listens
she waits in anticipation
martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the door to ted and lucys room
ted and lucy are having sex
martha watches for a moment then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the edge of the bed
lucy does not see martha
ted does not say anything he continues to have sex with lucy
his motion becomes harder lucy opens her eyes and ted jumps up
ted gestures to martha
martha what are you doing
ted turns on the light
he sits on the edge of the bed
jesus you cant just come in like that
martha gets up to leave
god damn it whats wrong
martha stops and stands facing the door
its been hard to sleep alone
all you do is sleep
martha goes to leave again
stay just stay
martha comes back and sits on the bed
why would you think it was okay to come in like that
i dont know
its a big bed you guys were on the other side
you cant come into our room when were having sex thats not normal
dont apologize i just want you to understand why its not okay
because its privte and its not normal
lucy can see something is really wrong
just lie down martha
martha lies in lucys lap
lucy is uncomfortable with the contact she pushes marthas head onto a pillow
this is just brilliant
ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out
martha closes her eyes
martha wakes up in patricks room he is gently having sex with her
she doesnt enjoy it but she doesnt stop him
ted is half asleep on the couch
lucy sits to wake him
martha is lying in their bed listening to them through the cracked doorway
im sorry you slept out here
thanks for being patient
i dont have much choice do i
i just want to make sure shes okay
i get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before i have to go back to work
i am under so much pressure right now i know you are
i have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it
that has nothing to do with martha
my point is i dont need the extra stress
im her only family
she needs to be able to depend on me right now
its complicated ted
as complicated as it might be we cant just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane
martha pretends to go back to sleep
lucy works in the garden
martha walks over to help
do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night
maybe its the pine cones
where did you pick up gardening
we had a garden where i lived
im good at some things
i know you are
they continue to work
lucy builds up the courage
was he ever physical with you
what do you mean
did he ever hit you
you had a bruised ear and when you called me you were hysterical
martha feels her ear
are you sure
you can tell me
he never hit me
i wish you felt more comfortable talking to me
theres nothing to talk about
i had a boyfriend he lied to me i left
thats it everything doesnt have to be a big martha zoe and katie work in the garden
several men are lifting heavy rocks to make a stone wall
max is in the hay loft
zoe is tucked around the corner smoking a cigarette
patrick catches her
he swats it out of her hand and scolds her
after a moment he puts his forehead to her forehead and caresses her head
zoe walks back to the garden
i dont know why im so weak
an old brown car pulls into the driveway
a young girl no more than fifteen years old gets out
her names sarah i think
two women welcome sarah and walk her into the house
you should handle her
zoe can help but youll be great
martha sits in the passenger seat lucy drives
martha notices a brown car is parked at the top of the driveway on the side of the road
martha is troubled by the parked cars presence
whose car was that
i dont know
theres a hiking trail people leave their cars there all the time
lucy looks through produce
martha takes the cart and runs down the isle with it
she picks her feet off the ground so she is riding on the cart
lucy is amused
martha turns around and goes faster flying all the way down the isle
a good looking young man walks into the isle
martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams her feet on the floor and just misses him
lucy runs up and takes the shopping cart back
martha doesnt say anything she just stares at him
the young man walks down the isle
martha watches him go
youre going to hurt someone
martha is distracted
can you go get me a large jug of water
whats wrong with the tap
i like bottled
its a waste
will you get it or not
martha walks through the refrigerated section looking for water
she notices the young man walking behind her
she stops to get water
he stops to buy beer
he looks at her
she grabs the water and walks away
martha and lucy get into the car in the grocery store parking lot
martha watches the rear view mirror
did you know that guy
the guy in the store
the one you almost ran into
he was looking at me like he knew me
did you say something to him
i dont know you tell me
what are you talking about
he was staring at me like he knew me did you talk to him about me
the guy was checking you out martha
lucy starts the car
if you dont want guys to drool all over you then wear more clothes just drive the car lucy
drive the car
lucy is unpacking groceries
lucy puts something in a cupboard
ted takes it out and puts it in a different cupboard
i dont think we should have the party
its labor day we always have it
things are just too stressful right now
ive already invited clients
im sure people would understand they wouldnt
i just think it would be best
for who martha
for all of us
its not an option
were having the party
and thats the end of it because you say so
martha shows sarah a large walk in closet
martha puts sarahs clothes on a shelf with all the other clothes
we share all of this if it fits you can wear it
they walk into a small bedroom
this is where we sleep
you can take any bed thats open or you can sleep downstairs
they walk downstairs
and see another large bedroom
im hungry can we eat
we dont eat until the evening
at the bottom of the stairs several make shift beds are laid out on the floor
youll get used to it
your body doesnt need that much food
youre taught to overconsume
there is a baby asleep in the crib
whose the mother
katies but we all help out
is patrick the father
they look just like him
all the kids here are boys
martha picks one up she is very natural with him
he only has boys
youre good with them
you want to hold him
i dont have to take care of them do i
not if you dont want to
there are plenty of jobs to be done
youll find your role
it takes time for people to find their role in a new family
martha walks with sarah and zoe across the courtyard and out into the field towards the woods
i called my dad today to ask for money
does patrick know
he asked me to
sometimes if theres something we really need ill call
how was it
fine theyre not bad people
did he give you the money
he thinks im on drugs
do you tell him youre not
no thats why he gives it to me
i guess hed rather pay for it than think im sucking dick for it
ive done drugs
not a lot but ive tried everything pretty much except heroin
its good to try everything at least once
you find out who you are that way
what about drinking do you drink
i have but i dont
good we dont drink
it just makes you angry and less focused
dont get the wrong idea sarah
we dont talk to our old families
i wouldnt call my dad anyway no matter how much he paid me
patrick and watts walk out of the woods
hi patrick did you meet sarah yet
katie teaches martha how to make a vegetable drink
martha adds some herbs
katie hands her a large chalky white pill
half is fine
martha breaks the tablet in half and drops it into the drink
she crushes it with a spoon
martha is back at the lake house
lucy enters and begins to load the dishwasher
martha holds the glass with the green drink which we now see is just water
ill do these if you want to go to bed
i dont mind
get some sleep
holding the glass tightly martha walks to her bedroom
martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink
sarah sits in a chair wearing a white robe
the room is no longer marthas bedroom at the lake it is a small dark room at the farm
sarah is nervous
martha brushes sarahs hair
what do i have to do
nothing you dont want to
drink this it will help you relax
sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink
its the start of your cleansing
martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down
weve all done it so you know theres nothing to worry about
do i have to wear this robe
i know it seems a bit silly but its a part of it
sarah looks very uncomfortable
she is getting light headed from the drink
you look amazing
its your special night with him enjoy it youll be great
martha helps sarah up and passes her through a door to the next room
she removes sarahs robe and lays her on the ground
martha shuts the door locking her in
martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball
martha wakes up wearing lucys dress
she has wet herself
martha takes off the dress and stuffs it between the mattress and the box spring
martha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the water
she is deep in thought
lucy walks down the stairs and sits next to her
shouldnt we start cooking
i just made some potato salad
teds cooking the fish
i thought we were going to cook
we cooked last night
martha is lost deep in thought
do you ever have this thing where you cant tell if somethings a memory or if its something youve dreamed
do you blame me for anything
i dont know
im just trying to figure out why we stopped talking
i didnt think about it
we were far apart
sometimes i wonder if maybe i could have taken better care of you
the past doesnt matter
it does matter
i took care of myself
i know you did
i think i could have done more though
be honest with me you never think about it
youre not angry at me
i know you dont think much of me but i knew what i was doing then and i still do
no martha i think the world of you im just wondering if i should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college you had
so much potential
i dont need your guidance i never did
im a teacher and a leader you just never let me be that but now i know i am i know who i am
teacher and a leader
what are you talking about
i always encouraged you to do more but you shut me out
martha doesnt respond she drifts off into deep thought
just because were sisters doesnt mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head
ted lucy and martha eat at the dinner table
so what are your plans martha
i dont know
are you thinking about what you can do for work
youre at an age where you need to start thinking about a career
its a part of adult life
there are other ways to live
i dont know
people dont need careers people should just exist
hes just saying we should start talking about what youre interested in
maybe we can help you get some ideas together
i have moments when i would love to move to france and just exist but it doesnt work that way
you can do that if you want to
its not that simple
its not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions
its just not the right way to live
lucy is floored by marthas response
and what do you think the right way to live is
being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain
youre eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth
martha with a frightening streak of viciousness stands up to ted
you dont know anything about it
ted and lucy are speechless
martha sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night
ted and lucy are asleep in their room
martha picks up the phone and dials a number
a woman picks up
she not there
where is she
who is this
who is this
its marlene lewis
martha hangs up
the phone rings
she unplugs the phone and collapses on the floor
martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing
martha looks out into the feild to see patrick talking with sarah
she is enamoured by him
zoe martha sarah and max are shooting bottles in the woods
watts said im supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but i think youre hopeless
im surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it
please im like doc fuckin holiday
zoe shoots and hits a bottle
he comes up behind zoe wraps his arms around her kisses her neck and gropes her breasts
she moves his hands away
sarah watches on
god you are so hot when you shoot makes my willy hard
max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots
he misses the bottles
what happened doc
i should be teaching you
he loads another round aims shoots and hits a bottle
alright my turn
max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun
alright max was this just an excuse to grope marcy
im teaching her how to shoot
then you just squeeeeeeeeeze
patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac
martha fires a few shots and misses
take a deep breath
think about someone who wronged you
feel it feel how they made you feel in your stomach
take a deep breath feel it all moving out into your hands
let it build
its transferring to the gun building in the gun
she fires five powerful shots quickly one shatters
a smile grows on marthas face
feels good right
patrick opens a sac and lets cats out
now try that
what do you mean
theyre living animals
so shoot max then
patrick lifts marthas hand so the gun is pointing at max
max is frozen he smiles awkwardly
max is confused he gets embarrassed
dont walk away from me max
martha drops the gun down to her waist
the cat has terminal cancer its in excruciating pain
max has no substance hes just here to free load and be around the girls but youre a teacher and leader you just dont see it because no one let
you believe it before me
youre a leader a marcy now prove it
martha is shook up
she does not fire the gun
the cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love
youre holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing whats right
zoe takes the gun out of marthas hand
the gun goes off
martha and max jump
zoe shot the cat without blinking
she hands the gun back to martha
i could spend my life being selfish living alone using this gift for me but ive sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be
you need to trust me
i trust you
then you shouldnt need me to explain everything
a gun shot goes off
they all look up
max looks mortified he has shot the other cat
what did you do
you said it was sick
one of them was sick zoe knew which one it was
max tosses the gun and walks away
martha looks for max
she finds him in the hay loft
ill probably leave this place soon anyways
where are you going to go
i got places
my cousin lives in bennington he said i could go up there and make like a week selling weed
you dont want to do that
i dont care what i do
im sick of all these rules
max theyre not rules
its just common sense
it feels like rules
they wont let me do anything
i cant even go on the house runs
id be great at taking shit
its not about taking shit
sounds like its about taking shit to me
and thats why you dont get to come
you just dont get it
you need to quit drinking
im not drinking
martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale
youre still living with all the shit you carried out there
youre the only one let it go
you cant try
you have to stop
they love you they just want you to be stronger
im strong theyll see
max leans up and tries to kiss her
martha stops him
she hugs him instead
youll be okay
a rock is hurled onto the roof of the house
it rolls down and off into the yard
flood lights shine up at a beautiful large country home
three people run through the yard dashing through the light and back into the shadows
it is martha watts and zoe hurls another rock onto the roof
a man inside comes to the window
zoe picks up a rock and throws it onto the roof
the man in the window walks towards his front door
watts leads martha towards the house
the man in the house comes out of his front door walks around the side of his house and looks up to see whats hitting the roof
he leaves the front door open
watts and martha creep into the house
martha and watts walk through the house
they sneak past a living room where a woman watches television
there are two place settings at the dinning room table and two candles burning in vintage steel candle holders
watts blows out the candles pours wax on the table and lays the candles down
he steals the candle holders
there is a large painting on the wall
he motions for martha to help him
they get on either side and dismount the painting then lay it face up on the floor
they hear the man come inside and talk to his wife
they continue to creep through the house into the kitchen and out the back door
martha watts zoe max and a few others have sex with each in the same room
patrick walks down stairs and sits quietly in the corner watching them
martha lies awake in her room
she hears a car outside
she creeps to her window and peeks out
she cant see what kind of car it is
it leaves the lights and engine on for a moment then it shuts off
no one gets out
she is frozen with fear
she builds up courage then leaves her room
martha walks through the dark lake house looking out the windows trying to see if anyone is coming almost as if she is standing guard
she is trembling with fear
a dark figure crosses from one room to another behind her
she freezes turns and holds her breath
the man walks out of the room
jesus christ you scared me
they take a moment to calm down
did i wake you
i cant sleep
i was going to watch a movie
you want to watch
martha thinks about it
i should try to sleep
it always helps me
its better than lying in bed awake
he takes a couple of beers out of the fridge
ted sits on one end of the couch martha on the other end
he wears his robe and drinks a beer
he glances over at martha who is lost in the movie laughing
im sorry about before martha
its your house
martha lies down
he offers her a pillow
she raises her head and he puts it under
lucy walks into the living room to find martha curled up on the couch next to ted
the tv is on and there are three empty beer bottle on the table
lucy is furious
she picks up the bottles and walks into the kitchen being sure to make as much noise as she can
ted and martha wake up
martha sits up on the couch and watches ted walk into the kitchen
lucy puts on the kettle
ted comes into the kitchen and opens the fridge
you want me to make some breakfast
lucy walks away
ted follows her into their room
ted and lucy enter
you can not be serious right now
one minute youre going after martha at the dinner table then youre curling up together on the couch
no one was curling up with anybody
you really do think im stupid dont you
jesus i couldnt sleep i was watching a movie she came out and sat down and started watching with me
what am i supposed to do tell her to leave
youre being ridiculous
you can lose your temper at will but when i get pissed off im being crazy or ridiculous
i couldnt possibly be mad for a reason
lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower
are you accusing me of something
because if you are id like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds
i just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel
you ask me to make more of an effort
i try to do that and you get upset
i cant win
lucy sits on the steps overlooking the lake
she is sneaking in a cigarette
martha stands below her bedroom window to see whats hitting the roof at night
she turns and looks over to the back road
the brown car is parked on the side road
it is overcast
it looks like a storm is approaching
martha walks towards the car her anger is building
as she gets to the top of the road she picks up a rock and throws it through the car window
glass shatters everywhere
she picks up a loose shard of glass and scrapes a line on the side of the car
she drops the glass and stares at the mess for a moment before looking around to make sure no one has seen her
martha looks out the window at the brown car with the smashed window
it is raining
martha lies in bed
something thumps on the roof
she flintches with each thump
martha helps lucy clean the house
you shouldnt smoke
i dont smoke
especially if youre trying to have a kid
maybe you should mind your own business
the phone rings
it startles martha
i cant deal with talking to anyone right now
martha is frozen watching the phone ring
lucy fixes marthas hair and puts make up on her
martha sits passively like a doll
martha walks down the stairs she looks beautiful
she is wearing a long white dress lucy has done her hair and make up
she is cautious as she descends
guests have arrived
they are drinking cocktails and talking in the house and on the back porch
jazz plays over speakers
martha walks outside
lucy introduces her to some of her friends
martha looks like a zombie though frozen at the sight of so many strangers
martha continues to walk around the edge of the party quietly observing everyone
something catches her eye
she is studying the bartender
she composes herself then approaches him cautiously
whats you name
whats your name
he puts out his hand to shake hers
she takes a half step back and studies his face
can i get you something
i used to like this
she points at the tequila
she stands there looking dazed
she doesnt respond
he just pours it
he is confused by her
i thought you werent supposed to drink mike
im not drinking
he hands her the tequila
she suddenly slaps it out of his hand
the glass shatters on the ground
you think youre so fucking smart
martha storms inside
lucy follows her in
hey what happenind
we all need to leave
hes a fucking liar
we all need to leave
she points to the bartender
what are you talking about
lucy lowers marthas pointing hand and tries to move her away
we have to leave
we all have to leave
i know him
what the fuck is wrong with you
you dont want to live with this lucy
ted approaches and helps guide martha into their bedroom
lucy turns around to check the party
people are starting to notice
lucy and ted force martha back into their bedroom
he closes the door
what are you talking about
martha is frantic she begins to hyperventilate
lucy tries to hug her martha squirms free
lucy hugs her again and pulls her onto the bed trying to get her to calm
dont touch me youre not listening to me
martha please try to breath
i dont know what youre talking about
ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills
he forces them down and makes martha drink water
she calms down
she falls back onto the bed
ted and lucy look exhausted
martha walks through a large house in the dark
she gets to the front door and opens it letting in katie zoe watts and patrick
they immediately scatter around the house looking in cupboards
suddenly the lights turn on
what the fuck
hey we can go
the man is confused
what do you want
the man goes to pick up the phone to call the police
watts stops turns and gets in his face
no need for that we are leaving
watts zoe and martha walk to the front door
patrick appears behind the man
calm down if you calm down no one will get hurt
what do you want
were not stealing we dont want anything
just get out
were just looking at the house
we didnt realize you were home
we wouldnt have come in otherwise
i would but i cant be sure you wont call the police
you didnt take anything so just go i just want my family to be safe
why wouldnt anyone be safe
unless you call the police everything will be fine
okay i wont
you have my word please just go
martha walk outside
patrick just stands there he wont leave
katie and zoe walk out of the other room and are standing behind the man
they dont move
he feels surrounded
get the fuck out of my house
martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door
no one knows what to do
the girls are looking to patrick but hes not doing anything
suddenly katie lunges at the man and stabs him in the neck
blood spurts out and she stabs him again in the ribs
they all run out
martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a mattress
she is stunned
she looks through the open door to see katie and watts washing in the bathroom
patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with martha
martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep
look at me
patrick runs his hands through her hair
there is a long silence
martha is clearly not okay
you know that death is the most beautiful part of life right
death is beautiful because everyone fears death
and fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness
when youre scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment youre in
it brings you to now and that makes you truly present
and when you are truly present thats nirvana thats pure love
so death is pure love
martha wakes up
lucy is sitting on the bed
she has brought tea
martha sits up and takes a sip
its too hot let it cool for a minute
she smiles lies down and curls up again
she is half asleep
im sorry i ruined the party
everything was fine
is it over
yes you slept through the night
are you going to drink the tea
i dont want it
lucy gets up and leaves
men are moving vehicles into the garage
women are bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line
martha is helping with the garden
there is a sense of urgency to close the farm
max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door
he slips and falls feet to the ground
martha rushes over to him
he is in pain
watts comes out of the barn
we have to do something
yeah im cool
they help him up and he falls
he cant put pressure on his leg and he seems to have a concussion
theres nothing to do marcy you need to get inside
max is strong hell be fine
yeah im good marcy
everyone files into the basement except for patrick watts and katie
they stand at the top of the stairs talking
how long do you think well be down here
itll just be a few days
just to be safe
everyone is sleeping
max is curled up in the corner
martha walks over to him and wakes him
there is vomit in the corner
do you feel alright
if you hit your head you shouldnt sleep
do you know why were down here
she shakes her head
what do you think it was
i dont know
it doesnt matter
do you still think about leaving
its cool now i dont really have anywhere to go
why would you
i just wanted to see about you
katie rings the dinner bell
martha walks out of the house holding a large pot of soup
she walks it through the courtyard into the shed where everyone gathers to eat dinner
everyone from the farm stops work and walks towards the shed
it looks like more people are there than before there are several new faces in the crowd
martha is cleaning the house
the phone rings she picks it up
a young girls voice is on the other end
hi is watts there
there is something written on the wall martha reads
martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside

watts hangs up
he and martha have a quiet exchange and watts walks away
martha just stands there quietly
martha cooks with katie
martha sneaks a bite of bread
katie whacks her in the ear with a wooden spoon
a slight ringing remains throughout the scene
nothing till theyre done
you know better
martha turns her head to see lucy instead of katie
martha is at the lake house cooking with lucy
is this from the past or is this now
i dont remember waking up this morning
why dont you go sit down ill finish up
lucy hands water and some pills to martha
martha takes the pills walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television
ted walks into the kitchen
martha listens from the couch
he reaches out and holds her hand
whats going on
who the fuck knows
she needs to see someone
ill start looking into places tomorrow
we can arrange for her to be somewhere by wednesday
i dont think she should stay with us anymore
we cant do anything for her when shes like this
lucy goes back to chopping
i dont want to talk about it anymore
martha and zoe sit in bed
i cant stop feeling terrible for that poor man
it happens though were never really dead or alive we just exist so hes still existing but its in a parallel time
just dont think about it its in the past
martha is upset with how cold zoe is
martha sits in the bathroom knees pulled up to her chest as she rests on the edge of the bathtub
someone knocks at the door
she pretends not to be in there
there is another gentle know
martha its me can i come in
martha unlocks the door for zoe
patrick bursts in slams the door and corners martha and yells at her
havent you learned anything
i felt like we had a connection
thats not what youre showing me
patrick calms down
maybe i asked too much from you too soon
you have potential but youre just not there yet
ill expect less of you fro now on
martha is upset like a trained animal she runs back to his side sits next to him and rests her head on his shoulder
he runs his hand through her hair
he puts his hand on the inside of her thigh
youre my favorite i wont lose you
martha wakes up on the couch confused she sees a man standing over her
she quickly pushes him up jumps over tyhe back of the couch and runs away
the man is ted
he follows her trying to calm her down but she is in a blind state of panic
she runs to the stairs
he follows her
he goes to see if she is okay
she kicks him
he falls down the stairs
the lights turn on
lucy comes out of the bedroom to see ted at the bottom of the stairs
she rushes over to him
ted gets up slowly
are you alright
ted pushes lucy off of him
what the fuck happened
she kicked me down the stairs
jesus christ whats it going to take lucy
martha starts crying she becomes hysterical
lucy is irate she runs up the stairs and confronts martha
you could have killed him
martha backs away
i was confused
about what what are you so confused about
i thought he was someone else
lucys anger is building
you thought he was someone else
what is wrong with you
im not doing this anymore im not doing this anymore
i beat myself up over you for years and im sick of it im sick of chasing you down and worrying about you
i need to move on

what happened to you
martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her eyes
what happened to you
i dont know
lucy doesnt know what else to do she can see martha is too far gone
were going to get you proper help
there is a long moment of silence
are you going to send me away
i dont know how to help you anymore
i cant help you
please i cant be alone please
were trying to start a family and i dont trust you to be here
lucy walks away
lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs
youre going to be a terrible mother
lucy freezes she tries to stay calm but bursts into tears
there is a long tense silence
lucy dries her eyes
do you have any money left
martha shakes her head
of course you dont
well make sure everything is taken care of
lucy walks away martha is frozen on the stairs
martha walks through the house
all of the luggage is packed and sitting by the front door
ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a beer
it is an overcast unusually cold labor day
lucy works in the garden
its a bit chilly
i dont mind
i think we both said some things last night that we didnt mean
we scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning
martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices footprints
whats it like there
it looks nice
martha turns and walks down to the water
were heading back to the city in about an hour
youll be ready to go
martha stands on the dock
she strips down to her underwear and dives in
martha swims out into the lake
she drops under the water and out of sight a burst of bubbles pop up to the surface
a few seconds pass by and she is not coming up
suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for air
she looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice homes that appear to be empty now
no one else is swimming
martha sees a scruffy man sitting on a neighboring dock he seems familiar
he is in his mid twenties his jeans are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water
his shirt is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette
he looks directly at martha
they make eye contact
he finishes his smoke throws the cigarette in the water puts on his shirt and just sits there
martha swims back to the house
martha sits in the back seat of ted and lucys car
ted drives and lucy sits up front
they drive up the driveway and turn out onto the road
ted and lucy talk
martha gets a concerned look on her face
ted slams on the breaks
are you okay
what was he doing
the man from the dock walks past the car
they almost hit him
as they drive away martha turns to see him get into the a brown car start the engine and drive
the car drives behind teds car
martha looks forward for a long moment then turns back again to see that he is still there
she is frozen with fear she thinks about saying something but then stops herself
instead she sits in silence
