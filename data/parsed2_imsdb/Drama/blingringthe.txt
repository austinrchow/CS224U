a guy gives girl a lift up we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room
she runs around to open a side door for the rest and they slip inside

quilted chanel bags in every color louboutin patent leather platform heels marc jacobs crisp shirts
he touches them and makes sure theyre all tucked away carefully before closing it up
we see there are several louis vuitton suitcases he slides this one away next to them and pulls a tarp over them in the corner and leaves them by some
old christmas decorations

marcs little old grandma shuffles about in a house coat with a plate of cookies as he rushes out

rebecca pulls up in her car and they get in and drive off
i think the biggest problem was after the audrina thing nothing happened it gave rebecca that self boost that oh this is okay

what do your parents do
my mom does a lot of things shes a minister shes been a masseuse shes an energy healer
my dad is a director of photography on t
shows hes been in the industry forever
and how is sam related
weve adopted her we met in ballet class when we were little
i was friends with her mother mom this is my interview
i met her when my parents divorced
now she lives with us my moms home schooled us all for a while
the philosophy of the secret its based on the law of attraction but my great grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy
its mans relationship to the divine thats what energy science means
since i was young i learned about every religion
so sam was in your ballet class did she have parents
she had a dysfunctional background we both did
and i met her mom can i talk please
the reason we related so well is my dad is a recovering alcoholic and sams mom is
a practicing drug addict and alcoholic and our moms became best friends and
and then she went off the deep end she was on the verge please
i told you that if youre going to be here you had to be quiet
thats why i didnt want you here because you talk
so basically you took her in
yes we took her in about years ago
but lets get back to nicki
so adam here told me you do charity work
yes we do a lot of stuff through our church its agape church
its the religious science philosophy being taught at agape church
my other sister gabby is on a trip with them now helping build homes
and they do a yearly trip to africa where they build wells and schools for kids
uh i cant remember exactly which country
we do bake sales and feeding the homeless that kind of stuff
ok so its a little bit of a disconnect with these positive pursuits and whats happening now
nicki i dont want you to answer that comment
i think that im a firm
i have a good statement to say
she can speak generally
im not gonna speak about the case what i was going to say is that im a firm believer in karma and i think this situation was attracted into my
life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being
nicki is getting emotional as she speaks her voice quivers
i dont think the universe chose a better person than me because from this its not just affecting me its affecting the media and everyone and i think im meant
to bring truth to all this
i believe that i am an old soul
yes she is
we have gotten to know nicki and her family and we feel nicki is an extremely focused honest person who has a lot to provide to the community
and we agree that there hasnt been a disconnect that there were circumstances that happened but nicki herself continued to stay on her plane despite the tumultuous experiences happening
whats your goal or life plan if you have one
i do i think my journey is to be a leader and push for peace and for the health of our planet nicki starts to get teary eyed
nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism
its my main goal
god didnt give me these talents and what i look like to sit around and just be a model or famous
i want to do something people notice thats why im studying business so i can be a leader and take a stand for people
over kates shoulder we see marc speaking into her tape recorder with his lawyer at his side
i met rebecca in school after i moved back and went to indian hills i went there because i had a lot of absences
i didnt want to go to school i had a lot of self loathing and anxiety issues i felt that i was ugly
youre not ugly
i know im not ugly but i never thought i was an a list looking guy
i went to indian hills to learn and be with my peers i felt so self conscious i didnt look as good as everyone else
and now youre a star
on my facebook page recently i had friends requests i accepted them all i didnt even look at them then i noticed someone had created a fan page for me
if it had been for something i had done to help the community or benefit something id love it but its just kind of awkward for me that these people
are loving me for something thats looked down on in society
its kinda showing that america has some sick fascination with a bonnie and clyde kind of thing
headline hollywoods burglar bunch allegedly targeted a list stars

marc looks in shock and keeps his head low and rebecca looks pissed as they are led out
we see news cameras descending on them

news coverage takes over from the voice of the judge
from the view of a tmz style low res video camera they leave the courthouse in the mayhem

nicki cries lauries freaking out
rebecca ahn and marc hall were both sentenced to years in state prison
chloe taynor and robert hernandez were each sentenced to a year

its a sunny afternoon
we see marc handcuffed to criminals being led onto a white bus that reads county of los angeles sheriffs department
marc sits next to a big hard looking criminal
close on marcs face as he looks out the window while the bus pulls away
light streams in on his pale face
he looks out as the los angeles streets go by
cut back to marcs young face looking out the window music starts and the bus drives out of frame
nicki in full hair and make up sits in front of a draped curtain back drop talking to an e journalist
were here with nicki moore who just served days for her involvement in the bling ring and shared a cell block with one of the victims lindsay lohan
there were reports that lindsay was crying with you being next to her did you actually hear any of this
i could hear her crying the first day which is hard when youre trying to be strong i just tried to really keep to myself
i just tried to get through the day the days are so long youre woken up at
and howd she look
she got to keep her extensions in most girls were talking about oh i had to take my weave out
she was in orange like all of us
were you nervous you were next to her because you were accused of being a part of that group that allegedly robbed her house
yeah it was hard for me there were tabloids and on t
s in there people were watching the story and they were showing the surveillance video and stuff
and little do people know that when that video came out i was actually in contact with her manager to tell her who i believed the people were who robbed
and eventually when im able to tell my story people will know the truth
so thats nerve wracking she could think you robbed her house
