carroll shelby mancinis ave maria fills the screen as a white bmw speeds along the road
a beautiful woman is behind the wheel
we never see her face
hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix
her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells
a silver bracelet dangles from her wrist
a slow moving semi obstructs her path
the woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane
she steps on the gas
shes in the wrong lane and cant get over
there are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard
suddenly the headlights are upon her
and airhorn blasts and shes trapped between two monstrous big rigs
she cuts the wheel hard but too late
the oncoming truck clips her sending her car end over end
the accident is violent and horrible
the bmw cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction
the music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof
and as the bmw violently smashes headfirst into the embankment the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash test dummy
the indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning
vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes
dairy queens hardees and walmarts line the main drag
stars and stripes flutter from lampposts
a man sits propped up against pillows his sleeping wife snuggled next to him
his name is john quincy archibald
his strong handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear
from across the room last nights news broadcast drones on the tv
the president is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing
watches impassively the irony not lost on him
suddenly he hears a noise
somethings not right
he jumps out of bed wearing only a pair of bvds
honey what is it
the screen door bangs open
bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house
two truckers are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old chevy
hey what the hell are you doing
what does it look like
aw come on
thats my car
thats not what the bank says
the truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in
just watches as the truck speeds away dragging the car along the cement
the neighbors now stand on their porches staring
turns to see his wife denise standing in the doorway
shes not a happy camper
their nine year old son mike appears at his mothers side wiping the sleep from his eyes
whats going on
close on a hand circling want ads in red ink
sits at the kitchen table drinking a half filled cup of coffee his eyes scouring the classifides
denise enters dressed in her brown and red supermarket cashiers uniform
without speaking she passes j
and starts making breakfast
denise doesnt respond
a chill fills the air
i talked to the bank
they promised theyd work with me
john that was two months ago

mike enters dressed for school
he strikes a body builders pose flexing
ronnie coleman mr
olympics two years running
he moves to the bread box and grabs a donut

mouthful of food i am eating
a donut isnt breakfast

mike runs out of the room
denise starts to clear the table
give me a ride to work
takes her arm
baby things will get better
ive just got to get a few paychecks ahead thats all
an amber light flashes through the darkness followed by a rapid buzzing sound
the camera pushes in on a mammoth sized printer furiously pounding letters onto a fact sheet
we catch glimpses of peoples names hometowns other vital information

the boys giggle

the car stops in front of the small red brick elementary school
mike kisses his mother goodbye
john walks mike to the gate
mike turns serious
ive got forty six dollars i saved from my allowance

john rubs his sons head

mike runs toward the schoolhouse

john keeps filling out his paperwork

or they tell you that youre overqualified
either way youre screwed
a personnel manager emerges from his office and reads from a clipboard
sits across the desk from the p
ive been working heavy machinery for fifteen years
i really want this job
whatever you need i can do
hey i could start today
laughs nervously as the p
reviews his application
your resume is very impressive
youve certainly got the experience
frankly you might be overqualified
gets the message
he pushes his chair back and starts to get up
the daisy wheel buzzsaws across the page
we see more names columns entitled status entry date
underneath the entry date heading months and days appear june april
the congregation sings
in the third row mike elbows his dad
the game starts in fifteen minutes
were gonna be late
a few rows back john sees jimmy palumbo tapping his watch
denise gives her husband a disapproving look
john sticks his head back in the hymn book and continues singing
the congregation pours out of the church and parishioners run to their cars
denise stops to talk to the pastor
john moves over to denise and the pastor
no time for saving souls today
have you been saying your prayers like we talked about
does praying for a job count
work on him will you denise
no ones hopeless
the pastor waves as john grabs denise by the hand and they run to the truck and hop in
in the parking lot kids put on their uniforms men and women change out of their sunday best
cars vans pick ups dualies take off tires spinning everybody whooping and hollering
its a tailgate party
parents lugging ice chests making sandwiches barbecuing
in the bleachers john denise jimmy palumbo and his wife gina cheer on the home team
the wives are really loud
lets go orioles
pitchers got a rubber arm
the dodger pitcher stretches fires a fastball
the batter takes the pitch
tommy trots down to first base
way to go tommy
walks as good as a hit
mike steps to the plate
family and friends cheer wildly
drive him home baby
you can do it
the pitcher smokes one down the middle
nothing but air
thats okay mikey
put the bat on the ball
the pitcher burns one on the outside corner
hey ump youre blind
i hate this pitcher
how old is he anyway
hes supposed to be twelve
twelve my ass
look at him
his beard just grew an inch between pitches
dont let him rattle you mikey
wait for your pitch
the catcher flashes fingers
the pitcher nods and fires
mike hits a sharp ground ball between first and second
the second baseman moves over but doesnt have the angle
the first baseman charges the ball scoops it on the run then underhands it to the dodger pitcher who gallops off the mound towards first
mikes foot hits the bag at exactly the same time the ball plops in the pitchers outstretched glove
he was out
tie goes to the runner son
as the dodger pitcher argues with the umpire the oriole player on third base darts towards home
the dodger pitcher wheels around and fires
too late the runner scores
seeing an opening mike races from first to second arms pumping breathing hard
the dodger shortstop sees mike races to the base and calls for the throw
the dodger catcher throws off his mask and fires the ball
close on mike slowing suddenly clutching his chest gulping for air ten feet from the base
the ball lands in the shortstops glove
mike wobbles doubles over and falls face first into the dirt
the dodger shortstop stands over mike
he cant decide if he should tag him
players spectators look on dazed shocked
push in on j
s face panicked
track him leaping down the bleachers knocking over spectators racing onto the playing field
he lifts mikes head holds it in his hands
denise arrives hysterical
mikey can you hear me
mike is semi conscious eyes dilated barely breathing
somebody call an ambulance
im not waiting for an ambulance
lifts mike into his arms and races with denise through the crowd towards the parking lot
denise gets in the pick up and john lays mike down in her lap before gunning the engine and taking off
s pick up speeds along a super highway blurring past rural pastures farmland and cornfields
up ahead the oppressive skyscrapers of the city
a monolithic maze of glass and stone
johns truck screeches to a stop at the e
its standing room only
doctors and nurses move purposefully through the suffering masses
mike in his arms j
and denise run double time through the crowded corridors
my son cant breathe
i need help here
can somebody please
a male nurse leo maguire leaves what hes doing and moves towards them
he clutches mikes wrist taking his pulse
i dont know
he had a baseball game
all of a sudden he
maguire passes a female nurse in the hallway
i need a doctor right away
maguire helps j
lower mike onto an examination table and immediately several emergency technicians start applying the resuscitation equipment
their movements are swift and precise
a blood pressure cuff is wrapped around mikes arm an oxymeter to the tip of his finger and sensors are stuck all over his chest
doctor is marjorie klein early s
klein is all business assessing mikes condition
collapsed playing baseball
notices maguire glancing worriedly at klein
he was running
next thing we know he keels over
anything like this ever happen before
pulse is seventy eight percent
lets get him on some oxygen
maguire reaches for the oxygen tank lays the mask over mikes nose turns the screw
as mike inhales the hissing air klein turns mike on his side probes his lung and lower back areas
hes going to be alright isnt he
the lungs are wet and his liver feels enlarged
five mil i
maguire moves to the counter finds an i
needle fills it with digoxin
whats the matter with him
just then another r
klein eyes the nurse who immediately picks up on the look
archibald would you come with me
hes in good hands
please theres a few procedures we need to go over
what kind of procedures
gently takes j
pushes her hand away
were going to be admitting your son sir
youll need to fill out the proper forms
for godsakes cant the forms wait
john and denise watch helplessly as maguire stabs an i
needle into mikes vein
its possible your son may need a transfusion
well need to test you both for blood types
edges them out as swoosh the divider curtain is pulled shut
and denise are escorted by the r
to the admitting desk
arms bent fists clenched theyre pressing sterilized gauze pads to their inner elbow joints
first name mr
the admitting nurses fingers glide over the computer keyboard inputting all vital info
and the name of your insurance company
spins and sees jimmy and gina rushing through the e
where is he is he okay
i dont know
theyre running tests
were waiting to find out
what can we do
gina throws her arms around denise consoling her
your card mr
your insurance card
ill need to make a copy for our files
pulls out his wallet fumbles for his card hands it to the admitting nurse
and denise walk past rows of quiet glassed in rooms full of patients and life support machines
they enter mikes room to find reggie a twenty four year old nurse hooking mike up to the high monitor above the bed
mike is lying supine awake but groggy hooked up to a heart monitor iv drips hideous plastic tubes up his nose down his throat on full inotropic support
denise leans over kisses mike
hey slugger how are you doing
mike smiles weakly struggles to speak points to the tubes
get some rest
mike closes his eyes
hes really out of it
i love you kid
denise reacts to all the flashing numbers on the monitors
whats all this
this is so we can monitor mikes vitals
and this one is blood pressure
diastolic and systolic
reggie points to a bank of monitors
in the middle is a flashing number
wed like this top number to stay above ninety but between eighty five and ninety is acceptable for now
anything less than eighty is dangerous
if his blood pressure drops were going to have to do something
we cant have him going below seventy again
what would that mean
seventy and below hes in heart failure
and denise watch the blood pressure monitor holding steady at
suddenly the number drops a notch to
jones baker azbirjari hererra
the daisy wheel pounds incessantly
eight members hope memorial hospitals administrative staff are seated at a long conference table
among them are dr
raymond turner mid s rebecca payne hope memorial hospitals administrative supervisor and dr
the father works part time
mothers a cashier in a supermarket
hows the familys insurance
she shakes her head weve got a problem
payne sees j
and denise enter and she is immediately on her feet
rebecca payne hospital director
this is doctor turner head of our cardiology department
hows our boy doing
please sit down
john and denise sit and the lights are dimmed
turner approaches an illuminated display of x rays
he uses a pointer to clarify
this x ray is that of a normal nine year old heart
this one is your sons
and denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist sized organs on the translucent glass
there are septal defects here here and here which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema and malignant ventricular ectopy
as you can see mikes heart is approximately three times normal size
he points to mikes heart huge in comparison
i dont understand
could you pout that in laymans terms
basically theres not enough blood being pumped by the heart so it backs up in the lungs
sort of like a sponge getting wet
mikes heart is trying but im afraid its working too hard
so whats he need
turner gathers himself takes off his glasses
im afraid were considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery mr
your sons heart is useless
he is going to need a transplant
the room goes silent
wait a second
there are other options
to do nothing
keep him as comfortable as possible
you need to start thinking about quality of life now
i dont understand
we were just with him
he seemed fine
hes going to seem fine
but as his heart gets worse he will become increasingly fatigued need more and more sleep until one day hell go to sleep and he wont wake up
i know its difficult but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left
you might want to make it a happy time
oh my god
and transplantation is a high risk operation
you could lose your son on the table
you may not want to take that chance
what do you think dr
this isnt my decision
i know that
im asking for your opinion
without surgery how long does he have
this is too much for denise
she breaks into tears
john puts his arms around her steadies her gathers his thoughts
what would you do if it was your son
id do the transplant
looks at denise who nods
lets do it
the first step is to get mikes name on an organ recipient list
once he does his chances are very good
your sons an extremely rare type so theres less demand
with b positive blood mike could go to the top of the list right away
its not that simple
there are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list mr
the cost of transplant surgery is expensive
in most cases prohibitively so
ive got major medical
dont worry im covered
actually weve already checked with your carrier
theres no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude
there must be some kind of mistake
my son is covered
ive got full medical
what about you mrs
do you have coverage
ive only been working at the market a short time
you need to be there two years before you get benefits
payne flips through the archibald family file
i see that you dont own your own home
no investments stocks bonds
and you have a little over one thousand in savings
did you hear what i said
im telling you im insured
that may very well be but youll have to check with your carrier on that
in the meantime im afraid were going to have to treat you as a cash account
how much does a transplant cost
transplant surgery doctor fees post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs youre looking at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars minimum
what are you saying
if i dont come up with a quarter million dollars youre not going to treat my son
we have treated him
we continue to treat him
now i understand how upset you are sir
but with other options available we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly
if you opt for replacement surgery thats your choice
but the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients
we require a down payment before the patients name can be placed on the receiver list
what kind of down payment
seventy five thousand
seventy five thousand dollars to put my kids name on a list
our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money
yes it takes money to provide health service
its expensive for you and for us
my job is to keep this program alive
now im sorry but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your sons name on the list
and denise move down the hallway towards the elevators
you dont want to treat my kid
ill take him over to county memorial
you dont want to do that
i dont huh
its a county hospital
they have to treat him
no they dont
transplantation is always considered an elective procedure
this hospitals politics are particularly infuriating but youre in the right place
you want dr
his bedside manner is terrible but hes one of the foremost surgeons in the country
what do you want us to do
you heard payne
were a cash account
i know its outrageous but dont give up
talk to your insurance company
check with our human resources department for medical assistance state childrens services medicaid
just dont take no for an answer
john sits in a cubicle across from his employers insurance representative
you coverage has changed mr
weve recently switched carriers from a ppo to an hmo
its a less expensive policy but unfortunately it has some restrictions
what kind of restrictions
this is how it works
non management part time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage
but im not part time
im a full time employee
its just slow right now
but your coverage is based on house worked
like i said you only qualify for second tier and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty thousand dollars
wait a minute
ive been paying for my coverage for years
you take it out of my paycheck every week
and thats why were going to cover you for the full twenty
let me get this straight
you drop me from full time to part time switch carriers and now youre telling me im not fully covered even though i have a policy that says i am
doesnt seem right does it
my son is very sick
if im not covered ive got a serious problem
i understand that but theres nothing i can do
you might want to try state services
either that or you can file an appeal
the insurance rep pushes a stack of papers towards j
here are the forms
itll take about seven working days
and denise at a window counter talking to a state employee who only knows whats on the computer screen in front of her
says here you already have medical insurance
what little we have is already used up
i understand that
but then you dont qualify
we only give assistance to patients without coverage
are you on welfare
you should be on welfare
we both have jobs
oh thats too bad
sorry i cant help you
a county worker flips through j
it says here your sons condition is congenital
whats the difference
it means its a pre existing condition one your son was born with
a birth defect
obviously it pre dates your coverage
otherwise we could help
hes had clean check ups every year
i dont know what to tell you
its right here in the report
have you tried medicaid
another state run facility
you dont qualify
ive got a kid whos dying and im broke
if i dont qualify who does
lower your voice sir
i mean what do you guys do anyway
why does this service even exist
i dont need you to be sorry
i need some help
we see more of the list this time
boldfaced columns appear hospital center cross match weight range blood type
vernell tilson des moines metropolitan hospital entry date feb
arthur friedlander jefferson city st
josephs medical center entry date april lbs
takes the trip down with rebecca payne
no no no
you filed an appeal
an appeal is for an already existing claim
what you needed to file was a grievance
youll have to resubmit
but that could take up to thirty days
i dont have thirty days
i know that
and frankly im tired of getting the runaround
i need my sons name on that list
archibald your hospital bill is in excess of thirty thousand dollars
so far we havent received any kind of payment
we have bent over backward to help you
oh is that right
yes sir that is right
but there is a limit to this hospitals generosity
once and for all you are not covered by insurance
we will need to guarantee payment
you want money
alright ill get you your money
john selling everything
television washer dryer sofa
strangers walk through the house and make offers
jimmy palumbo shakes his head
you know what you should do
you should try that newsguy that does all those special investigative reports
you know the one
the guy with the hair
the trouble shooter
whats his name
a woman offers twenty dollars for the coffee table
takes it pocketing the money
tuck lampley with plastic hair sits at his desk his lunch spread all over the table
hope you dont mind if i eat while we talk
im up to here today you know
go go go
no thats fine
thanks for seeing us
so what can i do you for
my son mike went into heart failure playing in his little league game
i have full insurance through my work but now theyre saying they dont have to pay
lots of reasons
he dont even understand half of them
what about the hospital
hope memorial hospital
yeah hope memorial
dont they have to cover it
thats what i thought
the hospital says i have to pay cash
otherwise the only thing i can do is bring mike home and watch him die
lampley is already working on the story in his head putting all the pieces in the right place
bureaucracy of the medical establishment american family caught in the middle
big guy versus little guy
we were thinking you could do one of them special interest pieces you know
send donations write your congressman
that kind of thing
anything would help
what theyve done to your son is outrageous and i want to help
but ive got to run it by my producers
ive got bosses just like anyone else
so leave me your phone number and ill get back to you
the fire sale continues
the archibald refrigerator is carried out the front door
after sunday services the pastor hands john and envelope of collection money and the congregation wishes him luck
mike is sitting up in bed
hes pale but hes in a good mood joking around with his he man poses
john and denise react to something funny he says and the three of them are laughing
john looks at the monitor
it now reads
john jimmy and gina go door to door soliciting donations
reads to mike from a book
mikes eyes close and john smiles as he falls asleep
as john closes the book something catches his eye
at the far end of the icu a man in a coal black suit stands over a boy in a hospital bed
he is the hospital chaplain and he is performing last rites
the boys distraught parents hang on to each other for comfort
the chaplain kisses the crucifix touches it to the boys forehead and begins to pray
john and denise exchange a look
the chaplain whispers incantations and he makes the sign of the cross over the dying child
john and denise turn
the monitor now reads
john and denise are refused for a loan
tight on a diamond ring through a lapidarys eyeglass
there are two gold wedding rings on the counter
the jeweler nods his head and john takes the cash
mike oxygen tubes in his nostrils is fast asleep the monitors chirping quietly
denise sits by mikes bed hands clasped and head bowed praying hard
walks in catches the anxiety on her face before seeing the cause
the monitor now reads
john selling the truck
a prospective buyer inspects as j
hell take it
takes the money drops the keys in the buyers hand and watches his truck drive away
from inside the house the phone rings
hurries inside to get it
furniture appliances everythings gone
just a few boxes
john picks up the ringing phone
theyre releasing him
turner just left
theyre sending mike home in the morning
what are you talking about
they cant just send him home
i gave them money yesterday
it doesnt matter
theyre releasing him
but i spoke to the hospital
i took care of
yeah you always take care of it
but its never enough is it
you need to do something john
do you hear me
john stands in mikes bedroom looking at his sons things
each thing with a memory
the body builder posters
he picks up a photo of john denise and a seven year old mike clowning around
s face thinking thinking
steps off a city bus carrying a gym bag
windbreaker buttoned baseball cap pulled down tight he moves with purpose toward the hospital
the broken battered and bloodied sit on chairs waiting to be seen
a baby boy wails in the arms of his hispanic mother rosa
miriam hugely pregnant sits next to her husband steve a contractor dressed in paint stained coveralls
lester a blood soaked towel wrapped around his hand
mitch s black jeans shades and a huge hangover sits with his arm around his girlfriend julie a platinum bombshell
her face is cut her eyes swollen
debby utley a young sensitive nurse sits behind the admitting desk
whats going on
are we going to get seen or what
the doctor will be with you shortly sir
shortly we could all be dead
weve been waiting damn near an hour
the electric doors slide open and j
enters and looks around before moving quickly through and disappearing into the main hospital entrance
moves through the corridors intently a man on a mission
turner escorts a wheelchair to the hospital exit
in a wheelchair is a middle aged man dressed in designer casuals a rolex wrapped around his wrist
his name is carroll shelby and he is a transplant patient
one of the lucky recipients
his elegantly dressed wife walks alongside
youre doing great carroll
youve already gained back five pounds
i think youre the only patient i have who actually eats the food here
thanks for everything doctor
approaches the group
his face reveals nothing
this is mr
his sons a patient of mine
well youre certainly in good hands
forces a smile
the shelbys say goodbye before leaving
denise said youre letting mike go home
archibald im a physician
i dont make policy decisions
thats handled by the board of trustees
youre head of cardiac surgery doctor
youre telling me a person in your position makes a recommendation no ones going to listen
i make recommendations all the time
the final decision rests with the board
wags a hope memorial brochure at turner
you and your staff did over three hundred operations last year
its right here on page of the hospital brochure
nice color pictures happy faces
three hundred plus surgeries at a quarter million a pop
thats seventy five million dollars your department took in
couldnt you do just one on good faith
please take your hands off me
im not asking for charity doc
i dont know how but i swear to god if it takes me the rest of my life i will
you have my word as a man
i tried to help
but its out of my hands
something in j
heart pounding he pushes turner through a pair of heavy metal doors and into the emergency room
shoves turner inside pulls out a baretta
mm points it at turners head
im not asking anymore doctor
now i want a new heart for my kid
drops the gym bag on the floor unzips it pulls out a length of heavy chain
quickly he wraps the chain around the power bar threads a lock and clamps it shut
turner marches over to a phone and picks it up
sticks the weapon in his face
dont even think about it
turner hangs up the phone
hey what are you doing
sees the stocky security guard trains the gun on him
hands over your head
the security guard nervously raises his hands above his head
this part wasnt covered in his training manual
give me your gun
i uh dont have a gun
reacts awkwardly wasnt expecting this response
then sit down
and stay down
the guard obediently drops into a chair
archibald i understand how upset you are but this is not the right way to handle it
i tried your way doc
it didnt work
now were going to try it my way
in one of the treatment rooms dr
marjorie klein and leo maguire attend to a man in motorcycle leathers with a bloodied head wound
they watch j
lock the ambulance entrance
what are you doing
i took your advice doctor
im not taking no for an answer
several patients and medical personnel see the gun and bolt out the front door
with turner still in tow j
hurries to the er entrance pulls more chains from his gym bag and secures both doors
turning back he sees lester at the admitting desk arguing with debby utley
a clipboard with medical information forms sits in front of him
whats going on here
lester removes the blood soaked towel
the tips of three fingers have been severed from his right hand
they want me to sign
its not going to work
archibald these people have nothing to do with this
you have got to let them go
they need treatment
this is a hospital isnt it
youre a doctor
points to lester
start with him
turner stands frozen
whats the matter doc
you want to see his insurance card first
stands on a table addressing the room
a madman with a gun
this hospital is under new management ladies and gentlemen
from now on free care for everyone
various reactions from the people in the room
points to the security guard
come with me
leads the security guard to the elevators
kill the power
i dont have a key for that
youve got the keys to the city
now do it
finally the guard inserts an allen wrench into the lock and kills the power
takes a crowbar from his bag and jimmies the elevator control box busting fuses and yanking wires
the elevator looks sick
its not going anywhere
looks around and sees a snake eye security camera bolted to the ceiling
a skinny pimple faced kid with a big chrome badge sits in front of a dozen closed circuit monitors
on one a man in a baseball cap is now bashing the camera with a crowbar
a blizzard of white snow crackles on the monitor
confused the pimply faced kid picks up the phone
this is the security desk at hope memorial hospital
i think you guys better get down here
we may have a situation
paces next to the windows sizing up the room
nearby the hispanic baby wails
everybody does exactly what i say and nobody gets hurt
he looks around the room everybody battered bloodied and bruised
a superbright techie geek pokes his head into an office where tuck lampley is having a meeting with his bosses
this just came in over the police radio
someone is holding hope memorial hostage
realizing lampley stares at the tv executives
hope memorial hospital
lampley is already up and on the move
is it a good enough story for you now george
do you think its that guy with the kid boss
what do you think
maguire leads lester back to the treatment area
lester hands him a baggie filled with three severed fingertips
lester dont lose my fingers man
had them fingers my whole life
under breath to julie we were here before that guy
youll get your turn
nobodys going anywhere for a while
glances at the admitting desk and sees the chair move
he lifts his weapon and moves towards it
he jumps around the corner of the desk to find debby utley underneath scared to death
im going to have to ask you to join the others miss
the sound of a screaming baby is cutting through the room like nails on a blackboard
approaches rosa who clutches her child defensively
whats the problem
rosa shakes her head
she doesnt speak much english
yo no se que pasa
el llora por toda la noche
yo pienso que tiene dolor en su oreja
en su oido

the babys tiny fingers reach for his ear
singles out debby utley
this kids got an ear infection
s finger pointed at her debby falls apart bursting into tears
i dont know anything

maguire hands a bottle of gooey pink amoxycillin to debby

mitch tries to engage j
with a wink and a big flashy smile

babys pretty banged up and weve been waiting for hours
i told you once already
thats what weve been doing
shoots mitch a look before moving to miriam and steve
when is the baby due
rubs his head
the sound of the automatic doors banging against the chain is heard
a red white ambulance is parked outside
three paramedics are pushing against the locked doors pounding on the glass
runs from the treatment area sees a body laying on a stretcher
got a gunshot victim here
lost a lot of blood
take him to another hospital
he wont make it
were losing him
open the door
to maguire you recognize these guys

paramedic wears the same blue jacket and pants but his shoes are black with leather soles
that ones a cop
i was here when you brought in your son
i shot straight with you then
im shooting straight with you now
im telling you these guys are cool
studies maguires eyes measures his honesty and then unchains the door and opens it pointing the weapon
the paramedics see j
s gun and their hands go up
you open your coat
you heard me
take the coat off
paramedic takes off his coat
theres nothing underneath
hes not police
leave the stretcher
the paramedics back away and take off
maguire rolls the stretcher inside and j
re locks the doors
names stawitzky i gave them all the money in the register
they shot me anyway
peels back a corner of the blanket looks for weapons recoils at the sight of the mans blood
maguire moves in squeezes the mans wrist takes his pulse
we need to prep this man for immediate surgery
hes in boo koo trouble
this is out of my department
im a heart surgeon
im not an emergency room physician
you are now
come on doctor
its like riding a bike
pretend youre getting paid
turner and j
seventy five milligrams demerol iv lidocaine local
turner takes the mans pulse as they roll the stretcher towards the trauma room
watches the anesthesia cup placed over the mans nose and he goes down for the count
mitch fires a look at the stocky security guard
when i get out of here im suing this hospital and your security company
unseen by mitch j
has moved behind him
what makes you so sure youre getting out of here at all
mitch sits back down
leans against a wall takes a breath
suddenly he hears the woop woop of police sirens
he looks out the window and sees police cars storming the front of the hospital
the cavalry has arrived
here we go
the summer sun beats down as cop cars careen into the parking lot
behind them an unmarked crown victoria plows slowly through a growing crowd
lieutenant frank grimes bails out before the car stops smoothing out the wrinkles in his rumpled suit
he reacts with surprise when he sees veteran on the spot news reporter tuck lampley already on the scene with his camera crew
what are you doing here lampley
shouldnt you be out exposing tragic miscarriages or justice or something
yeah well screw you too
grimes pushes past but lampley dogs him
theres a rumor floating around frank
some guys holding the hospital hostage
needs an operation for his kid
any truth to it
you know more than i do
youre full of shit
hey then were even
i never believe a word you guys say either
this is big isnt it frank
i can feel it
come on what do you got
read my lips
i just got here
but i promise as soon as i know anything youll be the last to know
youre a real horses ass
you know that
grimes chuckles as he moves past the police barricade sizing up his territory
he runs into swat team sergeant tim moody already on the scene
moodys accompanied by the pimply faced security guard who phoned it in
this guys in for the long haul lieutenant
he locked down the er barricaded himself inside killed the power on the elevators
we could bust down the door but the sonofabitch might start killing everybody
any other way in
im working on it
how many hostages
security guard here said there could be anywhere from ten to twenty
any security cameras
the guy took out the one in the er sir
but the hospital has two covert pinpoints hidden inside the treatment facility
i dont understand
the hospitals own private security
every hospital has them in case a mental patient goes crazy or an employee starts stealing pharmaceuticals
theyre hidden in the walls throughout the hospital
theres two inside the er area
can we get them
were setting up a video tap right now
should be up and running in a few minutes
grimes looks at the pimply faced kid
are you in charge of security
thatd be wally pitoniak
hes at home
its his day off
not anymore it aint
get him down here
to moody i need to make contact with this guy
can you get me a secure line
one of our guys is on the inside
hes got a walkie talk
you might want to give this a shot
the kid hands grimes his walkie talkie
alright but put a clamp on all phone lines to the emergency room
if he picks up the phone i want him talking to me
grimes looks around sees more news vans arriving
and keep the media on a need to know basis
until i say so the press doesnt need to know nothing
now whos in charge of this hospital
rebecca payne sir
shes off today too
does anyone work at this hospital
people get sick on saturday dont they
watches the police build up outside
rosa is holding her baby who is quieter now not crying
how old is he
klein approaches j
ill need to do an internal examination on this woman
sees steve the womans husband picking at his fingernails anxious
whyd you come to an er
why not go right to maternity
miriam went into labor early
her water broke we called our doctor got the service
excuse me but i think my fiancee broke her arm
could somebody take a look at her please
moves over to julie regards her black eye her swollen face
shes fine aint she
all that and twenty two years old
little slice of heaven
must be doing something right am i right
looks at mitch
is this guy for real
to julie whats your story
what does it look like
i was talking to her
a drunk ran a red light and slammed into us
it was an accident
a muffled voice suddenly squawks on the security guards walkie talkie
grabs the guards walkie talkie presses talk
the police have cordoned off a section of the parking lot and transformed it into a command post
police personnel invade the area
tables phones and monitors are being set up
this is lieutenant frank grimes of the chicago police department
are you the man in charge
who am i speaking to
come on my friend
were going to be doing a lot of talking today
you dont have to give me your real name but ive got to call you something
call me john q
alright john q
again my name is lieutenant grimes
but i want you to call me frank
can you do that
im the hostage negotiator
ive been a cop for thirty five years and this is all i do
i dont play games
and i dont fool around
so if i say something you can take it to the bank
now lets get down to it
is anybody hurt
its an emergency room frank
this guys a comedian
as long as it stays that way we can keep talking
grimes walks along the perimeter of the police barricade
a crowd of lookie loos is starting to gather
murphys law john
you picked the hottest day of the year
its a hundred degrees out here
and im allergic to the heat
so lets wrap this up as quickly as possible
now what exactly is it you want
find rebecca payne hope memorials administrative supervisor
tell her i want my kids name on the donor list
boy or girl
you know ive got two boys
two girls and two boys
dont handle me frank
i dont want to be handled
it insults my intelligence
if i dont get what i want youre going to have a lot of dead bodies on your hands
you only need to remember two things
my kid and the donor list
you got that
take it easy john
the ideas not to get too excited
mikes name goes on that list or theres going to be a blood bath in here
i hear you loud and clear
rebecca payne right
im writing it down
lot of cops out here john
are you sure you want to go through with this
youre in a tough spot john
a lot of trouble
but if you work with me if youre reasonable well figure a way out of this
we have to have a little faith in one another
because thats what faiths all about
believing when you dont want to believe
besides what else are you going to do
just tell payne
hope memorial hospital command post day the line goes dead
alright what the hell is a donor list
paces the floor
its slower now
everyone just sitting around waiting to see what will happen
debby has pulled herself together for the time being
she calls out to john
would you really do it
what you said about the bloodbath
would you really shoot us
ill do what i have to do to help my kid
he cant shoot us all
theres only eight bullets in that weapon
first ones got your name on it mitch
mitch mumbles and kicks his feet up sparking a cigarette
keeps pacing back and forth and steve is still picking them fingernails
you know how it is kind of nervous
what are you hoping for
boy or girl
miriam wants a baby girl
doesnt matter to me as long as the babys healthy
steve stops short
realizing his faux pas
i didnt meant j
shakes it off not to worry
john notices julie her arm now in a sling not broken
who was driving
off julies look the car
whats that got to do with it
how come she got all banged up and you didnt
what do you call this
mitch pulls back his hair shows off his wounds
surface scratches on his arms and around his neck and face
somebody get this man a band aid
shut up smart ass
his airbag went off
what kind of car do you drive there hot shot
a benz huh
one point six liter
it does about a hundred and eighty in reverse
its a classic
the other hostages study j
where is he going with this
yeah well ive got news for you mitch
mercedes didnt install passenger airbags until
a long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at mitch realizing the obvious
i was drunk
tears stream down julies proud face for the first time mitch is speechless
he looks like a car that wont start
finally he gets up and walks away
well well well
my man mitch
mister girlfriend beater
what do you got to say now bitch
maguire and turner enter
maguires got a big smile on his face
hes going to make it
hows it feel doc
saving a life
feels pretty good doesnt it
mikes blood pressure drops from to
mike is resting eyes closed
denise stands vigilantly by mikes bedside
carrying an armload of medicine
he replaces the iv bag and starts to administer the meds
one after the other reggie injects them into the iv line and mike stirs
its a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build up
but its potassium sparing so he needs this one to supplement
for his blood pressure
dig for his heart
gosh it seems like so much
yeah its a lot
this is antibiotic
just in case
these two i dont really know what theyre for
i dont know mrs
i just do what they tell me
he feels queasy and his mouth is bone dry
i dont feel good
this is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes buddy
but im going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on
how does that sound
mike forces a smile dips his head slightly
reggie leaves the room
something catches denises eye
down the pediatric icu she sees the hospital chaplain again
there is a commotion
the parents are crying
and a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child
the chaplain tries to console the devastated mother who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room
is dad coming
where is he
denise steals a final look at the parents overcome with grief
i dont know sweetheart
i dont know
mitch is snooping around one of the treatment rooms always careful to keep an eye on j
he nearly jumps out of his skin when he sees the security guard standing next to him
what are you up to
never mind me
you know that
some security guard
you should have zapped the bastard
besides im not putting my neck on the line
not for eight fifty an hour
mitch reaches pulls a cas cart closer
he carefully slides open a drawer steals a sharp edged scalpel slips it into his pocket
next he spots a spray top cannister marked ethychloride
what the hell are you doing
looking out for number one
you want to stay alive
sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here
wake up fat boy
the cops are coming in shooting
they dont give a shit about his kid
and as soon as he realizes that were history
he finds out you got a scalpel youre the one thats history asshole
he doesnt look so bad to me
no listen to me you stupid rent a cop
im not a slob
ive got a life and it means something to me
im not dying in this shithole
the vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table
everybody is chowing down
the thing i dont understand is why no one caught it before
mike had check ups every year since the day he was born
why didnt his doctors pick it up
was he ever diagnosed with a murmur
yeah he was
about a week after he was born
but his doctor said that was normal
that it happens all the time
he might not have been tested thoroughly enough
you got an hmo right
theres your answer
hmos pay their doctors not to test
their way of keeping costs down
lets say mike needed additional testing insurance says they wont cover them
the doctor keeps his mouth shut and no ones the wiser
little mike falls through the cracks and come christmas the hmo sends the doc a big fat bonus check
looks at turner
is that true
not likely but possible
then mikes doctors could have known about his condition all along
and he could have been treated years ago
nothing personal doc but you all are a bunch of damn crooks
you see heres the problem
over here youve got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead
thats how they make money
and over here youve got your medical establishment doctors pharmaceutical companies who dont want you healthy or dead
they want you sick
thats the way they make money
its all about getting paid man
and the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug of war
its a game
and the end result is people dont get the treatment they deserve
because then no one gets paid
but what about that thing you guys take
what do they call it
the hippocratic oath
more like the hipp crit cial oath to me
hows that go doc
i solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk except those without major medical
im telling you its not that far from the truth
the shit happens all the time
paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath
big boys in accounting find out they cant pay they send them packing
hospitals cant turn people away
i thought there were laws about that
there are laws
but there are also ways around the laws
all we have to do is stabilize them
after that were off the hook
turner is getting hot
thats not how it works
thats exactly how it works
maybe not up there on the fifth floor but down here if you aint got no money you get a band aid a foot in the ass and youre out
is that how you paid for that armani suit doc
finally turner explodes
ive heard all the bitching and moaning i can stand
sure the system sucks
theres red tape and theres worse
theres tough luck
and if youre looking for kindness and compassion theyre in short supply these days
but some of us got into medicine to do something about it
i break my ass every day trying to make a difference trying to plug the dam
im in it up to my elbows
ive seen people live who shouldnt and the other way around
and when i say i do my best i mean it
so dont tell me about doctors because theyre the last stop between you and six feet under
and if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire fine
im the bad guy
but whos holding the fucking gun
turner gets up and walks into the treatment room
whats his problem
ive got to be honest if my kid was dying and i couldnt get help i dont know what id do
but id do something
glances quickly at the clock
he picks up the phone clicking the button trying to get a dial tone
a black swat phone starts ringing and the policemen freeze
a computer cop runs over and calls out to the lieutenant
grimes waves him off and cues his portable
this is frank grimes
the line is clipped john
you pick up the phone you get me
then can i help you with something
where are we at with that list
im working on it john
but i need some time
time i dont have lieutenant
i want to talk about the hostages
what about them
whats going on in there
how are they
same as they were before frank
were all just kind of waiting on you
at the command post moody is now waving his arms
grimes moves over and looks at the monitors
the videotape is up
the images are wide and grainy
giving him his first look at the hostages
on the screen j
moves into frame
moody taps the screen and grimes nods
thats our guy
i want you to let some of them go
i do for you
you do for me
show some good faith
weve got a lot of nervous people out here john
make everybody breathe a lot easier if we saw some happy faces
good faith only takes you so far
you see i believe in the merit system
and so far you havent earned any points
a navy blue unmarked crown victoria pulls up and out steps rebecca payne and police chief gus monroe
they are quickly ushered over to the monitors where they see j
s face on the screens
his name is john archibald
his sons on the fifth floor pediatric icu
marjorie klein moves over with a very hysterical miriam in tow
holds up a finger telling her to wait
i need to talk to you
into phone can you hold on a minute frank
this womans six centimeters dilated and the baby is breech
i cant do anything for her here
she needs to be moved to maternity immediately
rubs his eyes and lets out a breath
hes under a lot of stress
grimes has his hand over the receiver as he barks out orders to moody
put people on the door
nobody talks to the wife but me
grimes sticks out his free hand to monroe who shakes it
good to see you gus
how are you
whats going on
youre looking at it
are you there frank
yeah im here
i changed my mind
i am going to let some of the hostages go
thats the right thing
but when i do the clock starts
you have one hour to get back to me with some good news
monroe is glued to the monitors
his wheels are already spinning
grimes covers the receiver to speak to him
isnt it a little early for you to be here gus
who called in the heavy artillery
i mean it frank
if my boys not on the list in an hour i promise you someones going to die
this is bad frank
lot of people watching this one
big embarrassment if it doesnt go away real quiet like
well give me some time
im working on it
i got it john
im hearing you
they look on monroes face tells grimes that something is wrong
grimes contd gus
theres no time on this one frank
this ones just got to go away
puts down the walkie talkie and points at miriam and rosa
you and you
come with me
maguire give me a hand
please let my husband go with me
honey for godsakes just do as the man says
get out of here
im not leaving you here alone
shit ill go
shut your face
what kind of man are you
screw you tyrone
steve leaps from his seat and goes after mitch bristling with the racial slur
moves in fast trying to separate them
but instead of going for steve mitch goes for broke and rushes j
the ethylchloride is out and mitch sprays it into j
s eyes temporarily blinding him
john tries to get his bearings but mitch is already swinging the scalpel
blocks the knife his arm is sliced and starts to gush
mitch goes for the kill but j
grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground the scalpel and johns gun clattering to the floor
the element of surprise gone mitch is now getting the worst of it
is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it
mitch sees the gun across the floor next to julie
julie baby get the gun
julie gets up
shoot him honey
but instead of grabbing the weapon she picks up the ethylchloride sprays it directly in mitchs eyes from superclose range and doesnt stop
mitchs hands fly to his eyes and he screams
gets up and recovers his weapon sticking it in his waistband
julie stands over mitch who is still writhing in pain
you stupid bitch
julie rears back and with her go go boot she kicks mitch square in the groin
thats for beating the shit out of me
she kicks him again
thats for being an asshole
once more for good measure
and thats for calling me a bitch
the hostages look at julie with newfound respect
takes the security guards handcuffs drags mitch across the floor and manacles him to the radiator
everybodys a tough guy
grimes voice crackles over the walkie talkie
where are those hostages john
moves to the door unlocks the chain points to rosa and miriam
both of you
rosa launches into a rapid fire monologue of thanks
she speaks quickly saying the word dios over and over
whats she saying
she said shell pray for his boy
miriam kisses steve holds him tight
everythings going to be okay
the baby is going to be just fine
puts a hand on steves shoulder
get out of here
steve is stunned
cant get to his feet
the front door opens and steve miriam rosa and the baby are released
we see channel reporter tuck lampley doing a live stand up
the gunman has just freed several hostages who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team
will the man known as john q
get a heart for his little boy
time will tell
where this leads next is anyones guess
live from hope memorial hospital this is tuck lampley
the hostages are hustled through the police barricade by a team of kevlar riot police
the media rush the hostages shouting out questions and frantically trying to stick their microphones close enough
is it true an ambulance dropped off a gunshot victim after the gunman took over the er
he unlocked the door and let him in
if he didnt the man would have died
very good man
good man el senor
but tuck lampleys attention is on the police command post where dozens of blue uniforms crowd around a small bank of monitors
suddenly it hits him
theyve got a camera in there
i dont believe it
theyre watching a video feed
squints through the glasses
how do you know
well theyre looking at something freddy
and i need to know what it is
can you steal it
no problem boss
if they got it i can get it
wally pitoniak chief of hospital security has arrived
he and sergeant moody are standing over an unrolled building plan that has been stretched across the command table like a battle map
monroe and grimes have rebecca payne on the defensive
you mean all of this could have been avoided if you had just put the kids name on a list
dont you dare try to blame this on me
you think mr
archibald is the only one with a sick child
try the hiv ward
theres a whole floor full of them
people get sick
thats the way it goes
im faced with tough decisions every day
the fact is theres a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son
the fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance sir
and theres one of me in every hospital
thats not my fault
its just the way the countrys set up
you want to change it
write your congressman
moody looks over from his map
excuse me but why dont we just tell him his sons on the list
doesnt that make sense
i mean hows he going to know
thats not a bad idea
you want me to put his name on the list fine but its a mistake
you give in to this man theres going to be guns in every hospital in america
i dont personally care if you put the kid on it or not
thats your conscience
but give us a hand will you honey
work with us
tell him his kids going to be alright
do you think you can do that
pitoniak has indicated a spot on the schematic by circling it with a red pen
sir take a look at this
monroe moves over
what is it
pitoniak points to the map marking a red x through the circle
its a phone
moody points to one of the monitors
on screen a view of the nurses station and beyond
and in the foreground big and clear as day is the red nurses phone
its that phone
so what now
whats the plan
i want to know
every day you read about this kind of shit
and now were in the middle of it
how is it going to end john
this country man
i swear to god
you cant go anywhere anymore without getting robbed mugged or murdered
kids killing classmates drive bys
i wont even go into a post office anymore
shut up mitch
you know how easy it was to get this gun
one gun show
youre just a punk with a gun
i understand your kid is sick but what makes him better than me
ive got a life too
yeah but youve got insurance
so what youre going to shoot me
because thats what youre telling the cops
if poor little mikey doesnt get the very first heart available all of us die
no i dont want to cheat anyone
i just want my kid to have a fair shot
so whats the plan stan
i mean exactly
how long are you going to hold us hostage
until your son gets a new heart
i dont know
use your head
correct me if im wrong doctor but hearts dont come just like that
it takes months years sometimes
then whats your move
im not letting my kid die
im out of options alright
i have no more ideas
this is it
the end of the road
im looking for an act of god
im looking for a miracle
the white bmw speeds along the highway tries to pass the semi in front of her and smashes into the embankment
its the same accident as before only this time its regular speed
frank grimes stands outside mikes room just watching him through the glass
mikes blood pressure has fallen to
he is asleep each breath magnified by the hollow mechanized wheeze of the ventilator pump
denise sits by his side praying hard tears rolling down her cheeks
payne arrives and the two stand there a moment
watching the scene grimes is visibly moved
even payne and her super bitch attitude are a little humbled
no matter how many times i see it this is the part i always hate
do you have any children miss payne
no i dont
they move to the doorway and tap lightly on the door
denises wet face turns to see the cause of the intrusion
could we have a word with you
denise grimes and payne by the elevators
this is my fault
when the hospital told me they were releasing mikey i was furious
i yelled at john to do something anything
i never thought
is he a violent man mrs
he wouldnt hurt a fly
thats not what hes saying
hes talking about killing people
has he spent any time in the military
hey what is this
i get whats going on here
you want me to tell you something you can use to hurt my husband
hes in a lot of trouble maam
were going to need you to talk to him
lets get something straight mister
you cant use me to make a case against john
i support my husband
whatever he does
im on his side
you dont talk to me
id tell you what i think of you but im a christian woman
now you people leave me alone
i have a sick child to look after
ive decided to put mikes name on the organ recipient list mrs
the hospital will pay for everything
denise looks at payne not daring to believe
this is too much for denise
she throws her arms around payne sobbing tears of joy
oh thank you
thank you so much
payne pats denise on the back awkwardly trying to comfort her
grimes and payne move quickly through the corridors
with the archibald woman back there
quite a performance
the sincere look the comforting embrace
for a minute i almost believed you cared
paynes eyes flash with anger
she looks like she wants to say something but she just turns and walks away
a restless crowd encircles the hospital cordoned off by police blockades uniformed cops forming a human wall around people
ems rescue vehicles rumble onto the scene sirens blaring
a police bus drives slowly into the parking lot
a swat team dressed in flak jackets and riot gear pours out
an armada of soft drink hot dog and ice cream vendors smell gold and stake out their claims
its saturday afternoon and the circus is in town
and the hostages watch tuck lampley on an overhead tv
jimmy palumbo is being interviewed
on screen j
sees the massive police build up swallows
he looks at the clock
ten minutes and counting
a red and white medical helicopter descends from the sky
the accident scene is now secured by the flashing lights of police and medical teams
the screeching sound of cutting metal is heard as the rescuers use the jaws of life
as we see the car more closely now we notice that the womans arm rests out the open window
on her wrist is a silver donor bracelet
grimes returns to find the post empty
nobody there except a few policemen and sergeant moody who is doing a check on his walkie
whats going on
where is everybody
moody indicates the map and the monitor
were sending in one of ours through the ventilation ducts
he indicates the red nurses phone
if we can get the target to that phone its a clear shot
is that right
that is right
on whos orders
police chief gus monroe wally pitoniak and a swat team are in strategy session
they surround a sniper decked out in hbt regalia
a green video mini monitor is being checked and fastened to the front of the snipers vest
in the distance grimes bursts into the parking garage
not one word
i dont want to hear one goddamn word out of you frank
im not going to say anything
im just going to go get you your red nose
what did you say to me
are you calling me a clown
monroe goes after grimes and has to be restrained
i swear to god ill kill you
you going to do this behind my back you sonofabitch
check the time frank
look at your watch frank
the guy said at a quarter after he was going to start killing everybody and we dont have any reason not to believe him
so goddamn stupid
whats your great idea
there are no great ideas
but right now ive got a shot at this guy
i dont even know what were talking about
you know the score
you always take the clear shot
the wife has agreed to speak to him
let her talk him down
thats exactly what were going to do
you use the mans wife to set him up
let me paint a picture for you
and i hope its clear
what weve got is a lose lose
if this guy starts whacking out the hostages its bad right
but if we give in to this asshole its also bad
bad for who
its an election year
do you want me to spell it out for you
a b c
however it goes down this guys not going to make it
so you kill him
thats a p
theres not going to be a slaughter in there
not on my watch
youre out frank
no hard feelings
but youre officially relieved of duty
ill handle it from here
its not my first trip around the dance floor you know
grimes laughs out loud
hey i dont like it any better than you do but im under a lot of pressure here
everyone is wetting their pants on this one
believe me my ass is swinging in the breeze
monroe turns and walks away
grimes calls out after him
what about the hostages
they better keep their heads down
paces back and forth looking at the clock
his level of irritation is growing exponentially
where the hell are these guys
mitch is now contrite and trying to reconcile with his battered girlfriend
leave me alone
im a lousy drunk okay
i get out of control
i dont mean to but i do and i lose my mind
but that doesnt mean i dont love you
and ill change
i swear to god i will
its you and me baby
all the girls in the club they dont mean shit to me
its only you
ill get down on my knees if you want me to
look im on my knees in front of everyone
ill even forget you kicked me in the nuts
this is always how it goes
you treat me like shit then come crawling back to me like prince charming
not this time
she takes off a big diamond from her finger and drops it on the floor
it bounces and disappears under a table
aw come on
dont do that
that ring cost me twenty grand
poor little rich boy
used to getting everything he wants
buying his way in and out of everything
lester bends over and tries inconspicuously to look for the ring
the security guard gets on his hands and knees
even debby sneaks a peek
do you mind
stay away from the ring please
hey she dont want it
finders keepers man
the hostages laugh and mitch goes crazy
hey whats so funny
does everybody think this is a joke
you all should be thinking about your own lives hoping that phone rings with some good news
because in about five minutes the road is going to get a lot narrower
monroe moves outside and joins the other swat team personnel at the video tap
grimes follows to plead his case
but hes not a wacko gus
married with a family no history of mental illness
no radical political views
he doesnt fit the profile
you know as well as i do that anybody can fit the profile at any time
hes got a gun and hes got hostages
thats a profile
how long have we been doing this
youve got to trust me on this one
gus i like the guy
well i dont
i dont like nut jobs who point guns at innocent people
it pisses me off
hes not a nut job
maybe youre right
maybe hes bluffing
maybe hes just a nice guy with a problem
maybe hes misunderstood and needs to blow off a little steam
hey its possible
but i cant depend on that frank
this asshole has raised the stakes real high
and i need to match it just in case hes not bluffing
now weve got five minutes before he starts throwing bodies out the door
ive got a chance to end this right now and im taking it
im telling you youre making a mistake
we try harder
i want to be on the record
monroe hands grimes a set of headphones
you can be on whatever you want
now i got you a chair
put these on and have a seat
will you stop already
youre so emotional
on one of the monitors we see the er room and hostages
on the other the red nurses phone
the images are black and white and grainy
into walkie talkie this is moody
pitoniak climbs along the narrow catwalk until he reaches the area that houses the air conditioning unit
we hear the thunderous sound of an enormous compressor
pitoniak reaches for the ac on off switch
everyone keeps looking at the clock
three minutes to go
some first day huh
a little more stressful than i thought it would be
cracks a smile
just then a loud rattle echoes through the er pipes clanging
what was that
air conditioning unit just shut off
the power automatically shuts down when the thermostat hits a certain temperature
something doesnt feel right
an armed sniper pops his head up and slithers along the plated aluminum floor of an ac duct a remote mini monitor in the palm of his hand
snipers lock and load assault rifles and tuck lampleys crew frantically unspools fiber optic cable line to a hospital outsource cutting and splicing it back to the news van
wheres my picture
we just need to unscramble the police encryptment
were almost there
well hurry up
ive got a contact in cardiology
the cops are setting up a phone call with this guy and his wife
this is going to be unbelievable
the sniper continues to crawl through the duct toward a light emanating from a louvered grill
moody looks at his watch synchronizes
into walkie talkie are you with a wife
lets patch it through
all eyes on the clock
hostages tired hot emotionally spent
suddenly a phone clangs
looks around surprised
he sees a desk phone picks it up
he moves to another phone
but the mysterious phone continues to ring
wheres the phone
which phone is it
news monitors cackle with white snow
works the equipment
lampley pokes his head in
come on goddammit
theyre putting the call through
suddenly an audio hook up
the phone clanging like an alarm bell
we got sound
but wheres the video
i need picture
moves from phone to phone with no luck
the phone keeps ringing
finally he moves into the corridor spotting a red phone at the nurses station
surreal distorted focus like a funhouse mirror
races into frame and snatches the phone
this better be good frank
were on the list
payne was just here
mikes name is on the list
you did it
the hostages are glued to the tv watching covering from the outside about whats happening on the inside
were on the list
hows mikey doing
not so good baby
he looks like hes going away
cops are glued to the monitor
grimes looks on disgusted
theyve done everything they can but he keeps getting worse and worse
oh my god our poor baby
tears come and theres no stopping them
the sniper pops off the grill revealing the acoustic tile of the ceiling below
he raises the microphone to his mouth
two zero to base camp
im in position one
john rests his head and closes his eyes as he listens to his wife falling apart
you know sometimes i think hes an angel
a real angel sent down to keep us company for a while
its going to be alright sweetheart
are you praying for him
are you praying for our boy
oh my god what are we going to do
i dont know
maybe we should let him go
maybe its meant to be and we should accept it
dont say it
i dont know what else to think
the priest keeps coming
he wants to give him last rites
denise dont you lose faith now
you cant give up
mikeys going to make it
i swear on my life hes going to make it
youve got to believe
is he awake
can i talk to him
news van late afternoon on the monitors the blizzard of white snow morphs into a clear picture of j
on the phone
mikes tired voice suddenly comes over the audio
lampley is giving the thumbs up
they have picture
are we good
youre a genius
lampley puts on his most sincere look as the channel news team goes live
this is tuck lampley at hope memorial hospital where we are bringing you exclusive live coverage of a phone call between the father and the son he is fighting so
desperately to save
leaning against the wall
father and sons static scratched voices crackling
how you doing buddy
you hanging in there
how are you
dont worry about me
the sniper crawls from the louvered grill moving along two metal support rails
he takes a crouching position over the acoustic tile
mike is propped up in bed now breathing with some difficulty
hes so weak denise has to hold the phone
how come youre not here dad
where are you
oh im kind of tied up right now
i cant get away
quick jagged cuts american families
people in bars
tv appliance stores
even the hostages in the er
awestruck at what theyre witnessing
mom says i need a new heart
thats right champ
whats wrong with my heart
not a thing buddy
not a thing
we just have to put a new one in so you can be stronger okay
the sniper lifts a ceiling tile exposing the treatment room below
there across the room is j
talking on the phone
mike stops to catch his breath
hes really on his last legs
he just lays there a second before asking the big one
am i going to die
denises hand flies to her mouth
he pushes the barrel of his weapon through the opening in the ceiling and puts his eye to the scope
through the scope j
s tormented face racks into focus but he moves behind a partition
the shot is not clear
no mikey youre not going to die
how do you know
hey what good would the world be without you
without you there is no world
lampley stands by the news van watching the drama unfold on the monitor before him
hes a little choked up
oh my god
this is the greatest thing ive ever seen
this is my white bronco
moves out from behind the partition and into the open
hes a sitting duck now
the sniper cues his mic
on your call
the hostages are glued to the tv set
maguire julie debby marjorie klein hang on j
s every word
you know how much i love you dont you
how proud i am of you
monroe nods at moody
into walkie talkie take the shot
from across the room and through the ceiling a small red light snaps on
we zoom in to see what it is
yeah well i wanted to tell you that
just in case i forgot
is in the crosshairs
the red laser dot square in the middle of his back
give me a chris cormeir will you
the hostages attention has been so focused on the screen none of them have realized that for john to be on tv there has to be a camera inside the
suddenly it hits lester
what the hell
tight on the trigger
as the sniper squeezes get some rest buddy
i love you dad
i love you too
hangs up the receiver the sniper pulls the trigger
youre on the tv you know that
john turns as the bullet explodes from the chamber muzzle flashing
a bullet blows through j
s shoulder knocking him backwards against the wall
the echoing gunshot rumbles through the air like a thunderclap
monroe moody grimes and payne react as the hostages scatter
we got him
grimes pulls off his cans
your kids are lucky gus
their fathers coming home tonight
all tuned into the sheer pandemonium
hostages run for cover
the phone receiver swings back and forth and a bloody j
is slumped against the wall
lampley continues his live coverage as horrified crowds move around him
all we know at this point is that an attempt has been made on the gunmans life
has been shot
sits his shirt soaked in blood
among all the madness something funny happens
the sniper loses his balance and his leg crashes through the acoustic tile ceiling
he is momentarily stuck
the wound the hysteria the events of the day and now a leg sticking through the ceiling
its all very surreal
he gets up moves to the leg and pulls
and the ceiling comes crashing down
stunned monroe moody grimes and payne grimly watch j
subduing the sniper on the video tape monitors
their faces are in stark contrast with the chaos that surrounds them
hes not down
this is very bad gus
a uniformed policeman runs up with a cell phone and hands it to monroe
its the mayor sir
and you better kill that video feed
the medias pirated the signal and the whole thing just went out live over national tv
as monroe takes the phone and moody starts barking out orders the feed is disconnected and the monitors go blank
the beautiful womans body is loaded onto the medivac
the helicopter lifts off and disappears into the darkening sky
the daisy wheel keeps on turning
we see the words as theyre printed
and a new entry mike archibald age pounds
hes on the list
the sniper now sits restrained to a chair his hands and feet bound by adhesive tape
the other hostages are somber knowing that they are caught smack in the middle of this mess
sits stripped to the waist as maguire removes the bullet from his shoulder his wheel spinning spinning
mikeys not going to make it
but the list
theyre shooting at me
theyre not going to help my kid
its time to change plans
what about an el vad
whats an el vad
a left ventricular assist device
its basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity wired to the heart to keep it stimulated
all this time theres been a way to save his life and you never said anything
its not a solution
its only a band aid
mikes immune system may be too weak
will it give him time
its only a temporary measure
my kids down to hours and minutes doc
things dont get more temporary than that
the police are unceremoniously disconnecting channel s pirated signal hassling lampleys crew and telling them they are all going to be arrested
youre going to bust me
you just shot an innocent man on primetime tv
a roar from the crowd indicates something big is happening
is coming outside
hes got the sniper in tow using him as a human shield
the crowd behind the barricade is huge now holding up signs like have a heart save mike and john q
they scream encouragement with j
s every move
as he comes forward police and swat teams train their rifles on him
behind the barricade frank grimes stands with monroe and moody
lets go out there
see what he wants
but i thought you said i was out
i stepped in shit frank
is that what you want to hear goddammit
now quit breaking my stones
i need you to save my ass on this one
frank grimes smiles before grabbing a megaphone from one of the uniforms and stepping out from behind the barricade with monroe and moody
hold your fire
looks around at the hundreds of weapons all pointing right at him
theyre everywhere he turns
he sees grimes approaches
look what i found
the crowd cheers support for their new hero
who are these guys
who the hell are you
oh i know who you are the guys who tried to take me out
indicates his bleeding shoulder
this is sergeant moody and police chief monroe
what are we doing john
you were going to call me back
i gave you your hostages and you were supposed to call me back
but no you want me dead
i dont want you dead
no you want to kill me
you want to kill me so bad you can taste it
nobody wants to kill you
nobody wants to kill me
indicates the sniper who is this
the crowd voices their displeasure in a chorus of boos
that wasnt my call
i i i i bullshit
you tried to kill me
you tried to kill me while i was talking to my boy
the crowd erupts
theyre getting rowdy now
the cops are getting jumpy their rifles trained their trigger fingers ready
john listen to me
lieutenant grimes had nothing to do with that
it was my call
dont lie to me
i dont need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops
what are we friends all of a sudden
all of a sudden we owe you something
you pulled the gun
youre the one that took the hospital
what did you think would happen
you want truth heres some truth
this is going to end up bad for you
theres only two ways out of here
jail or dead
hears the words and they sink in
he knows theyre right
look around you
look at all of it
you dont want to do this
i just want my life back
its hard to be a man these days
hard to know what the right thing is
put the gun down john
its all over
you got everything you asked for
mike is on the list
i dont believe you
i give you my word
forgive me for being skeptical frank but your word is shit
the crowd goes crazy cheering and shouting out their encouragement
the faces are those of outrage and passion
some even with tears streaming down their faces
looks out the overwhelming display of support
hey what are you doing
stay with me john
you think these people give a shit about you
youre just the cause of the moment
believe me in a couple of days theyll be outraged about something else
nobody cares john
thats the real truth
its only you and me out here and all these guns pointed at you
so what do you want to do
its your call
i want my son
bring me my son
i want my son inside with me
cant do it
theres an operation that could save his life
im going to need some equipment but ive got two surgeons inside that are ready to go
you listen to me you sonofabitch
you give this up right now turn yourself in
and your son will have any and every means of assistance
if not if you keep this up this is going to be very bad for you
are you threatening me chief
take your best shot
oh i forgot you already did
no well do this my way
you give me my boy they do the surgery and then i give up
nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home
monroe studies j
what do you think frank
i say give it to him
hes not going to hurt his boy
monroe takes his time making his decision
sir the object is to get hostages out not to let more in
the boy is not a hostage
hes the mans son
mikes hospital bed flies down the hallway
running alongside we see denise payne and nurses holding medical equipment
mom where are we going
to see your father
the front doors burst open and mikes bed is rolled onto the sidewalk
cops run alongside like secret service agents protecting mike pushing a path through the crowd
move it back folks
the mob swarms around the speeding bed trying to get a look at mike who considers the circus atmosphere surrounding him
as the bed hits the police barricade the cops take over
let me through
im his mother
but she is held back as mike is ushered through
mikes bed is rolled slowly to a stop outside the er doors
the sniper is released and j
stands guard as mike is rolled in by turner and maguire before locking the door behind them
dad where have you been
just waiting for you buddy
mike looks up to see dr
turner walking alongside
he looks up at him and smiles
mike is wheeled into a trauma room where the monitors quickly come to life
looks at mike as the medical team assess his condition just watching helplessly as the life drains out of his body
how are you feeling slugger
the monitors whisper faintly irregularly turner steps in front of j
i need some time to examine mike and i dont need you getting in the way
its crowded enough in here
ill stay in the corner
im serious john
let me do my job
turner ushers him out the door and closes it behind him
john looks up to find the hostages staring at him
uncomfortable he moves into a recovery room
alone notices the simple wooden cross hanging over the door
he stares at it a long time before kneeling his arms resting on the bed
bless me father
for i have sinned
its been a long time so forgive me if im a little rusty
i know you do things your own way
but im finding it hard to understand why you would want mike to be so sick
turner administers the meds and mikes eyes glaze and roll back in his head
with all the drugs coursing through his system mike is really out of it now
but as dr
turner diligently attends to mike the boy considers him the bright o
lights casting a halo around the doctors head
are you god
caught off guard yeah kid
yeah i am
turner continues working and as he turns his back to the boy he hears the question that floors him
where you been
i keep waiting for you to step in and help him
but you never do
and i dont understand
i dont understand and i dont forgive
so help me father
because im trying
im really trying
turner appears at the doorway and sees john on his knees
looks up and dr
turner soberly shakes his head
the news isnt good
turner and john look through the glass at mike resting peacefully
mikes blood pressure has dropped into the mid forties
his atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens
its thirty five
if i put that lvad into him his heart will never be able to handle the extra strain
not buts john
without a new heart hes not going to make it
it takes a few moments to sink in
turner doesnt get it
you heard me
take my heart and put it in mike
john buddy youre talking a little nutsy cukoo here
you cant be serious
you think im just going to stand here and watch my son die
you bet im serious
oh my god
lester tries to comprehend the nihilistic existentialism of it all
but that means youll die man
calmly finishes lesters thought
and my sone will live
john you cant do this
its the only way
no you dont understand
you physically cant do it
i kill myself
you cut me open and take my heart
the boy crazy
nutsy cuckoo im telling you
we just cant remove your heart and put it into mikes body
theres too many unknowns
matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated
theres several critical tests that have to be taken
cross matches for blood type chest cavity measurements
if both blood tissues arent compatible theres a very high likelihood of rejection
come on doc
i know all about compatibility
weve been tested up the wazoo
mike and i are both b positive
our tissues are a match
and his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit
you know damn well were compatible
no we dont
youre an adult
mike is strong but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for mike
ill take that chance
its better than letting him die
out of the question
im telling you hell make it
cant do it john
youre telling me that if im laying dead on the floor you wouldnt take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life
youd let two people die instead of one because of a technicality
i think what johns trying to do is right
i think its very brave
yeah its all very noble and brave
but what do you think mike would want
or your wife
mike is too young to know whats good for him
im his father
its my job to protect him and denise would do the same thing if she was in my place
are you saying mikes life is more important than yours
or that its okay that mike grows up without a father
you can have more children john
what happened to mike is bad man
its the worst
it aint fair but you cant kill yourself
sometimes youve just got to let go and let god take care of it
youve got to accept it
that mikes going to die
i dont accept it
i reject it out of hand
john moves over to dr
turner to plea his case
i know you only think of mike as a patient but hes a great kid
hes like magic you know
he loves bodybuilding
you believe that
and hes funny
youd like him doc
youd really like him if you knew him
i do like him
youve got to help him
im begging you
if you ever do anything outside the rules do this
take a chance please
id like to
i really would
but what youre asking crosses the line
its completely unethical
ive crossed the line
no youve crossed the line
the whole system has crossed the line
paces around the room his hand on his weapon his mood very dark and threatening
i dont think you understand
im not letting him die
havent you figured that out by now
i dont care what i have to do
so what youre going to kill me if i dont operate
im going to kill myself
puts the gun to his temple
and well just see what happens
aw man this is messed up
we all know how this works people
in order for mike to live someone has to die
im the father
it might as well be me
and turners eyes meet
turner doesnt speak for a long moment
ill do it
if thats what you want
wait a minute
are you serious
the room goes quiet
once hes dead
klein moves to dr
youre the finest surgeon ive ever known
you cant just throw your entire career for this man
yeah youre not god
its not up to you to decide who lives and dies
aw come on mitch
were all going to die
not for nothing doctor
but if you do this youre finished
so what are they going to do
evict me from the country club
raymond youre under a lot of stress
youre not yourself
yeah well what is myself
because right now i really dont know
lets see he takes his patek phillipe watch off and throws it at the wall smashing it
i run six miles a day drive around in my little black porsche and date girls thirty years younger than me
is the picture clear now
i like twelve hundred dollar shoes and ive always got a great tan
and heres the best part
everybody kisses my ass and acts as if thats the way doctors are supposed to be thats the reward
reward for what
what i am is a plumber
i connect valves to tubes and tubes to valves
thats what i do
but back in that room with your son i got a very short glimpse of my soul
and let me tell you its been long lost
this is still a hospital
theres a sick kid in there and im his doctor
and if theres a heart available ill be damned if im going to let it go to waste
the room is stunned
a medivac chopper swoops down lands on the big white cross on the helipad tarmac
the doors fly open
a medical team quickly disembarks lifts out a stretcher with a beautiful womans body and runs across the roof into the hospital
the stretcher is rushed into the o
and the body is placed on the surgical table
a medical transplant team is waiting ready
they take the body prep for organ harvesting
in another room an unos official is notified of the beautiful womans arrival
he gets up and is on the move securing his wireless headset and dialing
the unos official moves into the or
everything the transplant people tell him he repeats into the phone
thirty three years old
five foot seven
liver kidneys usable
heart is good
the transplant team are busy
checks bracelet b positive
the tvs are now off
looks out the window at the evergrowing police build up
theres an upbeat bound in his step a sense of relief with the finality of the decision hes made
come on guys
lets hurry it up
they could bust in here any minute
this was your plan all along wasnt it
you think i wanted it to turn out like this
pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolds it
this is my will
im leaving my heart to my son
he holds up a pen
i need two witnesses
dont everybody jump at once
i aint signing your death warrant
come on people
the sooner we get this done the sooner we all go home
you know something man
only one thing can stop me now
mitch here being b positive
e swear to god
for a moment the mood is light
looks around the room at maguire debby mitch julie lester and the security guard
debby cant stop crying again
do yourself a favor
start doing the right thing huh
lifes too short
you had a good woman there
youre too smart to be so dumb
looks around the room before he leaves
see you in the funny papers
the daisy wheel buzzes pounding letters onto the print page
mike archibald hope memorial hospital age pounds
blood type b positive
a man sitting alone in front of the computer
he rips the copy from the printer lays it into the fax machine and dials
a piercing beep
the paper gets sucked away
a fax machine chirps in the quiet picu
reggie picks up the fax and as he reads a look of disbelief
oh my sweet jesus
paper in hand he sprints out of the ward and down the corridor
john enters to find dr
klein checking mikes vitals
the heart monitor reads
can i have a word with him
klein exits and j
moves to mike and gently wakes him up
you find me a heart
we got you one
look like youve got a guardian angel
mike smiles and tries to go back to sleep
try to stay awake for a minute will you
i just need to tell you a few things
i want you always to listen to your mother
because shes your best friend and family is important
hes all over the place searching for the right words
youre too young for them now but when the time comes treat them like princesses because thats what they are
and if you say youll do something do it because your world should be your bond
and if you have a chance to make money go for it even if it means selling out once in a while
dont be a knucklehead like your father
everythings so much easier with money
hes stumbling trying to cram a lifetime of advice into five minutes
and try to be kind
but if someone chooses you be a man and stand up for yourself
and dont get caught up in the bad things theres too many great things out there
just sits there the tears running down his face not knowing what to say
mikes eyes open
see you later buddy
mike closes his eyes before opening and closing his little hand
reggie races through the hospital weaving in and out of ambulatory and pedestrian traffic
in his hand the all important fax
maguire klein and turner speak in hushed tones as j
when they see him they immediately go quiet
s eyes are glassy a look of finality on his face
lets do it
maguire gathers fresh clean towels and makes a pack for the back of j
sits on the exam table takes the baretta and pops the clip
he then takes a single bullet from his pocket feeds the clip and chambers the round
wait a minute
this gun was empty the whole time
aw im all talk
i would never hurt any of you
only person i ever considered killing was me
reggie flies out the main entrance and into the crowd pushing through the sea of humanity until he reaches payne grimes and monroe
youre not going to believe this
weve got a match
are you sure
payne studies the fax
michael william archibald
the only status one in the whole country
the heart is ours
the heart is on the way
well ill be damned
you really put the kid on the list
i may be a lot of things lieutenant but i am not a liar
readies himself before laying back on the roll of towels
i changed my mind
i wont do this
regards turner with positive affection
youre a good man doc
i know youll do the right thing
lifts the gun to his head
reggie grimes payne and monroe run over to denise
i have some very very good news
the moment has come
everyones face wears the intensity of it
john holds the gun up his hand trembling
denise reads the fax
is this for real
the lear jet just landed at ohare
the helicopter will be here in fifteen minutes
grimes offers his walkie talkie to denise
you want to do the honors
into walkie talkie john
its me baby
are you there
hears denises voice squawking over the walkie talkie
he shuts it off
takes a deep breath
flips the safety off and puts the gun to his head for the final time
denise keeps triggering the walkie talkie
desperate she grabs the list and starts running towards the er entrance
close on j
s gun moves closer to the temple til it touches
denise breaks through the police barricade
closer on trigger as johns finger pulls it tighter
the sound is revealed
not a bullet
its denise slapping the list up against the glass windows of the er
its a miracle
they found a heart
its a miracle
the crowd points and stares as a white medivac helicopter descends from the sky lights flashing and lands on the roof
tuck lampley hand over his ear shouting above the noise to bring us more exclusive coverage
the heart is here
the heart for little mike archibald has arrived
what an unbelievable ending to this incredible tumultuous day
a roar from the crowd is heard as the entrance to the er is unlocked and the front door opens
mitch and debby are the first to emerge
oh my goodness here we go
the first of the hostages are being released
yes theyre coming out
theres one two
they appear to be unharmed
but certainly exhausted from what mustve been an excruciating ordeal
julie and the security guard are next
and are quickly ushered away to support vehicles
and there he is
is coming out
in baseball hat and windbreaker emerges from the hospital
the suspects hands are up
he appears to be surrendering
the police are all around him now
pointing their weapons and shouting commands
puts his hands behind his head turns around kneels and then lays face down on the pavement
and theyve got him
the police have subdued him
the handcuffs are on and its over
its all over
the crowd voices their disapproval with the rough way j
is being apprehended
they cheer their support as he is escorted to a police car
if pictures speak a thousand words well id say these images speak volumes
and now as the bloody stand off comes to an end we remind you that channel was here first and has brought you live moment to moment all day coverage
of crisis at hope memorial
frank grimes takes in the whole scene
but as he glances at the suspect a funny look comes across his face
wait a sec mikes gurney flies through the hospital corridors
running alongside are turner klein maguire and denise
as well as teams of medical personnel and a man in green surgical scrubs
as they pass a police checkpoint we notice the identity of the man in the green scrubs
is pushed into the car grimes sees his real identity
its lester dressed in j
s windbreaker collar up baseball cap pulled way down over his eyes
grimes shakes his head
top notch policework
incredulous he turns and takes the long walk to the hospital
turner and the team work with quiet precision as mike lays on the operating table his chest wide open
behind the partition glass j
and denise hold on to each other for support as they look on
a figure in a rumpled suit settles in next to them and watches
its time john
turns knows its over
can you give me a second frank
i just need to see this thing through
put these on for me will you
grimes hands j
a pair of handcuffs
john puts them on and the three watch the surgery
the replacement heart is taken out of its container and placed into mikes chest
but then something suddenly is wrong
mikes vital signs start giving out
the gauges dropping at once
blood pressure seventy over thirty two
acute respiratory distress
i dont have a pulse
john and denise look on helpless
turner barks out commands as the team scrambles to remedy the critical situation
come on goddammit
im not losing this boy
nut now the long familiar tone of the ekg is heard
various news related programming
crossfire face the nation cnbc court tv and larry king live
clips dissolve one into the other
cannot let this man free
it sends the wrong message
although hes paid a heavy price he took matters into his own hands
maybe its the wake up call this country needs
socialized medicine in england has worked
sure to a point
except when its their life on the line the dutch the english and everyone else go to their private doctors or come to america because we have the best technology
that is if they can afford it
i think the decision we see today will tell us a lot about this country
the long awaited verdict is expected today in the trial of john quincy archibald where the jury has been deliberating
a gavel pounding down
the black robed judge silences the crowd
the courtroom is standing room only
packed with cops tv cameras reporters etc
we see denise next to a grim faced jimmy and gina palumbo
as the jury flies into the jury box the people take their seats
the bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the foreman
has the jury reached a verdict
the foreman stands faces the judge
we have your honor
the defendant will please rise
archibald gets up and faces the judge
his attorney a p
by his side
standing next to denise we reveal mike he looks healthy and rosy cheeked
he grabs his mothers hand with anticipation
the jury foreman will now read the verdict
as to count one assault with a deadly weapon we find the defendant john quincy archibald not guilty
the courtroom explodes in cheers
in the crowd we see familiar faces debby dr
turner and dr
behind them maguire
on count two armed criminal action
the crowd again roars its approval
steve and miriam watch from the gallery holding a baby girl
even rebecca payne cracks a smile
on the final count false imprisonment we find the defendant guilty
the crowd erupts in protest
the media rush out to file their stories
sentencing will be one week from today
stares straight ahead and takes a breath
after a moment the public defender leads him over to the rail where he is greeted by jimmy gina denise and mike
hes going to do some time
but theres not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year
and with time served john will be home very soon
leans over to talk to his son
mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears
its okay slugger

if you need anything ask your mother
and jimmy and gina will be around
if anybody messes with us ill take care of it
embraces his boy and moves over to denise

i guess i can live with that
a hand taps him on the shoulder
time to go john
im proud of you
smiles and grimes starts to lead him away
give em hell johnny
dont worry about nothing
see you later
an enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps
they cheer their support as j
grimes steers j
out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in j
they ask ridiculous questions about justice health care and politics
uncomfortable with all the attention has no comment
he pushes past politely head down his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice
good luck man
recognizes the voice turns and sees lester
both smile to each other as j
is pushed further through when john q
do you feel like your country has let you down
its a wonderful country
i couldnt hear you
could you repeat that
grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera
he said america is the greatest goddamn country in the world
now excuse us i have to take this man to jail
they push past the barricades and into the street
look at all this
youre a celebrity john
check with me in a couple of days
they move to the street and grimes opens the car door
he looks up to see the crowd in all its glory cameras flashing microphones pointed at j
this is ridiculous
i dont even know these people
what can i tell you
youre their hero
im not hero frank
im just a regular guy
grimes slams the door
the cherry light spins the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people
on the street j
sees mike wave to him from the sidewalk trying to get johns attention
mike is saying something
turns to look closer and finally he gets it ext
street continuous mikes lips say thank you
john winks at his boy
street continuous mike makes a muscle
john smiles and the car picks up speed
the cop car pulls away
away from the courtroom
