b if window
href b b the ghost and the darkness by william goldman by william goldman a tiny figure of a man hurrying toward camera
the figure gets larger as he approaches
but as yet we cannot tell who he is or where we are
male voice over this is the most famous true story of africa
it happened a hundred years ago but even now when children ask about it you do not tell them at night
the figure continues to grow it began with the race to build a railroad across africa
beat but this is not about building a railroad it is about patterson
and now we can tell that the figure is a young man a lieutenant colonel
this is patterson
he is gifted and bright and serious serious about his life serious about his career
he has been successful in everything hes attempted in part because of his talents in part because he is willing to outwork anybody
more specifically in a high ceilinged corridor of an elegant building lovely woodwork all around
everything is neat everything is clean and in order
male voice over patterson was thirty
a brilliant engineer
a fine man but do not become attached to him there are many fine men in this story but do not become attached to any of them
beat so many of them die
patterson stops at a large ornate door knocks
male voice over and remember this only the impossible parts of what follows really happened
now the door opens and we just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway
this is robert beaumont with an irresistable smile
were in his office and the place reflects the man clean cold
there are maps and charts on the walls
he ushers patterson inside
the great smile flashes john henry patterson come in
im robert beaumont
they shake hands firm i like that tells me a lot about you beat now why dont you tell me about me
to get you started many people find me handsome with a wonderful smile
im sure you agree
surprised uncomfortable patterson nods winning personality heaps of charm
my wife is the game player in the family sir
staring dead at patterson look at me closely patterson i am a monster
my only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me such as yourself
again the smile only now its chilling one mistake and i promise you this ill make you hate me
patterson as he realizes beaumont is serious
beaumont turns sharply and moves to a large map
it covers a great deal of east africa with a very clear line that ends at lake victoria a distance of some miles
pointing along the line we are building this railroad across africa for the glorious purpose of saving africa from the africans
and of course to end slavery
the germans and french are our competition
we are ahead and we will stay ahead providing you do what i hired you to do a more detailed map
this one ends at tsavo miles in
build the bridge over the tsavo river
and be finished in four months time
can you do that
im sure youve examined my record
so you know ive never yet been late on a bridge
youve never built in africa
but i have in india every country presents problems
youll need your confidence i promise you
ive got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised id be with her when the baby comes
very moving patterson im touched you confided in me
beat but i dont really give a shit about your upcoming litter
ive made you with this assignment the smile dont make me break you
smiling right back you wont have the chance
glancing at his watch any further words of encouragement
silence then ive a train to catch
they look at each other a moment in silence and its very clear they do not like each other
patterson turns leaves and we a train is loading up
a lot of activity a lot of noise
patterson stands in the midst of it anxiously looking around
helena patterson hurrying through the crowd
early s with the kind of serene beauty of jean simmons
she is still slim has not begun to show
she spots him puts a smile on goes straight into his arms
i tried to be late john it would have been easier if youd gone
they are nutty about each other he nods were not much good at goodbyes helena
brightly tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
it was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments
they start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a quieter place
patterson is suddenly very serious oh dear beat youre geting that downtrodden look again well its just
beat other men dont abandon their wives at such a time not unkindly oh please if id been against your taking this you would have abandoned me
youve been desperate to see africa your whole life
what if there are complications
not what if there will be there always are
which only means that our son and i note my confidence will have an excuse to come visit
the train whistle sounds
he kisses her hand such a gentleman
now he holds her i am desperate to see africa but i hate the leaving
she hates it too
you build bridges john beat youve got to go where the rivers are
they hold each other a moment more then break then back into each others arms a final time then the train and thick clouds of steam patterson runs into the
clouds and disappears
patterson runs out of the steam and we this is the train to tsavo and patterson is alone on the engine seat a wooden bench in front of the engine
used by railroad inspectors and visiting vips
behind it is a white circular piece of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers
nigel starling running as best as he can alongside the train trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat
starling is a terribly appealing young man
clothes do not fit him well and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that shirttail trying to get things right
he wears glasses tends nonetheless to squint at the world
he is above all a good man morally impeccable and very much a product of these victorian times
as patterson helps him aboard many thanks
squints youre patterson yes
patterson nods nigel starling ill be assisting you at tsavo but surely beaumont must have told you that
he just gave me his monster speech
i know robert seems dreadful but when you truly get to know the man well hes much worse
beat and im one of his defenders
patterson smiles forget him for now its your first ride to tsavo i think youll find it breathtaking
and on that word starling coughing like crazy hands over his face which is caked with dust he and patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary desert
shouting toward starling breathtaking doesnt begin to do it justice
as starling starts to laugh his mouth opens and sand flies in and his coughing fit returns and the two of them bent over arms covering their faces as the
dust gets worse a wind has kicked up
patterson and starling are walking beside the train now helping to push it trudging through the dust
all the other passengers spread out behind them also pushing the train obviously needs all the assistance it can get
patterson and starling filthy sit together
starling has nodded off
patterson has a book open in his lap we can tell there are drawings of african animals not all that accurate
now pattersons eyes close and he sleeps
stokers shovel coal
they are exhausted but they keep at it
he stares out and from his face its clear something special has happened
and now at last something special and what it is of course is pattersons first view of the africa of his imagination
because the desert has ended and now there are grasses and trees and one more thing bursts of animals
on both sides of the train
a flock of birds materializes here a cluster of gazelles doing there amazing leap there
patterson is like a kid in a candy store
patterson and starling back outside in the engine seat again
starling points arent they amazing
what hes pointing at some giraffes running along their absurd shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly long strides
patterson and starling staring out
you know the most amazing thing about them
they only sleep five minutes a day
starling glances at him clearly he didnt know that a family of hyenas
close by loping in their scary way
dont much like them
nods the females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they wouldnt survive because the males eat the young
starling studying patterson
clearly he didnt know that either
some hippos moving along
starling turns to patterson
anything special about them
just that they fart through their mouths
beat must make kissing something of a gamble
laughs ive lived in africa a year and i dont know what you know
how long have you been here
looks at his watch almost three hours
beat but ive been getting ready all my life
now from them a bunch of impoverished looking native women
they hold children who wave at the passing train
the children are more impoverished looking than their mothers
suddenly touched every time i see something like that i know were right to be here to bring christianity into their lives enrich their souls
beaumont says its to end slavery
shrugs we all have our reasons
mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes interrupts himself best i stop
one of the by products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring
but i know god smiles on me
they really like each other have you got that in writing
starling amazingly good natured laughs
and now hundreds of white claws
they arent claws at all theyre thorns as sharp as claws and theyre on a twenty foot high thorn tree
and there are dozens of those trees packed together
all mixed in with other trees low and stunted and thick underbrush and baked red rocks now the train begins to slow
smoke drifts across
a bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks
starling over welcome to tsavo
on the word we have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a place that is still being built
there are tin shacks a water tower is under construction men are working everywhere for thats what tsavo is a place for work
the train goes slower still
no one stands idly around here
but no one looks happy either
one man is apart from the rest this is samuel
an ageless masai tall and slender he has a smile that can light the world
patterson and starling as they step off the train
indicating samuel who is approaching samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts
softly does he speak english
not softly enough and very poor french
introducing samuel john patterson
as they shake the bridgebuilder gesturing to the working men we have been getting ready for you
could i see the bridge site
samuel nods ive got medical supplies to deliver
come along to the hospital when youre done
starting off i will bring him nigel
we should realize by now that samuels was the voice we heard at the very beginning of the picture
patterson and samuel starting to walk
they pass the water tower
standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely powerful indian
he waves to samuel who waves back
this is singh
workers study patterson as he moves by
up ahead some sikhs are erecting tents
why do the workers look unhappy
because they are here
beat because tsavo is the worst place in the world
he points ahead come john to the bridge
and on that the railroad tracks as the camera pans along
the river in the distance as they walk toward it
and here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like
there were five hundred men working for patterson
and they lived in a spread out area
a bunch of indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents
a group of natives might be in another cluster
what we have then as far as living places are concerned are dozens of clusters of tents
eventually as the terror began these areas all got surrounded each with its own thorn fence
the places well come to know best are among others pattersons living area the hospital tent area the area by the river where the bridge is to be built etc
as they move samuel points out various camps
a sect of indians is getting ready for prayer
another sect of indians is eating
a group of africans are cleaning their tent area
anyway you get the idea
just remember that the place covered a wide expanse maybe a mile square maybe more
okay back to the story
as they pass the indian tent area where prayer is starting its all wonderfully under control samuel youve done a splendid job
the truth is this you have to work at it constantly
the workers dont get on
they detest each other
obviously the africans hate the indians
but the indians also hate the other indians
some of them worship cows while others eat them
as they move on and suddenly the track just stops in mid air as we patterson and samuel standing high above the tsavo river
the track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank where it just stops and picks up on the far side
all thats missing in other words is the hundred yard long bridge that will connect the pieces of track
to the far side railhead is across there
nothing can be made out clearly but there are great clouds of dust
three thousand men laying track when the bridge is done it all joins up
patterson nods says nothing but goes to his haunches staring at the space where the bridge is to be
did it look like this in your mind
shakes his head this is more difficult patterson
eyes bright but how wonderful that its difficult it should be difficult what better job in all the world than build a bridge
make things connect bring worlds together and get it right
now from patterson as patterson and samuel walk in
patterson glances around its not bad at all
of course there are some patients injured or with fever
but like the rest of the camp weve just seen everything is working well everything is under control
finish your tour
nods and anxious to get started
indicating the hospital what is this mostly malaria
yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except god into their hearts he will vanquish all pain
mans voice over thats just vomitous talk nigel the poor bastards will relapse if you keep on that way
as they turn doctor david hawthorne
a tough middle aged cockney
and a heavy drinker
a man who hasnt been tactful in twenty years
to patterson im david hawthorne this is my hospital
and my advice to you is dont get sick in front of it
beat that was meant to be charming sorry
i seem to have lost the knack
you never had it
nigel and i dont like each other much
breaking the tension i am also liaison between these two
to hawthorne clearly you dont agree about building the railroad
who needs it
its only being built to control the ivory trade make men richer
then why do you stay
who else would hire me
to starling beat you to it didnt i
beat oh yes almost forgot brought you a little welcoming gift
now he gestures and we a nervous orderly who approaches them
he has been freshly bandaged across one shoulder
this is karim one of my orderlies attacked by a man eater earlier today first incident of that kind here
patterson says not a word just studies the wounded man
incredulous a man eater attacks and youre such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it
well he got away didnt he
to patterson riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off
no emotion on his face
hes kind of enjoying this
i know its your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey beat but what are you going to do about it
a long pause then evenly karim will have to show me where it happened
and of course ill need the donkey
beat with any luck ill sort it out tonight
and he walks out leaving an astonished starling staring after him starling has a tent there too as do samuel and hawthorne
and there are half a dozen orderlies
right now patterson is unpacking moving in and out of his tent
starling sipping tea sits and watches
i couldnt believe it when you said sort it out
as if it were the most normal thing in the world
ho hum what lovely tea i think ill bag a killer beast this evening nothing much else going on anyway
well he put me in a spot didnt he
but thats all right after all im responsible for everything that happens here
and it certainly wont do much for morale if a man eaters on the prowl
he goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him
there is a photo of helena on a small table
a photo of an elderly couple clearly his parents
his clothes are stacked with precision
he arranges his books precisely too
clearly john patterson is a man who believes in order
calling out you said of course youd need the donkey
why of course
taking a rifle moving outside we know three things about man eaters
first they always return to where theyve attacked before
second theyre always old they cant catch other animals so they turn to us
and third theyre always alone theyve been cast out by their pride because they cant keep up
starling sipping his tea and theres no hiding it hes excited
but also a bit reluctant
i dont suppose i could watch
delighted might be exciting for you
ive never been all that adventurous
i wouldnt be in the way
id love the company
and ive hunted all my life
gathering courage well why not
you seem so calm and experienced
standing teacup in hand why not indeed
now from that its roped loosely to a tree bells around its neck
when it moves they make a sound
middle of the night
a night wind
were in a clearing with thick trees all around
patterson and starling seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge of the clearing twelve feet up in the air
patterson has his rifle ready
this next is all whispered
embarrassed i hate to be a bother john but the cramps getting worse
pulls up his trousers his leg is knotted the pain is actually quite unbearable now
im sure you mean that to be comforting but interrupting youll have to deal with it nigel
that is precisely my plan but back in my tent
and he begins to climb down patterson grabbing him
they own the night nobody moves when theres a man eater out there
starling glumly obeys
i know this isnt the time to ask but what
since youd only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions
not to terrify you nigel but its worse than you think ive never even seen one
starling not pleased with this news
he massages his calf tries to get comfortable which is impossible
patterson just stares at the night
the donkey dozes
so does starling
patterson has not so much as moved
now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little
and the donkey is suddenly awake and scared and then it all goes crazy the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and patterson fires one shot and
the sound and starling topples from the tree to the ground landing shocked but unhurt he has landed close to the dead lion he stares at it
amazed one shot
even more amazed so thats what a lion looks like
now from the tree hold for a moment
samuel over one shot one now samuel comes walking into the shot really excited its the first time weve seen his wonderful smile
patterson has made the nights safe again
as he walks on behind him come three coolies carrying the body of the lion
as dozens of men come running in from all over to see the dead man eater mimes shooting now as the crowd continues to grow it has two embankments on
either side of the river
these embankments are big forty feet wide fifty feet high
patterson and starling standing on the high ground where the embankment will start
from here there is a slope down to the river itself
also present is ungan signh who we saw earlier standing precariously atop the water tower
singh enormously powerful is another assistant
bright a great worker another main character in what is to follow
now patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river its not that easy to do without falling but that doesnt bother him
he talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who move down with him
singh for all his massive size moves like a cat
starling does not slipping and sliding
gesturing all right id like to start the embankments today to singh sufficient supplies on hand
nods more than
with much more on the way loses balance falls john we could have had this chat on flatter ground true enough but without the comedy relief
starling amazingly good natured smiles gets back up the river as they scramble down to it
the slope theyve come down its a long way back to the top
the three men
its a glorious morning
how lucky we are
arent we full of ourselves today
beat i think its because of the lion
soft you know i too have killed a lion
how many shots did you need
i used my hands
he holds his big hands up palms out
starling looks at singh to see if he means it he means it all right
now from starlings perpetually surprised face patterson sighting through it we are on the far side of the river now
singh is there starling too
behind them a field of tall grass
all right thee second embankment will go there
he gestures toward the river you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just imitating patterson there
smiling in your honor nigel
and you and singh will be in charge of building them and youll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and youll be finished in eight thrilling weeks
very dubious john it will not be easy
nigel youll just have to use your hands and he smiles repeating singhs gesture both palms out singh
he smiles back starts to reply
but his words stop his smile dies
he just stares and we what hes staring at the surrounding field of tall grass
nothing unusual about it
he stares too
the field of tall grass suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a fresh wind
starling follows his glance
and now the field is making odd patterns as if something unseen were moving through
just the wind
but the odd pattern seems to be making its way across the field
singh and starling
just the wind
the odd pattern seems to stop
around it the wind makes different shapes of the grass
patterson as the wind continues to blow
he continues to stare at the spot where the pattern stopped
except for one thing suddenly he begins to shiver as if from cold
and what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity
huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground the framework for the embankments
and singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers and as the structure rises he is the one darting along the top high in the air pulling more logs
up helping here helping there
and alongside him is his assistant abdullah a little man with glasses and very bright eyes
meanwhile starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river
and he does his best tries to help on the top part as it rises but alas he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem
but he stays with it does well
and patterson in tremendous spirits helps when needed but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars he
wades into the water climbs the structures takes it all in and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story but its clumsy for labor so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes which is all he wears from now on
and the workers tire in the heat but singh keeps them going working with the power of three and there are accidents and explosions injuries and falls and hawthorne appears
when needed to help with the wounded its hard brutal work but gradually the wooden structure part is finished two huge skeletons facing each other across the tsavo river and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river the three foundation pillars are taking shape tons of red rock being shoved into the wooden skeleton to complete the embankments
as this goes on patterson and samuel in the river the foundation pillar work is going very quickly
patterson stops working looks across the river movement in the grassy area on the far side
several nandi tribesmen as they rise out of the grass gesture to samuel who gestures back
the nandi are a tribe of powerful little men primitive with teeth that have been sharpened to points
patterson and samuel watching them
what are they looking at
you they cannot believe youre still here
you dont know what tsavo means do you
patterson doesnt it means slaughter
the nandi tribesmen staring at patterson shaking their heads
the two embankments as more and more red rock is shoved and pushed into shape
the three foundation pillars almost finished
the near embankment as still more rock is forced in and the far embankment done at last and singh stands on the top of the near one while across the
river patterson pulls starling to the top of the other
and they all look at each other the embankments are both finished the three of them are flying and what they do is this hold their hands out toward each
other in singhs gesture
its kind of become their password
a big moment for them all
he sits around a fire and the man is exhausted
his dinner plate is beside him untouched
hes too tired to eat
starling is there getting ready for bed
hes wiped out too
singh going into his tent lying down breathing deep
starling is in his tent turning out his lamp half asleep already
patterson in his tent closing his eyes
singh deep asleep in his tent he shares it with a dozen others and theyre all deep asleep
they lie on the floor of the tent heads together toward the center pole feet toward the edges of the tent
hold on singh
its very dark
he and his men just lie motionless breathing deeply
now the camera moves up high into the center of the tent looking down at the circle of men
they dont move not even an inch
the steady breathing is the only sound
nothing is going on down there
nothing at all
not a goddamn thing
and now two things happen at the same time singhs eyes go wide and he starts to slide out of the tent as if being pulled by some giant invisible
the other men in the tent waking staring around and singh as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams grow even louder as we the
other men in the tent and its like a bomb just went off they rise spin cry out stare the night outside and singhs body sliding along the ground
its pitch black and hes going head first now face upwards and hes going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is thats making this happen is something we
cant make out because its so dark and because its on the far side of the man and his body is in our way and up ahead some bushes and singh his body going faster than before and his cries are weakening the night and his body and there is no sound at all coming from him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making this happen all we see barely is the limp body of the big man as it skims along and up ahead now a low clump of bushes
singhs body coming closer and the bushes and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn bushes and now singh suddenly rising magically in the night
his body flying over the bushes and gone
patterson and starling early morning their rifles held in front of them racing along suddenly stopping staring down and the ground
at first we cant make out much
then we can a spot of red
patterson and starling hurrying on again
thorn trees and as they force their way through them a large vulture wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth as it lands we can see a dozen
other vultures are already there surrounding something but we cant make it out
we are in an area of grass and shadow and specks of blood
patterson cries out in shock and fury fires his rifle races forward
the vultures screeching and screaming taking off and as we watch them soar into the morning sky hawthornes voice over what the lion must have done once hed killed singh
was lick his skin off so he could drink his blood hawthorne is examining singhs body trying to be professional but hes clearly upset its awful
then he feasted on him starting with his feet evenb more upset please you neednt be so graphic you intend sorting this out tonight
ill try but this feels so different that old lion i killed could never carry off a man singhs size
maybe a little alarmed but you said they were always old
thats what the books say
now from that abdullah in tears
where are we
this is singhs funeral pyre
singhs body is being burned
a lot of indians are there
weve caught sight of some of them before they worked with singh on the embankment or lived with him in his tent
there is a terrible sense of shock
patterson stands at the rear
he is terribly moved
now unseen by the others he holds his hands out in singhs gesture one final time
the flames they continue to rise
the flaps that were open when singh was alive are now shut and tied
patterson the middle of the night
he is alone fifteen feet up in a tree near singhs tent
he holds his rifle ready for anything
he cannot get comfortable
the area nothing no movement
no sign of movement of any kind
lower in the sky
the night is growing to a lose but there is still darkness
battling fatigue but now for a moment losing his eyes against his will start to close and as they do two huge yellow eyes
thats all we see just the eyes and they are near pattersons tree and they are staring up at him and patterson startled grabbing his rifle more tightly staring down
and the huge yellow eyes only theyre gone
patterson blowing on his hands looking toward the sky
patterson wrinkled and weary frustrated and sore walking back toward his tent area
now he stops
abdullah and a large group of workers only theyre not working
they smoke play cards sit around
patterson steaming going up to abdullah
you were contracted to work gesturing around malaria epidemic very sudden
let me see the sick
not backing off oh youre a doctor now too
there is no reason for fear
on that i choose to remain dubious
beat two are dead now in two nights
and on that news patterson
he didnt know
behind him now starling hurries up samuel alongside
to starling second death
gesturing far end of camp man wandering alone at night
hawthornes examining the body now
beat theres even less of him than of singh
just shakes his head but its crazy the lion shouldnt be that hungry this soon
getting control he looks to samuel samuel
we should construct thorn fences around every tent area
fires burning at night
and a strict curfew no one allowed out at night
to abdullah send half your men to the bridge the rest with these two
abdullah nods and im sorry for my tone earlier
but i repeat there is no reason for fear
i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge
of course you will you are white you can do anything
they look at each other
they are not friends
now endless numbers of them
there is a machete like sound as we a bunch of workmen led by samuel chopping down branches
they do it with care these are claws starling in charge of another area and hes not hanging back hes taking less care than the others hacking away with his
machete moving in between bushes and one of the bushes snapping back into starling and starling taking the blow with his arms the claws cut his clothing his arms are starting to bleed he is unmindful continues to wade into the bushes chopping at them cutting them down
he is a good man doing a good thing and right now he is possessed
patterson leaving his tent area lost in thought going toward the bridge
up ahead is a grassy area
for a moment nothing
then there is the same kind of movement we saw with singh
something is making the grass move only now there is no wind
did he see it
well never know
starling in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished
his clothes are shredded
a worker has finished with a section and satisfied moves on but starling is far from finished
he grabs the thorns with his bare hands and squeezes them together
not good enough look its got to be tighter
we see more fences around more camp areas
the entire place is filled with fences now all the individual areas protected
the skies are starting to darken dusk is coming fast
fires start up
dozens of them
now workers come racing home to their camps anxious for safety before darkness takes over
they zig zag this way that way dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other fall get up run on the sun
falling out of the sky
the fires rise higher
no one moves
starling in the main tent area
he is bathing his bloody hands
samuel is with him
both are exhausted
patterson brings them each drinks
they nod thanks drain them
they stand there together lit by the flames of their fire
you get the sense these three will be friends forever
what a good week
you mean nobody died
shakes his head we all worked together
worthy deeds were accomplished
i liked the labor
beat my mother insisted on piano lessons broke the dear womans heart when i turned out to be tone deaf but she still was always at me about being careful
with my hands
looks at them i like the blood is that strange
oh yes i think so
starling smiles starts to speak look out samuel here it comes
even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing what man can accomplish
when there is a common splendid goal there are no limits
think what we will accomplish when we all have gods warmth in our hearts
samuels eyes have closed he begins to snore
patterson cant help laughing starling
as good natured as ever
i am immune to your disdain
he looks at them now when i came here i had but one small goal to convert the entire continent of africa
shakes his head now ive decided to move on to something really difficult i will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold
ive had four wives good luck
the struggle is the glory
hold on the three friends patterson the next morning working with abdullah and some others at the bridge
starling completing work on the fence from the day before
its high and taut and hes done a terrific job
a bunch of other men are working near a large grassy field
one of the men starts a chant
the others pick it up
its really pretty
patterson wading into the river he stops as the sound of the chant comes distantly to him on the wind
the workmen chanting louder
its turning into a stunner of a day glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds
pauses briefly listening to the sound of the men
the men working and singing
the grassy field
as before except it isnt
because if you looked carefully something flicked in a degree arc
no telling what it was it was gone too quickly
patterson waist deep in the river listening to the sound of the men of the birds
the sun is higher in the sky
and here it comes again only the other way this time flicking back in another degree arc still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was
this a tail
now quickly patterson wading out of the river as samuel comes into view
he holds an envelope
taking it thank you samuel
watching as patterson opens it good news
glancing at the letter i expect so its from my wife
do you love her
i do actually very much
his wonderful smile you give me hope john
as he walks away starling probing at the thorn fence searching out any last weaknesses
behind him now in the tall grass something moves
starling intent on his work notices nothing
the singing men getting more and more into it
patterson by the river reading the letter
there is a large tree up the riverbank
it casts a large shadow
in the shadow now something moves
patterson intent on his reading notices nothing
helena over darling one the big excitement yesterday was when some school children spotted a whale pause they were looking at me john helena in their bedroom moving across to
the window staring out
she now has a considerable stomach
that was an attempt at humor but i dont feel very funny these days
i miss you terribly and after our son i still have total confidence well after hes born i think travel might be broadening
as he kicks me at night im quite sure hes telling me he definitely wants to come to africa
pause thought you might need reminding
patterson by the river
he smiles folds the letter
now the singing workmen at tsavo station and they sense how good they sound and they really concentrate on it on making that sound even better there must be twenty
of them working and singing and screaming
patterson turning his head sharply and starling doing the same and the screaming workmen and theyre running now running and shrieking and thats all we see the workmen some of
them run left some run right and now a few of them are starting to cry
a fat coolie running and running glancing back screaming louder running on and on and a shadow in the grass no telling what but its big and its moving and
the fat coolie and this next goes so fast it could be a dream or more accurately a nightmare a gigantic white maned lion as it leaps onto the fat coolie brings him to earth bites his neck in two kills him just like that
patterson and samuel as they race away from the river and starling running from the fenced area he holds a rifle in his hands
anoter part of the camp and a different bunch of workmen they freeze as the screams reach them and patterson on the way to his tent area and different workmen
listening in fear and patterson racing to his tent grabbing his rifle and cartridges and starling running toward the screaming and patterson as he charges ahead loading his rifle on the fly and samuel carrying more ammunition running behind patterson keeping up and tsavo station and nothing is visible now the men are gone and from this angle it looks deserted and patterson catching starling leading him into the tsavo station area samuel just behind them
a rectangular shed ahead of them
they move to it slow then they stop a sound is heard from around the corner the sound continues patterson glances at starling the sound could be this the crunching
patterson checking his rifle
starling doing the same
samuel holding the extra ammunition moves close to patterson
now patterson as he suddenly steps away from the shed rounding the corner and as he does the white lion with the fat coolie the lion is crunching at his
feet then the lion stares toward the shed as we patterson moving out into clearer view starling and samuel right with him
the lion is a good distance away
the white lion a low growl coming from him as he takes the coolies body by the shoulder begins backing away with it
patterson dropping to his knees for the shot and starling doing the same and the white lion growling louder and patterson taking aim and samuel crying out and pointing and
suddenly were into super slow motion samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and and this thing is suddenly there this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the flat roof of the shed and the sun blocked out as this dark thing moves across it fully stretched it seems to go on forever and patterson turning around to see and starling turning too and were coming back into regular motion now as we this enormous black maned lion diving into the three sending them all sprawling and the white maned lion roaring and the black maned lion roaring running to the other and the ghost and the darkness for that is how they will be referred to and the ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth the darkness has eyes that are crazed they are destruction bringers these two they can kill the old and the young and the fat and the strong patterson lying in pain dazed shoulder bleeding trying to reach for his rifle and the ghost and the darkness the white and the black as they move toward the field of tall grass roaring and samuel lying in pain his leg is bleeding and pattersons rifle and patterson as he reaches it manages to lift it and the roaring sounds are deafening now and the two gigantic males backing into the tall grass they roar one final time patterson gun ready to fire but its futile and he knows it as we the tall grass and theyre gone the grass is full of moving patterns from the wind thats all we see just the grass blowing this way that way patterson staggering to his feet staring at the grassy field
dazed jesus two of them
patterson registers turns and starling lying dead his throat ripped open
hold briefly on the young man then a train from mombassa is slowly pulling in
and things are fairly chaotic there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of the busier parts in camp but now something new has been added abdullah is
there with several dozen coolies who work under his command
they are waiting for the train
patterson and samuel are there too and at the moment abdullah and patterson are in the middle of a screamer first one of them walking away then coming back then
the other doing the same
shouting over the noise of the approaching train oh sing a different song abdullah gesturing toward the men who stand by the train tracks theres nothing wrong with your men
so stop telling me there is advancing on patterson now you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay losing it you think you matter
gesturing toward the train which is close to stopping now beaumont is on that train he matters patterson moving in on abdullah now he sees this chaos hell replace you
hell replace you too thats all you really care about
you think so
finished arguing its best you get out
tell all your people to go run home where theyll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done they can tell their
women that out of all the thousands who worked here they were the only ones to flee and he wheels around starts to walk away as we abdullah
quiet staring after patterson
patterson has won
as the two of them exchange a quick glance beaumont standing in the door of a passenger car handsome as ever
somehow his clothes are still pressed
patterson moves up
in a splendid mood
samuel is happy too
stepping off the train how could it be
i hate africa
now there is the sudden sound of men singing patterson looks around and we abdullah and his workmen moving away from the train they are singing the same song that
the workmen sang just before the ghost and the darkness attacked its pretty but its also a little unnerving
listening a moment
lovely sound they seem happy
dont they though
so work must be going well
he and samuel share another glance
beat there has been the occasional odd hiccup but then as you so wisely told me id never built in africa
but overall youre pleased
moving in i have never experienced anything like it
beaumont almost longingly looks back at the train
i almost feel like getting right back on
glances at his watch patterson and samuel
they do not breathe
he really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like he just might
a sigh i suppose it would be a dereliction of duty not to at least look around
now abdullah wanders happily by
waving morning friend glorious day
as are they all
he takes a step inside the passenger car
patterson and samuel
he has a large box
i do need to see starling
awhile back he ordered some bibles indicating the box ive brought them
looking around is he here
beat yes he is
well i need to speak to him
helpfully let me deliver the bibles
his eyes flick from one man to the other
voice low where is starling
the jig is up
he gestures here he comes now
and on that half a dozen natives carrying starlings coffin
they start to put it on the train and as they do beaumont
he storms off the train and we as beaumont sees it
patterson and samuel are with him
little more work has been done than the last time we saw it
a few men are working slowly
and now there are guards with rifles patrolling it
a deadly look at them
he storms off
as beaumont sees it patterson samuel and hawthorne stand quietly
its much more crowded than the last time
still under control but barely
beaumont is icy now
he gestures sharply toward hawthrone to join them
the four men speak low and fast what in hell is going on
the ghost and the darkness have come
snapping in english
its what the natives are calling the lions beat two lions have been causing trouble whats the surprise in that this is africa
it hasnt been that simple so far
what have they done besides kill starling
beat how many have they killed
patterson nods for hawthorne to answer hawthorne
doing his best
well of course i cant supply a totally accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each
other or deserting from camp so any number i give is subject to error cutting through how many
thirty i should think
whirling on patterson what are you doing about it
now from there we are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area
this is not near the track but off by itself in an area surrounded by thorn trees
several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it trying to disguise the fact that the small railroad car is indeed nothing but a small railroad car
it is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily
patterson and beaumont looking at it
this is supposed to be salvation
staring at patterson what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here
keeping control im calling it my contraption were going to surround it with a boma a fence to you and were going to leave a small opening opposite that door
the railroad car
there is in fact an open front door
patterson gestures for beaumont to follow him inside
inside the car as they enter
it has been divided in half by thick metal bars from floor to ceiling
the bars are close together only a few inches between them
in that half will be bait human bait ill start things off points to the open doorway a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run
across the floor
the smile is back genius the beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down trapping him you safe behind the bars will have him at your mercy
and will shoot him
are you running a high fever man
how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed
how could you even conceive of it
i didnt conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger
incredulous and it worked
he hates to say this in point of fact it didnt
hurrying on but im convinced the theory is sound
the two of them
they move outside
the tension between them is considerable
beaumont looks at patterson for too long a moment
i made a mistake hiring you youre simply not up to the job
then you genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people dont you
well fine lashing back except there isnt a higher rated engineer and we both know that
and since time is so important to you how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here
let me explain about time youve been here three months and already two months behind
and the germans and the french are gearing up
and i dont care about you and i dont care about the thirty dead i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule ill get my knighthood
and i want it
glancing around as samuel appears goes to the workers professional hunters may be the answer
all theyll bring is more chaos and weve plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then
im going to try and locate redbeard i assume youve heard of him
every man whos ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him the lions will be dead
long pause very well the jobs still yours ill go
but if i have to return youre finished
and i will then do everything i can to destroy your reputation
am i not fair
the great smile flashes told you youd hate me
and he turns walks off samuel
moving up to patterson
samuel has a bag
staring after beaumont i do hate him
takes the bag from samuel pulls out flares i want you to distribute one bag of flares to every tent area takes out a flare tell the men to light
them if theres trouble beat make it two bags
hold briefly then a lamp burns alongside him
across the bars the door of the railroad car is open
above the doorway is a thick wooden slab the size of the door
n the ground barely visible the trip wire
outside something is moving
patterson rifle ready holding his breath
nothing moves now
he rubs his eyes with his hands
flickering shadows on the wall
its later that night
the man is bleary with fatigue
he sits in a corner of the car writing a letter
pattersons voice over dearest
peace and tranquility continue to abound here the workers report each day with a smile except for your absence this whole adventunre is providing me nothing but pleasure
the flickering walls of the railway car
its later still
patterson finished writing stares out at the night
a flare rising brightly toward the sky
patterson seeing the flare
the man is miserable
pattersons voice over fire
the branch is destroyed the flowers blown away
the coolies hold rifles
they look like brothers which they are
they also look tough
and they are that too
three impressed very good indeed
he wears glasses we have hunted since childhood
all right youll spend your nights inside
he indicates the railroad car
the coolies nod youll have plenty of ammunition
youre totally protected you have really nothing to fear
that is correct
patterson looks at the three men
obviously he could not have chosen better
from them a lot of men working under patterson
progress is slow
some men sit on the part thats been built
spending the night there for protection
now they all turn and we another flare going off in another part of camp
patterson in a tree alone in despair
tough as ever
ready for anything
but nothing is happening
still more men are moving into the river
they wade til the water is up to their necks
then they reach out hold hands start to sing
patterson moving high into a tree
he listens to the sound
moonlight on the water
the men stand as before singing softly
the river here is calm no current to speak of
the men are safe or rather they should be
the darkness swimming softly his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream patterson watching
another flare rise helplessly listening
one of them kicks wildly at the wind
they should be nervous the ghost walks among them chooses which one to kill leaps on it brings it to earth as the dust rises
hawthorne seems overwhelmed
and for a moment we dont know what it is
there is a faint light and now we see what it is were looking at a wire
and now a paw walks across it and the instant that happens the three coolies the brothers in the contraption two of them asleep a flickering lamp the only illumination
in the railroad car and the door of the railroad car slamming loudly down and the darkness standing alone in one half of the railroad car its incredible just incredible but pattersons idea actually worked and the entire of the car the thick bars separating the two halves
in one half the huge lion
in the other the three armed tough coolies
for a moment it could be a frozen tableau both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare and then all hell just explodes as we the
darkness and this incredible roar comes from his throat the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and the darkness throwing his huge body at the bars and the bars and both his front claws are slashing through and the three tough coolies and they retreat against the rear wall of the car
the darkness rage building throwing its body at the bars again and the coolies pressed in fear against the far wall unable to do anything but stare and the claws
ripping at the air and the darkness leaping forward smashing into the bars and the ceiling where the bars are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and the coolies staring up at the ceiling and the darkness and here he comes again roaring and his body hits the bars and the ceiling and the bars shake but theyre not giving way
the tough coolies as they begin to realize this and the darkness clawing for them and the darkness raging and roaring on his side of the bars and the first
coolie raising his gun and the second coolie his gun raised too and the third coolie and hes ready and and reload and fire again and reload and the railroad car and suddenly the lamp is knocked over and a fire starts flames grow and its starting to look like hell in there only it gets worse as we the darkness at the bars and suddenly it stands up it seems to fill the car towering over everything its like a nightmare come to kill you the coolies staring up at this giant thing and of course theyre more terrified now than theyve ever been in their lives but these are tough men and they ignore the flames ignore the deafening roars of the beast and the darkness standing there going crazy on his side of the bars trying to knock them down but theyre holding and the tough coolies reloading and the darkness racing around the enclosed area now and hes trapped and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes have never been so bright his roars as deafening and the three coolies firing again and the darkness leaping at the bars again and they shake sure they shake but they keep on holding and the coolies firing reloading firing reloading and as they do somethings starting to come clear amazing as it may seem impossible as it may be to conceive theyre missing
the darkness whirling on his side roaring and leaping and the coolies and sure they fire but theyre still so goddam scared and the door that slid down its held
in place by some thick wooden bars and now the coolies start to hit something the wooden bars because they begin to splinter and the darkness whirling leaping at the bars and the coolies firing and then the door as it flops open and just like that the darkness
out the door and gone
patterson stands where the darkness was
the three coolies are where they spent the night on the other side of the bars
this was the lowest point yet for patterson
not only had his notion come so close to working he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed
it never seemed possible but of course it really happened
you didnt hit it once
i would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving well of course he kept moving but he couldnt have been more than
ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing i assure you we came close many times abdullah is in the doorway near patterson now with several dozen men
and from abdullahs face this is clearly going to be a confrontation
the next time we will do better
patterson makes no reaction moves outside abdullah simmering moving straight to patterson as soon as hes out
the next time will be as this time the devil has come to tsavo not in a mood for this thats ridiculous talk and you cant seriously believe it moving
in tension rising as others crowd behind him now youre telling me my beliefs
i dont think so the bush just beyond something is moving an animal
impossible to say
i wasnt and you know it and dont push it just listen we have a problem in tsavo cutting in at last youre right we do you are the problem
in tsavo careful abdullah patterson and abdullah and suddenly its dangerous
you do not tell me careful you do not tell me anything you listen while i talk now suddenly a shadow seems to cross abdullah
his eyes widen
an enormous pistol
pressed hard against abdullahs temple
mans voice over change in plan you listen while i talk because you have a question that needs answering
beat will i pull the trigger
we are looking at one of those legends ageless and powerful with a tanned face and a thick grey beard
he has seen everything and is capable of anything
just now he seems more than capable of killing abdullah
very calmly he cocks the pistol
samuel over its redbeard abdullah hell kill you
not looking around no hints samuel
the name has registered you dont know all that has happened here the devil has come to tsavo
the devil has come
look at me
i am the devil
abdullah staring at redbeard
right now redbeard just could be
louder i am a man of peace
am i to take it you want to live
now he suddenly reaches out shakes abdullahs hand your name is abdullah
im sure well meet again
go and enjoy the splendid morning
dazed leaving i think its been a pleasure
redbeard and now he does another surprising thing embraces samuel
three words you got old
now he releases samuel turns to patterson im sure youre john patterson
before patterson can reply stay out of my way
and without another word hes gone as redbeard moves through taking it all in
its even worse than when we last saw it bodies crammed everywhere and always the sound of pain and sickness
patterson stands in the doorway watching waiting
as redbeard approaches i didnt have a chance to thank you
preoccupied what did i do
got me out of trouble
matter of fact nonsense samuel would have done something
starts to move on we need to talk
let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge youre sorry im here
right so far
patterson nods good because i am not an engineer i dont want to be in charge and im sorrier than you are that im here i hate tsavo
so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave
see any problems
all right lets go into battle
suddenly taking pattersons hand im redbeard
as they shake somehow i guessed
as they move outside a bunch of men wait
hwathorne samuel abdullah and perhaps a dozen other worker leaders
redbeard and patterson move to them
starting now we attack them
how we dont know where they are
well have to make them come to us wont we
and since there are two of them were going to set two plans in motion
to hawthorne first we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night
appalled thats a terrible idea backtracking is it im sorry but then of course youre the doctor you should know
silliest thing i ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that
charming now i suppose i could answer you
i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike
its even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means theyre already contemplating feasting here
turning on hawthorne now his voice building but i dont want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i dont have the least idea
what i am doing that i am nothing but an incompetent that i am a fool
big anyone who finds me a fool please say so now
the words burst out i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
nice smile then we agree
and on that it was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day but there was always the sense of impending bloodshed
what we see first are patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of workers laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would surround the place
this was to be by far the biggest wall fence they had in tsavo
and now here comes abdullah leading a crowd of men wading into a huge patch of thorn trees cutting the thick branches down starting to load them for carrying and
its high noon now and patterson drenched with sweat leads the start of the actual building taking the thorn branches bunching them together forcing them so there is no room between them and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be except at the moment its barely a foot high and now redbeard appears beckons to patterson and patterson redbeard and samuel walk quickly
samuel turning to redbeard and patterson
redbeard nods to redbeard i have to ask why do you need me
i dont really
but understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out patterson has to smile at the phrase when im gone youll still have
to build the bridge
and i dont want the men to have lost respect for you
kind of surprised thats very considerate
im always considerate my mother taught me that
samuel who just breaks out laughing
why do you laugh
you dont believe she taught me
i dont believe you had a mother
and as redbeard laughs too a masai village as they approach
redbeard walks ahead
you like him dont you
but it takes time
youve known him long
he has since his beard was red
redbeard patterson and samuel stand near him
women and children are there
some of the children look at redbeard mime shooting fall down dead
samuel translates as necessary
how many cattle
four should do it
they will want a lot of money
to redbeard have you got it
no but you do beat see you were needed after all
to samuel and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
the masai chief replies
translating why so many
because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men
redbeard and patterson watching as samuel tells the chief
the masai chief
he moves toward redbeard and patterson
as he speaks samuel translates quietly
there is a sadness in the chiefs tone
translating the ghost and the darkness have come
and we can do nothing
but if you anger them
they will stay in tsavo
and life will become more unberable that i know
patterson watching as redbeard replies
beat two lions are all that have come
theyre only lions that i know
beat and i will kill them both tomorrow
hold briefly then were not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic sounds
now we hear voices
redbeard voice over ill need you by me in the morning
samuel voice over whatever you wish
where we are its pattersons tent area
patterson redbeard hawthorne and samuel sit around a fire
they are cleaning their guns getting ready
a word about their weapons
pattersons is a good rifle and he cleans it expertly
redbeards surprisingly is the oldest
and the way his hands move as he assembles it he might be bathing a child
hawthorne is the least skilled of the three
but his rifle is clearly the finest
bigger than the others with great killing power
there is a tremendous tension patterson hawthorne and samuel show it
redbeard is as before
terribly tense youre certain about tomorrow
redbeard is but you dont seem excited
redbeard isnt you dont enjoy killing do you
redbeard doesnt then why do it
he stares at the fire
then i have a gift
silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled
redbeards hands fly
his rifle is back together
he stands nods goes
hawthorne watching him
to samuel has he always been this way
much gentler now
shakes his head on that john
he holds out his beautiful rifle change guns with me mines much more powerful
ill be finishing the hospital tomorrow so i wont be with you but if youll use this
beat then i will
patterson touched changes weapons
he turns to samuel why does he need you by him
he needs nobody
but we have hunted many times
beat he knows i am afraid of lions
misty hard to see much
then ghosts appear theyre not ghosts theyre masai warriors emerging from the mists
they are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking equipment tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them materialize redbeard patterson and samuel wait as the
whispered i spotted one of them gesturing toward the thicket in there
the thicket again alive with thorn trees
dark filled with long dark shadows
redbeard and patterson and samuel
a lot of tension
the best way to ensure the kill when youre using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter
have you ever led trackers
he hasnt i can try
no good samuel says you killed a lion
it was probably luck id rather you did the shooting
youd never force the lion to me and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck
points hand out straight around theres a clearing youll know it from the anthills get there and hide and listen to the sounds ill make the lion come directly to
he gestures for patterson to take off and as he does the warriors as redbeard goes to them as samuel translates all of you spread the width of the clearing
no gaps go claps his hands once the warriors spreading apart
starting to appear more strongly on the horizon
patterson running like hell
the warriors moving quickly silently
patterson ducking his head blasting through
the warriors starting to cover the entire width of the thicket
patterson quickstepping over rocky terrain
samuel staying close to redbeard
the fear is there
redbeard studying the position of the warriors who are almost ready
patterson circling now racing toward a clearing picking up speed
the warriors spread out
they look to redbeard
patterson racing into the clearing glances around lots of anthills
an anthill eight feet high
it casts a long shadow
holding hawthornes marvelous rifle he slips silently into the shadow
hold on patterson its almost as if he werent there
suddenly screaming and samuel screaming too and the whole line of warriors suddenly moving forward all of them shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud
patterson in the shadow
the noise is faint but he can hear it
a dozen drummers moving forward banging away
a dozen more drummers even louder
redbeard moving forward his eyes flicking ahead the thicket ahead
just the least bit louder now
the whole line of warriors screaming and pounding and samuel the fear worse dogging redbeards steps
his eyes flicking ahead
the thicket ahead
its a lot louder now
hes totally still
and hes ready
the densest part of the thicket weve seen yet
the warriors slashing their way through drumming and shouting and redbeard at their head eyes as always flicking
the thicket ahead
redbeard starting to suddenly get louder and point because something is there the thicket ahead and we didnt see it before only redbeard saw it before but now something begins
to move and redbeard and the warriors and its all going crazy now and theyre starting to move faster and the noise has kicked up and all the time its coming closer and redbeard and the warriors and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the warriors are almost in a frenzy as we a flash of the ghost in the thicket eyes bright it starts to move away from the sound and toward where patterson is waiting
faster screaming louder and samuel and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and patterson he fingers the weapon
the ghost angrily retreating faster from the sound and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and redbeard immediately spotting the shift gesturingto the warriors to
get left and the warriors shifting over as redbeard directed blocking the ghosts intended path and the ghost shifting trying to go the other way this time and redbeard he spots that too gestures for the warriors to shift the other way and the warriors racing to thier new positions blocking the animals path again and the ghost rattled upset and now it starts retreating back in the original direction toward patterson and redbeard and the whole long line of men and its as if mass hysteria has gripped them because their sound keeps building and sure their throats must ache and yes their arms must tire but you couldnt tell that from what theyre doing patterson
waiting by the anthill
then at last the ghost backing into view staring back at the sound unaware of pattersons existence behind him
noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight
he raises hawthornes gun
the ghost backing toward patterson
patterson sighting along the glistening barrel
the ghost starting to turn
patterson ready to fire
the ghost in close up caught in the crosshairs of the rifle
and now its lips go back as it sees patterson
patterson close up and this is it this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger patterson and the ghost and a totally unexpected sound a dull snap hawthornes
rifle has misfired
the ghost unharmed and patterson desperately workingthe rifle trying to make it function and the ghost
it stares at patterson
patterson and the goddamn gun wont work and hes a dead man and and for a moment they might be frozen in some horrible tableau redbeard as he hears it
breaking into a wild run shoot for chrissakes
patterson standing his ground as now the ghost takes a step toward him
redbeard firing reloading on the move and up ahead is the clearing and as he reaches it the ghost
its great head turns in the direction of redbeard and redbeards position anthills block him from getting a clear shot at the animal he curses races for a better position
and the ghost
one final stare at patterson then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket and its safe and free and gone
the low point of his life
samuel catching up to redbeard
did you ever see a lion that size
not even close
now he moves to patterson what happened
a whisper misfire
has it ever done that before
trying for control
you exchanged weapons
patterson nods you went into battle with an untried gun
patterson nods redbeard
for a moment its impossible to tell what hes going to do
it seems that a homeric burst of fury is about to happen
drained he epects it
its very quiet
reedbeard studying the younger man
and when he finally speaks his voice is surprisingly quiet
they have an expression in prizefighting everyone has a plan until theyre hit
beat youve just been hit
beat the getting up is up to you
and he turns moves off and nearly finished
the fence is eight feet high and hawthorne is supervising men and material that are being transferred
redbeard checking security in the new hospital which is close to the center of camp
the old hospital was situated on the outskirts because they wanted to keep the workers away from the sick and the wounded
late afternoon now
patterson samuel and hawthorne are moving with him
as are two experienced orderlies both armed with powerful rifles
patterson is silent here the effects of the misfire still evident on his face
to the orderlies gentlemen theres no sickness smell at all here and little blood
when we leave close the gate securely dont open it til morning and keep your fires high
any questions ask them now
they understand now to samuel and hawthorne you two will sleep beautifully in your tents
beat and stay there
and where will you sleep beautifully
smile patterson and i will be in the old hospital where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers beat and by the time were done i promise you the odor
of blood will be irresistible
and on that redbeard and patterson have buckets which they empty around the inside perimeter buckets of blood
patterson and redbeard
they empty still more full buckets of blood
redbeard seems pleased
samuel and hawthorne hurrying toward their camp
patterson and redbeard leading masai cattle into the grounds of the old hospital
the orderlies in the new hospital firmly closing and locking the gate
patterson and redbeard just outside the fence of the old hospital they carry many large chunks of raw meat drop them as they move
patterson and redbeard
they slip inside the deserted old hospital pull the gate securely shut
they stand in the center of the old hospital calling to each other
the new hospital
the men are exhausted
most are already asleep
the orderlies sit by a fire alert for anything
the old hospital
patterson and redbeard stand across from their fire waiting
the cows are quiet
hawthorne by his fire near his tent with samuel
nervously they drink tea
an hour has passed
walking the fence perimeter
the cows are edgy
he calms the cows
outside the old hospital
the large chunks of meat are visible in the moonlight
the new hospital
the orderlies are calm
redbeard still walking the perimeter
patterson sitting by the fire staring at the night
redbeard moves to him speaks in a whisper
think about something else
have you ever failed
sad smile only in life
he walks away
the new hospital
the orderlies tend the sick
the night and the moon
stalking the perimeter
the night is deadly quiet
he stalks the perimeter now too on the far side from redbeard and suddenly a different and frightening sound the ripping of flesh now we can see both patterson inside
and also outside where in shadow the ghost and the darkness are devouring a hunk of meat
redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter gestures for patterson to switch positions with him
as he reaches where patterson was the eating sound stops
patterson reaches the far side of the fence
now the eating sound comes again and again both lions are outside directly across from patterson
redbeard looks across the perimeter at patterson
whatevers going on its sure as hell odd
the cattle they are very upset suddenly one of them kicks out violently against the night the same gesture the cattle did just before the ghost walked through their pen
and killed one now a different sound is heard scratching patterson and redbeard tracking the sound the main gate is starting to be pushed in
inside the gate the ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their buckets
more pressure against it it could give way any moment
redbeard and patterson and from the look on redbeards face this is it
patterson seees this readies his rifle and we the cattle going nuts and then the gate
all pressure gone
patterson and redbeard
patterson is furious
its all right
indicates the blood they know its there
patterson takes a few steps away stares at the moon
redbeard he studies patterson who so clearly craves redemption
going to him meant to ask you the railroad car trap
patterson nods excellent notion i used the same device myself once
but of course yours worked
in point of fact it didnt but im convinced the idea is sound
he goes back to walking the perimeter
patterson watches him and for the first time since the misfire pattersons mood begins to lift
and an orderly blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the fire and the second orderly rounding a corner seeing the violence before he can scream the ghost
and the darkness suddenly beside him and their giant paws slap out so fast we cant follow and the second orderly dropping to the ground and now were starting to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning
a tent full of sick men with malaria and a paw flashing and the darkness lips pulling back and a sick man falling from his bed blood pouring from his
slashed face and two more sick men trying to rise and the ghost leaping on them and the darkness eyes narrow and brilliant and a sick coolie and hes terrified and he tries to scream the sound barely escapes him but even so its the first cry weve heard and but the new hospital is on the other end a good distance away
patterson and redbeard rifles ready but no sound reaches them
hawthorne out of his tent because hes close by and he heard it and he lights a torch starts for the gate of the camp as samuel does his best
to stop him but hawthorne rips free and we a second tent as it starts to collapse and the medicine tent as the ghost and the darkness enter and medicine flying across the tent and glass shattering and more medicine is destroyed and a blizzard of cuts of lions claws and lions teeth and those terrible bright blazing eyes and a tent pole being pulled out of the ground and the ghost and the darkness and what they are doing is this destroying the new hospital and more tents collapsing and the ghost and the darkness
hawthorne alone in the night scared shitless as he runs
shadows moving as hawthornes torch lights the surroundings and hawthorne heart pounding looking around and then he gasps as we the area nearby two large eyes are staring at him
hawthorne panicked stumbling falling getting up staring around the area around him the eys are gone and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the new hospital
and the instant they are heard redbeard and patterson grabbing torches throwing the gate open and theyre off as we hawthorne running toward the new hospital just up ahead now
patterson and redbeard tearing through the night
the new hospital
we see all this next through hawthornes eyes
the tents are all down
the place is devastated
inside the first tent
filled with the dead and the dying
its a slaughterhouse
his body sags
he takes a breath his last
the ghost and the darkness are on him roaring
patterson and redbeard as the roar reverberates they glance at each other then they slow
because the new hospital has come into view
redbeard close up staring at the disaster
and this terrible crosses his face
for a moment you think hes going to fall
his body seems drained of all its power
he stands there
just stands there
unable to move
and he does move
into the chaos
he stares around the dead and the dying are everywhere
hawthorne his face clawed almost unrecognizably lies alone
all thats left now is this the sound of pain
it covers everything
only the sound remains
now different sounds take over an incredible babble of human voices
patterson walks through the dust
samuel a worried look on his face is a few steps behind
we are at the station area and it is jammed
a train has pulled into the station only you almost cant tell its a train all you can see are workers climbing up and the inside is full so the
workers clamber up onto the roofs of the cars covering the cars everyone is leaving patterson can only watch
abdullah stands on one of the cars the train begins to pull out of the station
more and more workers chase after it get pulled on
now the station area is empty the flat car roofs full
patterson still watches eyes vacant
abdullah sees him looks away
the train gathers speed
rounds a corner
patterson turns from the scene begins to walk
samuel stays close behind him the worried look still there
a few african orderlies do the best they can
patterson watches only a moment walks on
samuel still behind him
the camp as patterson walks through
a ghost town now
only africans remain
the contraption where the coolies missed the darkness
patterson looks at it a moment walks on
the anthill in the clearing where patterson misfired
patterson looks at it a moment walks on
and now at last pattersons tent area
one or two africans
samuel darts into his tent emerges with something holds it out to patterson
patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks puts it on he never takes it off again
he walks on alone now until at last it stops abruptly halfway done the foundations are in place a lot of the scaffolding but its useless
redbeard sits alone high on one of the foundations
he looks as he did the night before
patterson walks to the top of the near embankment
he is unshaven wrinkled he fingers the lion claw necklace
for a moment neither says a word
then out of the blue it would have been a beautiful bridge john
i never noticed before occupied with other business i suppose
hes rambling never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but ive had the time today nothing else on and this
its graceful and the placement couldnt be prettier
he goes silent now stares off you just got hit
redbeard nods the getting up is up to you but theyre only lions beat and im going after them crack of dawn
and on that we havent seen anything like it before its hundreds of feet tall gorgeous early morning light
as we watch we realize there are two dots on the side of the cliff
as we watch a moment more we realize the dots are moving
the dots are patterson and redbeard working their way along the rock face
patterson is much more nimble
its dangerous of course but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind
they travel lightly small knapsacks and their weapons
the two of them as they make it over the cliff face
they stand stare out
what they see the world
they move on
they are moving along the edge
its tricky going if you fell you wouldnt much like it
they are both concentrating on their movements paying no attention to each other as redbeard starts to speak
they dont stop moving
in my town when i was little there was a brute a bully who terrorized the place
beat but he was not the problem
he had a brother who was worse than he
but the brother was not the problem
beat one or the other of them was usually in jail
the problem came when they were both free togther
the two became different from either alone
beat alone they were only brutes
together they became lethal together they killed
what happened to them
pause i got big
they move on patterson and redbeard working their way up a steep ravine
its hard going
they help each other
patterson and redbeard moving along the edge of the ravine now
redbeard stops points a tangle in the bushes and thorns with one odd thing about it there is a clearly defined archway as if a buffalo or rhino used it
as a regular passage
the two of them at the archway
they look at each other without a word move through it
the other side
a small clearing
and at the end of the clearing a cave
the cave mouth
redbeard and patterson
they each check their guns move toward it
the cave mouth
suddenly its getting eerie
redbeard moving slowly patterson right with him
the cave mouth
theyre by it redbeard squints inside
what he sees its dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half crawl through
without a word they start inside
redbeard and patterson crouched low moving through the tunnel
ahead there is light
they move on
the end of the tunnel they can see the cave beyond
redbeard and patterson
they glance down
nothing much there just a copper bracelet the kind a native might wear
now they move past it and as the tunnel ends they stand up
patterson and redbeard moving deeper into the cave
its scary dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock
it all feels as at any moment the world could end
thunderstruck dear god and on those words the floor of the cave
more copper bracelets
and still more and now bones the floor of the place is littered with human bones eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around
the rest of the cave
we are looking at a carpet of bones
redbeard nods have you ever seen anything like this
nobodys seen anything like this
lions dont have caves like this beat theyre doing it for pleasure
several tunnels dark and ominous leading from the cave and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels something is coming close and coming fast and redbeard and
patterson as redbeard fires into the tunnel and the sound explodes shrieks redbeard and patterson
what the hell is it
the tunnel and here they come screeching and angry bats swarms of them hundreds of them patterson and redbeard diving to the ground lying there amidst the bangles and the
bones and the skulls the bats
circling above them
patterson and redbeard lying very still eyeless skulls all around staring
for a moment it seems as if they might attack
pattrson and redbeard
then the bats back into the tunnel and patterson and redbeard scrambling to their feet
one of my chief attributes is that im always calm
and then without warning from behind them a roar patterson and redbeard spin around start back toward the entrance of the cave the low entrance tunnel as they scramble half
crawling through it
outside as they make it stand straight look around thick bush beyond another roar and sudden movement and patterson and redbeard entering the thick bush but carefully because they are
vulnerable now and an attack could come from anywhere there is the sound of water slashes of light hit their eyes making it hard to see and theyre totally vulnerable now but it doesnt stop them the water sound gets stronger and as they burst clear patterson and redbeard
they look around
nothing is there
but the spot is wide open exposed
the words pour out where could it have gone
how could it get across the water
looks at redbeard theyre only lions yes
shakes his head he doesnt know dont they have to be
they look around a moment more
nothing to see they turn leave re enter the thick bush
and now the darkness who knows where it is but its there watching patterson
hold briefly on the darkness then outside the fence a dreadful sound the crunching of bones
patterson redbeard and samuel emerge from tents listen
patterson is on one side of the area redbeard and samuel on the other
pointing both of them over there
he is pointing to pattersons area
patterson goes to redbeard
ever have to use a machan
redbeard hasnt i did once
we will tonight
now from that patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd looking structure four slender poles lashed together slanting inward with a plank tied on top a dozen
feet up in the air
redbeard and samuel approach
theyre used to people in trees not in a clearing
indicating the plank it may be tight
not for me im too bulky and its your idea you go up there
to samuel take the others to the water tower for the night
ill be bait alone
and ill be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever
beat can you control your fear
ill have to
i cant control mine id be lost without the shame factor driving me
was that supposed to make me feel better
redbeard doesnt reply
now the men start to tie it down across the clearing from the machan
patterson takes a long look at the machan
he tests the support poles theyre rickety
the sun quickly beginning its quick fall
the water tower in the station area
samuel is with the remaining men who clamber up to the platform on top
the donkey in the clearing
redbeard holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the plank
patterson climbs his slow way up
the plank as patterson makes it clambers off the ladder manages to sit
nothing is around the machan
he is totally vulnerable
redbeard taking the ladder down
patterson tries to get comfortable
glancing around its certainly the best chance theyve had to kill you
you think theyll come then
redbeard does why
not answering good luck
beat because i think theyre after you
finally he nods
redbeard starts to leave
how many do you think theyve killed
reluctantly the most of any lions
beat probably more
now redbeard looks up at the younger man johnny
they study each other in the gathering darkness
theyve been through a lot together these two
theyre not what they were when they first met
an emotional moment clearly is at hand
dont fuck up
and he turns never looks back just goes patterson
he is alone now
on top of the water tower
the remaining men are with him
it peers around
his fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel there is no noise but you have the sense that at any second the world could explode
the edge of the clearing a good distance away
a bunch of trees
redbeard motionless rifle in hand is high in the branches
about to die
patterson trying to get comfortable
its not possible
the donkey tethered but able to move
patterson testing the machan not a good idea it trembles
he stops stares out at the setting sun the light hitting his skin giving it color
the sun and heres the thing about africa the sun doesnt just set it literally drops out of the sky
suddenly its bright and in a blink it isnt
as it drops patterson
its madness that hes up here
and he knows it
and that shows
just thick cloud
on his precarious perch
he scans constantly ahead of him past the donkey
the thick bush beyond the donkey
nothing moves patterson
he swallows moistening his throat
he stares down at the donkey
and now just the beginning of a mist
patterson sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends listening for something anything but all there is is silence
it lies still and quiet
patterson looking around you get the feeling hed like to scream
the bushes around him
the mist is getting stronger
redbeard in his tree cursing trying to see through the growing mist
patterson listening listening and then there is a sound and its so quiet you can barely hear it but to patterson it might as well be thunder from behind the
donkey there has come this the snapping of a twig
the donkey and its eyes widen because now something happens that hasnt happened before suddenly there are no colors only tones because lions cant see colors only tones and thats
whats happening we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of the lion the eyes of the ghost
watching the donkey
and from now on when we are using pattersons point of view everything is clouded and thick with mist and sounds are muted
when we are using the ghosts point of view everything is totally clear and sounds are thunderous
what patterson sees just mist and vaguely bushes
what the ghost sees the donkey
and camera begins to move closer as the ghost moves just the barest few steps closer
still no sound but beyond the donkey there seems to be some movement in the bushes
what the ghost sees the donkey very very close patterson
squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but the mist is so thick he cant make certain of anything
now there is something else visible something behind the donkey the four legs of the platform
now we travel up the platform the four legs grow closer together
involuntarily a shiver
what the ghost sees patterson but the angle shifts whats happening of course is this the ghost is circling around the platform in the safety of the bushes and the
patterson following the whispered sound of the bushes moving
he half turns the other way quickly making sure that nothing is behind him
what the ghost sees patterson shifting as the angle continues to change
patterson as the realization hits the beast doesnt care about the donkey anymore its stalking him
in the tree
the mist obscures everything
what the ghost sees patterson
still circling still closer
patterson and its scary now this thing circling and circling always closer never visible and his throat is dry and you know hes just dying to blast it with his
weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement
in truth the lion circled him for two hours always coming closer never quite seen
what the ghost sees patterson always the circling around
patterson trying to turn on his shaky plank trying to never to let the animals position out of his sight
what the ghost sees patterson
patterson staring staring at the goddamn mist about to come apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and what the ghost sees patterson
patterson gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on turning
what the ghost sees patterson
patterson suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him thats right a goddamn owl landed on him thinking he was a tree almost knocking him off the plank
and what the ghost sees patterson starting to slip off the platform and patterson fighting the owl away but his balance is going and hes trying not to fall and what the ghost sees patterson beginning to topple off and patterson helpless balance going going the ghost starting to charge forward and christ he can move and as he starts his leap redbeard racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing firing his rifle firing again and the ghost as this incredible roar comes from him and he spins lands and sure hes been hit but hes gone back into the bushes and the night has him and sudden dawn and patterson and redbeard running stopping staring at the ground the ground
patterson and redbeard moving quickly forward again the ground
more blood and
the two of them starting to slow strange terrain huge anthills all over the tallest weve seen some of them fifteen feet high some even higher
patterson and redbeard
they separate take different paths through the anthills
one step at a time
one step at at time
crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills staring down at them both
he gestures for them to stop
for a moment they might be statues
the rocky ground
spots of blood
redbeard kneels to examine them and as he does the ghost launched in mid air and patterson whirling falling firing and as the sound detonates the ghost in mid air
body twisted and and freeze
freeze on the ghost silhouetted against the morning sky
then were by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment when the three men brought the old man eater into camp only now eight men appear
carrying the ghost eight is the actual number of men that it took and as they lower the dead animal to the ground the ghost and now theres a flash of light as we beaumont kneeling by the dead animal
he is smiling beautifully and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face
a photographer loads of bulky equipment
patterson and redbeard stand behind him watching him
were in a lovely spot by the river
patterson and redbeard have definitely been drinking
i think another for posterity this is an important moment in my life
he strikes another pose the photographer goes to work
understand i had help not a time for modesty bob undeniably your triumph
oh surely theres enough credit for us all lets not forget you did the actual shooting
of course i hired you i was the general who put the team together
and generals are the ones who tend to be remembered
perhaps you might put your head in its mouth sir could be a corker
clever idea i like it
the mouth of the ghost it is huge beaumont manages to get it open puts his head between the enormous set of teeth hes nervous tries to hide it when
we redbeard suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and beaumont surprised and frightened he jerks his head away there is the sound of laughter pattersons and redbeards beaumont tries for his smile cant bring it off looks around humiliated and as the laughter builds patterson and redbeard flank a fire
its a sweet moment for them their first no fear in the vicinity
it should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of champagne
it should also be noted that the patterson we see is a world away from the young man who went to meet beaumont
hes unshaven his eyes have seen terrible things he is weary he has known failure he is more at ease with the world
drunk i never thought id say this but im glad you came
drunk understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
actually i could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason im glad you came
they toast each other samuel with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over joins them
drunk where do you go next
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas
help finish the railroad
i want to meet my son he must be what two months old
they look at the fire a moment
then three years ive worked for the railroad
now i dont know why
it seemed a good idea once
i feel the same about the bridge
this country certainly didnt ask for it doesnt need it
too soon to tell
they look at him
my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder
our lives have crossed because two lions went mad
but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity
was that worth all the lives
too soon to tell
drinks some mysteries should not have solutions
finishes his bottle rises looks at patterson hold your son high
and he turns goes to his tent beat quietly he has children
beat quietly once
hold on the two in the firelight
then female voice over id like to see john patterson please
as he looks up helena standing there in tsavo she looks weary from travel but still lovely
she holds their son in her arms
the kid is adorable
could you tell him that his wife catches herself smiles that his family has come to see him
on that patterson at the bridge samuel hurries to him with the news patterson takes off running and tsavo station and helena she holds the sleeping child walks back and
forth along the shaded front of the building no sound at all but her heels
patterson running like crazy and up ahead now is the station area
helena and now in the distance she sees him and she leaves the building walks out into the open smiling and waving excitedly and patterson excitedly waving back and the
darkness moving out of the grassy area behind helena and patterson suddenly screaming get back back helena and shes too far away his words are lost on the wind she smiles again waves again and patterson screaming now all he has get back and helena and she still cant make out what hes saying but just the same she stops and the darkness stalking silently closing on the mother and child
helena and the baby wakes smiles and the darkness starting to run and patterson and now it shows on his face hes not going to get there hes never going
to get there helena and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she turns but too late too late as we the darkness flying toward her now and patterson in agony
the darkness leaping on them taking them to the ground and as helena cries out helplessly patterson crying out helplessly and continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare
he just had is over he staggers to his tent opening goes outside
patterson shaken tries to rid himself of the dream
he looks around
redbeards tent is ripped patterson runs to it inside the tent
patterson stares around there is blood on the tent floor and quickly patterson running wildly rifle in hand and samuel carrying a weapon hurrying to keep up and patterson flying
across rough terrain and as he and samuel splash across a small river he gestures for them to split and they do widening the area of search and samuel veering off and thorn trees as patterson rips through them unmindful of the damage to his clothes or his skin and more thorns he plunges wildly ahead and a large anthill it seems to be casting an unusual shadow patterson slows rifle ready takes a breath moves around it nothing at all just his imagination which has been working overtime and is only getting worse patterson stands there a moment unsure where to go what to do and then samuels voice on the wind calling to him patterson tracking the sound samuels voice cries out again louder patterson starts to run and run and as he rounds a bend a field of white grass
with one patch in the middle that is blood red
something is moving in the blood red area
patterson has his rifle ready and then samuel rises from the blood red patch
in shock in despair call it what you want he has seen something beyond imagination
patterson rushing across the field of white grass rushing to where samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass he looks down into the grass clearly redbeard is there
and clearly he is dead
patterson and samuel stare mute at one another and now from frighteningly near them comes the triumphant roar of the darkness
they dont even react
we should already have a sense of where we are weve done this before
samuel stands there trying to hold it together
patterson stands there too trying to hold it together
redbeards funeral pyre
flames consume the body
just patterson and samuel
no one else is there
the flames lick at the sky
patterson and samuel both armed climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge not far from the baboon
youre positive lions hate baboons
samuel is pebbles
samuel holds up a bag lets get it over with
patterson and samuel as they reach the crane tower platform fifteen feet from the baboon
they help each other into position
the large baboon baring its enormous teeth shrieking out into the darkness
patterson and samuel on the platform
samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again not in pain but irritation theyre both tired
samuel throws another pebble
the baboon cries out
hes tossing pebbles now as samuel dozes
paterson looks wild only nervous energy is keeping him going now
peaceful then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and patterson blinking coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds
hes starting to hallucinate
samuel is awake now
patterson stares at the river which is calm
the river raging and black and lethal
patterson hallucinating again
and the darkness suddenly is there creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears patterson
firing the darkness and its hit and it roars and goes down and patterson turning reaching for samuels rifle grabbing it turning back ready to fire again the darkness gone
patterson and samuel blinking looking around
where is it
pointing down underneath
where hes pointing
the superstructure for the bridge it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run
they look at each other not good news and we find out why when we patterson and samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level
they reach the railroad level
patterson releases the baboon which races away
where they are
at the end of the bridge where they began construction
the bridge two thirds finished stretches away before them
they begin to walk the incomplete bridge
as they go the look down through the crevices of their level making sure they miss nothing
holding his rifle extremely tightly
ready for anything
the bridge up ahead of them
there are some holes
patterson and samuel slowing
the nearest one is the largest
he goes on tiptoe trying to see whats in the hole
it seems empty
patterson and samuel
one step forward
they hold their breaths
it seems empty
a shot from below bridge level the darkness is there
the darkness going down through another level of scaffolding
pattrson and samuel trying to track it
nothing is visible
patterson and samuel frozen
they listen nothing but their breathing
patterson looking around everywhere
the first level of scaffolding
the second level of scaffolding
samuel looking this way that way
the hole as the darkness just fucking flies out of it patterson falls back and fires and the darkness is hit and goes down but it gets up and patterson
turning for samuels rifle only samuel isnt there hes taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and patterson and he turns starts running too running across the narrow half completed bridge and its a bitch to do it without slipping or falling and the darkness wounded sure but the mother can still run and it takes off after patterson and samuel making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the nearest tree and patterson running for his life across the bridge and the darkness closing the gap and ordinarily patterson would be a dead man but even though the darkness hasnt got its ordinary speed its still faster than patterson and patterson and hes never gone this fast in his life and the tree hes headed for a different one from samuels and its just up ahead and the darkness closing and the tree and the darkness springing into the air now and patterson diving for the lowest branch grabbing hold with both hands swinging his body up as we the darkness barely missing as patterson gets his body onto the branch and now comes this insane roar and samuel with his rifle as he climbs higher into his tree
patterson in the next tree climbing higher until hes fifteen feet up
the darkness on the ground circling the trunk of pattersons tree raging with frustration
patterson exhausted but its okay now hes safe and as he looks across at the next tree not far away where samuel is embarrassed afraid of lions
its all right samuel we all get hit now he shuts up fast and the darkness as it does this incredible thing it starts to climb the tree after patterson
lions are cats and when they want to climb up they go and thats what the darkness is doing now going up and patterson and its terrifying he reaches for
the branch above climbing higher and the darkness climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and patterson going still higher but the branches are getting thinner and the tree is shaking and he could fall the darkness climbing on nothing can stop it patterson and the darkness together in the tree and theres no further patterson can go and its harder for the darkness too but slowly it moves in and patterson calling out samuel
and he gestures for the rifle and the instant he does samuel and he takes the rifle between his two hands and the darkness steadily moving in and samuel tossing
the rifle with great care and pattersons less than fifteen feet away and patterson hands out to catch it and the rifle in mid air and patterson both hands ready and the rifle as it strikes a tree branch spins away to the ground
the darkness almost on patterson now and patterson suddenly leaping out of the tree and yes its a long way and sure its going to damage him but sometimes there
arent a lot of choices in this world and samuel staring as patterson falls and patterson crashing hard to earth stunned hurt ribs broken leg broken and the darkness and its so big its hard for it to get room to turn but it does and patterson crawling for the rifle and hes in terrible pain but he reaches the weapon grabs for it and the darkness skittering down the tree and as it reaches the ground patterson forcing himself to his feet and the darkness a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its charge
patterson aims fires and the darkness hit again and down it goes again but up it comes again and patterson firing the final shot and the darkness hit again and
it has to stop it just has to but it doesnt
it roars and roars and moves slowly toward patterson
patterson all bullets gone no place to hide
still moving forward
he takes a step backward falls backwards over a branch lands hard and the darkness framed between pattersons legs
six feet away now four now patterson helpless on the ground
the darkness and the eyes glow a branch is on the ground in front of it it buries its huge teeth into the branch now a long dying sigh
and it goes to the ground
the darkness dead its teeth still buried in the tree branch
and suddenly he just empties and tears pour down his face and he begins to cry out loud his body wracked with sobs
he manages to get to his knees moves next to the animal patterson and the darkness
just the sound of pattersons tears
hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it samuel is there lighting up the world with his smile and pattersons there too
he stands with helena his young son in his arms
everybody smiles everybody waves the train goes triumphantly by
he looks wonderful again vibrant and young
watching him you might think he hadnt been through the nightmare as he stands there holding the boy tightly
but with his other hand he fingers the lion claw necklace
now slowly dissolve to an african evening
animals stretch from one horizon to the other
samuel voice over here we still wonder about them
how did they escape for nine months
and kill men
and stop the railroad
beat and were they only lions
beat if you want to decide for yourself you must go to america
they are at the field museum in chicago and even now after they have been dead a century if you dare to lock eyes with them
beat you will be afraid
in the distance the animals continue to move
samuel voice over sleep well
hold on the animals
they seem to go on forever
