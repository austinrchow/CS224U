graphic titles pop up throughout
some are chapter titles others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons
sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion
at other times theyre loosely spaced or sharply angled or individual words flash up one after another
titles ought to be wilder and less uniform than i suggest on the page
she looks gorgeous then ordinary sloppy white waitress uniform gorgeous again dishes stacked in her arms turning looking happy tired

end titles as we flash food images beans eggs pie burger shake waffle grilled cheese fast flow of too much grub as words fly flurry of movement waitresses setting up
for lunch slim joking with ginny knocked around but still spirited two kids at home from different guys she somehow maintains a good attitude
slim views ginny as her idol for her attitude not her life

the cook sticks his head between them ladies please

oh my god speaking
of time the lunch rush is coming they start working triple speed ginny and slim converge carrying dirty dishes piling them up for the busboy teddy hispanic
they havent stopped moving for two hours but now they can take a breath survey the scene
slim notices ginny has a wet spot under her arm

the deodorant thing
its salts or something it comes in like a
it looks like some kinda hippie crystal
youre saying i sweat

as someone comes in your turn im sweatin too much
slim gives her a look grabs a menu goes over to where the new customer whom we will call for the moment our hero is seated
when she reaches his booth she notices hes got a book and a long stemmed red rose
she hands him a menu waiting for somebody
he shakes his head
she cant help noticing hes very handsome

slim writes up a check for a customer at the counter
when she finishes the turkey burger is up
she carries it to the table tb coleslaw and so forth
you dont really write books do you
i dont read finnecans wake either
im goin into law
this is more like what she expected
whos the rose for
shes busy so she starts to go enjoy your grub huh
shes seven feet away when she hears sheturns back toward him he smiles offers the rose you
she smiles back their eyes meet
a sudden utterly magical moment
this is also the moment to
note our hero should be played by a famous actor doing a cameo
because at this instant the scene changes
the man mitch in the booth behind our hero a man we havent noticed because all weve seen is the back of his head turns and looks at slim
looks down at our hero
how much did you settle on
slim frowns steps closer so she can overhear the bet
how much is it
our hero has a completely blank look on his face you and your friend
was it or or
whatre you he bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours starting noon today
our hero rises to his feet and pushes mitch in the chest which looks like a stupid move since mitch is bigger is this your business
right in mitchs face what are you the morals police
he pushes again and mitch s hand shoots out like a snake striking
grabs him by the collar
a frozen moment more violence just a breath away and a sense of things about to spin out of control
our heros eyes are popping he tries to hide his fear take it easy m
she and i were just having some fun to our hero was it two hundred or five
i want to know what im worth
our hero gestures to mitch would you mind putting me down
mitch reluctantly obliges
our hero does his best to recollect his dignity
looks at slim
drops a ten on the table and smirks the bet was two but now that i know you
way too high
a pained look flashes across slims face our hero starts toward the door but mitch steps in his path
speaks quietly but with authority theres a physical power in his words
since hes protecting slim the power is dont come back here buddy
our hero nods nervously
mitch steps back inches just far enough to let our hero leave
which he does with considerable relief
slims leaning vs
the counter shaken tears in her eyes mitch tugs his baseball cap mutters as he heads for the door sorry to get in your business
he nods keeps going
blurts out grateful i
i cant believe you actually said something
turns shrugs if id kept my mouth shut ida felt bad later
good luck huh
he ambles out the door
a touch of the cowboy in him
she shakes her head looks at ginny
ginny gestures as if to say well
at first slim doesnt get it
ginny gestures more urgently come on
whatre you waiting for
she looks toward the door slim follows her look
push in on slims face as she tries to work up the courage
just as she starts toward the door we wedding photos
mitch has lots of surprisingly upper crust family slim has a few friends
the more photos flash the more pronounced and sad the contrast
fly right into bacchanalian dancing
french champagne has flowed shoes and inhibitions were abandoned hours ago
the camera weaves through the dancers to find slim and mitch dancing close never quite touching every move intense physical like subtle public sex
their eyes are locked she runs her veil down his body his hand lightly touches her ass they slow down and stand lips a millimeter apart but not quite kissing
the sexual tension building
we see how crazy they are about each other how completely physically involved and how much fun they have
watching them is phil with mitchs parents mrs
tyler confident at ease with her power and family money and likeable despite monstrous flaws and mr
tyler someone mrs
tyler married in a moment of cupidity
mitch was kind of
is her father dead too
dead to her
he left when she was two
well im happy to pay for the yes were very happy ignoring mr
its a way to build bridges
not that you can
repair all the damage when theres such a vast body of water
you dont get along with your son
she gives him a look
shes both offended by and appreciative of his bluntness
looks out at mitch hes like my father
which means i guess that hell do very well
hes done well to get miss slim
yes he has hasnt he
hes married down but hes gotten value
as phil reacts he notices his wife salima has joined him
with her are two kids and
salimas looking out at the floor not at slim but at ginny and her dance partner
we see a thought cross her mind
she bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids
they whoop their response run out to ginny who looks quite uncomfortable in her maid of honor dress
can we spend the night at phil and salimas house
ginny looks over winks at salima and kisses her kids dont eat at their ice cream huh
they squeal with pleasure and run off
ginny turns back resumes dancing with joe handsome in a casual way a good guy so this was during college or after
what was wrong with you
off his puzzled look i mean whyd you and slim break up
im terrible in bed
lets this hang for a moment for shock value then plus i dont know we just sort of
evolved into being friends
you were going the wrong direction bud
thats kinda what
thought but i guess i was so totally pathetic why am i not believing this
can i take you home right now
if youve got a sense of humor
my kids are out for the night and
another thing i live in chicago women always want the possibility of i didnt propose huh
i just want to have
looks at him
a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter
im your guy
she pulls him into a kiss and
well hes not a bad kisser
we glide from them to slim and mitch hardly moving
suddenly tender and insecure and almost comic she looks at him
you sure you love me
for ever and ever
he stops dancing
senses the real issue beneath her questions youre safe with me slim
youre safe and its okay to be happy
we deserve it
others stop to watch how cute
phil comes over waits
when they break im sorry i gotta get up five oclock to buy green beans
he slips an envelope into mitchs hand in my country its tradition to give money to groom
you dont need it but
slim shakes her head touched as thats very sweet thanks for giving me away okay
youre the best substitute dad a girl could possibly have
i am real thing
she kisses him and he goes
they look after him
he really loves you
she nods not quite picking up how odd his statement is of course he loves her she nicked him to give her away
mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress so the back of his hands touch her breasts is this going too far
he pulls her to him whispers you gonna give me babies
how soon can we get out of here
he hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor
applause from the guests
its a grand romantic gesture
you have to wonder if mitch is just a little too good to be true
slim months pregnant standson the walkway leading up to a large simple beautiful house
mitch is knocking at the door
the man who answers the door is white haired vigorous
looks like he walked out of a viagra ad
weve been driving around and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house
its great isnt it
we want to buy it
the home owners jaw drops as mitch gestures toward his bulging my wife wants it for our family
polite but firm well
were not selling
sure you are
mitch hands him a slip of paper
totally amiable thats the price
dont worry its well over market
stunned a little scared you
youre out of your mind
thats just it
so before you say no again think how miserable one determined crazy person can make you
miserable today miserable tomorrow miserable for every single day until the day you sell
we glimpse the home owners will just starting to crumble
your kids are grown youll be happier in a smaller place
move off the owners face
slow pan to the window of the house the sense that time is passing
and when we reach the window we see slim inside
move through the window
six weeks later
shes happily putting away groceries
whistling to herself
what we can see of the house feels good the furnishings are simple casual friendly
shes putting a bottle of oil up on a shelf
but it never quite gets there
her face changes
the hand holding the oil lowers
the oil bottle slips through her fingers and smashes on the floor
oil spreading across the floor
she stares at it
claws the air grabbing the cordless phone as she plops down on a kitchen barstool
starts to cry
punches the autodialer
its slim is he there
water is flooding down the barstool shes miscarried
well will you please just
just tell him im sorry okay
a central area with large offices surrounding it guys in women
all moving quickly purposefully
two uniformed cops come out of a room putting envelopes into their pockets
models photos charts and timelines when the concretes going to be poured when the inspector comes etc
mitch is building mini malls
in the center of this activity mitch moves from one locus of energy to the next answering questions making suggestions
gradually we perceive something motion slower than the rest of the office
coming toward him
he sees her
sees her expression
he realizes you saw the doctor
its so obvious from her face that she barely needs tosay it i lost this one too
slim lies in bed
very pale a light dust of sweat
we assume shes between contractions
mitchs face inches from hers smothering her with kisses
the nurse brings the baby in starts to give her to slim can i hold her
the nurse looks at slim
who nods and gives mitch the baby
he kisses her head dances with her
slim looks adoringly at father and daughter the sight is almost unbelievably sweet
his cell phone rings
he keeps dancing ignoring it
after one ring it stops
hes kissing the babys head over and over just like he kissed slim and staring into the infants eyes she looks just like my baby pictures
his cell phone rings again
as if the previous call had been a signal
slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing
with some difficulty juggling the baby he turns the phone off
but he doesnt look at slim
who was that
i dont know
some construction thing i guess
she stares at him
he stares at the baby
isnt she the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life
slim nods cautiously
remains of a picnic
slims playing with their daughter gracie now
says something and gracie laughs
keeps laughing which really gets gracie going
mitch looks on tries to join in but its forced and besides that theyre not even looking at him not inviting his laughter its all between the mother and child
so he stops trying
just watches them
and before his eyes they become for an instant strangers
as this reaction and the subtle hostility it engenders flicker across his face slim looks up at him for one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf between
then gracie says something
slim turns back toward her the girls are laughing again
and mitch is not
glass opaque streaked with water and soap so as to give a slightly freaky aspect
starts to take off her clothes
should i join you
im about to get out
down to her panties oh
i have to go to back to work im just doing this to wake myself up
starts to go sorry
shes in the bedroom now
its underlit full of shadows
in scary movie nomenclature shes exposed vulnerable it feels like someones going to leap out and attack her at any not this time
she throws on shorts and a t shirt she looks in on gracie sleeping peacefully
shes washing dishes bored humming to herself
the counters covered with take out food containers she didnt cook
not beeping just humming slightly she wouldnt even hear it except its on the tile counter
sounds vaguely like a vibrator
lying there just a few feet from her
with mitchs wallet and keys his cell phone
she looks at it
knows she shouldnt
decides not to
hands methodically on a dishtowel
picks up the pager
she stares realizing its code
she looks at the cell phone
looks toward the hall
we hear the shower still running
she picks up his cell phone
tentatively shes not sure this will work she presses recall
the phone flashes name but instead of a name theres
she stares at this glances again down the hall takes a deep breath
and presses send
you just paged my husband right
who are you whats your name
im sorry i its too late to deny it
tell me your name a rustle on the other end dont hang upl dont be a cowardl silence
just your name
thats the least you could do dont you think
a simple plea one woman to another
not only the name
now we hear it in the accent shes french
slim goes into slow motion
how oddly her arm moves downward
she looks at the phone
scans the room as if shes never seen it before
one of gracies toys lies on the floor
slim stares at it
reaches down to pick it up but instead of the toy moving up her body moves down
she slumps to the floor
slim sitting on the floor
mitch comes out dressed sees her
she doesn t say anything
he approaches her
some instinct keeps him from speaking
he sees shes holding his phone the silly toy
how can you do this to gracie
he doesnt say anything
darcelle paged you
that s where youre going right
off his silence yeah
can you please
can you sit here with me
she doesnt know where to start how to talk about it
she isnt important
i couldnt stand for this to
destroy our lives im happy ive really been happy and i dont want to give that up you wont have to
shes nothing shes no one you
you said i was safe with you
you are slim
they fall into an embrace
we feel how keenly they need each other
begin tight on them
at first it seems like this is the same embrace shot from a different angle
then we see were in the kitchen his briefcase is at his side their clothes are different
we watch slims expression slowly change
she whispers i smell her
darcelle or whoever
intense sad how many mitch
how many are there
how many have there been
what does it matter
a stunning statement
even more stunning because of the casual way he says it
id i mean whatre you saying here that i dont deserve to get laid
im a man slim
with the pregnancies gracie you dont have time and energy like you used to and i understand that i really do
men and women have different needs and thats okay
darcelle is willing to take care of it and maybe thats better for everybody
he contemplates his answer
calm down slim wild violently invading his space and assaulting his authority screaming at him her face just inches from his i cant do this anymore
just take it and take it and take it
im not strong enough
i dont know who would be
i love you okay
i love you and im your wife and you cant do this
you understand me
with the same speed he attacked our hero at the diner mitchs hand shoots out like a snake striking
a warning stop it and stop it now
her face shock
she raises her hand to her cheek
touches her skin where his fist landed
he reads her expression and is almost amused what i cant hit you
low strong no
he hits her again this time with a closed fist
knocking her to the ground
stands over her like a boxer
sees rase flare across her face you want to fight
im a mom honey its no contest
shes silent but we see very small her reaction oh yeah
you have to understand slim
i thought you did make the money here so i set the rules right
its my rules
he waits for her response but again shes silent
you with me
its your rules
she keeps her voice meek so as not to offend and if i dont like the rules
if you dont like them
she nods cautiously
life isnt onl stuff we like
we take the good with the bad right
thats what life is what marriage is
so maybe for you today is a bad day
tomorrow may be great
tomorrow may be great
tomorrow will be great
he appears to miss her inference
today is the price you pay for having such a good life
she stares at him
im going out
she says nothing
this is gonna be better dont you think
she just cannot process the absurdity of this statement
i dont have to sneak around pretend im going to work
i can just say im going to darcelles ill be back in a few hours
her face is completely blank
he bends down gives her a kiss on the head
we feel her skin crawl
she watches him go
hears the front door close
she gets up walks to the window watches him walk toward his car
she turns away looks at the room
we hear his car start
she goes to the phone
starts to dial slowly deliberately
shock rap at the window
she reacts with guilt but he doesnt look angry now
behind him is his idling mercedes convertible drivers door open
he motions for her to open the window
who you calling
whatre you gonna tell her
im supposed to bring gracie tomorrow
maybe i better cancel
i was thinking
you know that i adore you but if you ever want
if you want out
for a second he cant talk
hes choked up
she watches coldly
his emotion appears real but who cares
i really will
but theres one thing you cant have gracie
shes my daughter
dont even think about taking her
slim stares at him
he adds calmly if i see that thought even cross your mind ill kill you
hes said what he needs to
he walks toward his car
she shuts the window
stares after him
in an odd and defiant way she starts to whistle
almost daring him
he keeps walking
close on her face almost inside her skin a visual symphony
the countryside behind her is out of focus a blur
she pulls up at a gate punches in a code
drives up a long a driveway to four jaguars lined up
at a respectful distance sit an old toyota the maids car and a pick up the gardeners truck
slim parks near the truck
her hand moves to the door handle but she cant bring herself to open it
paralyzed a failure
in this prolonged pause mrs
tyler bursts out of the house youre late youre late i was worried you wouldnt comet looks realizes no gracie
slim shakes her head
tyler is clearly disappointed but quickly covers it up well then you and i will have a girls luncheon and gossip about simply everybody
shes about to hurtle into the gossip when slim turns her head and mrs
tyler sees and we see for the first time the result of mitchs brutality a nasty bruise on slims cheek
tylers face falls as she realizes what this means
underneath it all shes a warm person she hugs slim oh baby
oh baby im so sorry
hold a moment like a mother daughter tableau
her tone stays sympathetic not at all accusatory what did you do
whatd you say to him
on her sad shocked reaction ginny in the middle of an intense rap
she and slim are wedged in a corner booth
the off season lunch rush has died down
men are land mines
some you trigger the first week others its years in
problem is you want a man man meaning his veins run thick with testosterone which is good cause he can fuck your brains out but he can also turn around
no warning and beat your brains out too
i never touch salima
ginny waves at him of course not
but the other part first part i can do that relax phil
nobodys talkin about your dick here okay
phil brings slim an iced tea and slice of pie you went to cops i hope
dont be stupid
mitch is in construction phil
he knows every cop in the city
even if he didnt
she got a restraining order
when it was up this slimeball beat her into a coma
if he wants to put her in coma why worry restraining order
cause hes a man phil
calmly to slim youre leaving him today
shakes her head trapped i gotta pick up gracie at pre school
three year old girls running toward a car squealing
theyre all blond and adorable and it takes a moment for us to realize none of them is gracie
slim sits in her car in the pick up line
the four girls get in the volvo station wagon in front of her
the volvo pulls out and slim moves to the front of the line
the very hip pre school director smiles at slim your husband got her
gracie was totally psyched
i told him he should do it more often
slim nods with feigned casualness and pulls away
slight smile frozen on her face
she pulls in
no other car there
she looks around
nothing abnormal except the quiet
as if theyve gone and are never coming back
she digs out her cell phone punches the first number on the automatic dialer
after one ring she disconnects
immediately presses recall then send
how is my little croissant
its your loaf of bread
cheerful no guilt oh
hows it going
where are you
why didnt you tell me you were going to pick up gracie i called you at home left messages hes interrupted by a loud squeal from gracie followed by a
question which he answers your mom
hey moml the elephants are peeing
pleased with himself for being a good dad shes a little excited
when are you coming home
its scary that mitch will have this conversation in front of gracie whos playing at their feet it made me nervous when i couldnt reach you
he stares at her
his voice so soft and calm do you have any idea how bad things can get
embarrassed to say it slim
im a determined person
i was determined to have you and i did
i am and always will be a person who gets what he wants
you can either share in my success or leave us meaning him and gracie right now
which way you wanna go
i want to be happy
hes not sure of her subtext but hes willing to give her the benefit of the doubt good
with a sudden shock slim sees gracie staring at mitch the girl has picked up on his tone
slim glances at mitch to see if he notices gracies expression
slim looks back at gracie still staring at mitch
if she already senses whats happening how long before shes affected by it
how long before she sees mitch become violent
slims jaw tightens slightly her resolve grows stronger
mitch asleep slim awake listening
his breathing deep rhythmic slight hint of a snore
in the distance a dove coos
she looks at her clock
she eases out of bed
goes into the bathroom
we hear the sound of her peeing
shes no peeing
a bottle is propped up running water into the toilet as slim gets dressed
she leans out the bathroom doorway sees hes still asleep
she moves quickly bathroom to hall
gracies fast asleep
slim lifts her up piles her prized teddy bear on top
slim carries gracie toward the entrance
we move with her
shes silent terrified
glances over her shoulder no one there
she keeps walking
the eerie sense of a house thats awake rather than asleep
the almost imperceptible but anxiety provoking swoosh of her footsteps
extend the suspense as long as we possibly can
she reaches the front door
waits to make sure all is quiet
she turns looks back down the hall
reaches toward the doorknob
hand closer closer
she starts to turn it ginny phil and teddy are clustered under a tree staring at the house
their van is parked down the road
we expect the front door to open any instant
not knowing where slim was
but we know
did something go wrong
slim was right at the door
in a casual way her rescuers start to wonder
maybe she didnt hear the signal
she heard it
she could still be asleep shes not asleep okay
shes coming out any second
she does not come out
ginny shakes her head looks at her watch
do it again
cups his hands coos like a dove
they wait again
slim still frozen in exactly the same spot
still carrying gracie still with her hand on the knob
turning her head this way that way
she hears the cooing dove noise come again from outside
that settles it
she pulls the door grabs her catches her catches gracie pulling slims hair hard leading her away from the door the three rescuers still wait
phil shakes his head
we see a baseball bat in his hands
we better go in
itd be crazy to wake him
if anythings wrong shell flick the lights
phil nods skeptically and ginny herself doesnt seem so sure
they look at the house and wait
we want to scream go in
was that a sound from inside
they go on alert
listen more closely
but hear nothing unusual
looks at ginny shrugs ginny shrugs back flash of light then darkness
they run toward the house scream
intense horrible spit of sound replaced by an even more horrible silence
close on ginny as they run as if weve lost slim and ginnys
our new protagonist
as we near the house we realize its not silence
there are sounds from inside almost inaudible thuds
sound of a beating
on ginnys horrified reaction baseball bat
phil smashes a window
they climb through the hole into the house silence
they move quickly carefully toward the living room its very dark we can hardly another step and youre dead
mitch emerges from darkness
light glints off his pistol
thirty feet behind him gracies sleeping on the couch
mitch moves and they stare in horror
lying at his feet is slims body
pain springs from ginnys throat she rushes to slim mitch rams the gun into her head didnt you hear me
i ginny feels slims pulse says to phil shes alive unless you go your brains be on imy rug i sir
we are three people
if you kill us all you will go sure to electric chair
i could give a shit
slim makes a sound as ginny strokes her head
mitch fires the gun into the wall over ginnys head
muffled sound silencer
but he has everyones attention now this is your last chance
we are happy to leave sir with miss slim and gracie
ginnys helping slim to her knees
and make no mistakes
if you keep them here we will go to police who will arrest you with pleasure
mitch stares at phil
walks to him
is he going to hit him
mitch leans in gun to phils head and whispers i dont want to say this in front of the group but youre just a rug head nobodyll believe you
you go to the cops its her word against mine
theyll find drugs in her bureau
before phil can laugh or her car whatever
trust me on that
casual confident ill have custody of gracie by the end of the week
and if we take them away you will shoot all four of us
then we die young
the others are uncertain but phil helps slim up teddy joins him
ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up gracie
this is no good
youre humiliating him
a little louder hell come after me and kill me
mitch overhears this smiles
you hear that
thats why she loves me
off their horrified looks nobody cares like i do
the others stare at him in astonishment but continue toward the door
mitch leans toward slim whispers see you soon
gracie awake now in slims arms staring confused
gentle rocking of the van
the others barely visible like shadows
gracie asleep slim holding her
blinds down movie playing
despite gracies age the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a madonna and child
open air market shops stalls yuppie heaven
slim carries gracie on her shoulders
theyre with jog her old boyfriend from the wedding
horsing around having a good time gracie eating a pastry
they stop and look out at lake michigan
whattaya think toots
its a big ocean
its only a lake but we like it
nods stares out
can we stay here a while
theyre driving along suddenly joe says coming up whattaya say
bobbing for apples
slim front seat and gracie back both drop their heads so they cant be seen from outside the car joe turns the corner presses a garage door opener and drives
into the basement garage of a nice looking plex
they come in from the garage throw off their coats
all the curtains in the apartment are drawn
is there anybody who likes ice cream
gracie whoops the doorbell rings slim and joe freeze slim whips her hand over gracies mouth gracie looks horrified why are you covering my slim puts her finger to her
she takes gracies hand they scurry out of sight joe hurries to the stereo puts it on
music to cover gracies whoop
he goes to the door looks through the peep hole
sees a large man in a suit
can we talk
he holds up an i
not readable through the peep hole
would you mind opening up
joe glances over his shoulder no sign of them
he opens the door but not far enough to let the man in
behind the large man are two other men in suits
were investigating a kidnapping wed like to look around
you got a search warrant
oh we got a warrant all right
he slaps a paper and pushes past joe the other men follow
can i she the warrant
first fbi man ignores this
whore you looking for
the fbi man gives him a sarcastic glance
a mother taking her own child isnt kidnapping
i dont think youre fbi at all
this elicits no response
joe moves to where he can see the other two guys
looks down the hall toward second fbi man searching the pantry looking around
he opens the door to the garage and vanishes third fbi man looks under the bed in the closets
yanks clothes aside
at any moment we expect him to find them
mister unless you leave right now im calling the police
thats a scary thought
joe picks up the phone first fbi man slams it down
i marri a cop okay
im not in the mood
joe accepts this
but only for the moment
second fbi man looks in the car under the car
isnt this the logical place for them to hide
third fbi man returns from the bedroom emptyhanded starts to search the living room ill look around here
the second fbi man returns from the garage starts to search
were scared with every cupboard he opens that hell find them
third fbi man searches the room
suddenly we go to slims pov
she and gracie are in a cabinet looking out through a narrow horizontal slit
watching the third fbi man makes his way methodically in their direction
first fbi man stands over joe keeping him silent
joe watches the third fbi man search the room
and then joe blinks
moves his eyes and looks right in slims direction
he realizes where they must be hiding
the third fbi mans getting closer and closer to them
joe realizes he has to do something
abruptly joe stands thats enough
you hear me
its time to go
off first fbis
shocked look i know who you are okay
i know who hired you
first fbi man whirls
suddenly hes got a knife in his hand
definitely not fbi
knife to joes throat yeah
you know what it feels like to have a knife hit your carotid
trying not to move no
inside the cabinet gracie gasps
slim puts a hand over her mouth
but slim herself has to fight the impulse to burst out of there to save joe you know what its like to bleed out in less than two minutes
stopping his search oh please john boy
not the shiv im just going to cut him a little slims eyes bulge you are not going to cut him
i sure as hell am
slims on the verge of bursting out when second fbi enters john boy this is not listed on the program
come on theyre not here lets ride
cant i just cut him a little no
no slice and dice
they head for the door
as he goes first fbi man a
john boy runs his knife along the couch spilling out its contents
passes the tv set and stabs the tube
runs his knife along the wall making a vicious scary mark
and they vanish
we hear the door slam
the horizontal band through which slim was looking widens the cabinet door falls open slim and gracie come out
slim hugs her says to joe jesus are you okay
feels his neck i needed a shave anyway
the phone rings
they look at it
it cant be who they think it is
it rings again
joe goes to it
this is mitch tyler joe
hello yes how are you
joe points at phone its him
he nods toward gracie indicating slim should take her into the next room
calm friendly i assume slims called you
joe thinks for a split second then of course
will you give her a message
off his silence if she calls again i mean
slim and gracie are in the next room but slims looking through the door back at joe
i dont know
im on her side here not yours
come on joe youre a smart person
let me say two words okay
you dont want to worry theyre loose every time you get in your car
and how bout the windows to your apartment are they still locked
a person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that
tell her to call her friends
joe hangs up
slim comes back out
he scare you
joe shakes his head more at mitch than in answer to her question
i shouldnt be here sure you should im dangerous to know right now
calm forceful slim
you can be here anytime
they both know what hes saying if hes willing to take this kind of risk hes either a very good friend which he is or hes still in love with
her which he is also
he said you should call your friends
at the restaurant
slim on the phone listening as the phone rings
and again again
joe watching her concerned
finally awright already
we had to clear the customers out some ridiculous bomb threat what

runt they step out
the restaurant is at the end of a long pier
ginny turns skeptically to the overweight phil can you run
like michael jackson
as they sprint sort of toward the boardwalk its michael johnson phil
but i run like michael jackson
and he kind of does arms flailing not quite connected to his body
just as when were enjoying this comic sight explosion behind them theyre thrown toward camera debris flying everywhere they lie on the
are they dead or just stunned
slowly they raise their heads
look back at the restaurant starting to go up in flames
slim holding her phone
peculiar expression on her face
the line went dead
joe stares at her concerned
she presses redial and we hear the phone start to ring
she goes to the window parts the curtain outside in the street the fbi men sit in their car no answer on the phone
slim looks at joe and shakes her head this isnt good
slim walking a crowded street carrying gracie transamerica pyramid in the b
slim goes down an alley behind a converted warehouse enters a basement garage
one floor lots of windows lots of attractive young people in jeans working on lots of different projects
sign on the wall says v
viet cong venture capital
a blond girl nudges jupiter slakowski ponytail handsome confident hey jupe

jupiter gives slim and gracie a skeptical look
i know you dont want to see me or know about me but i am desperate i had nowhere else to go

he shrugs affably and leads her into his office its a good gig
to claim im your father

when mom died i wrote you you didnt answer
i didnt have enough money to bury her that was really fun
dont look at me i didnt kill her

perfunctory to gracie hi
gracie looks at him skeptically nods
and yes we need money
from to like i had maybe kids
it was like a joke to me
its like a joke to me too
youre the third to show up here with a hand out
i give all of you the same thing

she goes leaving the on the table
he pockets it
slim stands behind jupiters building
in the shadows
still carrying gracie
its only after we hear gracie dont cry mom
please dont cry
that we realize slim is crying
you have mtg
slim and gracie climb off the train and are immediately shepherded away by two swarthy men in hawaiian shirts wait
one of the swarthy men speaks to slim but in the flurry we cant hear it
she looks relieved turns to gracie but before slim can speak their bags are thrown in the trunk of a car and theyre pushed into the back seat the car
speeds off whips into a left hand turn now the car makes a right hand turn and a truck pulls out blocking traffic so no one can follow them slim looks out the back sees the trucks maneuver
turns to face forward again
tries to meet the drivers eyes
where are we going
the driver answers her in a middle eastern language
gracie looks alarmed
its okay sweetheart theyre friends of phils
gracie plays as slim talks to ginny and phil
the cars parked below
phil gestures toward the driver whoe standing guard
so secret we dont even know who this man is or where he takes you
youre not afraid to help me
in my country people bleed their enemies to death out of their genitals
this is for roasting lamb
no letters slim but you can call must be very short
phil ceremonially hands her a thin envelope
she looks inside
and clearly finds money no
phil wait a minute i i have insurance from fire i know but i will not discus okay
we are family
ginny takes her hand
what about the police
do they mr
mitch of course he has beautiful alibi
slim nods again
looks at ginny
whos been working up to you know i keep having a bad idea
the first time he hit you we saw your bruises
second time he beat you unconscious
the next time
if you should fight back defend yourself and he dies
whod convict you
this is american law
l i called my cousin hes some shit for brains lawyer over in tarzana he says its shed walk self defense justifiable homicide
thats good on a race horse gin but for gracie

ginny nods reluctantly
shes not sure the subject is closed

gracie whispers mom

mustapha working at one desk erin at another
gracie on the floor coloring

people being served from a large pot
erin and gracie each get a good portion of something that looks quite unusual
looks at it whispers what j it
erin works at her desk
gracie shoots paper basketballs into the wastebasket
stops as mustapha enters
he gives erin an open fedex pack
fedex is like underground railroad
erin is stunned
she looks inside the package finds another fedex pack
inside it is a wrapped present and note
she reads dear daughter cont
jupiters at his desk as the three fbi men are shown in
he says something gracious to them
a moment they dont respond
then one of them speaks
whatever hes saying produces a subtle but profound change on jupiters features
yesterday three men threatened to kill me if i helped you in any way
fortunately for you this aroused my interest
erin opens the present and finds cash
probably a couple thousand dollars
she fights the impulse to cry
im sending this via your former boss
if you get it and need more leave word at my office
arab men carrying in a couch as erin watches
erin hanging sheets over the windows makeshift curtains

erin approaches betty director of the pre school excuse me betty
hi im erin shleeter i called you oh hi this is my daughter

erin shrugs thats my daughter
erin cutting her hair in some odd primitive way that further changes her look
for the worse
the african american woman who works there watches erin exit the bathroom and put away the scissors
not a whatever youre goin for girl youre really getting there
erin driving nervous
gracie queen e
is turned around in her seat looking out the back he is not yes he is mom he turned

or we can go to mcdonalds
we cant afford to eat out every night
i can cook tootster
rolls her eyes as hi
off her blank look im brad zall i just rented a car from you guys
erin stares at him
an insane moment of sustained paranoia
who is this guy
what does he want
finally she realizes a normal response is required
kind of a is the vehicle all right
yeah its fine
i was just thinking that if youre not doing anything maybe i could buy you and the kid of course who are you
who sent you
you want a date
you are totally out of your mind if you think im gonna have even this conversation were having right now
im not okay
we are not talking
yeah i get it
and good luck with your psychotherapy
he walks away
she stares after him
again queen e
is looking at her mother in astonishment
youre thinking i over reacted
just a little
erin driving too fast
her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene
shes also eating doughnuts sharing a box with her daughter
they pass a gas station
sees pay phones
you know mom
i like the doughnuts and all but the driving
dont get on my case
every sunday to drive for hours
in exasperation erin gestures with both hands taking them off the wheel
nothing bad happens but again her recklessness makes us nervous its not just to reach some phone booth
hey can i call daddy this time
please please please
erin shakes her head
gives her a mournful look
you look like a dog
erin is on the phone queen e
at her side
oh thank god
mitch is planning some legal action youre depriving him of his rights as a father some nonsense like that you better have gracie call him
oh thats good news i thought youd want to know i do thanks i appreciate it
listen we have to keep it short again or he might trace it so i better put her on hands phone to hi grandma
i have a new name
as erin frowns
you wanna hear it
erin pushes down the lever ending the call mutters sorry your majesty
remember namesre secret
puts on her mournful look
that is the most pitiful expression ive ever seen
she listens cradling the phone
erin watches her daughters face light up hi daddy
were having a great vacation
i dont know
at a phone booth somewheres
erin shakes her head takes the receiver away no questions okay
or it ends now
hands phone back to queen e
just tell him you love him and say goodbye okay
nods puts the receiver to her ear
even erin can hear mitch yelling
s face changes
mitch keeps shouting angrily
she did not say i love you
she hands erin the receiver
erin hangs it up
i am really really sad
erin nods angry at herself sorry kid
mitch hands up his cordless phone picks up another line
i know mine was too short but she made other calls right
or my mother
he crosses to a map with colored pins
sticks in another one good
keep it up
hangs up goes to intercom isnt he here yet
great yeah send him in
to our shock the person who enters is the man previously known as our hero
robbie real name and mitch are good buddies hey
look will you tell whats his face lieutenant harris i bought his miata i paid for his rec room can he please keep his patrolmen from hassling my guys
you got me on a sunday for that
i could be out shaking down wetbacks

ease it up
walks to map pins she made calls from these places shes that stupid

shes not stupid okay
it says on the net it takes seconds to trace a call she keeps hers well under
of course your equipment is faster
youre welcome youre welcome
drawing on map okay say she lives within a two hour radius
erin and queen e
the sauce is unusual colors grey and orange
pokes politely at her plate
erin is understandably insecure about her cooking what do you think is it okay
its okay right
no its not its horrible
its not horrible mom
but its not good is it
is it good
mom you tasted it
erin pushes her plate back
its too much
in a second silent tears are flooding down her face
this is not what queen e
wants to see
and she certainly doesnt want to reverse roles by giving comfort
better just to pretend its not happening
know what i think
tries to pull whats that
i think you miss daddy
this comment is so wacko that its almost touching
she feels compelled to be honest daddy yells at me toots
you miss somebody
joe gets off a plane with his carry on luggage goes to a bank of pay phones examines the numbers on the phones
when one of these phones rings he picks it up sorry my plane was delayed queen e
is hitting stones with a baseball bat as erin talks on the phone rent a car make sure youre not followed drive to the taos airport
in taos go to starbucks
not the main one or the one by hagen dazs
the one near the book store
joe shakes his head amused what is this a treasure hunt
im gonna spend the whole weekend flying around
ill call starbucks in three hours
dont worry youll be here by four
he hangs up
erin and queen e
look out the window at a small prop plane which is starting to unload passengers
i tell you its this one
no hes not
shes looking at some other passengers who have already entered through another gate and are walking past them
that ones from reno
turns back sees him there
joel she waves
joe waves back
but thats not what were looking at
looking at robbie walking slowly toward them with the other reno passengers
he doesnt see erin but in a moment he will
hell turn the dogleg corner and be right next to them
robbie pulls out his boarding pass
with it are old photos of erin and queen e
he shuffles past the photos finds his claim check
hes now only a few feet away from them
and theyre oblivious of him
and he turns the little dogleg and looks at them except theyre no longer there
theyve moved toward the unloading area for joes gate
and robbie goes safely past as joe enters the terminal sees them shakes his head i can guarantee one thing in my lifetime i was not followed
he embraces erin and queen e
the camera looks past them to where robbie might be watching
erin and queen e
are pointing out sights passing an old and theres the diner where i do not work
where do you work
erin gives him a look shes not telling
she resumes the tour points to an old crumbling movie palace theres the one plex
pointing again at a the aan restaurant where youd take me if we were dating
for queen e
which we are not
very fast like an old routine we see how they play together no way
not at all
just friends right gracie
sorry your highness
erin pulls up in front of their house gestures here it is
continuing the tour theyre showing him and this is the guest bedroom
he comes in looks around
clearly queen e
has painted the walls herself its a modern art mesa
normally known as buckingham palace
nods checks it out very
you better warn him huh
erin whispers in her daughters ear and she confides in joe oh yeah
the dreams in here get really noisy
joe sets his suitcase down
i look forward to that
joe pitching underhand to queen e
hes using plastic balls the size of soccer balls so its easy for her to hit every one
erin is running retrieving the hits
freeze frame as shes caught in a photograph
the image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames photographs of her some wide some tight
no one taking their picture
a stand of green bushes
hold on the bushes for a moment queen e
is curled on a blanket taking a nap as erin and joe finish the picnic
you seem like youre doing great
how long can you stand it
off her look i mean not to talk to your friends or family or have anything to do with your real life
quiet strong gracie is safe
yeah but what now mitch started some kind of custody battle
what are you denise
there he is standing right over them in bad clothes and a baseball cap dark glasses
youre denise right
used to work at the pack n ship
im not denise
you look but youre right your voice
isnt youre not from new zealand are you
never been there
sorry to bother you folks
he backs away embarrassed
joe stares after him warily
we call pack n ship see if denise ever worked there because of some homeless guy
joe it could be the packnship in trenton new jersey
over his protest one thing i learned i cant jump every time someone says boo
i cant do that to her
joe looks at queen e
but why do we need this establishing shot
its very existence in the narrative is menacing
joe gets up from queen e
s bed and goes into the kitchen
gets some juice from the fridge drinks it
looks into erins bedroom
erin is awake queen e
asleep at her side
half whisper gracie was right
off her look bout the dreams in there
yeah mine too
as he gets into bed you remember the house rules
with gracie here
who can forget
they hold hands
you ever think about what wouldve happened
if you and i had
what do you think
i think gracie is truly a great kid and any path that doesnt include her doesnt make any sense
ginny told me about that weekend
of your wedding
she tell you how terrible i was
it might work on other people but you forget ive actually had you i didnt forget like a compliments coming and im telling you from memory
you are not that bad
they both laugh
it subsides into affection
you really go tomorrow
couldnt you quit your job and stay here and play the horses or something and become independently wealthy
please kiss me slim
i know were not supposed to its against house rules and all but for me to come all this way and feel the way i do and for us to
not even she kisses him and he kisses back
and they stop
incredible self control
lie next to each other hold hands again
youre a great person slim
youre a great person just like your daughter
she squeezes his hand
the camera lingers for a moment on this sweet image
then pulls suddenly back so were seeing their hands from outside through a crack in the window
you can runs s s from an odd distance across the street we watch erin dropping off queen e
extend the mundane details of this transaction
three days later t
sticks her head in to erin i know you have a back room gig but with sher out four customers i need help here im on meltdown
past a tree through the windows
as erin comes warily out to the counter looks over the customers
erin working a calculator muttering in frustration
here lemme do that
wrestles with the calculation erin looks up
frowns slightly her eyes shift
she senses something
this strange sensation as if shes being watched or
she looks out the window doesnt see anyone
glances into the back office and notices the clock
runs for door oh my godl the queen is out of dance class
ill be back in we watch from across the street as erin hurries to her taurus gets in and drives away
erin in line for pick up
betty the pre school director comes up to erin and says casually erin
im glad youre here
we cant find queen elizabeth you cant find her
so many kidsre staying for these after school things she turns distracted as another teacher calls n erin blinks
looks around frantically
other kids in gym or dance gear but no queen e
and the knowledge of whats happened is hitting her
her eyesre dilating breathing becoming frantic
betty turns back as erin mutters i shouldve
i shouldve known
he did it before
she rams the car in gear rockets out of the pick up line almost hits a teacher and year old kid slams the breaks calls im sorry im sorry i
freaked out frantic she pulls to the side of the road yanks up her brake grabs her cell phone
double a rent did queen elizabeth call
no of course not anyone else
nobody called erin are you okay
erin presses stop then auto dial waits looks around
betty staring at her like shes crazy walking toward her car hi
leave a message
gracie are you there
is anyone there
no one picks up
she beats the wheel in frustration
lowers her head
for one long second she seems completely beaten
a knock on her window she looks up sees betty
bettys talking but its as if erin has gone crazy
for a moment theres no sound and then the sound is there but unintelligible and finally the words and sounds come together what ive been trying to tell you
erin nodding now beginning to grasp the words
at the end of dance class the teacher lets them go hide and for a minute no one could find her erin looks past betty sees queen e
in her tutu and leaps out of her car thank you thank you i
ill explain later i
she rushes forward wraps queen e
in a big not quite appropriate hug
looks at her as if to say this is nice mom but will you please tell me what gives
from a distance we watch erin and queen e
trudge toward their taurus
the end of the day theyre tired
making meat loaf
erin consults the cookbook seems confused puts meat breadcrusts eggs sauces onions etc
in a bowl
mooshes them with her fingers a disgusting tactile job which she adores
improvise dialog to make the scene utterly mundane two girls having fun
the normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous
sleeping peacefully in her bed
erin also sleeping peacefully
we observe her from a slight distance to the left of the bed as we face it
slowly the camera begins to move
down the bed
to the foot
to the other side
back again on erin sleeping peacefully
and the camera rises to show mitch seated at her side
he seems calm and utterly content
it would be hard to imagine a more terrifying attitude
erin wakes with a start sits up looks around everythings normal
erin shakes her head as if clearing away a dream
as she looks again around the room her nostrils flare slightly
as if she smells him
she rubs her nose
touches her wrist and we notice something shes worn the whole time shes been erin a colorful elastic bracelet probably a swatch
she gets out of bed and looks out the window cold morning she goes toward the hall
moving down the hall
each open door feels like a trap ready to spring
she glances into queen elizabeths room
we half expect some sort of reaction or exclamation queen e
may be gone but instead erin keeps right on going
vanishes into the bathroom
hold the empty hall
hear the sound of her peeing
from the doorway we see her on the potty
the window over her head is open slightly
as she pees she stares at the shower curtain it rustles slightly in the wind from the window
she wipes herself
still staring at the curtain
she stands pulls up her pajamas
yanks the shower curtain aside nothing
she goes into the kitchen
she puts on the kettle
drinks a little o
from a carton
walks back down the hall in every moment of this the tension is excruciating
facing her as she comes down the hall passing the living room doorway
we wait for mitch to leap out at her he doesnt
she keeps coming past queen es erin starts to scream looks toward queen e
and stifles the sound
the only sounds are grunts banging vs
hes far too strong for her they slam against one wall the other crash to the floor wanna know a secret
whispering to her his hands moving to her neck
cops need a body
without your body theyll think you disappeared again
her hands at his hands clawing trying to pry them loose which is kind of true
one of her hands moves away from his hands to that swatch or whatever it is on her wrist cause where youre going they will never
she turns the gizmo so it points away from her face
toward his face
at the last instant he realizes what she must be doing but its too late
she presses a button orange spray hits his face eyes he screams and releases her she leaps up and sees queen e
standing in her doorway
staring mute and horrified
how long was she watching
erin grabs queen e
and runs down the hall
mitch writhes on the floor erin bursts out the back door whirls pulls a rope causing a slab of by to slide over the door primitive locking device she sprints
for her taurus
still in her pajamas still carrying queen e
her car has a number pad on the drivers door
she punches numbers opens the door puts queen e
in pulls a key from under the mat fires the car up rockets away down the block so far back were not even sure it means anything a chevy suburban
pulls away from the curb
parked in back near dumpsters
erin jumps out of the taurus runs around to the trunk pulls out a small suitcase
erin and queen e
pulling clothes from the suitcase getting dressed
a frantic blur of pajamas and underwear and suitcase and the last thing we expect to see knock at the window
erin whirls looks
for an instant time slows as she stares at him
flashback to the diner his face she recognizes him and realizes hes with mitch
which means mitch was phony from the moment she met him robbie reaches for her door handle she rams the accelerator leaving robbie behind the car rockets forward toward the
dumpsters she spins the wheel the car swerves kisses off the dumpster robbie running for his car and now we see the chevy suburban hidden behind some nearby bushes the taurus pogos over the concrete grass divider rockets across the next parking lot
robbie jumping into his suburban erin half in half out of her clothing trying to drive trying to see sticking out her arm to keep queen e
not in her seatbelt from flying through the windshield
seatbelti seatbelti put on your trying to put it on then slow down so i i cant slow who was that guy
looks in rear view i dont know some
sees robbie chasing them oh shit
three brief flashes of erin being chased out of the city
freaked out to drive so fast queen e
robbies suburban right behind them closer closer
finally slams into their taurus knocking them half off the road
he pushes them off again again queen e
covering her eyes erin coming back onto the road fighting to keep control and the road narrowing more and more down to one tight lane
this looks like totally the wrong place to be leading someone
up ahead is a one lane covered bridge crossing over a stream
the bridge is very narrow
mom are you sure
quite sure thank you
erin guns the accelerator
driving confident full of blood lust and then his expression changes
he realizes shit
that the bridge is way too narrow for erin is car slides through scraping one side the suburban crashes into the bridge careens into the water queen e
looks back through the rear view mirror
looks at her mother
back and forth
that was dangerous
different country road
parked ahead is a oldsmobile
erin pulls in behind it
they get out of the taurus
using her keys erin unlocks the trunk of the olds
two large suitcases inside
erin throws their small suitcase in on top
erin reaches up under the drivers seat and pulls out a wallet
checks the contents cash credit cards
pulls a red wig out of the glove compartment
theyre on a lightly travelled two lane highway
erin now a redhead looks in her rear view mirror no cars
we can talk
stares at her mutely
want me to tell you what happened
blinks twice shakes her head
one thing though erins over
i liked erin
slim nods sadly she liked erin too
youre not the queen of england anymore either
gracie nods fatalistically stares out the window
flat voice im hungry
gracie eating voraciously
slim has no appetite
their waitress comes over notices slims not eating everything okay here
hey there cutie whats your name
gracie looks up at her for a while
im working on that one
the waitress does a double take and leaves
to slim maybe something normal this time
ann or mary or
sees slim is distracted mom
yeah i can hear it
as she starts to get out she says to gracie anybody talks to you hit the horn
slim in line at a county recorders desk
the person in front of her leaves she steps up i need the best lawyer in town
i know you cant give names its against the law or whatever but i really need help and i can see youre a decent person
she slides a paper and pencil across the desk please
just a name
slim comes in sits gracie down and whispers watch how its done
slim goes to the receptionists desk hi
toiler with someone
no but hes im not a crazy person
she walks past the receptionist wait a minute
you cant slim opens the big door enters the moment we see jim toiler we know slims okay
the actor playing him is one of those cranky avuncular types who pisses and moans but always comes to the rescue and outsmarts the bad guys
as we expect he starts out disliking her i dont know where you learned manners young lady but this is not the way to get my attention
i know but im desperate
digging into purse my husband keeps trying to kill me and i need to talk to somebody whos smart okay
smarter than me at least
pulling out cash this is all the money i have well all but twenty its almost and ill give you all of it if youll just listen to what
just two minutes okay
shes so charming and intense and discombobulated he cant help but give in
hes staring at her
good poker player we can tell nothing from his expression
his voice very quiet and calm pardon my french dear but i hope you got pleasure from it cause you have really fucked yourself
you had two chances to file a complaint with the police and put his violence on record
you ignored them
which tells him to keep comin till he kills you
slim reacts to this
as for gracie his next move
hell initiate a custody hearing
he already did
if you dont show up the judgell rule against you you become a fugitive from the law
if you do show mitch will as you say portray you as a drug addict
for all i know you are one you break in here uninvited
id say your husband has a good chance for sole custody
now if you dont mind pushes the money back at her id like to go back to my work
stares at him in disbelief thats all
off his silence youre not gonna help me
no one can help you lady
stares at him
and does not go
after a moment we see him have a thought
look up at her
the custody hearing if he pushes for it is just a trick
she says nothing
watches as he plucks a bill from her stack of funds
obviously hes giving her a valuable piece of advice its a way to get you to a particular place at a particular time
so he can kill you
he pockets the
she stares at him
gracie curled up in the front passenger seat
slim glances at her
looks back at the road
back at gracie
finally softly i gotta make you a solemn promise grace
gracie is of course fast asleep
ever since you were born
well one day i started to think of all the awful things that were gonna happen
people youd love whod die or leave you betray you break your heart
physical injuries broken bones or sickness or guys who hurt you some way
and i thought that if i could protect you even once from any of those if i could absorb any part of that myself
ginny comes off a plane with her two kids
in tow looks around heads for a bank of telephones
as she approaches one of the phones starts to ring
ginny looks at it with irritation picks it up this is the most ridiculous thing ive ever done
how bout horace
ginny glances at one of her kids evidently horaces child
okay this is the second most rent a car drive to denver then fly to reno
youre out of your mind
as though flattered you noticed
we watch from a distance as ginny shakes her head in disbelief mutters to her kids
as they trudge off the camera follows
from the same distance ginny and kids approach the counter
ginny loading luggage into the back as her kids climb in
as ginny slams the trunk someones right there slim
ginny blinks recognizes her hugs her whatre you
i thought we were
driving to reno i had to make sure you werent followed
re slims hair i like it
not so sure maybe
gracie slips out from behind slim goes and hugs ginny as slim holds up a wallet theres a credit card and cash
its on me but make no calls home or to phil
think of it as a vacation till the orca reopens
this to gracie who started to climb into the car
gracie looks at slim and again tries to climb in she wants g part of saying goodbye but slim pulls her back into a hug
slim holds her for as long as gracie can possibly tolerate
when slim is done gracie climbs into the car with ginnys kids
slim has tears in her eyes
take care of her okay
extra ice cream and
and if you need to reach me
hands her a cell phone just dont call your friends
ill call strangers
in an emergency im on the auto dialer
or ill call you
any calls between us must run is seconds or less
re the vacation enjoy it huh
the custody hearings end of next month
thats my deadline
deadline for what
slim looks at her
camera continues back we see more of her face
perspiration streaming from her pores running down her face
and a look we havent seen before
can you lose
she shakes her head
can he hurt you
she barely dignifies the question with another shake
were now far enough back to see we are slim in a leotard
even though hes bigger
quiet hes a lot bigger
even though hes stronger
finally see her instructor pounds african american
hes a lot stronger
so if he hits you no way
twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit
after he misses what do you do
she answers him with an intense look
he nods and moves after her
slow strong powerful predator
she backs up
her movements simple graceful economical but athletic they remind us of the easy way she moved around the restaurant in the first scene
scattered over the mat are old fashioned plastic santas that kids use as punching bags
he backs her toward one
as she nears them she slides deftly to the side like she has eyes in the back of her head
he maneuvers her toward a desk her back to it
rushes at her for a moment she seems trapped but as he reaches her she slips to her left tosses him over the desk and onto the mat
she moves quickly to an attacking position standing over him
he pats the mat beside him
he makes a motion and she closes her eyes
one last thing
the hardest lesson we cant control the universe
the unexpected may happen
he slides his hand over the mat an order
she lies down
suddenly his maid enters youre distracted for an instant and he hits you
thats not possible we must prepare even for the impossible
she stirs slightly uncomfortable with this idea
we bend the universe to our will but it will only go so far
youre saying thats right for the sake of this exercise he hits me
hes standing over her
she looks completely vulnerable
and you lie there as if dead
but hear me
hold onto my voice
she nods almost imperceptibly
hes standing over you he thinks hes won and as sure as hes a coward hell try to kick you
and because you know what hell do youre smiling inside
her face blank eyes still closed but something changes we sense her confidence and serenity returning
he draws his foot back as if to kick her
san francisco day
slim strides through the office unapologetically interrupting various conversations
finally she spots jupiter walks over and without saying a word demands his attention to the others ah
just a sec ill be right back
to her irritated i thought i made it clear you werent supposed to come here
i dont care what you want
this almost makes him smile hes getting to like her
youre a different person
hows that black guy i
set you up with
did he teach you how to think
its not the question she expected its more interesting and complicated
i hope so
before he can speak the english guy is good too
but thats not why im here
i need a woman who looks like me
someone who can handle herself an off duty cop or something
hands him photo five four one ten
hair like this but cut higher over the ear hands him key miko hotel room oclock
thats awful short notice i dont know if i can what
i thought jupiter was like all powerful king of the gods
one more thing
at some point
not right now cause itd be phony
i need you to acknowledge that im your kid
she walks away
he stares after her
hint of a smile comes to his face
slim is signing the credit card slip as the clerk puts the merchandise in a distinctive red bag you sure thisll work
you bet your life
thanks i will
she leaves taking out her cell phone
follow her as she goes she walks up the street punches in a number
could you please tell mrs
tyler that ill call her around f our this afternoon
of course miss slim
slim hangs up goes into a
slim sits at a table with a cup of coffee
a short guy built like a fireplug dressed in sweater and jeans and wool cap enters walks to her and says in an english accent today hon you graduate
alex and slim are across the street from a strip joint
till six eh
and id guess whoever owns it isnt a very nice person
thats a safe one
slim starts walking toward the shop
as they go why here
youve got soft hands youve worked hard
the tricky part now is nerves
they reach the entryway slim takes out her tools
people on the street
and you have to go in when his alarms turned off meaning hes inside
has tools out im ready
alex moves slightly to block the view as slim bends over and slips her tool into the lock
slim working quietly concentrating
a shady character noticing them
we got company doll
slim still working
the shady character has almost reached them
youre too slow
she opens the door alex glances down nods she closes the door again and stands just as hey
whatre you guys up to
slim stares at him
we were hoping to see some action but it looks like theyre closed
the shady character stares back
he is ve skeptical
he watches slim and alex walk off down the block
alex mutters under his breath action
off her grin slim sits in a chair cell phone at her ear
her hair is done now shes getting a manicure
and where is gracie
shes coming day after tomorrow then were flying to l
i was thinking after the hearing maybe i could bring her by
tell me something
why is this call different
you were always worried about how long we talked i was out in the country mrs
im in a big city now meeting with my lawyer so therere lots of cell phones
no one can trace this
slim exits in a long gray coat
stops outside for one moment glances around sees a guy in a green trenchcoat across the street
she walks hurriedly away
glances over her shoulder sees trenchcoat following her
she smiles slightly to herself
from a discreet distance across the street we watch her go into her hotel
trenchcoat is standing across the street
slim enters her suite
sitting by the window is tova
as slim walks over tova pulls on a wig which matches slims haircut
there is now a strong resemblance
im tova steinberg
tovas voice is an octave lower than slims
say something else
i was a cop
i got shot took the benefits
slim thinks about tovas voice
takes out her cell phone
they have to think im still here so use my cell phone tomorrow to call my dad
slim presses the autodial number then send and motions for tova to put on slims gray coat
it fits tova perfectly
lowering his voice hey its me
what happened to your voice
i dont know im getting some bronchial thing
otherwise everythings okay
get some rest huh
she presses end says to tova back to normal voice tomorrow stay in order room service
call him twice
keep it brief
hello i dont feel well
go around the corner eat at guidos
ill be followed
tova nods and slim takes off her own wig
short dark hair
wish me luck huh
luck has nothing to do with it
slim waiting as the service elevator arrives
slim going out the door down the alley
slim getting on the plane to los angeles
slim parks looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts
she takes a duffle from the back seat
steps into the shadows stares at the warehouse brick building modern door and light fixtures
she looks both ways the streets dark
she hoists her duffle takes a deep breath
and crosses the street
goes up the stairs to the stoop
looks at the alarm panel on the door green
crouches starts to work on the lock
mitch in bed sleeping
a sound off
he stirs slightly
he sits up
cocks his head
the silence seems to have texture
he gets up
we glimpse a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into an open loft like space filled with birdseye maple metal beams etc
modern glistening expensive
he walks around the place in the dark
in his boxer shorts and t shirt
he looks vulnerable
from one corner
she has become the stalker
her eyes watching
he decides everythings okay and goes back to the semi partitioned sleeping area
he gets back into bed next to a young blond woman
she turns over mutters something goes back to sleep
he lies there eyes open
stays very still
mitch in his bathrobe making coffee
the young blond woman comes out fully dressed
i gotta get home change for work
he nods gives her a perfunctory kiss ill call you
she stares at him a second
you want my number
she sees how eager he is to talk to her again
irritated she scribbles the number quickly hands
it to him thanks for everything
for the sex in other words
she gives it right back to him you too
i really appreciate it
hes too self centered to notice her ironic tone
she lets herself out
the instant she does we go to a high angle looking down at mitch
alternate normal and high angle during mitch pours coffee goes back into his dressing area and pulls on some clothes as he talks into his cell phone janie
yeah i was working late
no tonights no good either
ive got a morning flight to san francisco
slim in therafters listening
if it was pleasure youd be going too
no im going down to get my daughter
slims reaction to this
sure the custody hearings here next week but it looks like gracies being brought to san francisco and my ex wife
well seems like she completely vanished
his words echo his threats when he was trying to strangle her in her hallway
right off the face of the earth
i doubt theyll ever find her this time
slims jaw tightens
when we come back to mitch hes dressed and packing his briefcase
yeah i want her to meet you
well call when we get in
he hangs up takes a sip of coffee
high angle shot looking down on mitch as he heads out the door
slim waits in the rafters until the alarm system beeps its armed
she climbs down walks into the kitchen
notices his mr
coffee machine is still on
hesitates turns it off
opens the fridge to find something to eat the alarm beeps again
slim drops silently to the floor
sound of the key in the lock slim scuttles away as we hear front door opening
footsteps coming toward her
she slips around the edge of the counter just as mitch enters the kitchen
he goes to the mr
looks at it
didnt he leave it on
slim in the foreground crouched down mitch feet away
he looks around
is something wrong
is someone here
slim frozen trying not to breath
wondering should he search the place
she looks for a place to hide he looks at his watch
he walks right toward slim curls around the counter but shes not there any longer
he heads for the front door goes out
hold on the hall where she was where he walked
the alarm beeps again as he resets it
one silent beat then slim rises in the kitchen
she did a
pours herself some coffee replaces the liquid with water
auto dials her cell phone
can you stay off the phone
for you honey
i hope so
she hangs up
retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out tools equipment etc
picks up a screwdriver and starts searching the apartment checking the phone line following it to the place where it enters the apartment
montage intercut with flashes of slim a face a running tab on her emotions
intensity focus determination fear
and as the sequence builds concern about what she doing
she disconnects the phone line
finds the electrical box opens it finds the main switch
removes all the knives from the kitchen
walks the apartment familiarizing herself with every inch of it occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly
we realize shes assessing fighting spaces
she looks from one piece of furniture to another back and forth gauging the distance between them
she eats a snack from his refrigerator
looks out the back bedroom window
and sees the water of the san pedro harbor below her
uses a metal detector to search the apartment in a drawer of the night table beside his bed she finds a pistol
there are papers in the same drawer notes or something
she throws these in the trash
she takes out three letters
as the camera sweeps over one of them we hear her voice
thanks for letting me come talk about gracie
and im glad youre willing to admit your temper and lets not mince words the physical abuse you subjected me to
and glances at second letter perhaps with your new attitude we can really work something out
per your last letter ill see you the evening of
she puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was
theyre not in envelopes theyre loose open
she picks up the metal detector resumes her search
the machine beeps insistently around his desk
she cant find anything
finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the drawers a second gun is in there
with the gun are papers reports from private detectives looking for her an assessment of his custody rights
she hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper
finds a photo of herself with mitch and gracie
rips it up
puts the metal detector back in the duffle
changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants
takes the distinctive red bag from the electronics store out of the duffle
theres a machine inside
she plugs it in tucks it behind the couch
puts her cell phone beside it
she makes one last check every wall surface every drawer
barefoot she begins to glide around the space
moving with ease and grace sliding deftly to the side as she approaches a couch desk chair
shes building on her earlier reconnaissance learning where the furniture is and how to navigate around it
light fading toward darkness
shes still moving backward only now her sliding is smooth graceful almost a dance
as if hearing a distant signal she slows to a stop
for a long moment she stands perfectly still
like an animal in the forest
theres a chair facing the front door
she glances at it
she walks behind the couch turns off the machine picks up her cell phone and auto dials
slim says nothing
say it again
what you told me
on slims face as oh
you have a divine animal right to protect your own life and the life of your offspring
she hangs up turns the machine back on and stashes her cell phone
with simple ease she lowers herself onto the chair
facing the door
waiting in the fading light
mitch walks down the street
up the steps punches in his alarm code
mitch enters closes and locks the door
turns on the light
he walks back to the rear of the space hangs up his coat
goes into the bedroom area takes off his jacket
the lights go out
mitch freezes shadow on shadow a silhouette in the darkness
he looks out the window sees the neighboring buildings still have light and power
he cocks his head listening
walks to the door of the bedroom area
take two more steps its me
he nods slowly
i thought so
he moves quietly to the bed
to the night table where slim found the pistol
covers this by talking this morning too
you always did forget to turn off the coffee
he rummages in the drawer
we hear the rustle of the letters slim put there
he fails to find the gun
gives up trying to be quiet tosses papers onto the floor i found it mitch
his hand leaves the drawer
picks up the phone listens
cant see her
goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes out his cell phone
we see the glow of its dial
he punches and pressed send
the dial goes dark for two seconds then blinks back on
he stares at it
again it goes dead
its a machine
knocks out cell phones
he throws the cell phone onto the bed
walks out of the bedroom area
looks around the vast space
slanting light and dense shadow
he doesnt see her
walks toward his desk
i found that gun too
doesnt know where to go
or what to do
now is when you decide mitch
off his silence whether youre a coward
if you are you can run
i wont stop you
meaning the match is unfair you have my guns
threw em away
then someones here with you
cause itd be stupid
silence is her answer
youre sayin this is man to man
thats what i meant man against woman you sure thats fair
the lights go back on
slowly slim comes out from hiding
fair to whom
as he realizes her meaning she moves into the open area between two couches
she has no weapon
shes barefoot in her sweats feet spread for balance arms just slightly raised
compared to him shes tiny
he moves toward her
this is what you wanted right
what you were going to san francisco for the chance to get me alone
he lunges for her she slides to the side and he misses
he begins to stalk her
and as he stalks she moves backward slowly and gracefully in the way she was practicing
i dont understand slim
how does this work for you
she ignores his words
watches his eyes and his chest
wants to know where hes going to attack
i mean this is carefully thought out right
she does not respond
he throws three punches
none of them hits her
hes unfazed keeps stalking
but say you succeed beat me up or whatever
youre not going to murder me
her expression remains neutral focused
he takes this to be agreement
so all youve done is further piss me off
self defense is not murder
this stops him cold
he lowers his hands a moment
stares at her trying to assimilate this new information
you dont have the guts
she just looks at him
he blinks worried for an instant
covers it with a smile its not self defense when you break in here and attack me
so far youre attacking me
he lunges almost hits her rushes in she has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity jumps over the couch to avoid being hit
he also jumps over the couch but his balance isnt as good and shes waiting for him as he stumbles with perfect balance and full force she slugs him in
he goes down
for the first time it occurs to him this might not be easy
he climbs to his feet feels his nose blood
im just defending myself
he resumes stalking her
only hes angry now and its scary
if you fail you can count on this youll never see gracie again
she reacts he sees it rushes her punching as he goes
from the standpoint of pure physics he makes a terrifying force
until she steps back grabs his arm whips him vs
the brick wall he hits it bounces off
cut on his forehead blood streaming down his face
he stares at her
trying to put it together you really think
you think youll kill me and get away with it
l i told you
i came here as arranged in our letters to talk about gracie letters
there are no in the drawer where your pistol was
you just left prints all over them
he stares at her stunned in every way
touches his forehead feels the blood
you attacked me i fought back
and of course if you never touch me
ill have to give myself bruises
he goes berserk
leaps at her covering ground quickly with his long stride swinging his massive arms
this is the most terrifying form of combat a huge person attacking a tiny one
if he should hit her even once a glancing blow she will go down she will break it will be over
but he misses and misses again
sometimes his punches are wild almost comical
others come so close we hear the wind feel their power feel his sweat on her
continue this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction for as long as it will hold
at every instant we fear for her bones and her life
sometimes she leans back like muhammad ali to barely slip a punch and we see terror on her face married to determination
she knows the score
and the odds
finally in frustration at so many misses he grabs an ashtray hurls
it at her it flies over her head he punches again and again wildly
she remains untouched
with all the blood he looks like a wild animal
he makes a great effort to pull himself together
this doesnt bother me slim
i dont care how long it takes
we both know ionly have to hit you once
once and its over
she laughs at him
this is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can stand
he rushes at her again fast she starts left he blocks her way she starts right again hes blocking her she lunges to the left through a narrow space he
punches grazing her hair punches again just missing and a third time
we feel the awesome power behind these blows
shes in the clear again
clearly part of her strategy is to keep him angry im confused mitchy
arent you a man
i thought it was no contest
i mean cant you hit me even once
he grabs a lamp yanks out the cord wields it like a club
he smashes the lamp down just missing her head its a martial arts cliche honey
a weapon throws you off balance he misses her three times the last time smashing the lamp into the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand
he yelps you see
he turns toward her pain on his face holding his hand and she truly attacks for the first time
smashes her fist against his head he flies back bounces vs
as he comes off it she punches him again he roars with rage lunges at her head first great speed she hurtles him in the same direction increasing speed right
into the opposite wall
the top of his head hits the wall
he shudders like someone in a cartoon a spasm running head to he drops
does not move
she stares at him
goes to him
gives him a reflex test no reaction
she tests his neck for a pulse
apparently hes still alive because she raises her hand over her head
her palm vertical like a knife
shes about to deliver a karate chop
to his neck
it will break his neck
it will kill him
her hand stays there poised
camera plunges in on her face
mitch hitting her the first time midwest house mitch leaping out from gracies doorway mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of their house
something we didnt see before
she reaches up flicks the light switch mitch jumps on her back mitch youll never see gracie again
earlier shes my daughter
dont even think about taking her
strangling slim whispering
where youre going they will never
face contorted in rage confusion she brings her hand down misses
turns away tears in her eyes
she retrieves her cell phone turns off the cell phone blocker presses redial
stares out the window
we see the turmoil on her face hear it in her voice i cant gin
re you okay
you beat him
listen to me
i did it but i cant do it
i cant kill him
behind slim out of focus movement a soft blur
hell come after you i know hell come after gracie an indistinct shape something rising over her head
i know all that
i have to but i cant
im not a killer
im not him
crazed and bloody face
in his hand the wooden lamp
she senses something turns her head slightly to one side so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull
still sends her crashing to the floor
now she does not move
he stands over her
looks insane bloody dazed beaten but triumphant
the lamp moving in his hand
hes rotating it
a simple menacing image
and we realize he s aoinq to hit her again
should i call the cops
hes distracted by ginnys voice
picks up the phone
listen to me bitch
if you value your children don t call anybody
its over okay
its all over
he throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward slim lamp clenched tight in his fist
were almost inside her head as we hear hold onto my voice
is that the hint of a smile on her face
mitch sees the slight smile cant believe it rage
he pulls his foot back to kick her her eyes are open just a slit his foot swinging forward
as it reaches her she grabs it yanks it hes pulled off his feet crashing down on top of her but shes already rolling out from under him
and up coming to her feet he starts to rise all fours then into a crouch and ug
her face alert
center of gravity low
as her motion unfurls boxers say that an uppercut perfectly executed is the most difficult powerful and beautiful of punches
indeed when an uppercut starts low for maximum center of gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin as slims does here it delivers a devastating
message to the central nervous system short circuiting it completely
mitch flies backward
theres a table behind him
his head cracks on the table
his neck snaps
he lands on the floor twisted broken
slim stares at him
theres no way a living man could assume the position now occupied by her former husband
she stares in disbelief
though she knows the answer she feels his carotid artery
her face registers what she feels
she walks slowly to her cell phone picks it up
listens no one there
she presses redial waits
in a panic h o
oh thank god youre alive
he hit his
hes not breathing
well i called the cops theyre on their way
can you hear me
this is important
as ginny talks slim puts the cell phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building
youre not him okay
youre not him and you never will be
see you soon
she drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water
then the duffle
they both sink
she comes out sits on the steps
a siren is audible
cop cars speed down the street screech to a stop
two cops leap out of the car run toward her
she looks at him considering the question
shakes her head
where is he
she makes a slight motion to indicate that mitch is inside and the other cop runs into the apartment
slim lowers her head
first cop looks at her sees the blood on her scalp
looks like youre one of the lucky ones
she looks up stares at him and starts to cry
slim jumping up and down and generally making a fool of herself as gracie runs off the plane into her arms
ginny follows with her own kids hugs all around slim looking
he hurries to her and picks up gracie instead gives gracie a big hug
joe lingers in the hug as slim waits
finally he turns to slim hint of a smile what rules are we playing by now
she answers him with the kind of kiss you can get away with at a bar or airport and almost nowhere else
jupiter comes off the plane is hugged by ginny shakes hands with joe
as he turns to gracie slim says this time be nice to her
is it gonna be like that
jupiter smiles shakes hands with gracie i hope i can work into being your grandfather okay
signs all over open again after bombing same great food
slim joe jupiter and gracie eating ginny serving large platters of gorgeous food so whattaya say slim girl you comin back to work

ginny gives him a look she has to go back to school make big success

jupiter gives phil a playful look thanks a lot
phil whispers to gracie but dont let her cook huh gracie
