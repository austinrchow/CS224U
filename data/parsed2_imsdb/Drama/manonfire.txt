man on fire by brian helgeland based on the novel by a
quinnell february property of new regency productions inc
work in progress
man on fire high over the city on a bright sunday morning the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog
as we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets the sounds of a mass being sung
the big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside
feature a tall lanky year old
holding his girlfriends hand anxious for sunday to really begin
they dont notice the traffic suddenly thin like a faucets been cranked down
they move toward a mercedes
as a chauffeur holds the back door open for them
squeals around the corner lurches to a stop alongside the mercedes
four men get out flashing badges
in a moment theyre hustling eighteen toward the car stiff arming the chauffeur
as the girlfriend cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins
the grand marquis pulls away
they shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat
these guys are not the police
a switchblade is flicked open
practiced hands slit the boys sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels
eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf
duct tape is wrapped around his hands eyes and head
the marquis is parked across from another car
four new guys wait as eighteen is hauled out of the marquis
his clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin
he stands naked bound and blind
eighteen is handed over from one group to the other
the phone rings
a bomb going off
eighteens distraught father family photos of the boy on the wall answers
work in progress
reverse to reveal a battery of police and negotiators in the room with him
one of them listens in waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin
a wall smeared with god knows what
facing it eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering
the back of his leg still bleeds
he shifts nervously as a little jack russell terrier eagerly licks the blood off his calf
a man the dreamer we dont see his face negotiates by cell phone
as he runs numbers he slaps his thigh
jack russell trots over gets an ear scratched
at a motion from the man eighteen is taken down to the ground
straddled by two men his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed

rosanna garcia guerrero editor of reforma newspaper being interviewed
organized crime syndicates
growth of kidnapping in mexico over the last two years
as a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox
a glimpse of something we dont want to see
an ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear
a mercedes driving around the square eighteens father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag
footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway
empty train blazes through
dangerous deserted downtown neighborhood
looks more like war torn beirut burnt out cars and trash
the year olds father naked to the waist walks from the family mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi derelict car on the opposite
side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open
he slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves
a red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median
work in progress
horns blare as a car stops
eighteen still blindfolded is dumped on the median
the car pulls away
he stands there in the whirlwind
pathetically screaming for help
more horns shouts no help
end main titles
goes to black
ezekiel blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the
finder of lost children
samuel valencia ramos and his lawyer jordan kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table
jordan is well heeled well connected and well oiled
in that order
samuel at already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations
they discuss the kidnapping a headline on the paper jordan tosses aside
the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later
laughs chews his father still hasnt gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards
my own wife included
if she pisses you off you get another one
laughs grimly do you know what she told me last night
samuel sits at his baby grand piano playing a gentle rendering of delibes
his american wife lisa stands away from him
just the sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance
she tells him work in progress
a mans worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes
only the amount matters
where will that put me in the social strata
im only asking for one thing
and its not an extravagance
its not even for me its for our daughter
she turns at that a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts to look at her
she stares plays him like chinese checkers
our childs safety is at stake
stops playing these people are professionals
they dont waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt
samuel it is not something we should skimp on
a bodyguards presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent
now hes gone i feel totally exposed
she just stares at him
jordan smiles at his client enjoys seeing him squirm
of course i care about pinta
shell be as beautiful as her mother one day
and if she was ugly
samuel rolls his eyes
beheading two cigars he passes one to samuel
work in progress
all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance
i have a policy aig
it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days without a bodyguard i will not be able to renew it
i know you need to please lisa
an ass like that is hard to find
good bodyguards are even harder
interrupts i know
i just had to let one go because i couldnt afford him
jordan lights his cigar
you need a bodyguard of some description
its a dangerous world we live in
but you will get what you pay for
he doesnt need to be superman does he
can you go fifteen grand
for a year
for a few months
hire someone cheap
you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance
then fire him for incompetence
the important thing is lisas daughter will return to school
samuel finally follows the logic
and lisa will be able to save face
we wont be the only family without a bodyguard
her beauty fucks with your mind
for an american she understands this country very well
work in progress
she understands men
as samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction
as a is towed by in the background a man strides at us
even in movement he has a stillness an air of isolation
hes set apart from other living things
he wears dark sunglasses carries a well worn leather bag
a bit frightening
the discipline of a soldier
the independence of a gunslinger
automatic baggage teller red light green light
creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card
light flashes red
he flips through creasys passport
even the stamps have stamps
every country in europe
guys been around
customs looks up from the ink blue american eagle to the deep matte black of creasys sunglasses
note italics denotes the lines spoken in spanish
where are you coming from
where are you staying in mexico
im on to juarez
i have a friend there
customs looks at creasy a moment
he doesnt look like a man who has friends
finally customs smiles
work in progress
i cannot see your eyes senor
creasy slips off the sunglasses
his eyes are deserted
customs can only look into them a moment
he indicates for creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an x ray machine
creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor
the official hits the start button
the bag drives forward towards the x ray machine
creasy pauses then offers up a license from his wallet
its a permit to carry a gun in columbia
the gun youre about to find in that suitcase
polaroid flash shot of creasy straight on
shot of creasy profile
fingers being fingerprinted
jumpcuts suitcase being stripped and ripped midnight express pack of marlboro bottle of jack daniels glimpse a weathered bible new testament intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in
different parts of the bag ie
toiletries underwear lining of suitcase
the seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled sig sauer
six japanese businessmen jabber on cellphones
paul rayburn sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the mini uzi cradled in his lap
as his own cell phone rings he answers
creasy on payphone
work in progress
when did mexican customs start getting smart
rayburns suv creasy
where the fuck are you
rayburns suv what do you mean im here
im in a customs holding tank in mexico city international
bring a bunch of cash
im going to need it
rayburn has k u
dollars laid out on the desk between him the customs official and creasy
the remains of the suitcase are spread around the room
the main offender the gun being front and center next to the cash
looks like the official is going to fold
this is going to cost you big time
strip bar rethink location a stripper does a half hearted grind as rayburn and creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of jack
you got a secondary search and you had a gun
listen it was a calculated risk
ive done it a million times and never got caught
everything happens once if you live long enough
work in progress
it doesnt make sense to x ray your bags coming off the plane
this is mexico they do everything backwards
creasy hits the jack
so whats wrong
dont give me that bullshit
creasy changes subject
so hows business
japanese are here in a big way
but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso
i ferry em back and forth
they think im john fucking wayne
but dont you stay in el paso
fuck i love mexico
i live like a king down here
creasy takes a look around the seedy bar
oh like you havent been in worse places
and a level five shithole is better than a level six
your logics inescapable
creasy takes the bottle
creasys hand is mottled by old burn marks
work in progress
you been working
not for eight months
i was in columbia looking around but nothing seemed interesting
how long you staying crease
shrugs got no plans rayburn nothing on
just wanted to see you how you were
came by on impulse
rayburn studies his friend a beat just seeing the cracks that werent there last time they met
you did something on impulse
everything happens once if you live long enough
nine year old pinta martin ramos stares out at the garden a bit like creasy but only a ten yard stare
pintas eyes brim with life
she folds her hands closes her eyes prays
chopin drifts up from downstairs
samuel on the baby grand
i do not ask for health
people ask you so often that you cant have any left
give me god what you still have
give me what no one else asks for
pinta grabs a battered old teddy bear and climbs into bed
she pulls the covers up looks over as her door opens
pinta is her daughter
you should be sleeping baby
work in progress
im trying mom
lisa strokes her head smiles
youre going back to school
sits up excited when
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard
it may take a few days but youre going back
pinta lets it sink in
lisa kisses her goodnight
could he speak english
emilio couldnt speak english
and thank your father in the morning
a man always needs to be thanked
four suvs blast along a desert highway on their way to pick up some japanese businessmen
rayburn rides shotgun creasy in the back
rayburn looks like he slept in his clothes
creasy looks crisp and clean
thats right a bodyguard
creasy looks at him blankly
your spanish is good enough
you certainly look the part
people would hire a has been ray
well youd have to keep it under control
work in progress
and what if just say there was a kidnap attempt
you do your best
they wont be paying you enough to perform miracles
creasy just shakes his head
its not exactly a scam crease
even at half speed youre pretty damn good
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time
willing to talk
im not good at that
so youll be the silent type
people will appreciate that
creasy shakes his head looks out the window
what are you doing here
i came to visit you
ive known you fifteen years
you dont visit
whos the guy
owns one of the plants in juarez
the jap car industry is in the toilet
hes trying to persuade ford to partner with him
i think hes in trouble
he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust
oh now you think i can be trusted
take a job creasy
breathe some air
then decide if you want to
stick around or not
work in progress
rayburn throws him a vhs from the glove box
instructional tape on what i tell my clients about bodyguarding
creasy looks back at rayburn whos just a little too perceptive for comfort
a dark mercedes maneuvers the turns
creasy at the wheel
samuel sits in the back
you drive easily
creasy doesnt answer just drives
were you provided with a gun
show me please
creasy takes his right hand off the wheel reaches under his jacket and passes back a beat to shit looking pistol
what is it
a sig sauer
have you used this type before
creasy just nods
doesnt like the show and tell
is it loaded
samuel hands back the gun
work in progress
you will meet my wife first
she would like it if you are presentable polite and respectful
youll be the fifth candidate shes seen this week
samuel flips through a manila folder
your resume is impressive
nine years in the army
extensive counter terrorism work
i shouldnt be able to afford you in my current state
whats the catch
honest i drink
how does it affect you
if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter the service will be on par with the pay
and what if amateurs try it
ill probably kill them
is that likely
and no one is to know of your drinking problem
that includes my wife
as they pull up to the ramos impressive hacienda
where lisa is flipping through tv channels sky news cnn etc
each one showing some terrorist act west bank protest madrid car bombing
samuel and creasy meanwhile enter behind her
she clicks it off looks back at them
the world of our children
how dare they
work in progress
shrugs its war
the weakest suffer the most
so are you
introducing my wife mr
lisa martin ramos mr
lisa steps over shakes creasys hand
gives him a quick once over
would you like a drink
creasy doesnt hesitate doesnt look at samuel and has no irony in his answer
scotch and a little water
she steps to the bar to make it
watching from the frame of the door
youve done much of this work before
samuel sells covers for creasys reticence
he has experience in related work
a great deal of it
do you have any family mr
creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat
i do not have family
work in progress
and then somehow creasy is aware of being watched
his eyes flicker over just in time to see
in the doorway
she stares back at him a beat then disappears around the corner
lisa steps over with creasys drink
she makes a point of looking into his eyes
creasy looks back into hers with complete indifference something she has not experienced even from dying men
she abruptly turns away
confused for a moment
a few moments and pinta arrives
cool hand pinta
this is mr
pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand
creasy shakes it
an odd beat
pinta show him to his room
creasy got the job
this way mr
what an actress
as he follows her out
samuel sits at his baby grand and begins to play
i think its nice hes american
i think its fantastic
work in progress
you realize that youve brought a killer into the house
samuel is stopped short by that one
she steps over and kisses her husband on the cheek
i feel better now
pinta leads the way
all enthusiasm away from her parents
a pound black german shepherd greets them
sniffs creasys pant leg unsure
do you like dogs mr
if they like me
frank doesnt take to most people
do you speak german
in german ein klines bisschen
a tiny bit
frank only responds to commands in german
he was trained in frankfurt
my dad loves the idea of having a dog around but hates the fact he lives inside
creasy follows her
frank pads along after them
not like downstairs but comfortable enough
we fixed the room up two weeks ago
mom and i
its nicer than before
creasy takes a stroll around it ignoring her
youve got a cd player if you like music
i like music a lot
work in progress
creasy looks over at a cage on a stand holding a macaw
it tilts its head at the big man
a tv and vhs machine in the corner
emilio forgot to take him with when he left
my last bodyguard
he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon
finally creasy turns looks at her hard
im here for you
pinta smiles huge nods
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch
does that sound alright mr
just call me creasy
big grin creasy
franks tail wags imperceptibly
looks like he approves of you
and then walking on air shes out the door
creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that comes from years in the military
front and center he arranges his shrine an almost empty bottle of scotch and a glass engraved from an earlier encounter next to a pack of marlboros and his weathered
then his beaten up gun and holster
a well travelled new testament is placed in the drawer
work in progress
he reaches in between the shirts pulls out a fresh bottle of scotch
he breaks the seal unscrews the cap
he pours a double
wait what do you call a full glass of scotch
the macaw squawks its disapproval
he ejects the shell from the breach of the mm tries to catch it on the back of his hand
an old game with himself
his hand is too shaky
the bullet bounces off hits the floor
creasy picks it up
ejecting the magazine he starts to oil the weapon
as the macaw squawks creasy looks up
it doesnt feel like this relationship is going to work
a battered teddy bear watches as lisa sits on the foot of the bed tucks pinta in
school tomorrow baby
pinta smiles happy at the thought
i like him mom
hes like a great big bear
a secret smile creasy bear
lisa smiles kisses her goodnight
as she starts out
theres something about him
lisa turns looks back at her daughter
i think hes been sick
hes alright now but i think hes been very very sick
work in progress
well think about going to sleep
good night baby
pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear
just like you a big old bear
in his room
tests his mag spring with his thumb begins loading up
the full magazine joins with those already loaded
another glass of scotch is poured
creasys hands oil the holster
the sig sauer is slipped in
the holster is hung over the corner post of the bed
a map is flattened
creasys finger traces various routes pencils them in
from the house to pintas school
the macaw squawks again
creasy steps over takes the cage and carries it to the open window
he opens the cage door
nows your chance
the bird flies disappears out the window
spent glistened in sweat the couple lay side by side
she likes him
pinta likes him
pinta loves school
shed like count dracula is he took her back there
work in progress
lisa just smiles knows her daughter better
creasys drinking in the dark next to the window listening to the sounds of mexico city at night
the empty scotch glass is set down
brushing her hair pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing
creasy is down below going over the car a dark blue mercedes
as he checks underneath
the car wash guy pedro trying to engage creasy
frank looks on seems like he disapproves of pedro
creasy sits grimly behind the wheel
pinta exuberant beside him
traveling route number one from home base to school
pinta looks at creasys hands on the wheel
the back of the right one is swirled with scars
where are you from creasy
the united states
but which state
creasy checks the rearview mirror
a banged up white toyota corolla pulls out behind him
no state in particular
pinta frowns this is going to take some work
my mom and me are from houston texas
have you been there
creasy has his eyes on the mirror
work in progress
you can drive and talk at the same time cant you
turns left no
im looking for potential
creasy checks the mirror
the white corolla continues the way it was going
i dont understand
places where the road bends places away from buildings places where the traffic thins out
but you dont have to understand
so no talking
are you going to quit
my last bodyguard quit
let me guess you wouldnt stop talking
someone gave him more money than we could
im a bargain
being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico
time will tell
there were kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days
four a day
what do you think about that mr
work in progress
maybe i need to up my fee or get a larger gun
she looks at his scared right hand then him
creasy pulls the mercedes up out front
he notes the high walls the heavy gates
beep the horn
creasy hits it
a beat and then a shutter opens at eye level
pinta waves from the car
a moment later the gate is being slowly pushed open by an old watchman
creasy drives in toward a rambling ivy clad building set in spacious grounds
creasy parks get out of the car
he looks around appraising the lay of the land
isnt it beautiful
pintas name is called
an elderly gray haired nun walks over from the entrance
pinta runs over kiss her warmly on both cheeks then leads her toward creasy
sister anna the headmistress
to nun proudly this is creasy my bodyguard
sister anna shakes his hand
no sister he told me just to call him creasy
from no state in particular
you must look after our pinta
were so happy to have her back in school
run along now pinta
pinta waves goodbye bounds away
they watch her go
work in progress
shes late mr
yeah ive got to get used to the routes
i it wont happen again
no offense but im sorry that your profession needs to exist
so am i sister
do you ever see the hand of god in what you do
not for a long time sister
the bible says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
romans chapter verse
sister anna is impressed
she nods her props to creasy
im the sheep that got lost
creasy pulls out starts down the street
hes only gone a hundred meters when sirens kick up
a police car behind him
creasy shakes his head
here we go again
creasy pulls over digs around the front seat as two sloppy cops head over
do you speak english senor
you have an identification
work in progress
creasy hands them his passport and a printed letter
a legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed by rayburn
creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel then the other
minimizing the confrontation
its a temporary license for the gun im carrying
i just went through all of this at the airport
six japanese businessmen jabber on cellphones
rayburns daily routine
he sits up front an uzi cradled in his lap
as his own cell phone rings he answers
creasy whats up
listens laughs yeah
police line up wall as creasys mug shot is flashed
creasys hand as hes fingerprinted
theres still ink on my fingers from last week
you got tossed
dont trust the cops especially the judicials
listens laughs again oh you know that
creasy slams a jack and coke
creasy striding the frivolous shoppers like another species as he moves through them
might as well wear a shark fin
he spots something a music store
work in progress
creasy finds the section hes looking for searches a rack
as he pulls a particular cd we are not privy to what it is
creasy waits smoking a marlboro light separate from the other drivers and bodyguards
the bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories
give him a share of unfriendly looks
creasy could care less
the doors open and the children pour out
pinta exits a huge grin as she spots creasy
creasy palms the marlboro
the frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble
pinta rides shotgun alongside creasy
she looks out the window realizes
were taking a different way home
pinta thinks about it realizes what hes doing smiles
no answer from creasy
its hard not to feel foolish around this kid
did you like school creasy
not at all
but why not
creasys hoping shell just shut up
work in progress
it wasnt a school like yours and there was no sister anna
so you were unhappy
being unhappy is a state of mind
i never thought about it
pinta watches creasy a moment trying to figure a way in
she looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel
then as she reaches out
what happened to
and touches it
creasy gives her a look devoid of humanity for an instant
no more questions
when he speaks again hes colder hes decided something
im not paid to be your friend
im paid to protect you
they drive on in silence
creasy finally glances over
pinta stares straight ahead her chin quivering
exasperated and dont start crying
im not crying
but she is
as creasy stops at a red light
work in progress
look this is the way i am
i dont like questions
i and shes out the door
creasy shoulders open his door bolts out
creasy has barely straightened himself and pinta is already getting back in the car
this time in the backseat
the light goes green
scooters whine away and horns blare
creasy sits back behind the wheel
you can take me home now mr
creasy looks back at her but she stares straight ahead
as the chorus of horns continues creasy continues driving
creasy sits at the table with the old gardener gomez weve seen him trimming hedges and such in earlier exteriors
gomezs just cleaned his plate and is going after any remnants with a crust of bread
creasy hasnt touched his
maria the cook enters
as she clocks creasys plate
chopin drifts across the courtyard
samuel is a very accomplished player
creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window a glass of scotch in his hand
a knock at the door
the door opens
work in progress
creasy i wanted to make sure you have everything you need
is the food alright
maria tells me that you didnt eat
the foods fine
sometimes i dont eat
smiles it insults maria
slip it to the dog if you have to
do you mind if i talk to you for a moment
he shakes his head
lisa glides into the room like a dancer sits down at the foot of the bed
how are you getting along with pinta
well be okay once she realizes im not a new toy
smiles yes she told me
do you have children mr
you should know theyre tenacious when they want something
and pinta wants to be friends
youre paying me to protect her not amuse her
a beat and then lisa nods
maybe this isnt going to work
maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone
work in progress
no youre right
you were hired to protect her thats enough
im confident youll do that
lisa stands is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed
it gives her pause
something sexy about it and creasys proximity
i didnt realize you had a gun
i know thats silly to say
creasy doesnt answer just watches her
it makes it all seem so serious
it is serious mrs
please its lisa
ill be coming with you tomorrow
i have lunch with friends
finally lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door
creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch
pinta blankets up teddy bear beside her says her prayer
give me god what you still have
give me what no one else asks for
then she listens as linda ronstadts blue bayou starts to drift through the open window down from the room above
im going back someday come what may to blue bayou
he stands in the dark in front of the glow of the stereo
the empty bag from the record store
this is the cd he bought
as the song ends creasy hits the back up button
blue bayou begins again
creasy takes the mm from its holster
as he sits back in his chair
work in progress
pinta listens to the music figures a way to dance to it
creasy sits in the dark with his blue bayou
creasy does not look right
holding the mm he ejects the round tries to catch it on the back of his hand
he chambers another round
well ill never be blue my dreams come true on blue bayou
pinta still dancing finding a way to be with creasy whether he knows it or not
frank the dog watches her every move perplexed
as the song repeats creasy chambers yet another round
feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into the chamber
pinta sings along oblivious
suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled
no gun shot
hammer against shell
creasy is confused
he ejects the shell and catches it in the palm of his hand
macro photograph a small dimple on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his actions
pinta still dances
rayburn in bed with his beautiful year old mexican wife and their four year old son
as she leans down to kiss her son a cellphone rings
rayburn looks over at the nightstand
five cellphones there one of them ringing
rayburn finds it
creasy stands at the edge of the drive the house dark behind him
on his cell phone
work in progress
i said have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didnt go off
rayburn pulling away sitting on the edge of the bed
you mean a misfire
i mean nothing
the hammer came down and nothing happened
dimple on the primer
ive heard of it
never happened to me though
maybe the firing pins off
creasy is troubled about it all to say the least
its like we always used to say a bullet always tells the truth
what were you shooting at
creasy doesnt answer
he holds the bullet up looks at it
focusing concerned creasy
sorry i woke you ray
creasy clicks off the phone
he starts back toward the house but stops short again
there she is
standing in the window of her room
shes been watching him
its like creasy seeing her for the first time
and shes been watching him forever
no easy answer for it
theyre connected somehow
fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox
it takes it place of honor front and center on the shrine
next to the marlboros and scotch
the new testament is set down nearby
work in progress
cu creasy asleep in his bed for the first time
silent creasy driving
lisa and pinta in the back
creasy steals a look in the mirror
pinta stares straight ahead
but when creasy looks away pinta steals a look at him
as the mercedes crosses an intersection a white toyota corolla turns right pulls in thirty meters behind it
creasy clocks the corolla frowns
he pulls a piece of paper from his pocket
but nothing to write with
pinta do you have a pencil
i go to school dont i
he stays calm doesnt let on what hes thinking
her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil
creasy takes it slows to let the corolla catch up
he squints into the mirror to read the plate
lisa is oblivious but as pinta looks back over her shoulder
brake lights up ahead
creasy lurches to a stop
the corolla swerves around them disappears ahead
the traffic takes some getting used to
as creasy cranes for a view another white corolla comes by headed the opposite way
this relaxes creasys paranoia
as he laughs to himself
work in progress
they pull in through the gates
the mercedes parks creasy gets out
pinta kisses her mother on the cheek
dont forget your towel
pinta gets out with book bag and her towel
as she starts to walk past creasy without a word he holds out her pencil
she holds up shows him a second pencil continues on her way
doesnt need him
creasy gets back in starts away
she has swimming practice today
youll need to pick her up at the pool
creasy just nods
he doesnt want anything to do with lisa either
thoughtful lisa looks out the window
i talked to her
she wont bother you anymore
as creasy just drives
creasy waits in the street stands by the mercedes
he checks his watch looks around
the minutes do not pass quickly
he looks over as the restaurant door opens and lisa exits with jordan kalfus and his latin wife evelyn
sees him creasy
stepping over meet jordan and evelyn
they study him with interest
so youre the bodyguard
creasy nods again you used to be what did they used to call it a soldier of fortune
work in progress
jordan doesnt quite hide his disdain
creasy nods a final time lets his eyes drift to a yard stare
giggles does he talk
as lisa gives her a dirty look evelyn whispers
jordan looks in the direction creasy looks
you see any danger out there
laughs the fears worse than the reality
just a blankness from creasy
i always wanted to ask a bodyguard would you take a bullet for your employer for samuel
a condescending smile as jordan awaits his answer
i wasnt hired to guard mr
for pinta then
if something happened my reaction would be to fight to protect her
i have skills in that respect
pinta would benefit by the fact that
im a soldier
what kind of an answer is that
the answer is the truth
the question is foolish
lisa smiles at the answer kisses jordan on the cheek
work in progress
jordan thank you for the lovely lunch
i promise not to let evelyn spend too much
evelyn doesnt see it but creasy does
jordan just lets his fingers trace the top of lisas ass
as she and evelyn head for the car creasy is there to open the door
creasy gets behind the wheel
pulls into traffic
as he goes he checks the rear view mirror
jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away
something odd about it all
reminiscent of a lunatic asylum
creasy arrives at the public pool
several bodyguards gather at one end of the pool
give creasy a less than friendly look
as he looks for pinta
a gun goes off
sees the smoke from the starting pistol as the swimmers splash into the water
he sees pinta in the pool
the fifty yard dash
shes in fifth
creasy walks along beside her
second and closing
and at the wall still second
she surfaces frustrated
as she sees creasy there
pinta in back writing in her notebook
not speaking but a weird sort of harmony
once i get in the water but not starting off
by the time i catch up its too late
she keeps writing
the number over and over
work in progress
creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch
all alone needless to say
creasy takes the instructional vhs on bodyguards that rayburn gave him and plugs it into the vcr
its in japanese
shakes his head
he switches off the vcr and surfs the tv channels instead
sees talk show with the editor of reforma newspaper rosanna guerrero talking about organized crime in mexico
from out the window a caw then again
finally creasy stands goes to the window
he leans out sees pintas window across the lawn from him
pinta standing on the terrace
creasy decides to play
he caws in return
pinta looks around
creasy does a pretty good impersonation
hears pinta caw again
she looks up at him
what are you doing
calling for emilios macaw
i thought i heard him
do you think hell come back
did you hear him
how do you think he got out
a beat well i let him go
work in progress
its better to be free right
actually he was driving me crazy
creasy disappears back inside
pinta smiles big before letting the stick drop to the ground
i got you to talk creasy bear
blue bayou plays
pinta now listens to creasys sound
im so lonesome all the time since i left my baby behind on blue bayou
a driver gets samuels and lisas luggage into a car
theyre on their way kissing pinta goodbye
ill call you from detroit baby
youre going to miss mexican halloween
the day of the dead
you enjoy it for us pinta
lisa gives her a look
dont make this harder than it has to be
finally pinta nods
creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the mercedes
she steps over stops to wave goodbye one last time then gets in back
as creasy shuts the door
creasy drives glances in the mirror at pinta in the back seat
she wipes away a tear just as it forms
theyll be back in a week
they can stay for two weeks
i dont care
shes got a toughness creasy likes
as she looks out the window he looks ahead
work in progress
the food is excellent maria
you have a real talent
maria beams with pleasure
my pleasure creasy
pinta enters in a red satin devils outfit
she looks a bit forlorn as she sits at opposite ends of the table from creasy
as she stares at her plate creasy starts to laugh at what an odd sight she is
all dressed up and no place to go
pinta stands marches out of the room
as maria and creasy exchange a look
pinta the devil stares sadly out here window
then there it is
sitting on the opposite roof
pinta pushes it open climbs out onto the slope of the roof
this doesnt look like such a good idea
as she crosses disappears over the peak
its a game of catch me if you can
bird looks at pinta right in the eye
she gingerly moves closer
the bird moves away just out of her reach each time
pinta coming down the other slope
theres the macaw
the fourth time pintas fingers are centimeters away
she reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile covering this section of the roof
franks in the yard barking loudly
near the edge she manages to stop
she scrambles up a few feet
a tile snaps off
she slides again
this time right off the edge
work in progress
she catches the rain gutter
hangs thirty feet above the ground
a concrete landing below
as the gutter creaks creasy is on his feet out the door in a heartbeat
creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side
pinta drops ten feet jerks to a stop as the gutter stops then drops the last twenty feet
landing in a hedge
creasy dashes over
shes in a lot of pain but moving her arms and head
franks licking her face
she puts her hands to the left side of her ribs
creasy carefully probes with his fingers
i dont think theyre broken
as maria huffs and puffs her way up
im going to get you out okay
creasy eases his arms under around her lifts her out as gently as possible
she disappears in his arms
work in progress
and she bursts into tears
maria looks up at the thirty foot fall
begins to cross herself
shes just scared
creasy cradles her pats her back
as pinta says his name like a mantra
lisa on the phone
fantastic in a black evening dress
the ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance
youre sure shes alright
samuel enters from the bathroom concern on his face
okay good youre sure
to samuel he took her for an x ray but its just a bruise and a sprain
she turns her back so samuel can zip her dress up
thank you creasy
give her my love
creasy makes his way up enters
pinta in bed propped up by a pillow teddy bear beside her
frank at the head of the bed
the night you arrived mom asked you if you had a family and you lied didnt you
i didnt have a family
but i did have two kids
theyre adults now
its a sensitive subject so pinta moves on
creasy looks at the bear
an odd beat
work in progress
do you always sleep with him
im too old for him
dont tell my friends
i dont talk to them much
does he have a name
pinta thinks just a beat then shakes her head no
i spoke to your mother
she sends her love
creasy stands there a beat then heads for the door
almost out he looks back
some bodyguard i turned out to be
good night pinta
hes halfway out the door
could you play the song
creasy is confused a moment but when he sees her open window he realizes
you got it
as pinta eases back with a sigh and a smile
pedro the car wash guy puts the finishing touches to the mercedes
using crutches pinta hobbles over
creasy opens the back door for her
but when she gets there she hesitates
i think ill sit in the front
theres more room for my foot
creasy makes no big deal of it
he takes her crutches opens the front
as she scoots inside
frank waits and watches
creasy calls to him
work in progress
hes only allowed to travel in the car on weekends
dad says the car will smell doggie
both of them up front
pinta is happy to be there and creasy doesnt seem to mind
did you sleep alright
hows the ankle
can you put your weight on it
its not too bad
will it take a long time before its better
our big swim meet is in three weeks
i was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle
in a week you should be fine
they drive on a few silent beats until
i always finish second
you need to practice
pinta looks at him hopefully but creasy catches himself
hes not going to coach a little girl
gomez maria and creasy again joined by pinta
as creasy places a fork of meat into his mouth
creasy whats a concubine
creasy opens his mouth takes the fork of meat back out
work in progress
why do you ask
it was in a book at school
maria and gomez wait to see how hell answer
well its a sort of wife
but the emperor of china had of them
how can that be
in the west its one wife for one husband but different cultures have different rules
it must be difficult having lots of wives
you feel sorry for the husband
in spanish yeah
can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand
maria and gomez burst out laughing
so funny that creasy smiles
pinta lights up at the sight
a huge victory
creasy youre smiling
he reverts to a frown
now pinta bursts out laughing
and creasy cant help but smile again
i guess i am
pinta changes subject
so how come you know so much about those countries
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there
also i enjoy history
work in progress
what did you do in asia
is that where you met the man with cigarettes
no that was in columbia
humming to himself as he brushes the leaves out of the empty swimming pool
cu of a water faucet unloads gallons a minute
raises up against the blue sky
like a kid playing cowboys and indians
the finger pulls an imaginary trigger
in her swimsuit and cap pinta crouches in makeshift starting blocks
pinta takes off
splashes into the water
not to creasys satisfaction
no no come back
pinta turns in the water looks back at him
you dont flinch when a gun goes off you react
dont listen for the sound dont anticipate it
concentrate on the sound itself
i dont understand
creasy points at the blocks
pinta gets out of the water
work in progress
shivering creasy throws a towel around her and rubs her down
on the way to school
pinta is stealing looks at creasys right hand
she knows the answer must be serious but she has to ask
creasy what happened to your hand
creasy looks at her a moment deciding
pinta practically holds her breath watches him knows the answer may come
creasy checks the mirror watches the road
a man asked me questions once
he smoked a lot
there was no ashtray
end of explanation
creasy continues watching the road
pinta watches him
remember you asked me what state i was from
where youre from isnt so much about geography its about events
where youre from is what happened to you
good things happen too creasy
smiles big like meeting me
after a beat i guess that really does make me a hard case
as the two of them share a laugh
lisa walking toward creasys room
as she moves to knock she sees the door is ajar hears voices
she peeks in
work in progress
creasy and pinta sit on the floor pencils papers and a book spread out before them
doing her history homework
hes charming and great with pinta
evelyn was right
do you have a girlfriend creasy
did you used to
two or three
lisa continues to watch the little play
she smiles knocks on the door as she opens it
pinta and creasy both look back over their shoulders
creasy tomorrow after you drop off pinta could you come back to take me to get my hair done
they both continue to look at her
she gets the feeling shes interrupting
alright ill leave you two to your history
as she goes
mexico city traffic is heavy
cars and people
creasy stands by the car across the street
cooling his heels
he can just catch a glimpse of lisa in the shop
suddenly the traffic seems to finish expending itself
the street goes ominously quiet
creasys antennae go up
a police car comes prowling down the empty street
creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front
then creasy spots a businessman coming out of a doorway with a bodyguard attached
the bodyguard is speaking into a two way radio
work in progress
creasys sixth sense tweaks as a mercedes pulls up to collect the businessman
and the cop car disappears around the corner even as two men start toward the businessman
lisa exits the hairdressers
creasy starts across the street toward her
a second car squeals around the corner behind the mercedes and everything goes to hell
and then creasy is there
his arm around lisas waist sweeping her off her feet
the next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a shop doorway creasy on top of her
the bodyguard beside the businessman is killed
the body guard in the mercedes trades a full magazine before hes shot
a pedestrian is killed
liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters
the businessman is hustled into the back of the second car
lisa sees the gun in creasys hands
she hears the slamming of the car door the screeching of tires
a parked van also hauling ass out of there
but then shes aware of something else
creasy on top of her
she feels his weight his heat
she watches as he rises goes to the curb
one bodyguard is sprawled dead across the ground
red blood on the sidewalk
as lisa closes her eyes
lisa sits in the backseat
through the window we can see creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the judicial police
finally he gets in the car starts to drive
work in progress
murdering people in the street
you had your gun why didnt you shoot them
the shoulders in front of her just shrug
nothing to do with me
besides there was another one in the passenger side of the van with a sawed off shotgun
if id started shooting his friends he wouldve had me
quiet a beat
lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her hair looks from it to creasy
a minimum close protection team consists of four men for high threat targets and environments
even in a low threat situation you need two guards plus a security trained driver
she shakes involuntarily
its hitting her
as they make eye contact through the mirror
the mercedes parked
creasy and lisa up against it
no cultured way to put it
a primal release for both of them
pinta waiting alone
then the gate swings back the mercedes drives through
smiling she hurries over hops in the passenger seat
happy to see him youre late
you were never late before i was worried
creasy doesnt answer
he actually looks guilty
pinta watches him a moment
work in progress
wheres my mother
i dropped her at home
its no wonder youre late
why didnt she just come with you
creasy doesnt answer just grunts
pinta keeps looking at him and it suddenly all makes sense
he looks over at her starts to say something then thinks better of it
do you think my mother likes you
shes for sure pissed
definitely aware and definitely jealous
creasys a bit amazed not sure how to respond
i think shes afraid of me
but not the same way most people are
pinta considers this
im not afraid you creasy
i know youre not
are you afraid of me
creasy looks at her almost like hes deciding
i used to be
but not anymore
her smile is huge
steam rising off the water
pinta stands with her eyes closed
creasy standing beside her brings two blocks together with a whack
work in progress
pinta flinches at the sound
she opens her eyes shrugs an apology at him
creasy frowns shakes his head
pinta closes her eyes again
he starts walking around her
frank oversees the whole program
the gunshot holds no fear
the gunshot holds no fear
you welcome the sound
the sound is what lets you go
the sound is what frees you
you are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound
eyes closed shes drifted off with his voice
and creasy whacks them together right in front of her face
pinta smiles at the sound
creasy smiles at the sight
pinta bolts from the blocks
pinta knifes into the water
pinta touches the far wall of the pool the finish line
creasy checks his watch claps
im tough creasy
im tough as you
theres no such thing as tough
youre either trained or untrained
pinta raises her arms overhead makes like rocky across the shallow end
creasy shakes his head in amusement
first light is just tracing outlines against the window
lisa alone in bed staring at the ceiling
frightened at what shes feeling
sleeping looking sexy
work in progress
as the mercedes pulls in another car is ahead of it
samuel is home a driver pulls his luggage from the trunk
pinta gets out of the mercedes
he gives her a pat on the head
simultaneously samuel fixes creasy with a look strides purposefully over
he thrusts out his hand shakes creasys
i want to thank you creasy
for what you did for my wife
creasy wants to choke but he just nods looks past samuel to pinta who looks bemused
he doesnt even want to know exactly what she knows
the car wash guy pedro ingratiates himself with samuel
creasys finger presses play
blue bayou begins
as he moves to sit in his chair he passes the scotch bottle
it has gone unopened
he ejects the shell from the breach of the mm smoothly catches it on the back of his hand
franks tail wags
where the song drifts down
pinta smiles closes her eyes
now she can go to sleep
samuel makes love to his wife
but lisa looks past him through the walls and floors to where that song plays
im going back someday come what may to blue bayou
work in progress
cu of creasy
the big swim meet
a lot of security men speaking into their wrists
for a public gathering the mood almost seems ominous
creasy and pinta exit the mercedes
pinta watches wistfully as her fellow students stream toward the water with their parents
whats so important in los angeles
your father has business
and whyd she have to go with him
no comforting answer for her
he looks around at some of the other bodyguards
ill be waiting here when youre done
but shes shaking her head adamantly
youre coming with me
a big marquee has been set up alongside the pool
coltish girls in swimsuits
parents socialize drink cocktails
bodyguards and security are outside of it on the perimeter
creasy looks completely out of place
stand near the finish line
pinta starts away
she turns looks back at him
work in progress
smiles knows im a prisoner in them
until the gunshot sets me free
hes serious now
as he watches her head off for the track sister anna steps up
creasy nice to see you
and now creasy is completely out of place
apologetic pintas parents are in los angeles
i was going to wait in the courtyard but
she takes his arm pats his hand
today you are her father
as creasy lets this sink in looks out where pinta is warming up
sister anna smiles heads off to a group of parents
were left with creasy
but clarity is creeping in
as the sky opens up around him
pointed up at precisely degrees
eyes closed serenely pinta surges forward leaving everyone behind
she hasnt even hit the water and he already knows shes won
ten meters in before she breaks the surface
her head sweeping left and then right
work in progress
wherever her competitors are its somewhere behind her
and the future everything ahead is wide open
pinta somersaults kicks off and is gone
and the finish line seems to come to her
cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall
watches her satisfied with what hes done
pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs
a beeline for creasy
and the poor fucker doesnt even understand until shes leaping the last few feet
into his arms
i won creasy
she loves him
creasy hugs her
he loves her back
a mariachi band roams
we see creasy but not who hes with
as we come around its pinta
sitting with them rayburn and his wife
and a sleeping four year old
note rethink following dialogue with reference to creasy rayburn background
my dad said all your friends were dead
all but one
the most important one
when we were eighteen we made an agreement to take the world together
then one day he calls and says im in love and im moving to mexico
i said what happened to the plan
work in progress
i said the plan was right here
rayburn looks at beautiful year old alicia and their four year old son sleeping
i hung up on him
when i met alicia i got it
alicia blows creasy a kiss
can i kiss her now or after youve gone to bed
okay i think now is as good as time as any
she takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket
she holds it out to creasy
he looks at her takes it from her hand
his thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring
pinta waits for his reaction as creasy pours a simple but fine medallion and chain into the palm of his hand
i bought it with my own money
i saved it
creasy is really affected tries to hide it
she takes it slips it over his head
jude the patron saint of lost causes
and hard cases
creasys the reason st
jude became a saint in the first place
yeah thats right
creasy looks at it considers
thank you pinta its beautiful
work in progress
pinta kisses him
as the mariachi band drifts over rayburn grabs his wife by the hand
come on baby
i feel like a third wheel
watch the kid
a waiter steps over refills creasys water glass
as he drinks
could i ask you a question
could i stop you
you dont drink like you used to
thats not a question
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles
still not a question
my mom drinks too
why do people drink creasy
now thats a question
i dont know about your mom
for me the problem isnt in the glass
the problems in between my ears
you think too much
because at one time i didnt think enough
pinta nods thinks she understands
samuel and lisa on the moving escalator
home from los angeles
they look down through the glass see creasy waiting for them below
and finally lisa frowns
work in progress
he has to go samuel
you were so pleased with him
pinta likes him too much
a beat she thinks of him as a father
samuel thinks about it is almost apologetic
ive just been so busy lisa
he has to go
samuel looks at her wonders at her adamancy
the three month trial ends in a week
i just wont confirm the position
that possibility was understood when i hired him
lisa gives him a look
she wants it done today
but for once samuel is stronger than his wife
i wont create bad feelings
and another week wont make a difference
off the escalator they turn toward creasy waiting unaware
it will be a hard break
shell get over it
work in progress
i wasnt thinking of pinta
as lisa looks over at samuel hes reaching out his hand smiling big
creasy how are you
as they shake hands
i dont want to play piano
i want to swim
no discussion pinta
lozzi is a famous teacher
if he accepts you you will play
as pinta marches out of the room
the sounds of samuels baby grand resonates throughout the villa
an impassioned rendering of a mozart symphony
pinta is looking for frank
today is saturday and on weekends frank is allowed to travel with them
and today she is claiming all her rights
pinta weve got to go
travel sucks at this time
pinta looking noble and brave
frank was a no show
not like him to miss a ride
work in progress
distant you should break all my fingers creasy then tape them back together
i wont be able to play the piano but i could still swim
dont be a baby
youre tougher than that
theres no such thing as tough creasy
just trained and untrained
smiles then be trained
im going to keep people safe someday
just like you
be a swimmer
i could do it
remember the day you wanted the pencil
i know why
and i saw that car again
i wrote the license number in my notebook
except i missed the last number
creasy checks his mirror nothing back there now
he then looks at pinta
a bit amazed
youll have to show me that number when we get home
a wide avenue
the mercedes pulls up parks in the only open spot
creasy and pinta get out
we walks her across the street along the lawn to the apartment building
they look up at the sound of piano keys tinkling above
then creasy looks at her smiles to himself
pinta looks back
continue to play in the wrong key like youre dyslexic
work in progress
a hopeless case that has a complete block about c minor
but remember whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves
new testament romans
you got that right
youll be back in the water in twenty four hours
creasy presses the buzzer
as they wait pinta sees something reaches down to pull a dandelion from a crack where the sidewalk meets the wall
she smiles at creasy
for you creasy
creasy takes it from her
hes saved by the bell as a second buzzer answers the first
creasy pulls the door open
pinta heaves a resigned sigh
as pinta nods disappears inside
the curtains rustle in the breeze
the sound of badly played scales
and then sounds of frustration
then the sound of the teacher playing
pinta appears in the window for just a moment
looking up from the window of the mercedes
as pinta is called back inside creasy checks out twirls the dandelion pinta gave him
hums to himself
work in progress
creasy leaning against the mercedes
traffic pounding by
the dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his shirt
and then suddenly traffic thins out
reminiscent of the previous two kidnappings
its a process
creasy straightens up
a judicial police car cruises by slowly
creasy makes eye contact with the two cops up front
the same guys who were at zona rosa
creasy starts across the street toward the apartment building
at the same time as
the door bangs open
she spots creasy a huge grin on her face
she was not accepted
and a white toyota corolla coming the other way
the police car reverses back cutting creasy off from pinta
the cops getting out big smiles on their faces
slides to a stop in front of pinta blocking her path to creasy
and as two men leap out from the backseat
drawing his mm run pinta run
but shes rooted with fear
and the men are almost on her
creasy raises the mm overhead
and the sound frees her
ducking under a flailing arm
quick and lithe
trying to reach her bodyguard
the cops drawing uzis
creasy plants himself the sig sauer now level
he fires twice into cop one dead center in the chest
chased by the two men
cop two returns fire wildly the mercedes hit in a ten bullet line
work in progress
creasy fires two more rounds into cop two whos hit high in the chest and throat
creasy pivots strides calmly forward firing at the men chasing pinta
man one goes down hit in the ribs
a bullet slams creasy in the back fired from inside the corolla
creasy fires back
man three falls dead hit just below his nose just above his teeth
the fat driver fires now and creasy is hit in the shoulder
and pinta disappears into the traffic
man two who has abandoned chasing pinta fires again
creasy drops the mm as he is hit in the stomach
he falls to his knees
the dandelion starts to come apart
drifting away piece by piece
slack jawed creasy looks about
sees the fat driver heaving himself out of the corolla while man two scans for pinta whos nowhere in sight
she got away
creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side
and pinta is back
running toward creasy
she cant leave him like this
she was safe and now shes back
she runs to him wraps her arms around him
man two catches up tears pinta away starts back for the sedan
creasy can only blink after them
work in progress
its not a cry for help
its anguish for him
man two crams her in the back seat follows
the fat driver gets back in behind the wheel
as the door slams shut wheels spin grip and the corolla accelerates away
we just see pinta look back through the rear windshield
an anguished image before shes pulled back down
creasy makes a wish
not for himself but for her
dont die creasy dont die
and everything goes very very sound breaks through first
the whir and beep of medical equipment
and we fade back into creasy hooked up
tubes running in and out of the unconscious man
and hes suddenly surrounded
the chief of the judicial police and several uniformed officers
at the foot of the bed several newspaper reporters and photographers
this man senor robert creasy an american citizen is under arrest for the murder of two police officers hector gonzalez and pablo lunara
he is also the prime suspect in the kidnapping of pinta martin ramos
one of the officers props up creasys head
the chief puffs his chest out and flashes flash
sounds of a dog barking bruno opens the door to a very distraught frank
someone had locked him in there
work in progress
in the dark
halfway to mourning already
a hubbub drifts up from the rooms below
a bedraggled looking samuel sits with jordan by the phone
an insurance company lawyer is here as well
maria cries softly in a doorway
montage of chaos and panic
judicial police are trying to set up shop
when did he say he would call back
cut to do not tell them you have a kidnap policy
cut to they usually ask for three times the amount they expect
they react as two vehicles pull up outside
chaos as the front door opens
men in suits several policemen
their very well groomed leader is colonel tazinari
i am ernesto tazinari commandante of the judicial anti kidnapping division
we do not need or want police involvement
i am the negotiator
we feel a better guarantee of getting pinta back without your involvement
i have a written order from the public ministry
two police officers were killed
he holds up the phone this is the attorney general navarro bernal diaz
jordan accepts reality
theyre taking control
work in progress
the law requires an intervention by the authorities de officio
a ringing phone sounds like an bomb exploding in the room
a technician answers
jordan takes the receiver
we hear the conversation
the kidnapper only wants to talk to the father
everybody is one headsets monitoring
samuel listens carefully
jordan prompts him with hand written replies on a notepad
samuel negotiates the amount via notes from his lawyer
i cannot afford thirty million
i will need to borrow the money
samuel proposes five million
kidnapper gets angry
the realities are i do not have access to this type of money
they settle at ten million
the kidnapper gives a list of instructions
two and a half million in two different bags
the bags you can get from save on
fifteen gallon black canvas divide the money equally
samuel is on another phone talking to family friends asking if they will front a hundred thousand dollars each
which will be paid back by the k r insurance in days
yes i will give you interest
i will instruct you on the exchange over the next hours
work in progress
lisa is nowhere to be found
locked in her bedroom in darkness with frank
another showcase press conference
more reporters and now tv news crews
the girl is a mexican citizen
her father is samuel valencia ramos
rosanna the woman we saw on t
earlier stands watching and listening
incredulous and angry
miguel manzano the director of afi also seen earlier on tv approaches with his two assistants and kisses rosanna on the cheek
a bodyguard was shot trying to protect a year old
the bodyguards american
not only that hes black
is that good or bad
he shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack
theyre saying hes responsible
manzano looks bemused as he eats a sugary pastry
rosanna heads into the press conference
beside the american in custody are any other americans involved in the kidnapping
were looking into it
rosanna cant believe what shes hearing
work in progress
the two officers who were killed
records show they were off duty at the time
the chief frowns at the sight of rosanna knows what a royal pain in the ass she is
manzano awaits his answer
im not sure
all i know is they died bravely
he turns points out another reporter
if they were off duty why were they in a patrol car
what exactly were they doing at the scene of a kidnapping
he stares back over at her furious
were they known for their exceptional good luck
they were known for their professionalism and integrity
it opens and out slides rayburn
he looks down the hallway
press conference is still going down that way
rayburn heads the other way
but as he tries to enter creasys room hes met in the door by two thug cops in uniform
cop two pokes a finger into rayburns chest
who are you
im here to see my friend
cop two pokes him again
work in progress
rayburn swallows his anger starts fishing for his wallet
suddenly the thugs snap to attention
manzano is on the way down followed by adjutant and two ignoring the proffered salutes manzano finishes his pastry licks his fingertips as he regards rayburn
when i heard it was this hospital i was so pleased
theres a pastry shop nearby
do you know it
rayburn shakes his head
the best pastries in mexico
manzano holds out his right hand
creasy out of it still
rayburn and manzano at the foot of the bed
hes not a cop killer
im sure he isnt
though hes certainly adept at killing
he was doing his job protecting the girl
if police were involved you figure it out
im here for him
so am i
and creasy stirs
rayburn leans into his friend manzano just behind him
you hear me crease
creasys eyes slit open
whispers you got three of the fuckers
work in progress
two days gone
theyre negotiating a ransom
these things take time mr
creasy closes his eyes
technicians police tazinari jordan and samuel all listen intently to the call

jordan supervises the transfer while the k r agent takes an incoming call
the call between the voice and jordan continues

the delivery car with a white shirt held out of the window

samuel exits the car and goes to the payphone
the phone is ringing
samuel picks it up and listens
we need proof of life
is the father there
jordan hands the phone to samuel
work in progress
if this girls life is as important to you as it is to me do not play with the process
family is everything
i am a professional
you keep your word and i will keep mine
creasy being wheeled down the hall by a tough plain clothed federal policeman
followed by rayburn manzano and rosanna
the uniformed judicial police are powerless to stop them
whats the deal here
i wouldnt gamble leaving him here
these guys will kill him in a heartbeat while trying to stop him from escaping
tazinari dialing his cellphone
he said no phones
you do your job
ill do mine
samuels car is parked on the south side of the bridge
a shirtless samuel carries two large duffle bags containing ten million dollars across the bridge
we see tazinari again dialing up his cell phone
leave the money in the trunk of the car with white paper taped to the windshield then return to your car and go home
do not look back
samuel finds the car leaves the bag in the trunk he turns and heads back over the bridge
remember i am a professional
if you keep your word i will keep mine
if you do not then god be with your child
work in progress
as samuel is walking back across the bridge
suddenly gunfire from where he came along with shouting and yelling
samuel crouches and runs in the dark back to his car with tazinari
cages of mangy looking mutts
pull back to reveal creasy on his hospital bed ivs and all
rayburn sits nearby
he looks up as creasy stirs wakes again
creasys eyes flicker to his friend ask the first question on his mind
rayburn looks away cant face his friend
and suddenly creasy knows
rayburn finally nods
and with that gesture god takes everything away
it might as well be the old testament
and we are about to get biblical
creasy turns his head looks up at the ceiling
it was a fuck up
someone hijacked the drop
the kidnapper his nephew got killed
cu of creasys face with his back to the room
a thousand yard stare
his eyes glaze over
cu of pinta looking up at creasy
the camera ramps into pintas smile
a small but a sinificant moment in terms of their connection
the curtains are drawn tight
slivers of light illuminate the darkened room
lisa sits on the end of the bed humming a nursery rhyme
she rocks gently
you betrayed me
you killed my nephew and took the money
no not us
no we did not
work in progress
remember my words
family is everything and do not play with the process
the phone line goes dead
creasy still staring into space
shes dead creasy
creasy blinks away a solitary tear
dogs barking constantly
manzano walks the hall flanked by a doctor and a nurse
a second policeman manzanos adjutant brings up the rear carrying two heavy binders
they fucked with the process and his nephew died
he suffered gunshot wounds to the upper extremity chest and abdomen
he has a collapsed lung which is stabilized injured his spleen which we may have to remove and ruptured his intestine
hes on strict bedrest or theres a good chance we could lose him
a strange man
he has much experience of hospitals
did he say so
but a nurse knows
manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside the bed
the adjutant flips through one of the binders
each page holds a single mugshot
each time creasy shakes his head the adjutant flips to the next photo
work in progress
creasy shakes his head
excellent work by the way
three men dead
only ten rounds fired
creasy shakes his head at the next shot
if two of the men in my division could shoot like that i could get rid of the other thirty six
one of the dogs starts to bark
soon ten of them
the vet assistant enters shouts at them to quiet
manzano ignores it motions the adjutant to flip pages
what am i doing here
believe it or not youre safe here
the judicial police will kill you
if they can
re book this page
the adjutant reaches the last page
creasy shakes his head
you have a rather checkered past
your interpol file is six pages long
am i a suspect
it would be convenient but no
as manzano packs up his mugshot books
show me mugshots of mexican policemen
maybe then well get somewhere
work in progress
all these photos you just saw were of policemen
sadly theyre protected
manzano heads off
as creasy watches after him
creasy sitting on the gurney rayburn buttons his shirt
rayburn gets creasys arm over his shoulder eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the floor
creasy winces but the two of them start to walk out
an suv rolling away
lights out engine off
it coasts a hundred yards before the engine turns over
rayburn behind the wheel
as it sweeps past camera
rayburn constantly checking the rear view
no pursuit in sight
he looks over at creasy
how do you feel
creasy looks over at him finally shrugs
ill get you up to the border
friend of minell take you in to san diego
drop you right at the hospital
creasys not really listening
hes been looking in the passenger side view mirror
nothing back there
creasy sits up
a bit of an effort
got a thing i gotta do first
work in progress
scene of the crime
typical mexican roadside shrines where the policemen fell
a pyre of flowers where pinta was scooped up creasys blood still staining the sidewalk alongside
a car pulls up
rosanna guerrero gets out with a reporter and photographer
she directs them in spanish
the reporter starts making notes the photographer snaps photos of the shrine
rosanna stands by the flower pyre
something catches her eye
a balled up piece of paper and a half burned candle beside it
as she picks it up she spots something else
across the street creasy walks
an awkward hitch in his stride
outside the apartment of the piano teacher surveying the scene with experienced eyes
unaware of rosanna corolla
a lot of people are looking for you
i guess that makes you the smart one
were interested in the same thing
im writing a story
creasy walks away from her
rosanna catches up and holds out a plastic ziploc
this might interest you
i found it across the street
creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand
a small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle
creasy unballs the paper
its a photo
flash creasy at the police station
his photo taken
work in progress
its santa muerte
the religion of la hermanidad
theres a curse on you
its a little late
he hands it back to her not interested
as he turns to go
what are you going to do
creasy doesnt answer
i can help
i have a situation mr
there is a brotherhood called le hermanidad which protects both high ranking government officials corrupt police and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch
i believe you were a victim of this organization
you and this story may help to unmask them
creasy looks carefully at rosanna
right now he trusts no one
he walks away towards rayburn
the suv parked a discreet distance away
rayburn grinds out another cigarette mutters to himself
bruno lets him in
nothings been touched
creasy retrieves his bullet from his shrine along with the jack marlboros and new testament
puts his few possessions in a bag
move with him as he silently crosses out into the hall heads toward
he stands there a moment
his pain entirely his own
and then he goes to pintas little desk finds her school notebook buried in a pile
he flips through it until he finds
work in progress
the license plate number pinta jotted for him
then he notices the notebook is really a diary
every page references her day to day relationship with creasy
i love you creasy bear
he hears soft footsteps
lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown her eyes drilling through creasy
softly you let them take her
she loved you and you let them take her
creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him
why are you here
why didnt you die
shrugs i was already dead
eyes brimming lisa has no more words
but creasy comes bearing cold comfort
i want you to know something
a beat im going to kill them
anyone who opens their eyes at me
lisa doesnt answer but the connection between them is suddenly monumental
finally creasy looks away
he picks up pintas battered old teddy bear
he turns but she doesnt look back at him
kill them creasy
as he continues away
kill them all
creasy exits the house and stands by the pool
frank appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort creasy
work in progress
leaves blow across the surface of the water
underwater slow motion a wall turn
it looks remarkably like pinta
blue bayou drifts through the air
soft in the ether somewhere
creasy hears it half raises his head
why blue bayou creasy
is that where youre from
shes standing behind him
wearing the all too familiar one piece swimsuit she towels her wet hair
blue bayou is a dream pinta
dreams are beautiful creasy bear but life is better
smiles why are you here
i have to watch you now
the words are a salve a balm
he turns looks back over his shoulder
hes all alone
rayburn looks over his shoulder sees creasy walking down the street
clutching a teddy bear
creasy gets in the car
youll be stateside by suppertime
finally as rayburn lights a cigarette
im going to need help ray
rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit knows what just was asked
creasy needs help unleashing a plague
work in progress
look at you you wont last a day the shape youre in
unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed
yes or no
after a beat i wont kill again
i gave that up
creasy reaches into a pocket hands rayburn a hand written list
rayburn reads his eyes widening
youre talking war
the surface breaks as creasy enters the water wearing a red t shirt to hide the bandages
he begins a slow laborious stroke
a pale attempt at getting back into shape
a ribbon of maroon trails him through the water
fluorescents flicker on
a fiat up on the hydraulic lift
a section of the garage is portioned off by heavy steel sheeting with a padlocked door
one of the two men unlocks it
creasy and rayburn enter
three long steel tables
covered with weapons
every town in mexico has one if you know what door to bang on
creasy stops by the pistols
ill take the
and the webley
i know its old fashioned but its reliable
work in progress
next hes looking at grenades
he hefts two different choices
i need less than standard packing
can you knock up a case for fifteen of each
he picks up a double barrel shotgun checks the line of it
he flicks open the breach snaps it shut
indicating cut the stock here
the barrel here
make sure you file it smooth
looks around rocket launchers
not far from here
jump cuts of the following being loaded into a bag
colt ammo clips bodyarmor the kind you wear under your clothing nightvision scope a couple of flash bang grenades flex cuffs a silent mm beretta a small shotgun pepper spray
and four cellphones
rosanna picks up phone
creasy holding the card rosanna gave him
maybe i can help your situation and you mine
so where do we begin
i need the name and address of the owner of a toyota corolla license number me
we didnt get the last digit so i need the ten possible matches
so what do i get in return
work in progress
lets see how the relationship develops
ill call you in the am
creasy hangs up
manzano rosanna and technicians are listening to voice analysis tapes of various kidnappers
rosanna hands the piece of paper with the license plate number to manzano
hell die of his wounds bleed to death before he can do anything
he sounded strong to me
stronger than we are
because hes outside
because hes not tied to the same system we are
we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings including the little girl
the same man the dreamer
listen to this
manzano plays back a recording of the kidnapper
i used to run through the streets of neza because i was scared of being fucked with
i swore one day i would cross the street walking
now i walk
hes protected by la hermanidad
i know this
creasy is not a policeman
my sense is he could be very valuable to us
rosanna waits for a response
work in progress
then what do you have to lose
its a moral issue
on one hand youre cleaning up the bad guys but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys
finally deciding manzano turns holds out his hand
as rosanna hands him the paper with the partial license written on it
jorge ramirez the lb
driver who shot creasy in the shoulder exits
whistling to himself gets behind the wheel of a fiat
unaware hes being shadowed by a man on a scooter
as it comes to a stop
jorge gets out
we hear the scooter whine as jorge crosses the street and enters a creasy watches and waits
time lapse of the building jorge exits the building still trying to get the last button of his police uniform closed
hes a cop
he struggles to get behind the wheel of the fiat
the car is tiny
someones getting in on the passenger side
as jorge starts to protest creasy rams a sig into his gut
at the same time he takes jorges gun from its holster
incredulous do you know who i am
you are jorge ramirez
creasy jams him in the gut again
work in progress
jorge starts the engine
as he eases out into traffic
a car graveyard sitting on top of a foot cliff overlooking a real tough barrio
gravel crunches under the fiats tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff
turn off the ignition
jorge does as hes told
suddenly the sig comes down hard
as jorges vision explodes
still in the drivers seat jorge wakes
the first thing he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel with his pudgy white fingers exposed
he is naked reminiscent of the year old in the opening sequence
can you hear me
jorge nods the pain in his head blinding
i am going to ask questions
if you dont answer fully and truthfully you will suffer much more than you have to
creasy opens pintas notebook to a blank page near the end
he clicks open a pen
creasy presses in the cars cigarette lighter
then he opens a buck knife
jorge winces at the sound of the blade locking
im going to cut your fingers off
one by one
if i have to
the cigarette lighter pops back out
thats to cauterize the stubs
work in progress
holy sweet jesus
sweat drips down jorges forehead
he tries to master his fear
do you know who i am
who are you
i am the president of la hermanidad
without warning creasy reaches up with the buck knife a flash of steel
the big man howls his left ear suddenly missing starts an epic struggle practically breaking the wheel off the steering column
he is like a bucking rhinoceros
he howls as creasy sprays his face with pepper spray
the passenger side door opens and creasy stumbles out
some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well
creasy wipes his tearing eyes
and then he turns
hefting the knife in his hand he marches back toward the car
and then a terrible scream
blood squirts against the inside of the windshield
the car rocks on its shocks
and then another terrible scream
stares at the stump of his right forefinger smoke rising up off it
creasy sticks the lighter back in its hole
and creasy looking at him devoid of emotion
wh wh what do you want to know
it takes a moment for creasy to come back
he picks up the pen and notebook
the ramos kidnapping
how did it work
work in progress
i dont know
we were just given instructions to take her
ordered by who
as creasy sets the pen down
i dont know
creasy jerks back jorges middle finger raises the knife
a mile a minute i dont know
we work in parts
a voice calls in a kidnapping
we deliver the target to the guardians
we dont even know them
they might transfer to other guardians
the negotiators and the bosses dont even see the target
they just make the deal
who ordered it
the cops call him the dreamer
where do i find him
shrugs terrified i dont know
no one knows
scream as the knife comes down
creasy tosses the finger out the window wipes some of jorges blood off his cheek
i dont know i swear
after a beat i believe you
crying im professional
i just do my job
work in progress
tell me about the guardians
he called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch
the one who transferred pinta to their car
flashbacks see pinta being manhandled from the white fiat to the trunk of grand marquis
she has been bound and taped around the mouth and eyes
creasy looks like hell kill him on the spot
muzzles his sig into the palm of jorges right hand
i dont know but i know his face
creasy cocks the trigger
i see him sometimes at the handball court in chapultepec on a saturday afternoon
how do i recognize him
he has a tattoo covering two thirds of his back
he is part of the brotherhood
in the next hour where do i find your partner
one one three arco iris
creasy closes the notebook caps the pen
a gunshot echoes over the barrio
creasy gets out of the car reaches back to release the emergency brake
work in progress
the fiat goes over the cliff
kids playing soccer
one of them kicks an errant pass
it skips down the street toward an approaching creasy
the kids shout for him to kick the ball back but he ignores them
as the kids curse him out creasy enters
boom up alongside the building
a man steps to a third floor window
man two who stuffed pinta into the car
his name is sandri
and were inside
sandri italian immigrant putting his cufflinks through his shirt sleeves
wearing a shoulder holster
a satisfied smile as he looks back into the room
at the bed
a year old girl under the sheet
nods when will i see you again
pulling on his suit coat sandri steps to the door
he mimes a pistol action with his forefinger and thumb
he opens it to find himself staring square into the eyes of creasy
he rests the twin barrels of the sawed off shotgun square against sandris chest
her name was pinta
sandri registers the name
creasy swings the shotgun down to sandris groin
a flock of pigeons explode out of the jacaranda trees
do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
there is no authority except from god
work in progress
creasy swimming toward the far wall
as he rolls kicks off its pinta who emerges from the bubbles swimming back the over way
pinta swims through the a maroon cloud filtering through the water
cu of pintas diary
creasy opens it up
the bullet sits in the center crease
he thumbs through the pages stopping on different days
illustrating those pages
intense game with big money stakes
a sea of criminal faces cheer on the gladiators from the bleachers
its a close match
a pound guardian removes his t shirt before serving
turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two thirds of his back
creasy registers his prey
a small russian taurus crests a hill and descends into hell
a frightening looking barrio
burnt out cars and dead dogs line the sidewalks
creasy tails the guardian on his moped into the center of a trash dump
the focal point being a semi derelict church within a gated compound
our tattooed handball genius exits the taurus
reaches in back for the groceries
guardian two steps over carries a pistol
he slides back a speakeasy slot to reveal our tattooed guardian
guardian one stands at the slot
creasy is pressed up against the wall out of sight
he holds the shotgun wrapped in a ragged beach towel
as the door unlocks and opens and guardian one steps in creasy slides in right behind him
work in progress
as the butt of the shotgun makes contact with guardian twos mouth
blood spouts as his front teeth are smashed in
as he raises his hands to his face the pistol he holds discharges into the ceiling
guardian one watches as creasy clubs him again in the head
frightened footsteps running on the other side of a plywood wall
a female voice yelling from the other room
creasy gauges their whereabouts
creasy fires into the wall
guardian three freezes mid stride
its a tough looking woman in her s
the three guardians stand facing the wall
hands bound with tape or cuffed
naked like our year old other than their dirty skivvies
creasy holds up a picture of pinta
picture taken from her schoolbook
tell me about the girl
all three look
and with a strange defiant arrogance
who the fucks that
creasy kills guardian one
the two guardians each bound in two different rooms
both have their eyes taped shut
creasy interrogates guardian two
how does it work
everything on the cellphone
we wait for calls
we have no number to call
creasy picks a cell phone up off the table hits redial
its a blocked line
work in progress
who pays you
we have an atm bank card
we draw out dollars every two weeks
creasy takes the atm card from guardian twos shirt pocket as he lies on the floor
whats the pin number
the number you use at the bank machine
four seven four seven
who killed her
dont lie to me
the boss did or his brother
whos the boss
we dont know
we never see his face
we have to wait in the other room
he was screaming to the girl that
flashback guardians pov
hearing the above
his nephew was killed in the exchange
and the money was stolen
work in progress
the ransom money
at the drop
he said tazinari one of the policemen had taken it
he was crazy
head of the antikidnapping division
flashback guardians pov
see the wall shake from a bodily impact
creasy shoots guardian two
guardian three female becomes a panicked whirling dervish at the sound
a moment later creasy is there
tearing the tape off her eyes
the white tiled room we saw pinta held in
the door opens and guardian three leads creasy in
he was screaming about the money and his dead nephew
he threw the little girl against the wall
the female guardian points
creasy steps over
theres a smear of blood against the wall
she wasnt moving
they threw her body in the trunk of the car and drove away
flashback guardians pov through window
we glimpse through a dirty window pintas body being put into a car trunk
the bosss brother i recognize his voice
its high pitched
we call him woody woodpecker
work in progress
now listen to me
if you tell me where to find the boss
i will let you live
i dont know
and creasy stands there a moment
realizes she is telling the truth
and the sound that snaps him out of it
a girl crying
and creasy is suddenly moving down
after the sound
he kicks open a door
in a x room
a year old girl
bound and blindfolded
flashcut we think its pinta for a heartbeat but its not
a window to the left explodes as the room is enveloped in flames
the front door opens a weird sight
creasy exits holding both the year olds hand and the female guardian whos bound and blindfolded in her underwear
they walk straight at camera as flames shoot out of the roof
creasy has set the place on fire
creasy is on fire
and as they continue to walk towards us
therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgement on themselves
now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed
a telephone ringing
rosanna at her desk
she picks up the phone
work in progress
where are you
was a little girl kidnapped recently
about twelve maybe
do you know something
what was her name
creasy on the cellphone the small russian taurus in the background
he stands outside the building still holding the little girls hand
she has the same lost look he does
female guardian in the back of car
the girl looks up at the name
into phone ive got her
creasy hands the girl an ice cream cone
he looks over as rosanna hurries over from across the street
creasy puts the little girls hand into rosannas
i need something
do you have banking connections
i have connections
creasy hands her the atm card
work in progress
the pin number is
i need to know whose account it is
rosanna notices the blood on creasys shirt
near his stomach
where do i find you
ill call you tomorrow
creasy looks at the girl and starts off then looks back
what do you know about the cop
the one who made the ransom drop with samuel ramos
hes an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation
hes high on my hit list
where does he live
he lives in a judicial compound
he travels by motorcade
he has better protection than george bush
even more importantly he is part of la hermanidad
his reach is far and wide
give me the address
photos of dead kidnappers on the wall jorge and sandri
sandri emasculated one hand missing
jorge behind the wheel fingers stubs and a missing ear
two in one day
and they died very badly
sandri and jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last six months
manzano studies the photo of jorge
work in progress
whoever did this was methodical unafraid
was jorges mugshot in the photos we showed creasy
no i checked
but right after sandri was shot a girlfriend of his was found naked hysterical in the street
she said it was a man fitting creasys description who shot him
creasy was and maybe is again a very lethal human being
you dont seem very surprised
manzano looks at his adjutant pleased with his perception
but he isnt sharing
whats surprising these days
an afi agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken
manzano takes a bite moans in pleasure
only a virgin cooks like this
laughs your mans here
interrogation room two
seen through a two way mirror
manzano watches as
rayburn sits at a steel chair bolted to the floor
rayburns eyes are closed
then slowly his arms extend out to the sides
manzano is curious as slower still rayburn extends both hands out in front of him palms up
must be a zen thing
then both middle fingers are extended
with eyes still closed rayburn mouths fuck you
manzano bursts a laugh
work in progress
rayburn opens his eyes looks over as manzano enters
still eating he hands rayburn a second plate of chicken
chicken and chorizo sausage
they marinate it in lemon and orange juice
its a stew really
sets it down i already ate
manzano enjoys another bite then
tell me about your friend creasy
you just said it
hes my friend
nothing else to say
i read the file
you and creasy have seen quite a bit together
two tourists who never went home
you helped him get this job
thats what friends do
but if i traced creasy to you others will do it as well
their facilities are as good as my own if not better
i can take care of myself
you and creasy both
a two man army according to interpol
lebanon with the druze
where you were contracted by the u
army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders
laughs you two were a married couple
work in progress
the kind that gets divorced but still stay friends
what happened to him
what happened to creasy
rayburn flinches at some bitter memory
none of your business
or mine for that matter
i got nothing more to say
this is my jurisdiction
i want these men as much as creasy does
hell deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals
so stay out of his way
i plan to
ill even help him if i can
hes going to lead me to the the dreamer
someone i want very badly
but id like to understand him
give me that
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you
tragic a public outcry but a number
one more dead
what was she to creasy then
at the end of a long dark tunnel
somehow she showed him it was alright to live again
and they took that away
a man can be an artist in anything
stone paint words
anything if his soul is true to it
creasys art is death
and hes about to paint his masterpiece
the words sink in
manzano understands their magnitude
work in progress
i got jap businessmen to drive across the border
so if youll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here
framed commendations fall to the carpet as rosanna slams up against the wall of manzanos office
skirt up around her waist manzano moves inside of her
between breaths is it true
creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday
and left three more dead men
she bites the heel of his palm to keep from crying out
when you talked to him did he look sane
not by the rules of polite society at least
i think hes
as they both climax pressed up hard against each other
smiles you only fuck me to get information
smiles back you only give information so you can fuck me
a beautiful circle
he kisses her turned on again already
lets put creasy to press
theres a vigilante cleaning up mexico
an unstoppable hero
as manzano considers this likes it rosanna takes the atm card out from her bra
work in progress
and as long as were talking information theres something else as well
as he takes card i should start going for your tits first
underwater as pinta swims
as she spins kicks off the wall its creasy who comes out the other side
a plume of red blossoming off his side
this is done over and over faster and faster closer and closer
the blood becomes darker bigger
and we push into that blood until its finally obscuring everything
a row of newspapers being set out
creasys face on the front page of every one of them
a quaint old mexico neighborhood
we follow a long canvas bag being carried through the streets
carried by creasy
toward the end of the street and a ground floor apartment
walks past a canary yellow coup deville which has seen better days
an elderly couple eating lunch
the husband looks over at a knock on the door
he stands answers it
creasy slides in eases the door shut behind him
gun in hand
im not here to hurt you
i need to borrow your house and your car
are you the proud owners of the coupe deville
a military operation as tazinari is led out to his car
two heavy gray sedans wait
tazinari gets in the back of the second car with his aide de camp
the door is shut behind them
the door closes with an hermetic whump
the two cars pull away toward the opening front gates
work in progress
creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two chairs
if you promise to speak softly and not to shout i wont have to tape your mouths
the old man looks to his wife then back to creasy
the old man watches as creasy opens he canvas bag pulls out two metal tubes that he screws together
its a rocket launcher
next he pulls out a cone shaped missile
the old man is starting to look curious
did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood
creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it back into the tube
i know of you
youre the american
the bodyguard whos killing the kidnapper
creasy doesnt answer steps into the center of the room
in the church they say to forgive
forgiveness is between them and god
its my job to arrange the meeting
creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows and in a line to the wall with a household catholic alter
christ on the cross sits front and center
do you have an old blanket you dont care about
i dont want to burn that wall
a figure rises framed in the window
and pinta stands beside him
as she puts her fingers in her ears
creasy looks back over his shoulder but of course shes not there
work in progress
creasy fires the rocket launcher
a gout of flame erupts from the back
but creasy has hung a blanket on the wall
eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them
the driver stands on the brakes
the car explodes is obliterated really from the inside out
tazinaris car slams into the debris of the lead car and slides sideways against a wall wedging it in
a man on fire strides through the smoke and dust
a shotgun at his side and a molotov cocktail in his left hand
without missing a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window
a scary prospect even though its bullet proof
the lit molotov explodes beneath the car
then a dull impact explosion
feet of flames envelope the car
the driver and tazinari both prisoners inside their own car
the driver exits releasing a full clip from his uzi
creasy nails him with a single shot to the head
tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air
there sits the canary yellow coupe deville
eyes and mouth taped shut hands and ankles bound by flex cuffs
tazinari stands there
creasy steps up pulls the tape off tazinaris eyes
he looks about relatively calm considering
you know where you are
as tazinari tries to process
work in progress
under the bridge
where the deal went south
now why dont you tell me what went down
creasy tears the tape off his mouth
do you know who i am
i am the commandante of the judicial anti kidnapping division
and one of the founding members of la hermanidad
creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket flips it open
as tazinari reacts creasy spins him round slits his clothes up from ankle to neck
the cloth drops away some hanging at tazinaris wrists
tazinari has a sudden loss of attitude
close up tazinari hands being cuff flexed and tied to side view mirrors of the coupe deville
cut back to see tazinari naked other than his calvin klein skivvies spread eagled across the grill of the car butt forward reminiscent of the woods scene in creasy rips
down his calvins
cu of tazinaris face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort
thats not my dick
thats the barrel of your own gun
shoved up your own ass
as tazinari reacts
now hows your hearing
we hear the click of the trigger being cocked back
work in progress
its all up to you commandante
tell me about you and the dreamer
creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the record button
i dont know him
i saw the opportunity and got lucky
that he used policemen
that you killed them it made it a police matter
the ramos family couldnt refuse our involvement
and i had my men ready
you stole the drop
more flashes as we see this happen
pov from opposite side of the bridge
pov from the drop car
see the money drop get ambushed by unknown faces
the nephew gets shot
the kidnapper running the show sounds like woody woodpecker high pitched squeaky voice
you done it before
tazinari doesnt answer
creasy gives the magnum a tweak
so tell me more
there was no ten million dollars
the ransom was ten
work in progress
two and a half
thats how much there was
dont lie to me
two and a half
the rest was paper
strips of paper
flashback tazinari in his office sifting through the paper
maybe your men stole from you
whoever took the rest took it before the exchange
who gave the bags to ramos
flashback ramos house
bags of cash being switched from the mercedes with the flat tire to the nd mercedes in the garage
see that jordan does the switch four bags on the floor
as creasy thinks
tazinari has been stretched to his limit
thats all i know
im sorry for the girl
but it was business
im a professional
thats what everybody keeps saying
creasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it
relief for tazinari as the
creasy walks around the car tazinari now looking like a naked hood ornament
work in progress
average speed m
this is mexico
creasy slips the clutch jumps out and the coup deville kangaroos forward down the ramp
gathering momentum into the oncoming traffic
tazinari screams right on impact
flambouyant beautiful year old boy with a black eye and bloody nose
terrified and in tears runs down the hallway
a huge maroon cloud covers the center of the pool
in the middle of the cloud is jordan face down floating on the surface dressed in his beige linen suit
close up of jordan face down
we glimpse what we dont want to see
black holes where his eyes and mouth were
his ears missing
creasy not terribly impressed
just pissed that hes late
creasy on a cell phone talking to rosanna another favor
get me banking info on jordan kalfus
deposits or withdrawals
oh get me the same on samuel ramos
how do i contact you
we still dont have the atm info
you dont ill call you
i have a tape recording that i am sure will interest you
creasy doing laps
he swims the last few meters underwater
as he surfaces pinta waits by the edge
she nods in grim satisfaction
work in progress
he isnt doing well
the cloud of deep red emanating from his stomach envelopes his whole body
samuel eats dinner silently
lisa just stares into space nursing a vodka
even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death
the door opens and they expect to see maria with the deserts
creasy enters and sits at the table like a dinner guest
to samuel im going to talk to your wife
if you move or say one word ill kill you
he takes a colt officer model
semi automatic pistol out of his waistband and lays it on the table in preparation for something we dont know what
he turns to lisa
im going to tell you a story
your lawyer is dead
someone didnt want him talking
last week he wired
million into his u
colonel ernesto tazinari is also dead
he hijacked the ransom drop another
if my arithmetic is correct it means million remains
creasy looks to samuel
your husband magically had five million deposited in a u
bank account last friday
lisas eyes never leave creasys
trying to discern whether this is true or not
they planned it samuel and kalfus
work in progress
kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse
im sure he thought shed sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv
it didnt work out that way
everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity
creasy gestures with a finger to his lips
on the surface it was low risk and high return
this was the third autosequestra jordan had organized for clients
the other two succeeded
samuel looks to lisa
our lifestyle was in jeopardy
my pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination
i wasnt sure about whether to go through with it or not
then i woke up one day and it was done
beat jordan was supposed to take care of it
through all of the above creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet
he empties the other cartridges from his gun
lisa suddenly attacks samuel in a violent emotional outburst of tears screaming and rage
drawing blood from his nose and upper lip
samuel smothers lisas arms beneath his
he appears strong and decisive for the first time
creasy very carefully takes the bullet puts it into the magazine and chambers the round
he looks into samuels eyes
a bullet does not lie
a bullet tells the truth
and the truth will set you free
creasy hands samuel the gun
in many ways i think this bullet should be shared between you and lisa
work in progress
creasy exits the room
samuel kisses lisa on the forehead and exits onto the terrace
lisa just sits
where will she find air to breathe
life moves on with its brutal inevitability
this is a river whose course cannot be altered
from the backseat i can see creasys eyes in the mirror
he watches and thinks
he never smiles
i wish i was back in the front seat with him
i wish he would smile
creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city
and a smile comes
but its bitter and hopeless
its half grief half not knowing where to go next what to do
and hes dying
he knows that too
creasy dials a number on a cell phone
i traced the pin
i have an address for you
but i need to see you
i show you give me the information
work in progress
back on rosanna
we see shes sitting in the afi operations center amongst technicians surveillance and listening devices and manzano
we can hear the interior of a family house kids a frustrated mother a mexican soap playing in the b
to manzano we got the whole place wiretapped
but no males that sound anything like the dreamer
manzano is carrying a x digital blow up of a handsome mexican john gotti type in some nightclub environment
hes the man the boss
my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots
we had to inject the whole barrio
we bugged the house and stole the picture of him
manzano looks at rosanna
nows the time to really pressure him
lets publish his picture in tomorrows edition
rosanna understands the consequences makes light of them
so how are going to recipricate
manzano discreetly slides his hands up her crotch
her car draws up
her driver exits and opens her door
she steps out
but waiting inside is a welcoming committee
a hooded figure wielding a shotgun who shoots the driver in both knees
work in progress
hooded figure waves the shotgun under rosannas nose
then disappears into the darkness
rosanna in her apartment in the dark
a tear trails her cheek
cu of the proofsheet of the next days newspaper
the boss picture full frame
creasy moves in the shadows looking remarkably strong considering his wounds
video being shot
he hasnt arrived alone
as he disappears inside
the owner watches nervously as creasy approaches wearing a wool cap
a pale attempt at disguising his identity
theres a newspaper folded on his dais more photos of creasy his dead targets the story of his vendetta
im looking for rosanna guerrero
empty restaurant chairs on tables
an exterior streetlight illuminates the darkness
the owner leads him down a row of empty booths
creasy slows stops as he sees the only person waiting for him is manzano
as manzano smiles
holds up paper hombre en fuego
man on fire
thats what the papers have named you
its what you and rosanna named me
work in progress
everything that happens from now on does so with my permission
you wont find a better carne asada in all of mexico
the table is covered in an arrangement of the best food you will ever find in mexico
laughs at himself the last few days may represent the best police work of my life
what do you want
the same thing as you
except my reach isnt as long as yours
my father was a policemen did you know that
i dont know shit about you
he was one of the original founders of le hermanidad in the days when it represented good not evil
manzano smiles he likes creasy
he was murdered
and now here i am
trying to honor his memory
hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption
the organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where i would need a presidential finding in order to expose it
the waiter steps over manzano waves him off
my family lives in miami
because of the death threats
its not worth it
be with them instead
work in progress
it galls me to watch you
you can do as much in days as i can in years
men like the the dreamer are protected
out of everyones grasp it seems but yours
are you going to arrest me or talk me to death
manzano laughs again
creasy cracks him up
my country needs justice
gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence
they need to be brought to trial
dealt with properly
then people will respect the law
when they see it works
so you are going to talk me to death
you walk out and deal justice
youre what i wish i could be
another laugh then a beat the policemen who kills you his family will have all they want
then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids
what do you want
i want to arrest you for murder
i want to shake your hand and reload your gun
i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing
my deal is with rosanna
i knew you guys were up to something
are you two fucking
no but i have to admit i thought about it
just tell me who the bank card belongs to
name and address
work in progress
you have no interest in making things easy do you
manzano reaches into his pocket
he pulls out a folded piece of paper and a prescription bottle
he hands the bottle out first
i imagine you need handfuls by now
creasy makes no move to take it
manzano sighs sets it down in front of him
regarding the paper
account belongs to a woman we think is the dreamers girlfriend
reina rosas who is months pregnant
creasy holds his hand out
the plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the boss
youll lead me and ill arrest him
creasy doesnt respond
finally manzano gives him the paper a mimeographed mugshot and address scrawled on it
as he scoops up the pills
creasy starts out
creasy turns id have liked to have known you under different circumstances
off the top of my head i dont know what they couldve been
as creasy departs
work in progress
romans chapter therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgment on themselves
now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed
full page photo of the boss on the front page of a tiered house built into the rock face that runs through mexico city
a scooter is parked
a man sits on it waiting wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well known features
its difficult to say where they are coming from
the view passes from one screen to another
as creasys passes we hear the whispered crackle of radio communications
creasy sits up as a car pulls up and a man gets out
creasy checks the digital x even though this face is indelibly imprinted on his brain
its not the dreamer
not as handsome but theres a resemblance
the man unlocks the front door checks the street first and then enters
creasy regroups mentally and physically
checks the magazine in his sig sauer
chambers rounds into his shotgun
looks up and sees a six year old on a bicycle approach the front door
a ten year old opens the door from inside
the six year old struggles to get his bicycle through the doorway
he holds the shotgun against his leg as he strides across the street
man on fire
the bicycle makes it in
and the door is closing
creasy gets a foot in forces his way inside
work in progress
manzano listens to a radio over a desk speaker
what should we do
keys mic do nothing
the pregnant woman reina rosas screaming bloody murder as creasy fills the space behind her
creasy follows as she runs
creasy faces reina heavily pregnant
two other kids hide behind her
suddenly the wall next to creasy explodes in a hail of bullets
we realize creasy caught one round in the chest
hes down on one knee
uses the shotgun as a crutch
reina is screaming
hear a door torn open
creasy moves to the sound
a man has run out the back
creasy steps into courtyard turns a vw bug coming right at him
aims his weapon
windshield shatters from the blast of creasys shotgun
bug slams into wall
the man rolls out
using the door as a shield
the man flees into a labyrinth of packing crate houses on car tire foundations out into street
running hard too hard for creasy in his condition
he is losing a lot of blood
behind the wheel of the volkswagon roars out chasing
work in progress
now through the maze of poverty
creasy drives hard
no sign of the man
empty eyes of poverty looking back
mostly women and children
they clearly see creasy
driving a car with no windshield
he slams the car into reverse
someone says creasy aloud
now more faces to turn
children looking directly through his absent windshield
one skinny kid runs ahead of creasy
the boy points at one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco wall
creasy pops the clutch
straight into a small house
taking whole walls of cardboard
to the back brick wall
the man is pinned violently between the car and the wall
creasy shotgun in one hand the injured man in the other
walks through the barrio
a small crowd is yelling creasy man on fire in spanish hombre en fuego
the man badly broken and bleeding lies on the floor flex cuffed
reina screams at creasy
creasys popping percodans
the hysteria is peaking
creasy chambers a round and shoots man through left knee
screams then silence
how do you contact the boss
creasy chambers another round and holds the gun to mans right knee
we page him and he calls back on this cell phone
work in progress
what is his name
he pulls the hammer back
daniel rosas sanchez
so youre married to him
and this looks remarkably like his brother
creasy looks to man semiconscious on the floor
she nods what is his name
aurillio rosas sanchez
technician listens into the living room conversation and speaks to manzano over the radio
what do we do
prepare yourself for an incoming call
congregating around maps and a triggerfish a means of tracing the location of a cell phone
cell phone ringing
creasy pauses picks up the cell
ive got your family and i want to negotiate
what do you want
work in progress
i want you
several beats of silence
we can hear daniels breathing
how much do you want
its non negotiable
two million u
three million u
i told you non negotiable
daniel hangs up
cell phone ringing
daniel has a different attitude a lot more amenable
he tries to speak to creasy very logically about a very illogical subject
the most important thing in life is family
and there you are
you have my family
what do you want
i want you
this is not possible
but in that house i have money
if i tell you where work in progress
interrupts your brother wants to talk to you
holding the shotgun with his right hand creasy holds the phone to aurillios ear
creasy shoots aurillio in his right kneecap
as aurillio howls in agony
listen to me
im going to take your family apart piece by piece
the line goes dead
creasys ready to explode
under the sink
we have money under the sink
six million dollars
its wet but good
the phone begins to ring again
i will give you a life for a life
what do you mean
her life for your life
youre a liar
work in progress
im a businessman
a dead girl is worth nothing
she is alive
a long beat
i want proof of life
what did she call her bear
daniel hangs up
aurillio moans on the floor
reina says the rosary
the kids cry
the phone rings
creasy listens not capable of speaking
she calls the bear creasy bear
time stands still for creasy
liquid film in creasys eyes
close up of creasys shocked face
he pulls down his shirt collar
bubbles of blood form and reform over his chest wound as the maroon spreads across his chest and stomach
vans on the move
team leader radios
we received enough of a signal to at least put him in the zona colonia
shit not enough time
he hung up
great ac without the front windshield
keeps him awake
daniel sanchez v
detailing the drop
creasy trying desperately to drive and write down the address
lisa dont hang up on me
pinta is alive
work in progress
blinds are drawn
slivers of light illuminate her emotionally drained face
silence i dont believe you
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction
i dont believe you
then dont come
he cannot waste his ebbing strength
darkness has fallen
few people are on the street as creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge
shes not coming
checks his watch turns and walks toward the bridge
the ramos mercedes drives up the bridge
lisa is driving
she exits the car
she runs to catch creasy
if you do something stupid we wont get her back
he climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his dignity through the pain
he can see cars parked on the other side
other side of the bridge creasys pov creasys dreamlike pov is it real or a dream a driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door
a small figure in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants exits the car
work in progress
breathing labored breaths
he sees it all
the driver unties little hands
removes a blindfold from under the hood
he steps away
offering no help
the small figure is confused
creasy calls out pinta
she turns and looks
it looks remarkably like her even under the hooded sweatshirt
she begins to run
across the street up the steps toward creasy
a screaming train flashes beneath
car headlights illuminate the bridge
time stands still and the city sounds fade out to nothing
she runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the bridge
her hood blows off revealing her full face
its definitely pinta
camera ramps as he jumps into creasys arms
this is not the little girl we experienced in the beginning of the movie
the experience she just endured has been life changing
all of a sudden we have a year old head on an year old body
she wraps herself around him
he picks her up
we glimpse a simple tear on his cheek
but we do not hear the words
she notices her mom on the far side of the bridge
creasy maneuvers her toward lisa
before she goes to her mother we hear i love you creasy
and you love me right
the inference is that he will see her in a few minutes
we start to hear linda ronstadt painfully quietly on the wind singing blue bayou
he continues to walk across to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the kidnappers car
work in progress
theres a certain sort of calm of him
he closes the door he lays his head against the back window
he looks out at pinta at the other side of the bridge where shes screams for creasy
blue bayou gets louder
pinta now knows it was a lie
creasy is not coming back
were shooting through the glass of the back window
we se mexico city reflected in the glass
as the car pulls out time slows and we see creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down into a dark tunnel
pinta can see creasys face eyes slowly closing
he can hear her screams before being enveloped by the night
as blue bayou continues
dark spot in the road
suddenly police lights on the roofs of four cars flash simultaneously in front in blocking position
the driver turns and looks back wanting to escape
he has a blacked out afi armored van right on his rear bumper
nowhere to go
swat at his door
hes pulled and proned out onto the road
manzano enters the drivers seat
reaching back to creasy
grabs his hand
im your chauffeur now creasy
manzano does a u turn
on his portable radio
commence the operation
he reaches back again
close up two hands clasp
creasys left with manzanos right
a strong grip
then no response
manzano pulls to the curb
manzano reaches creasys wrist
takes his pulse
work in progress
still holding creasy
unfolds creasys fingers
close up pintas medallion of st
jude clutched in his hand
manzano punches the seat again again and again
manzano looks at creasy and makes a decision
keys mic hold at the perimeter
until i enter
dark suburban cuernavaca street
creasys car rounds the corner
security outside the compound motions to open the garage doors
the driver of the car is faceless
street light reflections across the windshield
the car enters the gates
a collection of armed bodies appear in the courtyard curious to see this national hero
hombre en fuego
the car stops
this beat seems interminable
a hand opens the rear door his forehead explodes
the driver door opens barely two shots two more bodies drop
panic and confusion
everybody runs for cover
an overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the courtyard
an armored vehicle rams through the gates
manzano explodes out of the drivers door in slow motion
he is clearly on a mission
he strides through the mayhem creasys sig sauer in one hand and a
auto in the other
manzanos guide to his destination is the the dreamers little jack russell running back to his master on instinct
manzano moves purposefully
his surrounding environment is chaplinesque in its chaos
he enters a long walkway to a patio following the dog
daniel sanchez appears at the end of the hall
we ramp him into slow motion
the mexican version of gotti
he raises his arms prepared for the inevitable
the outcome is a given
work in progress
manzano unloads a magazine into him and we ezekiel
blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder
of lost children
