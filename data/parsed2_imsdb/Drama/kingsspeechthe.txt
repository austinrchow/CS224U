written by david seidler a shimmering surface of cold water held in an immense free standing white enamelled bathtub with gilded lions legs bulges in slow motion to the chords
of handels trumpet volunteer
a head emerges
white gloved hands in livery rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels
the ritual continues with crisp military precision
close on the royal coat of arms stamped in gold lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp thistle and more lions denoting england ireland scotland
the shield is surmounted by a crown
this emblem is on a cuff link fastened on a starched white shirt
trousers pressed to a knife edge are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted
mirror polished boots are laced tight
jacket held ready
arms shoulders chest received
glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions
epaulets edged with gold braid tassels are adjusted
polished buttons are fastened
multi coloured collar clasped shut
white ostrich feathers topping a tri corner hat are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair
pan down to the handsome features of albert duke of york known to his family as bertie
hes in his late thirties the second son of king george v the reigning king of england
he conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which hes been bedecked
reflected in a full length mirror bertie tells himself tks seidler
you look like a christmas tree
he smiles wanly
the royal standard flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill
liveried footmen open the doors of a stately austin princess
bertie exits york house with his young wife elizabeth considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land truly an english rose
golden labradors and corgis appear from all directions weaving between them barking boisterously creating a happy chaos
elizabeth and bertie glance upwards and wave
two little girls lilibet and margaret rose aged eight and four wave back from their nursery window
bertie nervously lights a cigarette
elizabeth pats his hand
buck up bertie
the bbc said it wouldnt rain
berties pov speakers corner with its assortment of orators prophets protestors and onlookers gathered around soapboxs agreeing disagreeing shouting comments
others carry placards sing protest songs
a miners strike is the focus of the day
a large rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing austin and stares at the occupants
reverse angle berties face stares back
the first drops splatter against the glass
never trust the wireless
berties face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour which segues into a gargling sound
a gentleman in a tuxedo carnation in boutonniere is gargling while a technician holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the ready
the man in the tuxedo is a bbc news reader
he expectorates discreetly into the bowl wipes his mouth fastidiously and signals to another technician who produces an atomizer
the reader opens his mouth squeezes the rubber bulb and sprays his inner throat
now hes ready
he looks to the control room
the floor manager begins a count down five
ladies and gentlemen good afternoon
this is the bbc national and world programmes taking you to wembley stadium
he speaks in flawless pear shaped tones
theres no higher creature in the vocal world
elevated shot looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas hiding the spectators from view
bertie and elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded chairs with the other dignitaries
they are king george v a barrel chested man with naval beard and uniform accompanied by his wife
queen mary an elegant but icy grande dame
dr cosmo lang a tall unctuous churchman with a high domed balding head and a perpetual expression of moral superiority
winston churchill a politician of sixty as portly as lang is lean
they are bantering rivals in ambition
stanley baldwin the prime minister of the day
his hair as always parted down the middle
neville chamberlain chancellor of the exchequer
tall thin lugubrious with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk
a bbc technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on springs next to the stadium equipment
it looks frightening even to us
berties shoulders brace as though expecting a blow
elizabeth sees his terror
why wasnt he told
ten million people listening around the world mam
as though bertie didnt exist his brother and father have been broadcasting since last year
the king growing impatient hisses get on with it
show what youre made of
bertie moves forward diffidently without an ounce of confidence knowing deep within hes doomed
his stomach knots chest muscles contract constricting his breath
luh luh lords la la ladies gen tell men
it is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter
a man who cannot speak in public
lang whispers to churchill
when lang whispers everyone can hear
i wouldnt miss his highness maiden voyage for all the world
and on such an important occasion
lang really is a piece of work
for ease of reading berties stutter is not indicated from this point on in the script
no doubt you wish the prince of wales was standing before you today
pov a sea of dripping umbrellas
this is going to be a torment for him and his audience
a glowing dial on the face of a studio radio
everyone listening intently
stuttering profoundly be that as it may
my brother david is attending to other duties in the furthest parts of this vast empire
the radio falls silent
eyes widen in concern
bertie stands frozen his mouth agape jaw muscles locked
he knows hes considered by all especially himself unfit for public life
elizabeth is devastated
just needs more practice
tracking shot rain splatters on brass plaques denoting dr this or dr that specialists in various maladies
halt at a plaque that reads lionel logue speech specialist
umbrella stand coat rack wooden waiting bench thats all
the door is flung open and elizabeth enters drenched her hat decorated with white silk roses now limp
a veil covers her features
calls imperiously are you there
from behind a door in the lav
princess elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing
shes further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed and startled by the entrance of lionel logue
hes in his forties tall with piercing eyes and charismatic features
his demeanor is friendly but professional
the accent although australian is not heavy he is after all a speech therapist
how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
worlds greatest villain
just wants to be bad
sorry no receptionist
he offers to shake hands
she doesnt take it even though shes gloved
with sang froid id be more comfortable in your office
thats for clients
wheres mister j
he doesnt know im here
thats not a promising start
my husbands seen everyone
they were all useless
hes given up hope
a bit premature
because he hasnt seen you
lionel doesnt disgree
youre very sure of yourself
im sure of anyone who wants to be cured
of course my husband wants to be cured
his position requires public speaking upon occasion
i fear the requirement may grow more frequent
he should change jobs
something of that nature
well have your hubby pop by and give his personal history
ill make a frank appraisal
logue tries to object but she over rides
i do not have a hubby
we never talk about our private lives
nor do we pop
you must come to us
sorry this is my game played on my turf by my rules
the lady lifts her veil
perhaps youll make an exception
he recognizes her instantly and is clearly impressed yet refuses to be intimidated
i thought the appointment was for johnson
a name used during the great war when the navy didnt wish the enemy to know his royal highness was aboard
im considered the enemy
you will be should you continue to be un obliging
for my method to succeed there must be mutual trust complete honesty and total equality
that process takes place in my consultation room
in which case
re lowering her veil i should have kept my pledge
i promised my husband id stop seeking the great cure
ive wasted your time
she exits closing the door firmly behind her
bloody hell i buggered that
the sound of something solid meeting leather
a foot kicks a ball
lionel is returning home from work
hes a well known fixture locally
some lads are playing footie
one of them passes the ball to lionel who despite briefcase and rolled brolly dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and entering a modest brownstone
as lionel mounts the stairs hes set upon by three sturdy boys valentine ian and peter with handkerchiefs tied around the lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick
stand and deliver
falling into the game ow dares molest
jack the ripper
the boys scream with delight and a sword fight ensues lionel using his brolly
beware highwaymen or ill run yee through
were swagmen not highwaymen dad
then beware jolly swagmen ill skewer yer gizzards
lionel wife myrtle appears at the head of the stairs a sweet faced down to earth woman
youll all hang from the gallows if you dont come for tea
boys i think wed best go up
logue myrtle and the boys are finishing at the table
had a visit from a lady today
another spoiled silly
may we be excused
you must stay bored stupid listening to your parents inane conversation
grinning thanks dad
they start to leave
take your plates
the boys grabs their plates and exit
after a moment
no wonder about the silly
youre so good at what you do
at what i do
then deliberately being theatrical twas a lady with a capital l
oh lionel thatd get us home in grand style wouldnt it
she came on behalf of her husband
which is not the proper way
i told her i was fully booked
myrtle is clearly disappointed she was
too high and mighty
know what i mean
theres an unspoken code between them
we wouldnt want that
covers her letdown
hard to feel sorry for that sort
silence then had a call
wish me luck
loads and loads
elizabeth fashionably attired for an evening out is curled on a bearskin rug reading peter pan to the girls
darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late
the birds were flown
bertie enters handsome in a tuxedo
elizabeth closes the book
tomorrow chapter iv the flight
the two little girls clap with joy
oh to fly away
werent they lucky
within his family berties stutter is virtually absent
one would have to learn to fly properly of course
now a daddy story
can i be a penguin instead
he drops to his knees and waddles
in his tux he looks like a penguin
the girls giggle but are undeterred
the horsie story please
called upon to perform the stutter returns slightly
but the two girls listen raptly ignoring their fathers minor impediment and it fades
once upon a time there were two horsies
a white horse that went clip clop clip clop through hyde park
and a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through hyde park
they met in the middle of hyde park
the white horse said neigh
the black horse said neigh
the white horse continued on clip clop clip clop through hyde park
the black horse continued on clip clop clip clop through hyde park
and thats the end of the story
now off to bed
as the girls exit a silly story really
but father tells it rather well
the girls have gone
he said come round to the fort on friday and stay for dinner
will she be there
seriously shell be there
i think i meant
is david serious
about our coming
a married american
he cant be
movements behind a curtain
from the auditorium now
someone pushes through a gap
falters begins again
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york
his elocution is crisp and flawless
his acting however is unconvincing
and all the clouds that lourd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
interrupts crisply thank you
but i dont hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king
lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity
what do you suggest
continue to do whatever you do and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction
crushed lionel retreats behind the curtain
cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights
on the parade ground grenadier guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers
viewing stands are beginning to fill
the kings voice is heard stride boldly up to the bloody thing stare it square in the eye and talk to it as you would to any decent englishman
the kings study resembles a naval captains cabin
both men are uniformed for a state occasion
bertie regards the bbc microphone as though it were an alien
i d d dont thu thu think i c c can
in the presence of his father berties stuttering returns in full form his breathing short and shallow the muscles in spasms
show whos in command
if you dont this devilish device will change everything
used to be all a king had to do was look reasonable in uniform and not fall off his horse
now we must creep cap in hand into peoples homes that smell of boiled cabbage and speak nicely to them
were reduced to that lowest basest of all creatures
dont give me a look of defeated pathos
this is a family crisis
father were not a family were a firm
his father shoots bertie a surprised look
does the lad have a brain after all
were the oldest most successful corporation in the world and sitting on thrones is our business
but any moment now we may be out of work
your brother came to me the other day livid a certain lady has been refused an invitation to my silver jubilee
i pointed out she wasnt a lady and most definitely wasnt his wife
what did david say
she made him sublimely happy
i said that was probably because she was sleeping with him
i give you my word weve never had immoral relations
as my son as prince of wales as my heir do you solemnly swear your friendship with this woman is an absolutely clean one
i do he said
look me in the eye i said
on my honour he said
stared straight at his father
oh my brother
when im dead that boy will ruin himself this family and this nation within twelve months
wholl pick up the pieces
davids friend oswald mosley
his black shirt british union of fascists are marching through london
hitler terrorizing half of europe stalin the other half
wholl stand between us the jackboots and the proletarian abyss
a red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning blinks
whatre you going to say
the usual guff
the archbishop writes it
my people love to hear me say it
spoken fluently of course
theyre interrupted by the entrance of the bbc news reader and technicians
thats the chap who taught me how to use this contraption
you touch your chin with your thumb and the thing with the end of your little finger
assisted by the technicians the news reader sprays his throat
good evening ladies and gentlemen this is the bbc broadcasting direct from buckingham palace upon the occasion of the royal silver jubilee
his majesty king george the fifth
to the mike i can only say to you my very very dear people that the queen and i thank you from the depths of our hearts for all the
loyalty and may i say so
the love with which this day and always you have surrounded us
i dedicate myself anew to your service for all the years that may still be given to me
the news reader terribly moved whispers to his technicians tks seidler
thats how a king speaks
adds with splendid false modesty i showed hm how to do it
the edge of the crowd is visible
one can sense a vast sea of humanity
when the glass doors of the upper balcony open the murmur becomes a roar
when the king steps out it becomes tumultuous
the king is joined by queen mary and the archbishop of canterbury other royals and dignitaries
the noise is deafening
the king beckons impatiently for someone still inside to join them
its bertie with elizabeth
they didnt come to see us father
bedding his american whore
come join the fun
aside to elizabeth youll have to do a lot more of this
im sending him to the midlands
with all the factory noise they wont hear a word he says
the king goes back to waving
elizabeth is stunned at the prospect
the roar of the crowd segues into the roar of machinery
huge industrial wheels whir in neutral
workers are lined up dutifully to hear the visiting royal
berties lips move but with the noise he cannot be heard
elizabeth watches in relief
then a foreman trying to be helpful signals
the machinery halts the factory falls silent
at first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries bertie forward
whats needed is cooperation
hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory brings berties stutter back in full form
buh buh between the cuh cuh classses
one of the workers sullenly pulls a chain releasing a blast from a steam whistle that drowns bertie out
the royal standard fluttering
elizabeth and bertie in the back
is this necessary
you know perfectly well
as they pass a corner news stand the headline chalkboard reads neglects to tell them what must be done how its to be done and whos to do it
david has the touch
they adore him
as the austin halts for lights people stare to see whos inside
ill wager theyre saying theres the useless one who cant speak
bertie and elizabeth enter
she explains in a whisper tks seidler
theres no receptionist
elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door
loudly the johnsons
from the inner office
not finished yet
elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav
howd you find this physician
poker faced classifieds next to saucy model shepherds market
bertie smiles despite his mood
comes highly recommended
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor
realizes oh dear perhaps hes a bolshevik
im not sure i want to see this fellow
im not sure he wants to see you
the consultation room door opens and a working class young woman anna comes out then realizes with a gasp who they are
she retreats rapidly back into the consulting room
perhaps this was a mistake
after an uncomfortable moment anna returns attempting to be properly formal and stutters you can go in now mr
im not actually mr
whispers terrified i know
then to elizabeth dr logue says
wait here if you wish
or it being a pleasant day take a stroll
to the consultation room was that alright
choking up thank you
anna flees quickly
johnson do come in
the yorks look at each other
a totally different universe from the spartan waiting area
a world of books piles of them spilling everywhere
two slightly shabby but comfortable armchairs
well worn turkish rug
hotplate and two chipped mugs
model airplanes hanging from the ceiling
the walls are pearl grey and smoky blue
my wifes favorite colours
here in a doctors office berties stutter returns
glad we have something in common
berties head bangs into one of the models
my lads build them
make yourself comfortable
youre too close
five paces is the rule of thumb
that might be difficult in this office
bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair
nice girl anna
worried she wouldnt find a husband if she couldnt speak
tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner
the perfect woman
sorry bad australian joke
whyd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment
i cant discuss that
what can we talk about
when speaking with a royal one waits for the royal to start the conversation and chose the topic
that wont work here
i admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time
they stare at each other
you call this making me comfortable
you call this being forthcoming
arent you interested in treating me
only if youre interested in being cured
no thank you
i need one
turns on the hot plate
any idea what youre letting yourself in for
apparently a great deal of rudeness doctor logue
call me lionel
i prefer doctor
i prefer lionel
my family calls me far worse
what shall i call you
the duke of york is appropriate
your royal highness then
much more informal
ive lots of names to choose from
how about bertie
flushes only my family uses that
thats what ill call you then
we must be true equals
if we were equal i wouldnt be here id be at home with my family and no one would give a damn
bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case
dont do that
bertie gives him an astonished look
sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you
my physicians say its good for stuttering relaxes the throat
theyve all been knighted
makes it official then
house rules no smoking
i thought here were equal
as a monarchist i thought youd appreciate these are my digs and here i rule
what was your earliest memory
i beg your pardon
first recollection of the world
stutter growing in intensity im not here to discuss personal matters
whyre you here then
exploding because i bloody well stutter
and you bloody well cant fix it
one of my numerous faults
do you stutter when you think
dont be ridiculous
one of my many faults
how about when you talk to yourself
i dont talk to myself
come on everyone natters to themselves once in a while bertie
stop calling me that
shant call you anything else
then we shant speak
the jug has boiled
lionel makes himself a cup of tea
must i pay for this
now when you talk to yourself do you stutter
of course not
proving your impediment isnt a permanent internal fixture
when i give a speech
i bloody stutter
bet you a bob you can read flawlessly right here right now
bitterly easy money
see your shilling then
royals dont carry money
logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table
ill stake you
pay me back next time
if there is a next time
correct i havent agreed to take you on
during this logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus a recording device with earphones
he sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone then hands bertie an open book
bertie glares at it defiantly
i certainly cant read the bard
bertie reads stuttering badly and getting worse
to be or not to be that is the question
whether it is wiser
reaches for the coin
not so fast
i proved i cant read
you proved you cant listen
hands bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones
bertie doesnt want to take them
a princely bob is at stake
bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones
logue turns a dial
loud music is heard
bertie takes off the earphones
the music stops
youre playing music
how can i hear what im saying
bertie youre royal
surely a princes brain knows what its mouth is doing
youre not well acquainted with royal princes are you
i want to demonstrate that when you cant hear your voice you dont stutter thus proving your impediment is not innate
bertie replaces the earphones
again the loud music
his lips move as he reads but all that can be heard is the music
finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the music ceases
he reaches for the coin but logue snatches it
i was terrible
i know how i sound
would i lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence
ive no idea what an australian might do for that sort of money
logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it to bertie
souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter
bertie glances at the record
pov the label hmv his masters voice
elizabeth trying to be gracious has been cooling her heels with a working class mother and her young son willie
im finished with your husband
im finished with doctor logue
they exit curtly
hows it going mate
william isnt trying hard enough
why am i not surprised
the yorks are being driven home
as they pass speakers corner oswald mosleys blackshirt british union of fascists are out in full force
the bloody man did parlour tricks and cheated me out of a shilling
in fury he rolls down the window and is about to throw away the record
elizabeth stops him
he quickly rolls up the window
the sound of an approaching aircraft engine
a grass strip cut into the moors
bertie waits beside a shooting break the stiff breeze whipping his coat as a small plane lands and taxis
the cockpit canopy slides back and the pilot leaps out removing his leather helmet and goggles revealing hair gleaming like gold perfect teeth flashing a dentists smile
this is david the prince of wales prince charming the medias darling a sun god descended from the skies accustomed to being worshipped by all
teasing with a false stutter hello b b bertie
b b been waiting long
whereve you been
bertie stutters badly in the presence of his brother
i was busy
so was i
elizabeth has pneumonia
bertie shoots him a look
hes doing this on purpose
some sod tipped him off wallis is getting a quickie divorce and were going to make our marriage a fait accompli
as an act of pure spite fathers trying to depart prematurely in order to complicate matters
the break almost careens off the lane
you believe that
wallis explained it
shes terribly clever
the king is propped up in bed wrapped in his favorite faded tibetan dressing gown hooked to an oxygen tank
hes surrounded by his wife queen mary his two eldest sons his secretary clive wigram his personal physician dr dawson and a nurse
wigram presents a tray with papers and pen
the instruments of succession your majesty
the king is so feeble he can barely make his mark
glares at david
god help us
he waves them out of the room but beckons wigram to come close and whispers something in his ear
at the appropriate moment your majesty
the king nods
clear soup is being served at the immense table
places set for five but only bertie and his mother are seated
the clinking of silver and china
finally i want my jewelry divided equally
elizabeth gets first choice
shes not greedy
may i remind you youre not the one whos dying mother
where are the others
lord wigram and dr dawson are making arrangements
what sort of arrangements
they didnt say
david hunched over a table appears to be sobbing
he doesnt hear berties discreet knock
seeing his brother crying bertie is deeply moved puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
david pulls away as though touched by a leper and covers the receiver in his hand
im on with wallis
as though bertie didnt exist tks seidler
i know darling a talk even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy
nor making our own drowsies either as weve had to do far too often lately
kisses the phone til then sweet love
hangs up wally misses me terribly mother says youre late for supper
david glares at a clock
clocks set five minutes in advance so as not to be late
when im king i shall set them back
bertie and david enter to find wigram and dawson with their mother
lord wigram has requested permission to order the coffin
nobody wants to take responsibility
the queen looks to david
theyre interrupted by a butler
the archbishop of canterbury
who the hell invited him
somebody should bloody well dis invite him
that would be rash
youre not your father
his grace can be a persistent enemy
we need friends
david knows hes referring to the simpson affair
show the toad in
lang is already sweeping towards them
whatever can i contribute in this dreadful hour
the men are huddled with cigars and port composing a news release
bertie acts as secretary
the others nod
the kings life is moving peacefully to its
to its close
as a man of letters youre heaven sent to assist in the editing of our press communique
ill telephone this through to the bbc and alert the times to hold the morning edition
the problem is
if were to keep to schedule
time is running out
the clock is approaching midnight
is my father late for death
we wouldnt want the news delivered by the disreputable afternoon press would we
the brothers look at him
he expains who knows what sensational side issues those tabloids might report
perhaps a peaceful termination
all eyes on david
the nurse looks aghast as dr dawson administers an injection
three quarters of a gram of morphia and a gram of cocaine injected into the distended jugular vein
you may leave
she does so sobbing
everyone watches silently as the kings breathing slows the twitching jugular subsides then all movement ceases
dawson takes the pulse and consults his watch
david sets the hand of the rooms big clock back by five minutes
time of expiration pm
queen mary curtsies in homage to the new king taking her eldest sons hand and kissing it
when she looks up
her eyes are chilling
long live the king
bertie in despair and grief has been describing to elizabeth what happened
the look in mothers eyes it was
he notices something on his desk the record logue made
pov the label his masters voice stares up at him
he releases his emotions in an outburst of anger
whats this bloody thing doing here
the man was a total fraud
he picks up the record and is about to smash it against the edge of his desk then realizes the mess that would make and tosses it into a waste
then changes his mind
would you like to hear
well i think you should
you should know what goes on
telling me he could help me read flawlessly
listen to this babble
bertie takes the record from the trash and walks to a victrola stand lifts the arm places the steel needle expecting to hear his stuttering voice
instead what he hears is flawless and flowing to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
the needle sticks tks seidler
sea of troubles and by opposing end them
and by opposing end them
and by opposing
bertie lifts the needle
he and his wife stare at each other there are tears in her eyes
the roar of a huge delirious crowd is heard growing in volume
the roar becomes chillingly recognizable zeig heil
hitler giving one of his mass rally speeches continues
the brass numbers appears on the blackness
it is the black front door of the prime ministers residence
the fuhrers tirade continues as camera moves through the door into downing street itself
camera explores the dwelling during which hitler grows louder and more shrill until the glowing light of an illuminated dial of a radio listened to by churchill and baldwin
they wear black armbands
turn that devil off
the hysteria stops
if only one could do that so easily in real life
chamberlain thinks that hitler can be reasoned with
neville is an old woman
thats the direction its going winston
youre out of step
well see who trips and falls
ive asked you here because you seem to be the only sensible member of the kings camp
nice of you to say so stanley
is he willing to be reasonable
depends on the definition
bluntly has he seen the light
our monarch basks in the warming rays of a celestial orb
her name is wally
baldwins face clouds once again
a headline screams hitler rattles sabre
lionel is at his desk reading the newspaper as his sons sprawl on the floor building a model airplane
time for a shake dad
pleased you sure
clearly this is a much loved ritual
lionel disappears into a closet
bet its the scottish play
perhaps something with falstaff
ominous thumps within the closet
art thou afeard
lionel lumbers out of the closet a pillow stuffed into his jacket to create a monstrous hunchback
his acting performed just for his children is quite magical
be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that if then i had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in
dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i waked i cried to dream again
the lads are enthralled
the door bell rings
lionel is not expecting anyone
the austin princess waits at the curb
bertie is at the door
he rings the bell again
lionel is stunned covers must be a tradesman
off you go lads
mum should be home from work
the boys gather their things deposit the model plane on a chair stow the building materials in a box and exit the back way
lionel goes to the door but doesnt open it
logue expressionless doesnt respond
bertie is torn part of him wants to flee yet he desperately needs to be let in
he knows what must be done
this is a huge step for him
the door opens
i didnt expect you
i didnt expect to be here
may i come in
my wife doesnt think its a good idea
myrtles never met me
ive never met myrtle
may we discuss myrtle in private
its not proper talking about our women on the street
lonel gives him a look but lets him him
as they enter bertie notices what happened to your shoulder
lionel hastily removes the pillow tosses it away
whats your myrtle got to do with me
elizabeth doesnt much care for you either but here i am
that woman has style
which is why she dislikes you
youre far too familiar
referring to the consultation room may we discuss this properly
they enter you look dreadful
another example of exactly the sort of thing you dont say to a royal
and youre too close
but youre not royal in this room
which is precisely why elizabeth dislikes you
he starts to sit
a model airplane was nestling in the armchair
curtis bi plane now a curtis mono wing
oh i say im terribly sorry
tell your lads ill buy a new one
lionel takes out the box of model building gear the boys left
you dont have any money
ill fix it
so bertie what brings you here
your fathers death
bertie is silent
mine lay rigid fists clenched angrily at his sides daring the reaper take me you bastard
what was he angry about
i was a great disappointment
thought hed be proud of you
so did i
a man of stature
pause tks seidler
i was informed after the fact my fathers last words were bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together
pause couldnt say that to my face
then your mother
coughed herself to death when i was young
i remember going to the theatre with her
not real theatre
ive been to australia
not where i lived
blurts my brother
thats why im here
whats he done
im going home now
you must undersand i cant puh puh puh
his jaw and throat muscles constrict
try singing it
know any songs
happens to be my favorite
fascinated by the plane repairs may i help
always wanted to build models
father wouldnt allow it
i had to collect stamps
he collected stamps
only if you sing
goes like this
sings way down upon the
i know the words
sings way down upon the swanee river
you didnt stutter
of course i didnt stutter i was singing
one doesnt stutter when one sings
then well i cant waltz around on state occasions warbling
you can with me
thats because youre peculiar
i take that as a compliment
cut some struts from the balsa
sorry hard to show you what to do at five paces
would you like a cup of tea
lionel fires up the hot plate
you were about to sing an aria concerning your brother
im not crooning to the tune of swanee river
try camptown races then
sings the arch of c he said to me doo dah doo dah
that sort of thing
i cant talk or sing about your future king doo dah doo dah
my future king
hes your future king too
did that cause friction
knowing hed grow up to be king but you wouldnt
ive always looked up to david
lionel makes the pot
two lumps or one
bertie a bit abashed holds up three fingers
ive a sweet tooth
to tell the truth
referring to plane wing cover it with tissue
it was a relief
knowing i wouldnt be king
lionel hands him a mug of tea
bertie realizes its chipped and possibly none too clean
i wouldnt have to give speeches
reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case
whats the age difference
while logue isnt looking bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim of the mug with his handkerchief
but for eighteen months you wouldve been king
we didnt think about it that way doctor
sings doo dah doo dah
then david and i were very close
as you said eighteen months
i dont or i wouldnt ask
did you go after the same girls
flares what an extraordinarily rude thing to say
quickly under control david did try to be her beau at one point
before i met her
she wouldnt have him
not like my father
he and his brother when they were young kept a girl in st johns wood and shared her on alternate nights
an uncomfortable silence
too much has been said
now dope the other wing
did david tease you
they all did
buh buh buh bertie
father encouraged it
spit it out boy
thought it would make me stop
is this necessary
otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue
i mean the damn questions
tell me more about your storybook childhood
what was your earliest memory
you asked that before
this time id like an answer
how can you remember that
i dont understand
prince albert departed on that date
i was named bertie to placate great grandmamma victoria
in return she hated me because it reminded her of her grief
stutter growing in intensity tks seidler
lets stick to medical history please
im naturally left handed which was considered inappropriate
i was punished
now im right handed
also considered inappropriate
metal splints were made
worn night and day
now i have straight legs
this is so
i need your services as a speech therapist not grand inquisitor
are you available
or will it be myrtle says no
you sound angry
yes i told you i have a temper
angry at me or at your brother
bertie remains stubbornly silent
then blurts hes fallen in love
with the wrong sort of woman
whats wrong with her
some of them must be lovable
this ones divorced
mrs wallis simpson of baltimore
i want david to be happy but the family the church the nation wont have it
cant they fornicate privately like adults
david used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment
queen wallis of baltimore
does sound a bit iffy
i made a smudge
touch it up
you want me to beg for help
i advise you never to beg
especially if you might be king
dont say that
for reasons you cannot disclose fearing ramifications you will not explain you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith
you already owe me a shilling
bertie takes a coin out of his pocket hesitates then offers it to logue
i brought it along
you won fair and square
ill pay you generously
lionel pockets the coin
ill continue to ask questions
thats what i was afraid of
admires the plane nice job
bertie sees lionel glance at his watch
youve someone waiting
i do now
id apologize to them in person but
you dont wish to be seen
slip out the back way
after the funeral
it may be even more difficult
to remain unobserved
youre having second thoughts
berties silence is confirmation
i ask too many questions
perhaps the wrong sort
writes an address we live in south kensington small apartment but no one would see you
added incentive lots of planes
you know lionel youre the first ordinary englishman
ive ever really talked to
sometimes when i ride through the streets and see a bloke im struck by how little i know of his life and how little he knows of mine
cuts both ways
as bertie is about to leave lionel requests casually and if you decide to come bring the duchess
she might be helpful
if i asked
at back door and how will myrtle take to our coming into your home
she isnt speaking to me
pause wants to go home
pause after the funeral then
bertie doesnt answer
logue is left holding the plane
he goes to the waiting room door
howre you doing willie
speaking for her son still cant say a sentence
iiiiiiim much bbbbbbbetter
a drum roll is heard
funereal bagpipes wail joining the measured drum rolls
on the balcony of the castle decorated with black bunting is a huge bbc microphone and arrayed in front of it a row of uniformed dignitaries wearing naval hats of
the napoleonic wars replete with ostrich feathers
one of the dignitaries reads a declaration whereas it has pleased almighty god to call to his mercy our late sovereign king george the fifth of blessed and glorious memory
during this intercut to the reverse angle showing a massive military parade mainly navy personnel wending its way through the main street of windsor towards the castle accompanying a gun
carriage on which rides the kings coffin draped with the royal standard on which rests the royal crown topped by a maltese cross
david is seen very serious
that the high and mighty prince edward albert christian george andrew patrick david is now become our only lawful king
canons are fired
startled by the salute a large flock of blackbirds rise up and streak across the wintery sky
a murmur then a shocked gasp as the gun carriage transverses a tram track and tilts precipitously
suddenly the royal crown tumbles and falls knocking off the maltese cross
oh bloody hell
a bad omen your grace
the archbishop and churchill are watching the events from the shadows at one end of the balcony
below a scramble to restore the cross to the crown and replace both atop the coffin
dont be disingenuous
for our late kings crown to fall from his coffin is not a fortuitous portent
what ever is going to happen next
is that be the motto of the new reign
indeed will there actually be a new reign
im deeply shocked
you dont look it
my function requires me to appear serene
that may be increasingly difficult to maintain
ive been informed by no less an authority than the prime minister that our populace has no objection to royal fornication but will never tolerate adultery
well since we cannot acquire a new populace perhaps we need a new king
my turn to be profoundly shocked
neither look the slightest traumatized
but you more than others know full well well soon be under siege from the forces of darkness
the winds of war
a gathering storm
oh you do have a way with words
and who would you suggest to rally the troops the nation the empire the world
intercut to bertie in the funeral cortege looking frail and pale
a man who cannot speak
in nuremberg stadium herr hitler mesmerizes millions whilst the duke of york cannot successfully order fish and chips
would you prefer the next brother
intercut to henry the duke of gloucester
a bi sexual former drug addict
the unwashed moralistic populace will adore that
the youngest perhaps
intercut to george the duke of kent
now theres dimness
i must admit
unburdened with brain
thus were left with david the rightful heir who speaks beautifully even if he talks nonsense
below the coffin is entering the chapel
come let us bury one king before we attempt to bring another to his knees
re establishing shot
the royal standard flies bravely
bertie waits at a table with a group of immaculately attired courtiers and dignitaries
this is the coronation committee
the chair at the head of the table is empty everyone waiting for its occupant
he finally arrives
he gestures for bertie to come into the corridor but deliberately leaves the door open so the committee can hear snatches of berties ensuing humiliation
david has a habit of constantly fingering his tie
hear youre taking elocution lessons lad
thats the word around town
merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment
im the brother who speaks
or do you wish to have a go
good lord no
i hope to
todays your chance
he thrusts a document into berties hands then pokes his head into the conference room
my brother will read the coronation plans
whispers urgently im not prepared
whispers back as a boy scout
and you are one arent you very much a boy scout
you must always be prepared
nice and loud so everyone can hear
bertie looks at the pages his throat constricts his chest tightens and his hands begin to shake
i thu thu think we should tuh tuh table the document
he attempts to return it to david but his brother wont accept
tell the others how mrs simpson is to be accommodated in a special alcove above the altar
now ill be off
see you at balmoral this weekend buh buh bertie
in the room they are appalled
bertie stands frozen and shattered
the lion rampant flutters on the bonnet of the austin
inside bertie wearing a black armband gestures for the driver to stop
pulling his homburg over his brow bertie wraps his scarf around the lower portion of his face
then catches his reflection in the rearview mirror
tells his driver wait down the road
not wanting to draw attention to his destination bertie has disembarked several buildings away from logues address
he makes his way hurriedly
a soccer football hits him on the back
he wheels around
the group of local lads look at him unabashed
kick it ere aye guv
bertie kicks it
a fine high shot
they go back to their game
bertie rings logues bell
a brief pause
bertie glances nervously hoping not to be recognized
lionel opens the door
to be honest wasnt sure whether to expect you
i wasnt sure either
bertie stares at his mentor
as they enter referring to his hat and scarf do i look like a spy
with a toothache
they disappear inside
bertie has to pick his way through discarded toys and sporting equipment explaining to logue i was totally unable to speak
you seldom stutter with me anymore
referring to the mess the boys are a bit untidy
because youre paid to listen
like a verbal geisha girl
bertie looks around the cluttered but pleasant room comfortable furniture a bit battered by the boys antimacassars to hide the wear spots on the arms family photos everywhere well used
turkish rug on the floor
what more does a man need eh
lionel stares unsure if hes being patronized
coming from a man whos lived all his life in castles and palaces
somebody has to live in them
ushers bertie into his study
bertie stands shattered lost in his painful memory
i couldnt say anything
you couldve refused
dont you know any rude words
what a bloody stupid question
i just said one
perhaps a touch more vulgar
to prove you know how
a public school prig could do better
well bloody bugger to you you beastly bastard
shit shit shit
see how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue
you dont stutter when you swear
because im angry
get angry more often
do you know the f word
fuck fuck fuck
now a resounding chorus of
shit shit shit
bugger bugger bugger
fuck fuck fuck
a pounding on the wall
we have children
whispers this is your fault
wont happen again
i should hope not
first time ive heard you laugh
royals arent allowed emotions in public
which explains a lot
bertie is in no mood to be provoked
what do you want me to do dammit
stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta
your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed
without thinking lionel instinctively reaches out to pat bertie supportively on the shoulder
bertie pulls back in offended shock
all the warning signals instilled in him are going off
dont take liberties
youre a dangerous man logue
who sent you
anyone in mind
the lurking shadows
courtiers and peers
the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased
your wife was the one who sought me out
because dear sweet deluded woman she believes in me
but you dont share her belief
why come here
im beginning to ask myself that very same question
your sailing close to the edge dont push me doctor logue
i came here because i was taught from childhood to serve a purpose and that purpose is to serve
duty is our sole justification for privilege
i came here because i was under the illusion you might help me perform that function
not to worry
they say the king can do no wrong
he can bugger things up
and i am not the king
simpson is seeking a divorce
the coronation is set for the th of may
her decree becomes final on the th of april
that gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest
and if mr baldwin stops them
that would be a tragedy
i pray to the almighty they succeed
ill do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne
does that include debasing yourself
your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning
are you saying he wanted me to fail
are you insisting he didnt
in the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases
you can sing them swear them rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow that combined with your growing confidence
bertie doesnt want to hear
youre a wicked man lionel logue trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother
trying to get me to commit treason
trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear
again why did you seek me out
to take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties
how dare you
im the brother of a king
the son of a king
back through untold centuries
you presume to instruct me on my duty
a jumped up jackeroo from the outback
the disappointing son of an embittered clerk
youre a monster doctor logue
im going to balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother
and these sessions are over
someone fumbles behind it
lionel pushes his way through the gap in the curtain
a provincial director replies from a seat in the auditorium
not the same director as in the earlier audition scene
were you told
we arent for london
playing the provinces
available are we
i believe thats called desperate for a part
you have played the provinces
lets hear what you can do
make him deformed
audiences like that
rallies himself be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
as magical as lionel was when he performed for his boys here hes stiff and painfully stilted
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices
interrupts thank you
dont abandon your day job
logue bows his head
lionel enters and sits dejectedly at the table
myrtle and the boys eat in silence
finally you may leave
havent finished yet dad
myrtle knows something has happened
lionel takes five slim folders out of his jacket pocket and puts them on the table in front of myrtle
she studies them stunned
a long pause as myrtle digests this
what about your
willies a problem
not much progress
the others have been referred
whatll you do when we get home
try not to act the toff
im not good enough
you gave it a try lionel
yes i had a go
thanks to your patience
grief overwhelms him i just bloody well wasnt good enough
studying the tickets oh lionel
this mustve cost you
the sound of an axe
a woodsmans axe chops into the thick trunk of a massive tree
nearby a bulldozer cuts into the green turf and rich soil
the felling and earth removal are being watched by churchill and lang from a distant terrace
in the background a jazz band in white tuxedos syncopates pertly
five hundred year old oaks
part of the hill
removed to improve the view
how ever does she do it
inside the ballroom seem through open french doors an afternoon dance is being held
churchill and lang look in
at the epicenter a dashing couple david the very picture of insouciance and clinging to his arm dripping in jewelry a rather small angular dark haired woman with a high
brow and square jaw mrs wallis simpson
her most attractive physical feature is her back displayed fully by a dress that plunges to her nates
surrounded by their entourage they are the apex of chic
watching from the sidelines erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination
i realize of course that may be outside your personal experience
winston exchanges his empty champagne flute for a full one from the tray of a passing footman
youve the devil in you today
if anyone should know it would be your grace
all aspects of mankind are within my venue
did you know hm has trouble with his glands
churchill almost chokes on his champagne
id not appreciated your grace was so well versed concerning things testicular
they were severely damaged by the measles when hm and his brother were naval cadets
a veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information
apparently it affects the quality although not the quantity of hms endeavors
and the brother
i shepherd my flock in all matters winston including multiplication
they make their way inside
in the distance an austin princess can be seen making its way up the stately tree line avenue
bertie and elizabeth are dressed for the party
we must try to be pleasant
your father not dead six months and that woman throws a garden potty
p o t t y
shes sleeping in your mothers bedroom
and i know perfectly well she calls me the dowdy duchess and cookie
at the buffet table churchill helps himself copiously
has it occurred to you as it has only occurred to me that a monarch with a gland problem who realizes he cannot produce issue might not wish to be
knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed
a dazzling concept
a footman announces tks seidler
their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york
wallis sweeps forward to greet them but elizabeth sails past announcing to no one in particular i came at the invitation of the king
david turns and bows formally
elizabeth cursties in return
wallis quickly returns to david taking him forcefully onto the dance floor
the yorks go in the other direction
to the side churchill and lang watch david and wallis do a brisk turkey trot
according to the f
she is after all one of their citizens
our monarch does not possess exclusive rights to mrs
simpsons sexual favours
hitlers ambassador count von ribbentrop has been sending her carnations every day
one for each time theyve slept together
good lord winston we must see to it this empress of the night does not become queen of england
churchill has spotted elizabeth in a side room
allow me to test new waters
churchill makes his way to elizabeth who is standing in front of a portrait of george iv
i dont need to be told i behaved badly
on the contrary mam
court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host
in this case the king
you behaved impeccably
referring to the painting a relative
referring again to the painting youre well aware of course george ivs wife mrs
fitzherbert was very common indeed
and previously married
she signed an agreement that she could never become queen and their children could not be royal
a rather sensible morganatic arrangement
that was a very long time ago
youre stirring with a rather large spoon winston
keep in mind im also a distant relative of lady macbeth
i would disremember at my peril
david is coming briskly down the corridor struggling to open a champagne bottle followed by bertie determined to catch up
elizabeth and churchill leave the brothers alone
wally wants more champagne
i have to fetch it
she prefers that
been trying to see you
been terribly busy
where did you get that american accent
fathers not dead six months yet youve put mrs
simpson in the suite used by our mother
mamas not still in bed is she
that isnt funny
ssssssorry d d dear b b oy
no more of that
a moment of silent confrontation
david backs down
didnt realize you cared
this could end in disaster
this will end splendidly
with wallis as my wife
whatever will she call herself
queen of england i suspect
kings do marry
empress of india
the whole bag of tricks
the upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous
hunger marchers are singing the red flag in front of westminster
demanding a republic
ive seen them
herr hitler will sort that out
wholl sort out chancellor hitler
hes much maligned
by the jews according to wallis
and shes very clever about politics
the mans a monster
our position must remain clear
whys that old chap
we are a german family
didnt bother anyone during wwi
and kaiser willie was our uncle
because we took an english name
because we are england
we are the heart and soul of this nation
that must never change
are you already in charge
im trying to warn you
am i being threatened
david your role is to consult and to be advised
sounds like youve studied our wretched constitution
sounds like you havent
i wont be a lackey to an unwashed politician like stanley baldwin
hes your prime minister
and im his king
if you refuse to listen to our government they have no choice but to resign
ill form another
hed love to be p
well create a kings party
to fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic
id risk anything and everything for wallis
dont i have rights
not the same thing
yet an ordinary man may marry for love
were not ordinary men david
we were bred to be profiles on a coin
if you were ordinary on what basis could you possibly claim to be king
whats the point then
just to look posh
your speech is much improved tonight
hardly a hesitation
yearning for a larger audience are we
dont say such a thing
is my young brother trying to push me off the throne
sounds positively medieval
i beg of you dont do this to my wife my daughters to me
the politicians will give in
see you at my coronation
the champagne cork finally pops
he strides off
establishing shot of the prime ministers residence
nice of you to invite me to your digs stanley
baldwin and churchill are alone together
no love lost between these two men
as you may have guessed
churchill is silent
balwin waits then i intend to resign
the royal scandal has weakened my position considerably
churchill on the edge of his seat cant suppress an anticipatory grin
baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it
no need to volunteer your services winston
neville chamberlain will take my place once this royal matter is settled
as chancellor of the exchequer he already lives next door
my opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough stanley
well enough chit chat
the question of a morganatic marriage as a possible solution has been put to the dominion prime ministers
after all hm is their king too
baldwin has a sheath of telegrams in hand
david feels there arent that many people in australia
union of south africa an inappropriate marriage would create a permanent wound
the irish free state states it is not really their affair and bluntly our english king may marry any whore he wants theyll be well out of it
ah the kiwis
being rather remote theyve not even heard of mrs simpson
hardly a winning hand
this is not about true love winston
this is about whos in charge
does the king do what he wants or what his people want him to do
does the king own his nation or does the nation own their monarch
he wont budge
nor will we
winston churchill is incongruously inspecting a rocking horse
unable to resist he sits on it gingerly rocking back and forth lost in a reverie
eyes closed he extends his right arm as though holding a cavalry saber
bertie enters startling him
good of you to see me at this late hour
thought you were in davids camp
takes a piece of paper from his pocket and reads i am now free to tell you how i was jockeyed out of the throne
my brother wrote that
wallis wrote it for him
ill burn it
i fear your brother is like the child in a fairy story given everything in the world but they forgot his soul
quite happy to bring his nation to the brink of civil war just as we face global conflict
were not coming to that
oh therell be war alright
takes out another piece of paper your brother held conversations with the duke of saxe coburg your cousin a ranking member of the nazi party
i have the scotland yard intercept who is king here
baldwin or i
i myself wish to talk with hitler and will do so here or in germany
i doubt england is ready to return to absolute monarchy
surely his motives are misunderstood
if i dont get my way when the war comes hitler will crush everyone including the americans
the british may not want me as their king but ill soon be back as their leader
his intent seems crystal clear
dont take him seriously
mugs for his cancelled coronation will soon be on clearance sale
youre willing to go along with this
changing horses in mid stream is a perilous maneuver
depends how badly the horse youre on stumbles
its not too late winston you could form a government on his behalf
i must decline
the rocking horse cracks
churchill gets to his feet
starts to exit then ive written a new speech for him
i dont want to hear it
it does have a rather nice turn of phrase
it is december th
if practical use the actual recorded broadcast truncated
in london birmingham edinburgh country hamlets and cathedral towns
the streets are deserted
stragglers hurry indoors to be near at long last i am able to say a few words of my own
until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak
a few hours ago i discharged my last duty as king and emperor
bertie and elizabeth listening to the radio with the two princesses royal sitting at their parents feet
bertie battles his emotions
now that i have been succeeded by my brother the duke of york my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him
whispers daddy who broke our rocking horse
whispers a giant
elizabeth holds a finger to her lips shush
this has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing enjoyed by so many of you and not bestowed on me
a happy home with his wife and children
the glow of a radio dial
lionel and myrtle sit in armchairs the radio on a side table between them
i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as i would wish to do without the help and support
of the woman i love
lionel gets up to turn it off as davids voice concludes we all have a new king
i wish him and you his people happiness and prosperity with all my heart
god bless you all
god save the king
logue strokes myrtles hair
i too married the woman i love
you married a shop girl
a wonderful lass
someone i can talk to heart to heart
using simple words and short sentences
im very ordinary
thats why were suited
im just an ordinary bloke
youre a man with wild dreams lionel
mine are so very small
a job a husband a home
raising our sons
thats all i ever wanted
is that why every day youve spent hours with a man whos about to be king
that relationship is now past tense
yet for as long as you could you did what you wanted
i wanted to be a great actor
thats what i wanted
and failing that
i certainly failed
a great healer
where does a shop girl fit in
very snugly into my heart
always have always will
trouble is lionel when you say that i still believe it
the royal standard on a gleaming cars bonnet
bertie stands uneasily in the uniform of an admiral of the fleet as the driver opens the door
bertie realizes its a rolls
wheres the austin
the palace changed it your highness
i liked the austin
so did i sir
the two girls wave from their open playroom window and call you look like a chicken
he waves and gets in
a formal voice announces his majesty will address the accession council and take his oath
bertie looks at himself in a full length mirror making last minute adjustments to his uniform
staring at his reflection how did this happen to you
bertie walks to the podium like a man to the gallows faced with an array of the privy councillors members of the house of lords the lord mayor of the
city of london the aldermen of the city of london and the high commissioners of the commonwealth countries
all the old symptoms reappear the tightening of the neck muscles the protruding adams apple the jaw locking
my lords members of the accession council i meet you today in circumstances which are without parallel in the history of our country
its going to be a terrible performance
he bows his head in humility
elizabeth is playing quietly with her daughters when the door opens and bertie appears still in full regalia straight from the accession council
he holds his arm out expecting them to run to him for a hug and kiss his solace after the ordeal
they remain where they are
they curtsy formally
bertie is devastated
elizabeth takes him quickly out into the corridor
i dont want to lose you
how could you possibly
being what we both dread most
dear dear man i refused your first two marriage proposals because as much as i loved you i couldnt abide the thought of living in the royal gilded cage
then i realized
you stuttered so beautifully
theyd leave you alone
she takes his face in her hands tenderly
if i must be queen i will be a good queen
the wife of a very great king indeed
then you know what you must do
logue is working with anna
shes reading smoothly and with great intensity
had i the heavens embroidered cloths enwrought with golden and silver light the bbb
we havent much more time together
give it a go
the doorbell rings
logue is annoyed
there werent any more appointments today
the bell rings again
he yells piss off
the blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half light
the door opens and bertie enters the waiting area
hearing anna he stops outside the consultation room and listens
i would spread the cloths under your feet but i being poor have only my dreams
i have spread my dreams under your feet tread softly because you tread on my dreams
softly read it to him
if he doesnt profess his love hes not a man
anna nods earnestly
she exits via the waiting room and almost runs into bertie
on recognizing him she bobs her head
that was lovely
dont take any guff
can i tell my harold thats what you said
id be honoured
she dashes off
logue comes to the door of the waiting room in effect blocking berties way in
johnson isnt it
have you an appointment
want me to beg
i told you kings dont beg
i believe this time a bit of begging might be required
elizabeth says i must eat humble crow
its crow or humble pie
take your pick
gathering resolve i was frightened and took refuge in being royal
what i said was unforgivable
blurts out whats the one essential thing a king must do
he must believe he is king
how can i possibly do that
for pity sake lionel i beg you get me through
ill pay you another shilling
whatre friends for
logue steps aside letting bertie in
i wouldnt know
the double bed is piled high with clothing a suitcase at its foot
myrtle is sorting
she hears lionel enter behind her
at first she doesnt turn
lionel remains silent
ive got the boys sorting their things
your office will be a chore
realizing something is amiss she turns and knows instantly what lionels going to tell her
her hand goes to her mouth to stifle her emotions
bertie is with visitors churchill and lang
theres a slight but discernible change in his demeanor
we asked to see your highness because theres the urgent question of what to call your brother
aside from the obvious
bertie is not pleased with his graces joke but lets it pass
what do you suggest
all he deserves
what has my brother given up on his abdication other than the throne
they look at each other unsure
wouldnt it be a good idea to find out before coming to me
he cannot be mister as he was born the son of a duke
which makes him a lord at the very least
very well lord e
and as a lord of the realm hes entitled to be elected to the house of commons
heading a kings party
so you prefer he takes a seat in the house of lords
again on behalf of a kings party
is that acceptable
but if hes made a royal duke and called his royal highness he cannot stand for parliament
nor may he speak or vote in the house of lords
realizing oh i say
the duke of windsor it is
he exits abruptly
churchill and lang gather their things stunned
not exactly a dummy is he
myrtle is in the shop window arranging handbags luggage and briefcases
in the store myrtle can be seen dressing the window while in his glass office the owner a portly bald gentleman with a dickensian air is deep in concerned conversation
with a man in trench coat
the owner keeps glancing worriedly in myrtles direction
the two men nod shake hands
the fellow in the trench coat leaves
the owner beckons another shop girl over and whispers something to her
she heads towards myrtle
lets go gathering hearty heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons
a wall divides the study from the living area allowing the action in both spaces to be viewed
in the parlour elizabeth waits ill at ease
she sifted seven thick stalked thistles through strong thick sieves
at home twenty five times in rapid succession
those are my hardest sounds
lionel gives him a look
shall we invite your wife in now
logue goes to the door and starts to open it
he shuts it quickly
i wasnt expecting myrtle for several hours
in the parlour myrtle has entered definitely unhappy
seeing elizabeth shes even less happy and flabbergasted
your majesty the first time
after that maam
not malm as in palm mam as in ham
im informed your husband calls my husband bertie and my husband calls your husband lionel
i trust however you wont attempt to call me liz
in the study lionel stands listening ear to the door
howre they getting on
as to be expected
in the parlour myrtle announces you may call me madam logue
myrtles at a loss knowing what to do with a duchess
may i offer you a cup of tea maam
thank you madame logue but im waiting to be summoned
you dont like my husband
thats what i was told
i was told the same
do we remain in hiding
im not going out there
what do you dislike about my lionel
i dont wish my husband to be demeaned
what dont you like about mine
i dont want my lionel getting hurt
theres only one thing can save him now success
in the study the men are growing increasingly nervous
were being cowards
were sensible men
you should go in
youre the royal
being a monarchist i recognize these are your digs
therefore here you rule
therefore you go in
urged by bertie logue opens the door
in the parlour logue enters pretending total innocence and surprise followed by bertie also trying to keep the pretense
hello lady elizabeth
hello myrtle darling
what a pleasant surprise
myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge
will the yorks be staying for dinner
logue and bertie look panic stricken
elizabeth comes to the rescue
a previous engagement
some other time love
logue ushers elizabeth into the study giving myrtle a nervous little wave
she glares and exits
glad you had a chance to meet myrtle
bertie stifles a snort
elizabeth glares at him
to elizabeth good of you to come
harley street is far too public
what is my function here
for me to show you how to pitch in
oh dear i may not be a pitch in type
piece of cake
to bertie please assume a supine position on the floor
firm support is needed
bertie dutifully lies on the floor
expand your chest
now your stomach
deep into the diaphragm
how do you feel
full of hot air
well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker
bertie inhales deeply
now princess elizabeth be so kind as to sit on your husbands stomach
gently of course
elizabeth sits gingerly on berties stomach asking solicitously are you alright bertie
now exhale slowly
down goes princess elizabeth
nothing rushed expanding your chest fully extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm
up comes princess elizabeth
down goes princess elizabeth
up comes princess elizabeth
you get the idea
doesnt have to be princess elizabeth of course but i thought youd prefer your wife to one of the staff
now comes the fun part
theres actually more
bertie springs to his feet while logue opens a window
you will now shout the vowel sounds all five of them as loudly as possible each to last no less than seconds
theres poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm
princess elizabeth you can be the official timer
shouted at an open window
on a public street
anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech
they can also be considered quite dotty
dont even contemplate it
sorry dear doctors orders
stops shes right those two chaps are staring at me
theyre always looking at you
startled youre followed
royal scrutiny doctor best get used to it
to elizabeth are you timing this
the family eat in tense silence tks seidler
may we be excused
the unhappy meal continues
mumbles we dont want to hear you fight
were not fighting
your mother isnt talking
you wish me to speak my mind
thank you dad
thank you mum
they exit hurriedly
without warning i arrive home to find the queen in my parlour
a duchess she hasnt been crowned yet
lionel dont quibble
whatd you think of her
does it matter
shes the queen and hes the king forgodsake
whatre they doing here
whyd you come home so early
they came for help
what role are you auditioning for now
whos going to help us
this will bring us down lionel
you know it will
when that poor chap first walked into my office he was a slim quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual
speech defect has set the sign
you saw him today once more there was hope
youre not listening to me
she gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen
he follows her back and forth
myrtle i love you
you say that but you dont listen when i say in so many ways how desperately i want to go home how i never ever intended to stay here
this was to be a holiday trip to see mother england and you turned it into quite something else
what happened lionel
we went to wembley stadium next thing
youd cashed in our tickets
very well i shant talk of this ever again
i will as always be supportive of your endeavours
i dont deserve a wonderful woman like you
how right you are
but whyd you come home so early
i was let go
inquiries were made
mr falkoff wouldnt say who
afterwards it was with your hubby treating a personage that high and mighty you wont be needing employment with us will you mrs logue
theyre frightened lionel
of what seems so far above them
im frightened too
establishing shot of this architectural icon
winston you do read the newspapers
a massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass
the center piece of this particular section is the throne of edward the confessor
scaffolding is in the process of being erected to supply lighting for the coronation
archbishop lang and churchill inspect it with satisfaction
only the vulgar ones
churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a hip flask
to our new king
lets sincerely hope
they look at each other in silence
is this a slightly pregnant pause
they say he is dim
they say he has epilepsy
fragile prone to illness
some correctness in that
and will die prematurely
they predict hell be unable to complete the coronation
what do you propose
shorten the ceremony
or no ceremony at all
my idea exactly
i believed so
but what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world
what we need and what well get may be two rather different things
did you hear his pathetic attempt at the accession council
hell never be able to speak in public
so we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet
who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war
who will address the far flung corners of the empire rallying all to our defense
the head of our church
is that what you have in mind
would it be such a calamity
best ask our new king
bertie has entered with logue
lang spins around
excuse me sir duty calls
he exits quickly
cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the abbey the archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress particularly a booth for broadcasters
is this the scene of the crime
what a peculiar thing to say
referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners
ah yes wireless is indeed a pandoras box
i have however categorically said no to the bbcs new radio with pictures gadget
imagine the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms
radio with pictures
it is called
happily with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this tv thing has no future
we shall however be forced to permit cinema the product of which i shall personally edit
thatll keep you busy removing all my stops and starts
unless of course youd prefer a quiet ceremony
what exactly do you mean
we could pre record an edited version to be broadcast to the world
or even find an actor with a similar voice
logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows
a king based upon deception
cosmo takes bertie aside
if your gentleman from security would give us space we could discuss this in private
you mean my bodyguard crusher
giving lionel a scathing look lang continues speaking to bertie confidentially
as i assured our nation in my recent broadcast when his people listen to their new monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech
but to those who hear it it need cause no sort of embarrassment for it causes none to him who speaks
you see ive paved the way
but should you wish to avoid further stress
why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins
if you wish to call attention to his anxiety
does your bodyguard know to whom hes speaking
he certainly doesnt know his place
doctor lionel logue my speech therapist
id no idea
had i known your majesty was seeking assistance i wouldve made my own recommendation
logue is to be present at the coronation
impossibly to find room
even for a doctor
behind the chair of edward the confessor
the royal box
your family will be seated there
which makes it most suitable
perhaps i might be able to add a very small stool
two comfortable chairs
one for madam logue
shes a close friend of my wife
ill have someone attend to it
and now if you dont mind we need the premises
my dear fellow this is westminster abbey
the church must make preparations
so must bertie
we do not call the king bertie
during waking hours well need the facilities
itll be a closed set
those are my wishes your grace
lang nods curtly and exits
youve made a dangerous enemy
wouldnt want him as a friend
and dont ever call me bertie in public
a moment of confrontation
lionel knows hes overstepped
i sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon
do you really want to be king
i havent any choice
you can be a wounded king who stumbles through his coronation
or as the arch of c so archly suggests no coronation at all
always a choice
whats this you wait til westminster abbey then ambush me
im simply asking questions
which you seem unable to answer
im a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter
but at least i know what i want
you havent the foggiest
explodes his words reverberate through the empty abbey
thats quite different
lets get down to work then shall we
bertie glares at him
as soon as you and elizabeth enter the west door youll be greeted with the hymn i was glad when they said unto me
you wont actually be that glad because they sing it for a great long time
bertie follows logue deep into the bowels of the abbey
youll then show yourself to the various sides of the abbey as the archbishop announces four times in a loud voice sirs i here present unto you
have you decided your name for when you become king
for when you become a different person
like your father
like my father
given the current situation
sirs i here present unto you george your undoubted king
george your undoubted king
echoes through the abby
lang is on the phone
the door is open
while talking he watches the work preparations
on the phone he tells someone ive made inquiries
logue enters and sits at the table
myrtle serves him
a bit dry
tried to keep it warm
you look done in
ive news for you
youre coming to the coronation
ive news for you
stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse
you and i
stunned silence then
id need a new dress
rather thought you might
valentine calls from the next room tks seidler
wont be a sec
looks at herself bemused reflected in a glass fronted cabinet
even does a curtsey
the last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by lang
he gives a final satisfied look at the cavernous space like a director preparing the stage for a final scene
he quotes shakespeare extremely pleased with himself the plays the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of a king
the camera explores various elements the throne of edward the confessor
beneath it a large rough hewn stone the stone of scone
leaning against the throne a huge sword set there for the next coronation rehearsal
majestic stained glass windows of saints kings and martyrs
rows of pews worn with centuries of use
graves of the mighty kings poets and statesmen
this abbey holds the history of a nation
trips over one of the gravestones
stepped on lord byron
lights snap on skewering lionel
bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral
this is not a rehearsal doctor logue
ah the star chamber inquisition
i wondered when that would happen
and id promised myrtle a new frock
barely controlled just call me lionel
never did you call yourself doctor
we did that for you
no diploma no training no credentials
just a great deal of nerve
want to hear my side of the story
there isnt a your side of the story
this is my story
and youve ruined it
its not just the coronation terrifying enough its the radio speech to millions afterwards and the speech after that and for the rest of my failed miserable life
softly wembley stadium
you dare remind me
i was there
then you knew from the start i was hopeless
my son valentine asked could you help that poor man
i replied hes too old for me to manage a complete cure but i could very nearly do it im sure of that
i knew i could help you
you refuse to believe
who the hell do you think you are
a failed actor
father wanted me to be a doctor but i couldnt cut flesh
so i worked in the mines recited in pubs
when the war came by the time i was ready to be shipped out the first casualties were limping home
poor buggers broken in bone and spirit
lionel youre good with your mouth see if you can help these poor sods
the shell shocked were the saddest
most stuttered profoundly
far worse than you
muscle therapy helped somewhat but i found i had to go deeper as you might well imagine
i know nothing of those poor men
i think you do
they had cried out and the universe had not listened
so theyd lost faith in their voice
my job was to make them shout in righteous anger i have the right to be heard
i suppose that helped them did it
inquiries have been made
but a lot of success
no training was given
not in western australia not at that time
i simply knew what to do
when the war was over i kept being a therapist to earn a living
when the lads were old enough i thought alright lionel youve always wanted to be an actor one last go
i pretended it was our trip home to mother england the great australian pilgrimage
to harley street
cashed in our return tickets
i had three months rent
so you set yourself up on harley street as an actor
harley street dont you know is for doctors
the plaque says l
no mention of a medical degree
no mention of any degree
some of the diggers id helped had come to england
they made referrals
my practice flourished
my acting however did not
well enough to deceive me
lock me in the tower
i would if i could
youve saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless king
destroyed the happiness of my family
all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldnt possibly assist
lionel sits down on the chair of edward the confessor
leaning against it is the great two handed sword of st
whatre you doing
you cant sit there
its a chair
its the chair of edward the confessor
the throne upon which every king for six and a half centuries has been crowned
its falling apart
people have carved their initials into it
needs a stone to keep from blowing away
thats the stone of scone
the stone of destiny that was once jacobs pillow
you believe such ballocks i dont care how many royal backsides have sat on it its a building block with handles attached
youre just like me an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real
listen to me
listen to you
by what right
divine right if you must
im your king
noooo youre not
told me so yourself
said you didnt want it
so why should i listen to a poor stuttering bloke who cant put one word after another
why waste my time listening to you
because i have a right to be heard
heard as what
i have a voice
quietly well then
stop trying to squirm off the hook
bertie youll make a bloody good king
and you know it
bertie stares at him
a familiar voice is heard from the shadows
the archbishop of canterbury
youll be relieved to learn ive found a replacement specialist
theres a long silence
that wont be necessary
the matters already been settled
for your own well being
what did you say
your majestys function is to consult
and to be advised
you didnt consult but youve just been advised
now i advise you so listen carefully
in this personal matter i will make my own decision
may i remind you you do not place the crown upon your own head
and may i remind you it is my head upon which the crown is placed
this will end badly
lang turns on his heel
lionel ignores what has just happened
in hushed tones the bbc commentator paints a picture for the world as you stand at the altar divested of your robes
trumpets echo through the abbey
the incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight
and you are king
the faint clicking whir of a film projector is heard
on the screen archive footage of the coronation capturing the pomp and ceremony
cigar smoke rises up
the voices of churchill and lang can be heard
i was much moved there were tears in my eyes too your grace particularly when i saw you and the dean of westminster cannoning into each other
thats been edited
more tears when our new monarch started towards his throne only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the bishops treading on his robe
to the world all went splendidly
amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels bobbing tiaras and heaving bosoms
the footage freezes momentarily
now winston i have something which will bring tears to your eyes
the archive footage continues but it is not of the coronation
david and wallis visiting the fuhrer in germany hitler gallantly kissing mrs simpsons hand while goring and the duke of windsor beam david giving the nazi salute
the lights come on
for once churchill is speechless
theres no doubt david is planning a comeback
and will succeed if our king continues to falter
though bertie miraculously survived the coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed
soon he must broadcast to the world
hitler will be listening
david will be listening
stalin and roosevelt will be listening
everyone will be listening
god help us
stuttering very badly in this grave hour
bertie and logue are rehearsing
in this grave hour
in this grave hour
turn the halts into pauses during which you say to yourself god save the king
i say that all the time but apparently no ones listening
use the silence
long pauses add solemnity to great occasions
then im the solemnest king who ever lived
lionel i cant do this
logue tries to protest bertie over rides
if i am to be king
where is my power
may i form a government on my own appoint or dismiss a prime minister chose an ambassador levy a tax or declare a war
none of these things
yet i am the seat of all authority
because the nation believes when i speak i speak for them
yet i cannot speak
logue totally ignores the outburst
take it from the top
in this grave hour
hesitates then in this grave hour p p perhaps
the letter p is always difficult
get a running start put the words all together
perhaps the most fateful
in this grave hour
perhaps the most fateful
in our history
i send to every household of my peoples
both at home and overseas
doo dah doo dah
five miles long
spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you
as if i were able
in your head now bugger bugger bugger
damn damn damn
all those bloody blighters are going to have to listen to me
can you dance
helps relax the body
goes to record player waltz
i prefer pipes
thought you might
starts a bagpipe record of scotland the brave dance with me
one two one two three four
one two one two three four
for the second time
one two three four
in the lives of most of us
one two one two three four
we are at war
dancing at arms length with logue bertie repeats for the second time
in the lives of most of us
we are at war
one two three
continues on over and over again
we have tried to find a peaceful way
out of the differences
and those who are now our enemies
bugger bugger bugger
fuck fuck fuck
youll be ready
pause the shilling you won
still have it
bertie holds out his hand demandingly
somewhat hurt lionel hands it over
ill return it
bertie leaves with the shilling exiting the back way
logue opens the waiting room door
wheres your mum
stuttering painfully she had to work
youve been waiting here alone all this time
willie nods again
then haltingly i heard the king
and shouted rude words
would you like to sing dance and shout rude words
why am i not surprised
the dreaded bbc microphone
the room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio for this all important occasion
the bbc news reader and floor manager are there along with a small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their equipment
think hell manage
ive heard he may not even show
the floor manager tries to warn him with his eyes
bertie has entered with elizabeth and logue
the reader wishes he could sink into the floor
bertie says nothing but approaches the looming microphone while logue and elizabeth watch nervously
walk up to the bloody thing boldly stare it square in the eye man to man
placating if youll be so kind to let me show you
i already know
my father taught me
he spreads the fingers of one hand touches the apparatus with the little finger thumb to chin
the reader scurries off and tells the others
his father taught him
i taught his father
testing the microphone bugger bugger bugger
bloody bloody bloody
bertie do make sure thats not switched on
youre going to be splendid
and if youre not
theyll bloody well have to listen to me anyway
lang and churchill have entered
elizabeth forces herself to greet them graciously
prime minister your grace how kind of you to join us
wouldnt miss this for the world
to churchill congratulations
neville didnt last long did he
talking to hitler
my tenure will be shorter if the king fails tonight
bertie and logue speak privately
no matter how this turns out i wish to thank you
for asking such dreadful questions
what can i do in recompense
yet seriously ive always wanted to be knighted
that would raise too many questions
pause then understood
bertie takes something from his pocket
told you id give it back
keep it for good luck
no you won this fair and square
the object is a silver medal
bertie pins it to logues jacket
made from the melted coin
designed it myself hope you like it lionel old friend
may i call you that
my greatest honour bertie
then one final question
do you believe youre king
a very long pause
the red light on the microphone starts to blink
logue joins the others
the reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc broadcast booth
five four three two
good evening this is the bbc national and world programme broadcasting from buckingham palace
his majesty the king
during this berties hands begin to shake the pages of his speech rattle like dry leaves his throat muscles constrict the adams apple bulges his lips tighten
all the old symptoms reappear
several seconds have elapsed since the reader finished
it seems an eternity
elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles
langs eyes roll heavenward
churchill studies the situation ready to leap into the breach
bertie and logue stare at each other
logue smiles perfectly calm totally confident in the man hes worked with
his confidence is contagious
bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly
his hands grow steady his throat muscles relax
all the things hes practiced
the luminous dial of a wireless
then in this grave hour perhaps the most fateful in our history i send to every household of my peoples both at home and overseas
this is being listened to by myrtle and the boys
the boys look at their mum
suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio address continues in homes pubs where we see the man with the rosacea nose clubs hotels boarding houses factories mines prisons a
shearing shed in new zealand cattle station in australia sites in india south africa loci around the commonwealth and empire
the white house
hitlers mountain top wolf den
the south of france where david and wallis listen dolefully
during this the address continues with dramatic pauses to be sure but no real hesitations
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if i were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself
for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war
for we are called with our allies to meet the challenge of a principle which if it were to prevail would be fatal to any civilized order in the world
it is the principle which permits a state in the selfish pursuit of power to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges which sanctions the use of force or threat
of force against the sovereignty and independence of other states
such a principle stripped of all disguise is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right and if this principle were established throughout the world the freedom of our
own country and of the whole british commonwealth of nations would be in danger
but far more than this the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice
and liberty among nations would be ended
this is the ultimate issue which confronts us
end the montage with a return to the exterior of buckingham palace
outside stand solemn crowds listening to the speech on loudspeakers
pan their faces the faces of england stalwart and resolved
for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear and of the worlds order and peace it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge
it is to this high purpose that i now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas who will make our cause their own
i ask them to stand calm firm and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard
there may be dark days ahead and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield
but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to god
the two girls listen to their father on the radio
if one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand then with gods help we shall prevail
lilibets expression tells it all she can hear it her father is truly king
bertie in his quiet way is totally in command and utterly magnificent
everyone in the room is awed as he concludes tks seidler
we may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which in my closing words i would like to say to you i said to the man who stood
at the gate of the year give me a light that i may tread safely into the unknown
and he replied go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of god
that shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way
may the almighty hand guide and uphold us all
in the ad hoc control booth area the manager makes a cut gesture to bertie hes off the air the red light on the microphone goes out
the manager points and the red light on the readers microphone goes on
this concludes the bbc broadcast of the kings speech
another cut gesture from the floor manager the red light goes out and the transmission is concluded
the floor manager looks to the reader
softly he wasnt perfect
barely controlling his tears not perfect
but by god
he moved me
at the main bbc microphone bertie waits for the verdict of his peers
churchill first couldnt have said it better myself
the ultimate compliment
softly thank god
she goes to bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek takes his hand then logues
well done bertie
for the first time lionel
she leaves the two men together
i always called you bertie
today i call you king
he offers his hand
but instead of taking it bertie takes him by the shoulders and gives him a hug
this is a long way from the five pace rule
the last barrier has fallen
