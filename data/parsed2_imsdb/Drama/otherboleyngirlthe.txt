written by peter morgan based on the novel by philippa gregory were moving through a cornfield
the sound of childrens laughter
a beautiful young girl mary boleyn our heroine runs through the fields being chased by her younger brother george and sister anne
touchingly mary is barely taller than the corn her head skimming along the sheaves
reverse angle to reveal the children are being watched by their parents sir thomas and lady elizabeth boleyn
i received a formal request for marriage today for anne
a beat from the carey family
sir thomas indicates to anne the eldest
the obvious leader among the children
but thats wonderful
i turned it down
lady elizabeth turns
and offered them mary instead
sir thomas indicates mary the middle child
fnnes too good for william carey
she can do better than a merchants son
you underestimate mary
i think shes
the kinder of the two
quite possibly the fairer
the children meanwhile have started a race
but to get ahead in this world you need more than fair looks and a kind heart
on the field anne wins
she jumps up and down holding her arms aloft as mary flops to the floor
sir thomas smiles see
he walks towards anne
applauding his favourite bravo
bells ring high up in the bell tower of a country church
mary ten years older and grown into a heavenly bride is in her room surrounded by maids and seamstresses making final adjustments to her dress
a knock at the door
may we come in
anne and george enter
george lets out a low whistle
look at you
younger than me
more beautiful than me
married before me
a beat i am eclipsed
i am just the other boleyn girl
no is this it
this is the end of the unholy trinity
george extends her arms wraps them around his two sister
an intimate moment
ill be married thats all
a beat apart from that it wont change a thing
the three of them hug together tightly
a packed country church
the priest officiates in latin
the air is thick with incense
and winter cold
the entire boleyn family is assembled on one side
father mother the duke and duchess of norfolk brother george and finally anne
confirma hoc deus quod operatus es in nobis
the priest sprinkles the ring with holy water
william carey puts it on marys finger
few rows back a young nobleman stares at anne
looks at her across the church
the party afterwards
the bride and groom william and mary are dancing surrounded by well wishers and other guests
are you happy
you dont secretly wish youd married someone grander
with a title
i want a husband who loves me
and who thinks it first thing every morning
and last thing at night
then youve found the right man
anne is dancing with her brother george
she looks up to see the nobleman who was staring at her across the church
who is that
he was staring at me in church
thats henry percy
heir to the duke of northumberland
richest landowner in england
annes eyes widen in interest really
but dont get your hopes up
he is already betrothed
george indicates a tall haughty looking fiancee beside percy
betrothed is not married brother george
a lot can happen before you reach the altar
anne stares over at henry percy
who stares back
he duke of norfolk the most powerful nobleman in the room and close personal friend of the kings walks with his growling dogs to where sir thomas boleyn and lady
elizabeth are sitting
sir thomas gets to his feet
he duke ignores thomas and goes instead to his sister lady elizabeth and kisses her
i think i have managed to persuade the king to come and stay with you on progress
a week ends hunting in late summer
but thats wonderful
thank you thank you so much
he turns to elizabeth did you hear that elizabeth
hates the idea yes
finally we can present george and with luck get him a position at court
lady elizabeth excuses herself and leaves
these are difficult times
i have it on good authority that the queen no longer bleeds yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved
a beat it cannot be long before the king is forced to look outside the marriage
and make a bastard king of england
a legitimized bastard
what choice does he have
a beat obviously ive given it thought and wondered which howard girl i could put under his nose
imagine the influence that would give us
to be blood family of the next king of england
equally imagine if another family were to achieve the same
norfolk indicates sir john seymour in the corner and his two loathsome ambitious sons edward and thomas
what about anne
sir thomas turns and indicates anne across the crowds whos dancing with george
i realise as a boleyn she is not officially a howard but as your sisters daughter
but shes your eldest thomas
your first born
and your favourite
wouldnt you prefer her to have a nice uncomplicated respectable marriage
if anne were an uncomplicated respectable girl like mary then id say yes
but shes not
sir thomas looks out at anne
shes anything but
sir thomas and lady elizabeth stand in a corner watching the party continue
elizabeths face darkens
dont like it
it would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit
money we dont have
and what if thedy elizabeth contd la king doesnt like her
or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl
and what if you were to look on the bright side
an ominous clap of thunder outside
risk nothing you gain nothing
ady elizabeth stares at her husband
hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin and started thinking of it as a virtue
easy for you to say
youve had power and wealth all your life
until i married you thomas
and i was happy to give it up
lady elizabeth turns and walks back inside
anne knocks on the door of her fathers study
presently the door opens
we see sir thomas inside
you asked to see me father
sir thomas closes the door
mary is in a bathroom
being prepared by anne for her wedding night
anne brushes her sisters hair
rubs oil in her skin
o the king himself is coming to hever
im so happy for george
but father took me aside
it seems he has ambitions for me too
he thinks im anne coage dnow
and of not of an nt unpleasing appearance
what are you saying
its known the king has a wandering eye
if he were to like me
you could never be more than his mistress
and thats no substitute for a husband
but as the kings mistress the least id get after he finished with me would be an earl
and if i fell pregnant
and gave him what his wife has failed to
a beat quite apart from the money itd be a duke at least
but what about your happiness
anne shrugs smiles
i could be a happy duchess
mary and anne enter the bedroom
a sea of candles
mary stares at the bed
are you nervous
youll tell me everything in the morning
no details spared
the two sisters hug tightly
the door opens and william carey appears in the doorway
anne curtseys gives mary a last good luck kiss then goes
mary stares at her husband
hold me a moment
william carey envelops mary with his arms
mary contd im so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has
mary looks at him
mary contd you are arent you
william carey smiles looks at his gorgeous bride
i am the luckiest man in the world
william reaches for the wine
william contd drink
mary shakes her head
but william tenderly insists
william contd you should
it will hurt less
mary nervously drinks
william contd lie back
mary lies down
then she lifts up her nightdress
william pulls down his trousers
mary extends her hands
inviting him to join her
william slowly lowers himself on top of her
he enters her
mary smiles in anticipation of pleasure
a side to her one might not have imagined
but one or two strokes later and williams knuckles whiten his face reddens then he cries out and slumps on top of her
mary looks up
surely that wasnt it
william contd thank you
william rolls over
soon william snores contentedly
mary is wide awake
aybe this is how its meant to be
the thunder of horses hooves
a huge cloud of dust
the royal standard flutters in the wind
beneath it a soldier in the kings uniform riding hard dirt kicking up in his wake
the soldier is flanked by a dozen other of the kings soldiers who lead a coloumn of fifty or more riders
its like an army
a legion riding into battle
but its not this is just the king of england going away for the week end
behind the advance party is the king himself s handsome in his prime surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest courtiers among them the duke of norfolk a
grand tough intimidating lot
behind them comes the kings confessor a priest with a large ornate crucifix a small library of religious books
then in a riot of colour come the musicians the fool and the players led by the master of the revels
behind them come the squires and pages carrying the kings weapons his jousting kit his swords his armour his lance etc
then come the animals falcons in cages and the hunting hounds beagles and pinchers barking in excitement and an assortment of fresh horses for travelling and hunting
and finally bringing up the rear another unit of armed guards and a second standard bearer
the boleyn family page william stafford is perched on a hill
staring into the distance
presently he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching
his expression changes
pandemonium breaks out among staff and family members as stafford calls out the king
anne is being dressed by maids
hearing the commotion outside she rushes over to the window to see the approaching riders
anne looks out of the window
scans the approaching riders until she finds the king
there he is
the young henry tudor is a dazzling magnetic intensely glamorous and handsome figure
a total contrast from the bloated bearded figure of his later years
you think he will like me
of course sister
how could he not
anne turns to face mary
the two sisters embrace tightly
the entire boleyn family is nervously assembled outside the house which we notice has been transformed at great cost
huge marquees in the gardens
new extensions to the stables and kitchens
mary is discreetly hidden among the crowds
anne is pride of place
sir thomas and lady elizabeth are beside her
the proud parents
everyone bows deeply in deference as the king arrives
your majesty you are most welcome
the king dismounts athletically
his dogs are unleashed bark excitedly
kisses hand lady elizabeth
a servant in stiff new uniform with trembling hands brings wine on a tray
henry takes a glass
may i present my son george
george visibly nervous bows deeply from the neck
but henrys attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind george
while staring at mary your uncle tells me i should have you at court
it would be a great honour sir
mary dutifully modestly averts her eyes
and our daughter anne
enry turns to see anne
no one said anything of a daughter
anne curtseys deeply
had we known we might have come sooner
perhaps youll allow anne to show you around our modest house
anne offers henry her hand
he takes it then leads anne away
mary shoots anne a look good luck
anne leads the king through the house
she is followed at a distance by sir thomas boleyn
and watched by mary and george from a gallery above
here is the library
and through here the observatory
henry looks up his eye having been caught by something
henry points at an emblem above a doorway
falcon your grace
i can see that
but whats it doing there
more to the point
turns not just there but in every corner in the house
i have no idea
ask my father
a beat perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports field sports with aristocracy and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms
shrugs a man with ambition will do the strangest things
henry is delighted by annes candour
thats a sharp tongue you have
a beat i wonder what it might say about me behind my back
oh his majesty has nothing to fear from me
unless he fears an excess of compliments
henry smiles visibly charmed
and what would they be
watching from above mary smiles to herself well done anne as henry and anne continue down a corridor
the entire boleyn family is assembled frantically changing anne from her day attire to her finest evening clothes
sir thomas watches
the king was quite smitten
told me so himself
and has requested you sit beside him at dinner
sir thomas adjusts her hair
my dear remarkable girl
i knew you would up to the task
a momentary stab of jealousy at fathers attention
but as anne looks over at mary for support
shakes herself out of it
its her sister
what was she thinking
music is being played
everyone is dressed in their finest a packed banquet hall
musicians come to a climax loud and enthusiastic applause from everyone
henry gets to his feet
and may i say
a modest smile an excellent choice of music too
nowing smiles from the courtiers sir thomas and lady elizabeth the duke of norfolk etc
sir thomas lady elizabeth dear anne
enry raises his glass
cheers and applause from the courtiers
a beaming sir thomas raises his glass
later dinner is served
everyone is eating
henry and several close courtiers are engaged in debate
i had it from the lips of the spanish ambassador himself
that our musicians are the envy of all europe
then he was flattering you your grace
our universities and philosophers too
that honour would have to go to the germans
what of our painters then
years behind their italian counterparts
the truth is far from leading the world were a provincial outpost lagging far behind
is no one proud to be english
turns to anne anne
what say you
the clanking of cutlery
all eyes on her
me my lord
clears throat i know little of such matters but ive not heard mention of our armies
undefeated i believe in a generation
or our navy
the finest in the world
the universities in spain and the philosophers in germany may be strong but are they really the equal of oxford and thomas more
i doubt there is a country that is fairer in government or better protected by nature from her enemies whose people are happier or more prosperous
shes right by god
henry is delighted
sir thomas stares proudly across the room at anne
whos hand we notice is shaking
her heart pounding in her chest
sir thomas stops anne on her way upstairs
you did well tonight
quite enough to be invited to court i am sure of it
sir thomas kisses annes forehead
now go to bed
get a good nights sleep
because theres still the hunt tomorrow
a beat you must excel at that
sir thomas watches anne go
then he turns to see his wife elizabeth
she turns away in disgust
mary and anne lie together
in spoons position
anne is fast asleep
mary strokes her sisters hair
wo vulnerable young children
the following morning
thirty or more riders stable boys and horses are gathered
to one side a deafening pack of deer hounds wire haired lurchers barking frantically
ts a scene of great activity excitement and anticipation
the master of the horse helps henry mount his steed the biggest and most glamorous stallion of all with wonderful ornate saddlery
number of other ladies are also going hunting and we notice they ride pillion ie riding on the same horse as their men sitting behind them holding onto them
inally anne comes out
the king turns
good morning anne
anne curtseys deeply
good morning your grace
ho will you be riding with
its clearly an invitation
he indicates there is room for anne on the back of his saddle
but anne fails to read the signal
on my own your grace
a stable boy leads out her horse
they have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own
anne skilfully mounts the horse and sits upright
ut with no man to hold onto
how will you stay on the horse
the same way you hold onto yours your grace
a flicker behind henrys eyes
its the first wrong move anne has made
enry yanks the reins on his horse
anne shoots a look at mary
the thunder of hooves
william stafford leads the way out with a pack of some forty or fifty hounds
its a stirring sight
following the hounds come thirty or forty riders led by the king himself
kicking his horse hah
up ahead the hounds start to bark
their pace increases
theyve got a scent
the bugler blows his horn
the dogs begin to increase their pace
the riders urge their horses to gallop
the ladies hold tight to their men
up ahead a stag wide eyed innocent lifts its head
the sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching footsteps like thunder
the stag twitches in fear then bolts off towards the forest
the dogs and riders roar across fields
the hounds snarl almost delirious with primal agitation
among the riders the more advanced horsemen have already opened up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts
n the advanced group are henry several courtiers his guards and of course anne
they jump over a hedge
one of henrys courtiers catches the hedge and falls
henry smiles then turns to see
anne comfortably jumping the hedge herself
henrys smile fades
he urges his horse to greater speed
kicking his horse hah
the terrified deer bolts into safety of the forest
the barking hounds locked into the scent follow
he riders see this and some pull up
weve lost him
hes in the forest
galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the fainthearted
but henry charges past kicking up dirt
then we must follow
henry weaves skilfully through low hanging branches
he looks over his shoulder anne follows close behind
sharp branches tear at henrys face
some draw blood
behind him several other courtiers suffer lashes from the branches and pull up
but not anne
she kicks her horse harder
seemingly impervious to the whipping branches
ahead the deer darts and weaves
the hounds give chase
alf a mile ahead
a steep ravine with a sheer drop of twenty five feet deep
at the bottom a brook with dangerous rocks then another sheer climb of twenty five feet the other side
the deer arrives looks then scampers down the ravine pursued by the hounds
he remaining riders arrive
they see the deer scramble up the other side followed by the dogs slipping in the mud and struggling with the brook
everal dogs fall
yelping in fright and pain as they lose footing and fall on the rocks
the king pulls up his horse
henry raises his hat and salutes the deer
he king of england defeated by a humble fawn
the courtiers laugh then they turn their horses around and head off
its a clear opportunity to impress
she looks down at the rocks
a long stare then
suddenly kicking horse hah
the courtiers gasp in disbelief as anne lurches forward and leaps into space heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine
orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous lethal drop
but reaching the bottom the horse leaps across the brook then scrambles up the other side
she made it
exhilarated anne turns breathing hard
the king stares at her
the courtiers stare at her
nothing but the sound of wind in the trees
please your majesty
its not safe
henry turns and stares daggers at the courtier silence
he stares across the ravine at anne
their eyes meet
hen he kicks his horse hah
and lurches forward
he heads down the sheer ravine
the courtiers gasp rush to the edge of the ravine to watch
anne goes to the edge her side
enrys horse slides perilously down the ravine then struggles to clear the brook and lands heavily in the water
he king struggles to keep control and as the horse tries to scramble up the bank the other side it loses its footing in the mud its hooves grasping horrifically
he courtiers cry out in horror anne covers her mouth as
the kings horse falls backwards unseating henry sending him flying and worst of all landing on top of him as they fall and tumble dreadfully down into the brook and
onto the rocks
pandemonium breaks out
the sound of shouting voices cries of horror raising the alarm
annes face what has she done
henry slowly comes to to find himself staring at a number of faces
a physician sir thomas boleyn the duke of norfolk one or two courtiers and finally anne
its a miracle majesty you have no broken bones
henry flinches in agony tries to move
my daughter anne is here
would like to apologise
recoils his pride hurt no
get her away from me
anne opens her mouth wants to protest but is hastily ushered out of the room
later henrys wound is being dressed by mary
and who are you
mary your grace
annes younger sister
henry looks her up and down
youve been here all week end
yes your grace
how could i have overlooked you
next to anne its easy to do
henry sits up takes h better look
enry contd tell me about yourself
yes your grace
to william carey
from wolseys office
yes your grace
then why havent i seen you at court
because i have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first
we have a small manor and some land
but enough to start a family
a charmed life in the country
away from it all
everything i would have wished for myself
but then my brother died
a beat and duty called
henry looks at mary then
you dont think hell miss court
a beat a young ambitious man
he says not your majesty
mary lowers her eyes
but if he ever changed his mind i would always support him
henry stares at mary
strapped and bandaged henry is helped onto his horse
beside him george boleyn is also on a horse riding off to court for the first time
sir thomas and lady elizabeth bow curtsey farewell
thank you again lady elizabeth
well take good care of your boy
kissing her hand and thomas
henry embraces him whispers in sir thomass ear
youll take care of that matter
consider it done your majesty
henry shoots a lingering look at mary which anne notices
then the king and his entourage ride off
mary waves farewell to george
mary and anne are sitting together
presently the door opens and william stafford emerges
your father wishes to see you
mary and anne get to their feet
stafford raises his hand
mary shoots anne a quizzical look then goes with stafford
annes smile fades
a flicker of suspicion
an intimidating atmosphere
dogs lie at the feet of the duke of norfolk
sir thomas looks up
mary i dont know what you said or did but you obviously made a deep impression on the king
exchanges a look with sir and he has requested you come to court with immediate effect
marys eyes widen in disbelief
anne listens at the door
william stafford watches from the doorway as the duke of norfolk william carey and sir thomas smile delightedly staring at mary
oure to pack and leave first thing in the morning
mary shoots a desperate look at her husband
the king himself has secured you a position in the queens household
ut i dont want to go to court
nor does my husband
william carey clears his throat
avoids marys eyes
the king has also offered me a position
as gentleman of the privy council
gentleman of the privy council
attending to the private and personal needs of his majesty himself
thats the inner sanctum
marys shell shocked lost for words
but what about our future
here in the country
put it out of your mind
from now on your home is at court
dont you understand what this means
mary stares imploringly
they will separate us
put me in different accommodation
where the king can always
william carey averts his eyes
happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity
a beat for us all
what about anne
couldnt she go instead
sir thomass expression darkens
a flicker of pain
the way that girl behaved this week end she can count herself lucky she still has a home
annes face outside the door its as if a knife had been plunged into her gut
she turns and runs down the corridor
william and mary lie in bed
mary is equally wretched
tears are also running down her cheeks
she stares at her husband
how could he do this to me
my own father
a beat what if we just refused
we would be cut off
he made that clear
but would that be so bad
mary stares at him
position means nothing to me
we could find somewhere
a small farm
away from everything
you say that now but when youre older
and our children are grown up
comforting her this wont last long
and at the end of that well we have everything we want
a beat its for our future
ut cant you see
do this and we might not have a future
mary is getting ready to leave
she turns a corner and bang walks straight into anne
a tense moment
the two sisters stare at one another
im so sorry
you think i want the king
or to be used and abused by him
puts on brave smile no
youre welcome to him
i have my own plans which dont involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded
mary stares saddened oh anne but theres no time to talk
she has to go
anne is left
her eyes blazing
mary and william ride through london streets escorted by servants bringing their belongings
they approach whitehall palace
armed guards slowly open the gates
marys face as the heavy gates open
she shoots a last look at the free world outside
then she rides through the palace gates
clank the heavy doors shut behind her
the outside world has been totally sealed off
faces appear at palace windows staring down at the new arrivals
mong them is henry himself
he stares out of the window
then he lets the curtain fall
katherine of aragon late s imperious intimidating spanish
surrounded by other ladies in waiting mostly high born spanish and the queens age
a servant announces
mary carey maam
queen katherine looks up
the new lady in waiting
but i was not expecting anyone
his majesty the king
by my husband
the air crackles with tension
its school bullying
well then she must be some kind of gift
he must have seen in her some special talent that would please me
what special talent is it that you have
with icy contempt apart from your obvious youth and beauty
errified mary stammers
im afraid not
come youre too modest
turns to a musician signor vasquez
the spanish guitarist obliges by starting to play a well known tune of the period
i beg you your majesty
barks suddenly terrifying i command you to sing
blushing deeply her skin glowing with perspiration and terror she begins to sing
normally she sings well
but her voice now is strangled with fear
mary stands rigid her knuckles whiten nails digging into her hands drawing blood
finally mary finishes
the room is silent
all eyes on katherine who stares coldly
a formidable adversary
the cruel satisfaction of victory welcome at court
mary walks through the packed corridors of court her face burning from the humiliation
the sound of a voice behind her
but mary does not hear
she continues walking distressed and distractedly enters
finally she is caught by jane parker whom we had seen at the window earlier
younger also english a kindred spirit
i know that must have been agony but put yourself in her shoes
she knows the only reason the king has asked you here is because he desires you
for a wife that must be very difficult
a beat shes a good woman
mary manages a smile
ane contd jane parker
the two girls shake hands
you have a brother dont you
ive seen him a few times at court
and like him
a beat but i dont think he has noticed me
i cant imagine
a beat should i mention you to him
ane parker smiles
but as soon as marys back is turned the smile fades
a large dusty yard where knights train for combat and practise their fighting skills
mary is with george who is putting on his armour
not noticed her
of course i have
how could i not
she looks like a goat
well she likes you and asked me to give you this
to remember her by
mary hands over a handkerchief
well say you havent seen me
or that you forgot
george hastily gives it back
george contd there is something about that woman that makes me feel
he shudders george gets to his feet indicates to his male courtier friend that he is coming
and our sister
you know she took being upstaged by you very badly
yes i know
and no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadnt done it intentionally
but you know i would never do anything like that
george finds his helmet puts it on
george contd just give her time
shell come round
mary watches george go to join the other male courtiers
mary enters her room and closes the door
she begins undressing taking off her clothes then catches sight of a dog in the shadows
its the kings dog
please dont be alarmed
enry steps out of the shadows
mary covers herself in modesty and falls to her knees in a deep curtsey of deference
henry steps into the light walks towards her
h i wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so i might say a few words to you in person
enry turns looks around the room
i hope your accommodation is comfortable
i realise its no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country
a beat but please give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here
a beat nry contd the moment i met you i realised i
henry tails off as mary unbuttoning her dress
tailing off what are you
marys dress comes off her shoulder
the kings eyes however instead of staring at marys beautiful exposed body stay focused on her eyes
an uncomfortable moment
i am sorry
delicately putting her clothes back on mary you obviously misunderstand me
henry bows in respect then turns and takes his leave leaving mary standing in the room
the duke of norfolk stares in disbelief at mary
his dogs lie intimidatingly at his feet
if all the king wanted was coition he could fetch in a woman from the bath house
a beat what he wants is you
a beat to woo you
and be wooed in return
a beat and couldnt you look just a little happier
there isnt a girl in the kingdom that wouldnt wish to be in your shoes
your opinion uncle
mary speaks quietly
lowers her head
mine is that its the greatest insult of all
asking a whore to have feelings too
an incense filled royal chapel
the archbishop is giving mass in latin for the royal household
he king sits at the front on the left
with the men
the ladies are separated as is traditional and sit on the right
henry is lost in prayer
its not long however before he turns to look at mary
meanwhile a remote country parish church
local priest arrives
he sees two horses tethered to a tree by the side of the church
checks no one has followed him
hen he enters the church
in the royal chapel the archbishop solemnly performs the eucharist breaking bread and making wine from blood
but in full view of all those in the chapel the king continues to stare at mary
inally she looks up
their eyes meet
mary blushes averts her gaze
but then for the first time she reciprocates
and looks back
this is witnessed by the queen and further back by the duke of norfolk and sir thomas boleyn
everyone is pretending to focus on the mass
but none of them can concentrate
in the country church the priests eyes become accustomed to the dark
everywhere long shadows eerie darkness
are you there
presently a woman steps into the light
dressed in a shawl
no one saw you
you brought the money
anne hands over a purse of coins
they walk to the altar
and the groom
is he here
up ahead the groom slowly steps out of the shadows
now we see his face
its henry percy
then let us begin
back at court the service ends
everyone in the royal household filters out of the church
but its a very different atmosphere to when they entered
the extent of henrys affection for mary is now public knowledge evidenced by
the attention sir thomas and norfolk now receive from cardinal wolsey and thomas cromwell and the way in which queen katherine and her spanish ladies are being neglected
mary allows herself a private smile of satisfaction
surprised at how good it feels
to be the number
mary lies in bed in a room covered in flowers
she admires a beautiful necklace in a box and a handwritten letter from the king
we can see from marys face how much she likes it
presently urgent knock knock at the door
marys eyes widen in excitement
she hurriedly closes the necklaces box
tucks the letter away in a drawer
she gets out of bed
anxiously straightens her hair then goes to the door to find
george her brother who bursts in
its the middle of the night
hes married henry percy
without telling anyone
marys face falls
tailing off you dont look pleased
why would i be pleased
it would make her the future duchess of northumberland
but theyll never allow it dont you see
hes already precontracted to mary talbot and if word of the consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined
mary pulls back her sheets
i have to tell father
before its too late
george watches mary go to the door
a family meeting anne and henry percy the handsome young nobleman from marys wedding stand in front of the duke of norfolk and sir thomas boleyn and george
what were you thinking
the marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state
something only the king can decide
henry percy looks down avoiding eye contact
who knows about this
then that is how it shall remain
but you cannot undo what has been done before god
defiant stare and consummated too
snap norfolks quill breaks
sir thomas almost chokes
georges eyes widen
struggling to contain his anger there have been improper intimacies too
i have lain with my husband
there is nothing improper about it
my god if you were my daughter id thrash you within an inch of your life
anne recoils terrified
the boy will return to northumberland where he will marry the talbot girl
sir thomas gives the signal for william stafford to escort percy out
as for you
you will go to france and stay there until you have learned your lesson
how could you do this to your sister
you know full well her friendship with the king is at an extremely delicate stage
any scandal or black mark against marys name now could be fatal
sir thomas dismisses her
you will join the court of the french queen
and stay there until your father has forgiven you
mary paces anxiously in the corridor
presently anne emerges from the room
burning with humiliation
their eyes meet
mary is about to speak but anne cuts her off
ou told them didnt you
a beat how could you
because you would never have got away with it
and it would have ruined your prospects forever
a beat believe me
i did it for your good
for my good
ill try to remind myself of that
while im in exile
and youre here in the kings bed and unchallenged for our fathers affection
a beat that it was for my good
anne storms out
george shoots mary a look ill deal with this and runs after anne
over this we fade in music and the sound of laughter
a grand masque ball
were in a spectacular candle lit ballroom
large formations of dancers perform elaborately choreographed moves
among them we pick out
sir thomas boleyn stalking the party
he is distracted by the sight of
his son george boleyn surrounded by francis weston and his friends
george is clearly in his element
laughing in delight
very fond and intimate with francis weston
sir thomas looks concerned for the first time
n another corner mary is in costume but looking forlorn
she watches proceedings with a blank distant expression
presently a voice behind her
why look so glum mary
mary turns to see a masked man behind her
what reason have i to be happy
ou have two men the king of england and i both fighting for your love
the masked man is tall
his voice is quiet but strong
do i know you
you know me mary but not half as well as i know you
i know you better than anyone here
and love you better than anyone here too
and if god had made me your husband instead of william carey one thing i know
a beat i would never have let you go
marys smile fades
who are you
mary lunges for the mans mask to try and remove it but the man retreats into the safety of the shadows
all around mary the crowds part and a deep voice booms out
who have we here
mary turns to see a second masked man unmistakably the king surrounded by courtiers
my name is kindness
wonder will you be kind to me
what is it you desire
our love fair lady
you demand a great deal
no more than i would give in return
mary notices her father is among the masked courtiers
his eyes giving mary cues
it is easy for a man to declare love from behind a mask
ut if i remove it you might reject me
if your feelings were sincere i would never reject you
but you do not know who i am
i could be ugly
o matter how you looked
or who you were
then i shall hold you to your word
with a flourish the king rips off his mask
sir thomas urgently nods go on
mary theatrically swoons
falling into the kings arms
a gasp among the courtiers
take her to my rooms
call my physicians
sir thomas quickly picks mary up
he carries her through the crowds out of the ball room
queen katherine watches from a distance
a flicker of pain
then with great dignity and pride she turns back to watch the entertainment
thump the doors open and mary is carried into the kings apartments
henry fusses brings water
sir thomas bows to the king shoots mary meaningful look dont fail me and retreats
henry closes the doors
he and mary are left alone
henry makes her comfortable
thank you your grace
the first rule of this room is to leave your graces and your majestys outside
enry looks up
is there anything i can bring you
nothing to increase your comfort or well being
you might ask your servants to bring me some water
henry goes to get water himself
there are no servants
marys eyes widen
the king of england brings her a drink
mary takes a sip of her drink and watches as henry goes behind a screen and begins to remove his costume
mary notices a mirror and watches in the reflection of the mirror how henry removes the costume and status of king and becomes a man
enry visibly unwinds his facial muscles relax
he breathes out deeply
his face becomes softer
then he puts on a comfortable robe and emerges from behind the screen
henry goes over to a pile of cushions and flops down and smiles at mary
so this is it
this is where the king of england sleeps
and finds a few moments each day
gestures for himself
henry smiles at mary
henry contd you look surprised
i suppose its more
mary looks at the bed the books the pages of writing on the desk
simple than i imagined
theres no need for show
i am only ever here alone
and yet you invite me here
because i trust you
you hardly know me
a man in my position develops an instinct
a beat you would never lie could never lie to me
mary smiles admitting hes right
i also sense
that you might relish an opportunity to be yourself too
well here you only say what you like do what you like
stretches out her legs
id like an apple please
cant believe shes saying this henry
henry jumps to his feet brings mary an apple
mary laughs thank you
bites into the apple
now its your turn
to say something or do something you couldnt outside
there are many things i cannot admit to in public
sadness for example
but when you are loved as much as you are
how can you be lonely
do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage
i do now
married my brothers widow because my father ordered it
as a duty
to keep the alliance with spain
and she is a remarkable woman
henry looks at mary
but i never looked at her or longed for her the way i do you
henry reaches out
their hands meet
imagine how different it might have been
for both of us
had we been able to chose for ourselves
henry leans forward and they kiss
gently at first
ensing this the king picks mary up and leads her to the canopied bed and lays her down
they begin to make love
as radical a contrast to the scene with william carey as it is possible to imagine
marys eyes open
her hands grip the sheets
henry and mary entwined in one anothers arms as the sun rises
several hours later william stafford is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor outside
finally the door opens
and mary emerges from the kings apartment
tafford jumps to his feet
i have orders to bring you to your father
mary stares at stafford
as he straightens his shirt
a beat well wed better not keep him waiting
stafford turns leads the way
the duke of norfolks dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by the fire
the entire family is gathered
sir thomas lady elizabeth
also present is william carey
mary stares at her husband
did he have you
marys eyes burn
more than once
mary stares daggers
youd better get used to talking about it
once you sleep with the king its not a private matter any more
more than once
william careys face a flicker of pain
so he was satisfied
i believe so uncle
this is where our work begins
its one thing to catch the king
quite another to keep him
norfolk turns to sir thomas ignoring mary as though she were a piece of livestock
i want you to keep her spotless hair washed every day
she must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion
she must know her music must be energetic and entertaining in company and in bed
thats how he likes his women
and if ever shes in any doubt as to how to conduct herself or what to do next she should simply watch the queen
that woman kept him from straying for eleven years
and the effort almost killed her
ut sir thomas has not heard
he is distracted
he watches from a palace window as in a stableyard down below
george and francis weston return from riding together
the sound of laughter as they dismount and hand their horses to the stable boys
sir thomas watches as george and francis walk back to the palace together
theres something in their manner the intimacy between them
sir thomass smile fades
slap henry spreads out a huge architects drawing of a magnificent ship on a table
he sits with sir thomas boleyn and the duke of norfolk
the biggest warship in the fleet
thirty two guns and two hundred feet long and with your permission thomas
we notice sir thomass clothes have become more expensive grander id like to name her after your daughter
the mary boleyn
sir thomas looks up in disbelief
shes an angel
its the least she deserves
and if theres anything else i can do for you my friend
as an expression of my gratitude
let me know
sir thomass tails off
s it happens
there is one thing
sir thomas has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw between george and francis weston
ur son george
hes of an age now
you want me to make him a match
sir thomas bows
yes your majesty
do you have anyone in mind
there is one lady sir
who i fear is too high born for us
and following the unfortunate matter between anne and henry percy i didnt want my children to overreach themselves again
henry cant help smiling
one is currently in the kings bed
if they are good enough for me i suggest theyre good enough for anyone else
gestures who is it
over this we hear georges distraught voice
george boleyn visibly shocked and distressed stands in front of his father
i beg you father
shes well connected her father is cousin to the king
and theres money too
but must i actually
sir thomass expression changes
thought you had ambitions for this family
g i do
and that you wish to make a contribution yourself
not just stand back and watch your sisters
then my advice would be to start behaving like a man
a real man
do i make myself clear
sir thomas walks out
george stares after him
quiet yes sir
were at georges wedding
attended by the king and queen all the senior lords
its a markedly grander and posher affair than marys earlier wedding a clear indication of the boleyns new elevated status
a formation dance is in progress
at the centre of it george dances with a radiant triumphant jane parker
georges eyes meet those of francis weston across the room
y contrast henry dances with mary
a couple with eyes on for each other
locked to one another
blissfully unaware of and uninterested in anyone else
silently counting the minutes before they can tear off one anothers clothes
their intimacy is witnessed by william carey who we notice is now drinking heavily drowning his jealous sorrows
sir thomas boleyn is dancing with his wife lady elizabeth
he hisses through a fixed smile
for gods sake its the wedding of our youngest child attended by the king of england and the greatest lords in the land
would a smile be too much to ask
whats to smile about
im a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like hes been condemned to death
he indicates george who dances with jane parker
another banished abroad in disgrace
and a third whoring in public with an adulterer
for the moment shes happy
sir thomas watches mary who dances with the king
but will she be happy when he leaves her
because you know thats how it will end
only god knows how anything will end
he turned his back on all this a long time ago
sir thomas stares coldly at his wife
he applauds as the dance comes to an end
mary and the king also clap
henry whispers sexily in marys ear
then henry is called to one side
mary is momentarily left alone
she looks up to see william carey standing in front of her swaying slightly
youre in love with him arent you
illiam youre drunk
how is it
mary stares suddenly hard punishing him
he pleases me
is that what you want to hear
what does he do to you
i want to know
mary pulls away
but carey pulls her roughly to one side
henry sees this from across the room
i know you look at me with contempt
but i had no choice
your father insisted i stand aside
what was i expected to do
say no husband
a beat that was all you had to do
mary pulls her arm away and goes
she walks across the room visibly shaken and joins the king
henry and mary make love
two people giving everything of themselves
hours later they lie together enveloped in one anothers arms
mary is awake
the king asleep in her arms
she lovingly strokes his hair
watches him breathe
her face is glowing
and the look in her eyes tells us more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet
that she has fallen in love
the sound of groaning
shooting through a half open door we see mary hunched over her basin vomiting
resently she emerges from the bathroom
her hands instinctively covering her belly
marys eyes widen with the implications
sir thomas boleyn and the duke of norfolk stare at mary
also present are several physicians and george boleyn
are you certain
sir thomas looks at the physician who nods
n that case
someone should tell the king
shooting through a half open door
sir thomas and the duke of norfolk are having a private audience with the king
sir thomas whispers something in henrys ear
henrys face breaks out in a smile
he delightedly shakes sir thomass hand
over this the sound of a voice
keep them shut
a blindfolded mary is led through doors by sir thomas
into a suite of grand unfurnished rooms the most prestigious accommodation at court
mary removes her blindfold
she gasps in disbelief turns degrees staring at the size and grandeur of the location
thanks to you i am to become an earl
your brother a viscount
eorge smiles at mary whos eyes widen
sir thomas contd in addition we have received a number of new grants and estates
pointedly to lady so our debts are paid off
but lady elizabeth remains granite faced
just be aware
these gifts this favour can go as swiftly as it comes
these rooms belonged to the duke of buckingham
once the kings closest friend
now his head rots on a spike
because he committed treason
but what is treason
its anything the king or his lawyers decide it to be
anything that offends him or causes him displeasure
a beat and can you assure me well never do that
lady elizabeth turns and walks out
mary looks anxiously at sir thomas who gestures dismissively
pay her no heed
mary wakes up
she gets out of bed
she goes to the window and draws the curtains
then mary looks down and gasps
the floor has fresh drops of blood on it
mary goes to her bed and rips back the sheets
her eyes widen in horror
there is blood all over the sheets
mary covers her mouth
lets out a loud cry
the sound of approaching footsteps as servants come running
mary lies on the bed being examined by several physicians
sir thomas and the duke of norfolk look on in concern
finally the physician turns washing his hands
happily the baby lives
shes not miscarried
sir thomass face
overcome with relief
but the placenta is weak
for the sake of the child
the physician clears his throat
this will not be easy
she must begin her lying in immediately
mary looks up
her heart sinks
but im only three months
mary lies in her bed watching with a forlorn expression as midwives and maids prepare the apartment for lying in
apestries with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls
curtains are drawn for darkness
a large crucifix is placed in a corner
as each tapestry is hung the room becomes darker
mary cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as possible but before long
her face slips into darkness and the room into total silence
and effective imprisonment
the king stands at the foot of marys bed
he is clearly uncomfortable in these maternal surroundings
ou poor girl
all alone in here
but the time will fly by
its six months
but the most important thing is a healthy child
enry takes marys hand
henry contd ill come and see you as often as i can
enry kisses mary then goes
the kings birthday
the master of revels has organised a lavish ball
the entire court is assembled and dancing but henry appears sullen distant
unable to celebrate
he misses mary
he queen has several of her prettiest spanish ladies in waiting surrounding the king
giggling fragrant butterflies
but henry shows no interest
the duke of norfolk notices this
a flicker of concern
an archery competition is in progress
but henry pays no attention
he sits listlessly to one side
ill tempered and missing mary
mong the guests are sir john seymour and his children
they notice the king all alone
they talk among themselves
sensing an opportunity sir john seymour advances and presents his pretty daughter jane to the king
the duke of norfolk never far away notices how modestly and demurely young jane seymour flirts
she has been well trained
but she makes no impact on henry
he waves the seymours away
not remotely interested
or the moment
the king is visiting mary
he sits by her bed
they hold hands and are talking intimately
this is being watched by the duke of norfolk and sir thomas boleyn
norfolks face is dark and brooding
for the moment hes still visiting mary
but for how long
the queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little spanish things
not to mention the seymours with that girl of theirs
norfolk looks up
what we need is someone from our family who will keep the king focused on mary reminding him of her while she is absent
sir thomas is about to speak then changes his mind
i was going to suggest anne
you couldnt control that girl last time
what makes you think it would be any different now
ive had favourable reports from the dowager queen in france
it seems she is quite changed
mary sits up
her eyes widen in horror
sitting beside her in the darkness is her brother george
i suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough
but the king visits me every day
theres no need for her
or anyone else
they just want to protect you
leave nothing to chance
but in whos interests do they imagine anne will act
certainly not mine
george turns looks all around him
george contd why do they make this room such a dungeon
does it really need to be this dark
george notices marys vexed expression
shes had three years to forgive you
and shes not going to risk being sent away again
shell do as shes told im sure
a beat besides the most important thing is
george moves marys lips into an upward shape
the three of us will be together again
marys lips a reluctant unconvincing smile
the thunder of galloping horses
alf a dozen riders among them a hooded woman riding side saddle tearing across the countryside
the riders and the woman gallop through villages spraying mud
villagers stop and stare
a mother pulls a child out of the path of the riders
the riders and the woman ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon
henry and several of his courtiers return from a hunting trip
several dead stags are carried on horseback
the atmosphere is celebratory
its been a good day
dogs bark in excitement
a dinner at court
henry is at one end in serious conversation with foreign ambassadors
presently at the other end of the table loud laughter
enry looks up then returns to his conversation
its not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room
henry looks up again
then returns to his conversation
resently a third roar of laughter at the other end
this time henry loses patience
whats the noise
i can hardly hear myself think
at the other end a courtier gets to his feet
its mistress boleyn your majesty
her stories about life at the french court
they are particularly amusing
henrys expression changes
the room falls silent
im only aware of one boleyn girl and she is lying in with a certain child in her belly
sir thomas boleyn gets to his feet
its my elder daughter anne your majesty
she has returned to court
that awful girl thomas
the one that almost killed me
a beat you allowed her back
the time abroad has done her good your majesty
im certain youd find her much improved
henry looks down the table
well come on
where are you other boleyn girl
show your face
anne slowly gets to her feet
henry looks up
when he sees annes face his face falls
anne is a woman transformed
gone are the simple clothes puppy fat and lack of confidence
anne has become a glorious head turning siren dressed in daring french clothes
er hood is half crescent and reveals the hair
her neckline plunges sexily
her sleeves are long and loose offering daring flashes of arm and elbow
like every other red blooded man in the room henry is utterly mesmerised
what is so amusing anne
perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves
anne dark intelligent eyes stare back at henry
suddenly all sound fades and the world shrinks around them its as though they are the only two people in the room
i was just giving my thoughts on the new french king
that for someone with such great wealth and power
he has surprisingly little authority as a man
and is so consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think
and who is this rival
a neighbouring king whos name one is forbidden to mention at court
whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams
ipples of laughter as people guess
whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour
whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide
enry laughs too
in order to restore his confidence this french king spends a fortune on anything that glitters on building of castles with large towers
anne artfully gestures the phallic implications
but these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince
talk among the ladies at court in france suggests
anne stops herself
that in this department too the king has his shortcomings
annes gesture discreetly wiggling her small finger
henry stares for a moment
a deathly silence
has she gone too far
then henry smiles
dogs bark in bewilderment
soon everyone in the room laughs too
xcept for the seymours sir john and his sons edward and thomas who glower mute at the end of the table beside their sister jane
sir thomas beams with excitement and satisfaction
you should have seen the seymours
mary lies in bed
sitting by her side is her father
they must have thought that with you out of the way they had a real opportunity with that pale faced thing of theirs jane
sir thomas smiles as he remembers
sir thomas contd but anne put pay to that
last night the king only had eyes for us boleyns
mary shoots a private knowing look
or her you mean
m wary of any suggestion that anne would serve anyone but herself
france cant have changed her that much
n this occasion i am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you
mary stares hollow eyed
mary contd then ask yourself this
if she is really so concerned for my well being
then why hasry conot dcome to see me ma she nt since she returned
henry and several of his closest courtiers are sparring close combat sword fighting
its tough physical no holds barred stuff
afterwards henry and his courtiers among them george are being undressed and washed by their pages and squires
youre a fortunate man george
to be blessed with g two such sisters
yes my lord
there is a powerful physicality a sexual confidence to henry which he exudes even among men
he moves closer to george
are they as different in temper as they are in looks
each has her own quite distinct virtues
mary for example
im familiar with marys
tell me about annes
well shes strong
some might say difficult
with a fiery temper
but with it comes great passion too
its both the best and the worst thing about her
a beat there are no half measures with anne
careful youll make me think i chose the wrong boleyn girl
im certain mary is the right choice
you will have a serene happy life with her
the risk is with anne it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm
is that so
george has tried to put henry off
but might just have said the wrong thing
storm you say
a small precious looking gift box sits on a table
from the king madam
anne looks at the box
her heart misses a beat
it carries the unmistakable royal seal
a servant stares
i said open it
the servant opens it
other servants crane their necks stand on tiptoes
inside is a large pearl pendant
the servant gasps
covers her mouth
but from somewhere she manages to find the strength
now close it again
and send it back
the servant stares in disbelief
anne contd you heard me
the servant bows and leaves taking the box
anne watches a look of mischief in her eyes
shes up to no good
the servant nervously stands in front of the king holding the box
she did what
sent it back your grace
sent it back
a royal messenger in the kings livery holding a larger more expensive looking gift box walks towards the boleyn house
anne shakes her head and sends the gift back
she looks anxious
knows this is a high risk game shes playing
the messenger stands in front of the king holding the rejected box in his hands
the same royal messenger walks towards the boleyn house
this time holding an even larger more expensive looking gift
again anne shakes her head and sends the gift back
the king is in a meeting with several ambassadors on an important matter
the doors open
he looks up to see
the messenger returning with the latest gift
henrys smile fades
crash the king flanked by several of his most intimidating courtiers bursts through doors and storms along a corridor
its an impressive sight
people scatter to get out of the way
the king bursts in
everyone leaps to their feet
servants stop and stare and curtsey
lady elizabeth bows clearly thrown
henry turns full circle looking for someone
where is she
anne hears the kings voice
her eyes widen
she looks down
anne smiles privately its confirmation that her strategy has worked
t that moment henry sees her calls out anne
annes smile fades
enry dashes up the stairs
anne who is not properly dressed for the king rushes back to her room
anne closes the door
a hurriedly dressing your grace
they speak through the door
you received my gifts
they did not please you
on the contrary my lord
they pleased me greatly
then why did you return them
now anne opens the door
she appears wearing a stunning outfit
anne steps into the corridor
closes the door behind her
ecause my sister lies in bed with your child
if you wish to please me sir then send her the gifts you send me
i have shown mary enough kindness and generosity
its you i want anne
beg you my lord do not do this
what has changed so
dont you see
you have changed
but mary is still the mother of your child
and even if she werent
how could i forget that you chose her above me when we first met
you liked her better
either way i could never betray my own sister
a beat ne contd now i beg you leave me
this is too difficult to bear
the same pain as mine
it proves you feel the same way
but since it can never come to anything
let me decide that
for now you have given me hope
enry goes on bended knee kisses her hand and goes
anne is left alone
she breathes out
then looks down at her hands
hey are shaking
mary is asleep
dead of night
suddenly she wakes up and holds her stomach ouch
its the first contraction
sir thomas is asleep
the sound of voices
a commotion outside
the sound of banging on his door
mary cries out in pain
the contractions become stronger
midwives and physicians urgently do their business
pots of boiling water
primitive surgical instruments
priest arrives ready to perform the last rites
the duke of norfolk sir thomas and george boleyn arrive in marys bedroom and stare anxiously as the labour begins in earnest
does the king know
hes on his way
anne who overhears this surreptitiously adjusts her dress
mary screams in agony
the labour is well and truly under way
medically its a primitive brutal affair
no comprehension of sterilisation
midwives have dirty hands
physicians use rusty blood stained instruments
presently the king arrives with several courtiers
any moment your grace
but the king hasnt heard
he has seen anne
suddenly its as if all sound all vision disappears except for anne
he stands beside her
all around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding but for all their connection with it henry and anne might as well be in a rose garden
anne stares ahead at marys bed
anne i love you
your grace this is not the time
i love you anne
i cannot stop thinking about you
i cannot eat i cannot sleep
but how could i ever trust you
norfolk cranes his neck to listen
when i have seen how you have betrayed first your wife
and now my sister
henry takes anne to one side
i vow from this moment forth i will never lie with my wife or speak to your sister again
i will do anything you ask
marys contractions build
birth is imminent
physicians and midwives work to deliver the baby
anne thinks then
then dont acknowledge the child
henry is thrown
with a blood curdling scream mary finally gives birth
sir thomas and norfolk crowd into the room anxious to see
sir thomas turns towards henry beaming with happiness
its a boy your majesty
a strong healthy boy
henrys face a boy
his eyes fill with emotion
this is what he has waited for
anne notices his conflict and prompts him again
what my sister has given you i could too
henry looks at the baby then turns to face anne
his eyes are full of conflict then
he silently nods
annes face breaks out in a smile
then in front of everyone not caring how inappropriate it is henry falls to his knee takes annes hand and kisses it
the audible sound of gasps
mary watches in horror as henry falls to his knees and kisses annes hand
a dagger in her heart henry
henry gets to his feet then turns and walks away without looking in the direction of mary or the baby
mary contd my lord
mary stares after the king but he does not turn around
instead marys eyes meet annes
annes eyes stare back
the ultimate moment of revenge
barely perceptible smile of satisfaction then anne turns and goes
the midwives and physicians stare at one another visibly embarrassed by what they have just witnessed
the clearing of throats averting of eyes
then they get on with their work to the sound of the marys cries
crash sir thomas and norfolk burst into the study angrily slamming the door closed behind them
anne is inside
three years weve been working on this
not a single detail was left to chance
and now in the moment of our greatest glory
norfolk stares at anne
all i can say is youd better have a plan
and it had better work
anne stares back defiantly
both of you
what shall we do about mary
and the child
or have we forgotten them already
mary should go back to her husband
not a flicker of emotion on her face
she has been inconvenienced long enough by this family
then you can be the one to tell her
ady elizabeth stares at anne
i think youve earned that privilege
lady elizabeth turns and walks out
annes smile fades
mary lies in bed
she looks pale
anne stares into the room through a crack in the doorway
a flicker of doubt
what has she done
to her own sister
anne checks herself
she swallows it
mary looks up as anne enters and freezes
how can you show your face in here
i understand youre angry but be assured
i did nothing except remind him of you
oh spare me
you did this deliberately
a beat and now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done
well hasnt it
be careful thats my advice
learn from my experience
because hell only do to you what he has done to me
ill make sure he understands im a greater thing by far
that he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer
youll never get henry percy back if thats what you mean
thats not what i mean
annes eyes burn with anger
and dont you ever mention his name to me again
ill never forget how you betrayed me
if thats what you think fine
tell yourself that
i did sister
every day for three years
anne turns and walks out
mary is leaving court
her belongings have been packed into boxes
ahead of her the baby is being carried by midwives led by william stafford
mary walks across a courtyard then stops in her tracks
ver by the stables the king and anne are mounting horses to go riding together
henry lifts anne up into the saddle behind him how she has learned
anne holds tight her arms wrapped around his waist
at that moment anne looks over and sees mary
their eyes meet
they stare for a beat then
anne kicks henrys horse hah
and they ride out
galloping into the distance
marys face fighting to hold onto her dignity
william stafford watches her his eyes burning with sympathy
reverse angle to reveal this is all being watched by queen katherine from a palace window above
queen katherine turns and coldly lets the curtain drop
mary and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small caravan of horses and wagons
its raining heavily
the rain continues
marys carriage approaches the manor house
at one time this was everything she wanted
now its a prison
mary sits at the dinner table with her husband william carey whos health has deteriorated
he drinks heavily
a shadow of his former self
he stares at the baby
have you christened the child
a painful smile
and is he to take my name
or is he to be a fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast
he is to be henry carey
a silence then
well then here we are
william stares at mary
clearly still in love with her
i could pretend none of this ever happened
a beat if you could
manages a brave smile
mary lies in bed her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon outside as william carey makes love to her
after a short frenzied thrashing
he climaxes then as before rolls over and falls asleep
mary stares at the ceiling
greenwich palace at its most beautiful
henry and anne walk through the gardens
out of earshot of the entire court which is assembled outside
well i have done what you asked
will you give yourself to me now
my one true mistress
to whom i am loyal above all others
but its not true
you are loyal to the queen above all others
i barely see her
but she sits on a throne beside you
accompanies you to every state function
for appearance sakes only
in every other regard our marriage is a sham
still she is your wife
and ever present
and i feel her eyes on me
and those of her spies
anne nervously looks left and right
and look at us
forever reduced to meeting in secret like this
speaking in whispers
a beat hardly conducive to passion
well what would you have me do
anne watches from a distance as henry talks to wolsey
we do not hear their dialogue but the two men are having a heated discussion
voices are raised
wolsey pleads with the king to be reasonable
henry silences him angrily then walks out
anne enters a lavish drawing room and sits down
she picks up a book and pretends to be reading
henry enters sidles up behind anne putting his arms around her then
wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the queen to be sent to a nunnery
henry kisses anne on the neck
she will protest of course
she wont go quietly but she knows she has failed to give me a son and deserves her exile
henry kisses anne which leaves you all alone at court
he begins to unbutton her dress
queen in all but name
mother to any future heir
enry unbuttons and kisses lower lower
so is this assurance enough
will you give yourself to me now
a flicker behind annes eyes then
id like to
but im afraid i find the insult too much to bear
because as long as we remain unmarried any child i gave you would forever be daubed bastard and i a whore
ut what alternative is there
throws hands up in exasperation my love for the queen may have died but even you must concede she is still very much alive
a katherine of aragon is alive
that woman is not worthy of the title queen
i really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage
that woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against god
but she never consummated the marriage with my brother
they were married six months
arthur was a sick man
and katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother
a beat talk to your advisers
they will tell you as much
anne walks out
anne sits in her study working
henry appears in the doorway
his face is dark
wolsey has agreed to charge the queen
but thats wonderful
annes smiles then notices
why do you look sad
because she will contest it
which means putting her on trial
and hearing these delicate matters in public
but any court made up of your bishops will surely find in your favour
and declare the marriage invalid
now its annes turn to start kissing henry round the neck
hen you my sweet lord will be free to remarry
sensing his arousal then i can give myself to you fully
kissing him lower lower
and give you everything you
a beat desire
anne stops leaving henry highly aroused
its mid winter
a lone rider appears on the snowy crest of the hill looking down on rochford hall
ts william stafford now bearded
he kicks his horse
rides down towards the house
a fire roars
stafford warms himself staring at marys new baby daughter catherine in a a cot
i brought gifts from your family
a night dress from your mother
to young henry this from your uncle george
stafford produces a small wooded sword from behind his back
little henry takes the sword
swooshes it with excitement
please be sure to thank them though one wonders whats kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby
shes turning this country on its head
she has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage and put the queenm on trial
she continues to hold out
expertly witholding her favours until
until he makes her the ultimate offer
marys eyes widen
high stakes indeed
mary follows stafford out to the stables where freshly watered and fed horses are waiting
and my brother george
continues to be promoted
as does your father
i lost track of their latest titles
mounts his horse
ow is your husband
i heard he was unwell
stafford stares at her
their eyes meet
stafford opens his mouth for a moment it looks as if hes about to finally declare his feelings then
william careys voice calls out from inside
staffords expression changes
nows not the right time
he kicks his horse and rides off
william carey lying in bed emaciated coughing blood weak and sick calls out for help mary
mary walks down a corridor towards her husbands bedroom
as she goes she passes a window
and looks out
in the distance is william staffords horse
reaching the brow of a hill
at that precise moment william staffords horse reaches the top of the hill
pulling horse up whoa
stafford turns and faces back down at the house
he takes a last look
for a moment there is a connection between them both
hen he turns and kicks his horse and rides over the brow
mary watches him go then stops catches herself feeling something for the first time
then she turns and walks along the corridor
back in the direction of william careys coughing
a hall filled with lawyers and ambassadors from both sides
arguably the grandest most significant divorce proceedings in history
anne watches from a distance as henry talks to cardinal wolsey
then henry turns
he walks towards anne
the queen has insisted a papal representative be present at the trial
but wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only
we have our verdict
then what troubles you
one or two friends have refused to lend their support
among them thomas more
a beat and then theres the small matter of my conscience
you have justice on your side
henry stares conflicted
anne strokes his head
but the look on her face tells us this is getting harder and harder
henry sits at breakfast
reading official correspondence
and private letters
e sorts through the various scrolls matters of state then finds one
a letter in a hand he does not recognise
a quizzical look
henry cracks the seal and begins to reads the letter
presently his expression changes
then his face darkens ominously
his knuckles whiten
sir thomas and the duke of norfolk storm down a corridor
their faces are grim
its a terrifying sight
crash the door flies open
sir thomas and norfolk burst in
anne is in the bath
she covers herself
the girl that married henry percy
it seems she has petitioned the king demanding a divorce from her husband on the grounds
he can hardly bring himself to say the words that his prior betrothal to you was actually
his knuckles whiten consummated
annes eyes widen in horror
i knew this would come back to haunt us
i must go to the king
he doesnt want to see you
or hear a word from your lips
hes far too angry
a beat it seems the only boleyn he will speak to the only person whos testimony he will trust in this matter
a beat is mary
a dagger in her heart
a cemetery in mid winter
william careys coffin is lowered into the ground
mary dressed in windows black steps forward take a shovel throws earth on the grave
mary walks back to comfort the children
the elderly priest continues with the service
mary bows her head
then she senses someones eyes are on her
she looks up and her expression changes
there is george
standing among the handful of mourners
staring at her
the entire boleyn family is assembled
sir thomas lady elizabeth the duke of norfolk george and at the centre of proceedings anne herself
the atmosphere is tense
presently the door opens and mary enters the room
in widows weeds
all eyes on her
and her children
a sharp intake of breath a ripple of shock at the state of them
in simple country clothes
n awkward silence
mary holds her childrens hands
were so sorry
clears throat about your husband
several maids are assembled fussing over mary
transforming her from penniless country widow to sophisticated courtier again
anne enters unseen by mary and ushers everyone out
she takes the brush from the departing servant and continues to brush marys hair
uch beautiful hair
earing annes voice mary freezes
thank you for coming
mary looks up
notices annes hands are shaking
i hate how this matter has come between us
i wanted to come to see you after your daughter was born and again when your husband died but
mary pulls away
raises her hand
anne stares at mary her lips trembling
im frightened mary
what have i done
mary turns away
avoids annes eyes
the king sits in his private apartment
he looks up as mary enters and curtseys deeply
seeing mary his dog enthusiastically greets her
lapping at her
mary looks at the king
she is overcome with emotion but finds the strength to hide it
mary walks closer
beckons into the light
mary walks closer
henry looks at her
the other boleyn girl
id forgotten how beautiful you were
mary looks at him
something has changed in him
a perceptible darkness around the eyes
ou asked to see me your grace
the boleyn family members are pacing outside
anne and sir thomas exchange looks
finally the door opens
mary emerges from the kings apartments
er entire family stares expectantly at her
anne steps forward barely able to conceal her anxiety
mary is putting the children to bed tucking young henry in
whats the matter
marys face visibly upset
her hands shaking
putting brave face on nothing
mary smiles tenderly kisses young henry
anne appears in the doorway
watches through a half open door
notes how loving mary is as a mother
mary gets to her feet
walks towards anne
mary closes the door behind her
anne stares at her then
with difficulty i am forever in your debt
you owe me nothing sister
i did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us
hen let it be exactly that
a new start between us
here at court
anne embraces mary who stiffens
but id rather go back to our home in the country
that damp old ruin
with no food
a beat why dont you let your family look after you
your children would have the best of everything here
they would grow up safe and secure
mary stares horrified
but before she can reply
the sound of a commotion from outside
the sound of trumpets
the unmistakable noise of arriving soldiers
veryone rushes to a window
looks down to see a small army
t the centre of everything an grand old bearded archbishop climbs down from an opulent carriage
the papal legate
sent by the pope to preside over the queens trial
mary looks first at anne then back out as the long procession dramatically enters the palace gates
so its true
its really happening
anne suddenly looks pale
yes it is
stay with me please
i need my sister by me side
a huge crowd is assembled
despite the intimidating presence of the kings guards the people shout vigorously in support of queen katherine
crying out her name
the queen arrives
ast cheers go up
were in a packed courtroom
the room is filled with the countrys highest ranking bishops
to one side anne and mary watch from behind a screen
mary hears the crowds cheering for the queen
screams of support and affection long live queen katherine our one true queen
mary looks anxious
the crowds are with her
the crowds have no vote
a beat and the bishops that do are in wolseys pocket
anne watches as katherine enters court
the queen sees anne and starts walking directly towards them
anne contd god shes coming towards us
queen katherine walks towards the screen reaches it then pushes it aside intimidatingly flanked by her lawyers
the boleyn whores
two former ladies of mine
hiding in shadows
a beat what did i do to upset you that you should turn against me like this
you failed to give england an heir
and that upsets you so
what upsets the king upsets me
queen katherine straightens
how dare you
calling out katherine queen of england come into court
katherines lawyers try to drag her away from anne but she wrenches herself free
ou want me to creep away and become a nun
well i shall not
you want me to lie before god and admit my first marriage was consummated
well it was not
you want me toueen katherine contd q retire and withdraw my daughters claim as sole rightful heir to the throne
well i shall not
not in a thousand years not if you rack me to within an inch of my life
beat i am katherine queen of england the kings one true wife and mother of the heir to the throne
beloved of the people and beloved of a king you have bewitched
katherine turns and enters the packed courtroom
she makes no reply to the crier instead walks over to where the king sits and falls onto her knees
mary looks at anne who is visibly shaking
and tries to compose herself
throughout the courtroom people exchange looks
katherine is completely disregarding the court campeggio and wolsey and appealing directly to her husband
my lord how have i offended you
for twenty years i have been a true obedient wife
i have loved all those whom you loved and given you children though it has pleased god to take them away
if there is any just cause that you can allege against me i will happily depart to my shame and dishonour but i tell you as god is my witness
there is none
enry sits in silence but can barely contain his rage
atherine contd so i beg you dear husband to spare me this humiliation
but if you will not and i am to be tried
defiant you are
then let it be in a proper court and by the only authority i recognise
his holiness himself
an audible gasp from the court
henry shoots a look at wolsey what
wolsey is horrified i know nothing of this
katherine gets to her feet and dramatically walks out of the court stopping only to pause by a window
the cheers from the loyal people who are waiting outside ring through the court
henry looks dark thunderous
he storms out of court
wolsey watches visibly shaken
since it has pleased the queen to absent herself from the court the trial will simply proceed without her
a lawyer gets to his feet
the trial begins
the entire boleyn family is assembled
anne paces up and down
mary is with her children
wolsey promised the king his verdict
instead he has humiliated him
but they are continuing with the trial
and the bishops will still find in the kings favour
but without the popes blessing the result will seem hollow
a frustrated gesture if only the king would take matters into his own hands
and do what
his only option would be to reject the catholic church
and his faith would never allow it
nor his good sense
breaking with rome would isolate england politically
leave us at the mercy of the protestants
but the alternative is leaving this country without an heir
failing in his duty as a king
and risking civil war
anne stops thinks
anne contd omehow i need to make him understand that it is a fair price for a legitimate heir
anne looks at mary
anne contd one he could hold in his arms
annes face an idea forming
anne contd a strong rosy cheeked boy
mary looks up
sees all eyes staring at her
becoming suspicious what
henry along with thomas cromwell and several of his lawyers are walking along a corridor
they turn a corner then stop
hes seen something
and the impact of it has made him stop in his tracks
in the gardens outside are anne and young henry playing
the kings face its as if all sound goes silent
he stares transfixed at the boy
he hears nothing except young henrys laughter
he sees nothing except young henrys golden locks
mary watches from a distance her heart cracking as henry dismisses cromwell and the lawyers and goes out to join anne and young henry
t seems to have a profound affect on him
henry walks towards anne
and bends so as not to frighten the boy
anne smiles maternally strokes the boys hair
my name is henry
is it now
a fine name
raises eyebrow and how old are you
reverse angle to see mary watching helplessly from inside the palace
tears are streaming down her face
lady elizabeth appears and puts her arm round marys shoulders in comfort
outside in the gardens young henry and his father continue to get to know one another
young henry contd is that sword real
i think so
would you like to see it
henry draws it and shows the boy whos eyes widen in excitement
now on guard
henry and young henry begin to play fight
as they do our camera slowly slowly pulls back to reveal
the scene is being watched by mary her nose pressed against a window in the palace as she continues to watch henry play with her son
from a window high up we notice queen katherine has appeared too
henry continues to play with the boy
its clearly a powerful emotional experience for him
gradually other faces appear at the palace windows
first sir thomass
finally back to
watching on tenterhooks
unsure how this will play out
a clap of thunder
a storm breaks
queen katherine screaming in protest surrounded by wailing ladies in waiting is dragged roughly away from court by a unit of armed guards
how dare you
struggling take your hands off me
the guards drag the queen away her heart breaking kicking and screaming continues
as she disappears
we reverse angle to reveal this is being watched shadows by the king himself
his face burning with guilt and self loathing
the door flies open
anne is reading alone
she looks up to see henry his eyes ablaze
now you will give yourself to me
anne looks up
i thought i had made myself clear
until we are married there is no questi
enough of your games
tearing at her dress i have torn apart this country for you gone against every principle in my heart ive endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced
them with the axe
just to be with you
henry tears her dress
he forces himself on top of her
now prove to me it was worth the sacrifice
he pushes her back against a table slamming her down and enters her roughly
anne cries out in pain
stop you are hurting me
that night anne is being groomed by mary
how was he with you
as a lover
a beat surprisingly so
a beat why
fearing the worst
over this we fade in the sound of bells ringing
a small ceremony
held in secret
the distant sound of crowds protesting
mary watches from the shadows as archbishop cranmer marries henry and a visibly pregnant anne
in latin we see sub titles do you henry tudor take anne boleyn as your lawful wedded wife
henrys face eyes burning with self loathing
their voices are almost drowned by the shouts of protest and dissent coming from the streets
musicians play in the corner struggling to drown out the sound of the protesters
a party is in progress
anne the bride is at the centre of proceedings visibly pregnant and finally queen
but it has brought her no peace
the cacophony from outside visibly troubles her
mary stands by her side
maid of honour
did you hear
on the way to the church
they were calling me a witch
all that will die down as soon as they get to know you
but what if it doesnt
what if they hate me forever
they will see how much the king loves you and follow
haunted hollow how much the king loves me
anne shoots an anxious look over at henry who is with cromwell in the corner lost in serious conversation
ister i wonder if youve given any thought
to the matter of my returning to the country
with the children
annes face her expression changes
i need you here more than ever
besides as the queens sister you cant live alone out there like some gypsy
we need to make you a proper match
earing this the passing william stafford freezes
what about the duke of suffolk
anne indicates an ugly fat courtier
all the ladies at court are mad for him
or lord fardingly
indicates an old courtier in his s marry him and youd own half scotland
william staffords face
mary is walking back to her apartments when william stafford runs after her appearing in the corridor behind her
stafford catches her up
i couldnt help overhearing
and before you agree to any of your sisters matches let me just say
stafford takes a deep breath
his heart racing
i have saved money
not a lot
ive my eye on a place in the west
near where i grew up
mary turns an incredulous look
surely this is a joke stafford
tafford blurts it out
i love you
ive said it
from the moment i joined your family
mary looks at him
a lightening flash of recognition
shes heard those words before and puts two and two together
it was you wasnt it
at the masked ball
i have watched how your family has treated you
if you came withfford cwould never sta me
i ontd betray you
or take you for granted
i would love you and cherish you to my dying day
but its impossible
you know that
now annes queen my family would never allow it
and you would care
what they think
after everything they have done to you
tafford stares incredulously
lost in thought
staffords words still ringing in her ears
she sits at the foot of annes bed
anne sits in bed
on the other side is george
god i look hideous
does it hurt
little nips and stabs
mary isnt listening
she is lost in thought
it its a boy
the unholy trinity will be mother uncle and aunt to the next king of england
but if it isnt
the king will take that as evidence of gods displeasure
and will turn further against me
hes already become so cold
anne touches her stomach anxiously
they say you can tell by the shape of the stomach
mary what do you say
boy or girl
anne tails off when she sees mary
whats the matter with her
mary looks up what
youve been like this for days
youre not in love are you
blushing certainly not
mary gestures dismissively
flustered in love
mary returns to her book flicking pages
but privately she is shocked
is it that obvious
a darkened room
anne screams out
she is in the middle of giving birth
with a bone chilling scream a head appears
and again one more
anne pushes again
mary holds her
anne howls in agony
her nails dig into the sheets
a last primal blood curdling roar of pain
its done your majesty
physicians and midwives swarm around the baby
anne despite having lost a great deal of blood tries to sit up
its a girl
mary takes the child from the midwife holds it for anne
a beautiful healthy girl
anne is overcome by maternal love but realises what this will mean
she stares at the baby
fear filling her eyes
mary watches from a distance as sir thomas and norfolk tell the king
henry staggers from the disappointment as if he had been delivered a blow
she has named her elizabeth
after your mother
is the child healthy
henry stares hollow eyed
well if we can have a healthy daughter we can have a healthy son
henry turns and without a word pushes past everyone and leaves
anne is left alone her heart breaking
mary stares at anne
a stab of compassion
not long ago the same thing happened to her
hoping to console anne mary hands her beautiful new baby over to her
anne takes the baby in her arms
filled with love for something that will almost certainly mean her destruction
her shoulders shake with tears
anne stands by a window staring out
her hands wringing with anxiety
mary is in another corner tending to baby elizabeth
who is it
mary leaves the baby goes over to the window
down below henry is walking with an attractive young lady
lady somerset i believe
yesterday it was the wife of the french ambassador
the day before with the countess of salisbury
a frustrated gesture how could he do that to me
anne stares at mary
now i know how it must have been for you
anne reaches for marys hand
their hands touch
then mary pulls away her hand still not quite ready to forgive
and goes to tend to the crying baby elizabeth
mary is with her children reading them a bedside story
from next door the sound of raised voices
the king and anne are having a furious row
but mary is not listening
you cant ignore me like this
i am your wife
why dont you just admit it
ecause its not true
i can smell the whore on you
get away from me
you disgust me
slap the sound of someone being struck
anne and mary are together
anne is combing her hair
strands of it come loose in her hands
her eyes are hollow with stress
her skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration
i struck him today
what am i doing
i am destroying this all on my own
anne looks left and right
makes sure no one is within earshot
goes to check outside her door then returns
i cant sleep at night
and without sleep i cannot think
nd its getting more and more difficult to arouse him
some nights he cannot do it
i have to resort to ever more disgusting
then he hates himself in the morning
hates me even more for what i made him do
anne eyes stare
she rocks back and forth
its slipping away mary
i can feel it
mary takes annes hand
envelops it in hers
the sound of ugly loveless sex
cries of pain
anne tries to keep the king aroused
demeaning cruel shaming loveless sex
henry repeatedly strikes her
in the neighbouring room the ugly sounds of anne and henrys sex come through the walls
mary covers her ears with a pillow blocking out the noise and escapes to the only safe world she knows
that of her dreams
sir thomas boleyn norfolk george boleyn and mary are watching intently as anne is being examined by several physicians
finally a physician straightens turns to face the family
the physicians face he nods
a magnificent winter party to celebrate annes pregnancy
the river thames is frozen over
its a lavish spectacle
jousting on ice skates bear baiting with dogs musicians skate dancing sledges and fire eaters and muscovite tumblers
the king threads his way through courtiers and entertainers
wherever he goes people stop their conversations bow in fear
anne visibly pregnant sits on a throne
she looks drawn frightened and tired
an unmistakable echo of queen katherine at the masked ball earlier
and so its come to this
our sister is with child and all englands fate is in the balance
eorge indicates anne
george contd if its a boy the king will have been vindicated in getting rid of his first wife and his authority will be unassailable
but if it isnt
or if god forbid she miscarries
eorge indicates henry whos face is also drawn dark malevolent suspicious
the king will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies
he will claim innocence
that he was corrupted
anne will swiftly be replaced as queen by someone more acceptable
a beat and we boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again
thats no bad thing
mary shudders to herself
holds her children protectively
anyone with any sense would have run away from this hell hole already
as far as they could go
ike the wise william stafford
you didnt know
sold up and went
left for the country
just like that
gone to live in some place called
under her breath tatton
where he grew up apparently
did you know he came from a better stable than all of us
his grandmother was a beaufort cousin to the king
and he never mentioned it
shrugs whod have guessed
eorge shrugs and skates off with francis weston
we pull back to reveal they are being watched by jane parker
who looks drained
worn out by the humiliation of her failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love
haaarrggh anne bolts awake in the middle of the night
her face is pale
she is covered in a thin film of perspiration
she flinches in pain
holding her stomach
immediately doors open and several servants and ladies appear
but anne composes herself
im fine thank you
visibly paranoid just a bad dream
reassured the servants fill annes glass with water
flinches as she speaks but fetch my brother and sister will you
the servant bows and goes
as soon as anne is left alone she slowly looks down and pulls back the bedsheets
hen anne sees what lies beneath she howls in horror
mary and george arrive breathlessly in annes room to find
anne is on the floor before the fire her arms wrapped around as if she were hugging herself
on the floor beside her is a bloodstained bundle of sheets
anne looks up through the trailing locks of her hair
i lost it
almost without pain
and so fast it was over in a moment
mary looks down at the bundle of sheets
heart cracks oh anne
mary hugs anne tightly
all animosity now gone
ou have to get rid of it
get rid of it somehow
no one must know
eorge rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a cape
he wraps it around anne
then he pours wine into a glass
mary wraps anne in a blanket to warm her
and begins making the bed with fresh linen
an hour later anne is composed
staring into the fire
mary and george sit on either side of her
its not the first
marys heart cracks
takes annes hand
they will take it as proof that i cannot bear children
that i am cursed by god
and should be dispensed with
theres still time
you could sleep with the king and fall pregnant again
no one would know
he king would never lie with me now and risk damaging the child he believes im carrying
a beat besides he is barely capable anymore
and i couldnt go through that again
anne stares at mary and george
no if i am to survive
i have to take matters into my own hands
mary and george exchange blank looks
i dont understand
i need a baby mary
rolling eyes must i spell it out
you mean lying with another man
but that would be treason
esides where would you find someone you could trust
obviously it would have to be someone close
anne stares meaningfully at her brother
stop it anne
dont you see
this affects all of us
if i go down so do all of you
the only way to save ourselves
is to do this
a beat and pray its a boy
mary covers her mouth in horror gets to her feet
i cant listen to this
feeling nauseous this is monstrous
mary sit down
i understand you have had a shock tonight
a terrible shock
but there is no need for this
mary reaches the door turns to george
george gets to his feet
george is staying
he understands this involves the whole family
george is staying
her heart cracking i pray for you both
mary leaves the room
tears stream down her cheeks
she runs down the corridor rushing towards her children
but as mary goes we reverse angle to reveal a figure sits in the shadows by annes door
someone who has heard everything that has been said
ts jane parker
who turns holding her head covering her ears unable to listen to any more
mary runs through the corridors in an agitated state
mary rushes into her room
she goes to the beds where her children are sleeping
mary gently shakes them awake
come on darling wake up
where are we going
away from here
far far away
anne and george stare at one another
anne pours a mug full of mulled wine
anne takes the first step and starts unbuttoning her brothers shirt
george quickly knocks back the glass of mulled wine
then gasps as anne puts her hands into his trousers
their eyes meet for an intense moment
mary and her children ride through the night
anne and george are making love
silent tears are streaming down georges cheeks visibly traumatised
anne tenderly wipes them away
mary and her children continue to ride through the night
they gallop silhouettes against the moon
the faster and further they get away from court the better
afterwards anne and george lie in silence
anne strokes her baby brothers hair
george rocks to and fro
staring at the fire
jane parker gets to her feet
numb with shock
she stares ahead
momentarily loses her footing
then disappears into the darkness
mary arrives in a market village
she asks directions
then kicks her horse
a simple farmhouse nestling in a valley
mary stands in front of the door protectively holding her children
a flicker of panic passes behind her eyes
what is she doing
who lives here mother
clears throat a friend
mary knocks again
still no answer
mary hesitates then tries the door
mary enters calls out hello
inside its warm inviting idyllic
the children go to the kitchen table
instantly feeling at home
mary calls out
mama im hungry
what should she do
the children eat hungrily
a clock ticks on the wall
mary puts catherine to sleep in a bed
young henry is already fast asleep in another bed
mary draws the curtains
hen closes the door
mary walks along a corridor
she looks in the bedroom
mens clothes in the wardrobe
no sign anywhere of a womans presence
mary turns then catches sight of herself in a mirror
her hair is bedraggled
her clothes are filthy
mary pours hot water into a bath
the room is thick with steam
she begins unbuttoning her dress
william stafford and several farm hands return from working in the fields
talking and laughing
they reach a crossroads go their separate ways
stafford rides on for a while
then stops when he sees a horse outside his house
stafford dismounts his horse
a quizzical look
then he walks towards the front door
stafford enters his house to see empty bowls of food on the table
hildrens boots by the door
and a womans riding cape
rom upstairs the sound of splashing
stafford expression changes
he slowly goes up the stairs
he sound of splashing gets louder
a womans voice
stafford pushes open the door
mary is in the bath
mary looks up
a beat i just didnt know where else to go
stafford walks in
mary gets up
no effort to cover herself
stafford sweeps her into his arms
time for that later
hey fall into a passionate embrace and sink to the floor
time has passed
winter has become spring
were in an idyllic country church
mary and william stafford are being married by a do you mary take william as your lawful wedded husband
a dance is in progress
fifty or so guests
mary is talking to a friend
in another corner she notices a messenger arrive
a former colleague from court
e talks to stafford
they talk gravely
staffords face is ashen
mary excuses herself from her friend crosses the room goes to what is it
news from court
tafford avoids marys eyes
fearing the worst she miscarried the child
anne is walking alone
her maids follow at a distance
presently she lets out a cry
her body doubles up in pain
her maids rush towards her
back at the dance
they say it was deformed
she is charged with incest and of summoning the devil
your brother too
he has already been sentenced
anne is in the tower awaiting trial
anne in a prison cell at the tower
mary face horrified
i must go
mary turns to walk out
stafford blocks her path
and do what
george is doomed
for anne its only a matter of time
i can petition the king
ou think he will listen
its his own neck hes saving by getting rid of them cant you see
but if you do you might as well kiss your children goodbye
you are annes sister
that alone makes you her accomplice and co conspirator
i have no choice
anne and george are my family
i cannot desert them
mary walks towards the door
and what of your new family
your henry and catherine have you
anne and george have no one
a beat im sorry
the sound of galloping hooves
mary rides hard towards london
anne is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches and filled with fifty or sixty of the countrys most powerful noblemen
anne walks to the centre of the room surveying her jurors noting that they have remained seated
it is a sad day for england when the nobles do not rise for their queen
and even sadder when that same queen is charged with adultery and incest
charged is different to convicted uncle
or is it not
in this court
the clearing of throats
then with much chair scraping the nobles reluctantly get to their feet
master cromwell read out the indictment
cromwell gets to his feet
the charge is that in the twenty eighth year of the reign of our sovereign henry king of england his wife the queen being seduced by the devil did knowingly
commit adultery high treason and offences against god
how do you plead
not guilty my lord
mary thunders across bridges through villages
urging on her horse
no thought of rest
anne faces the lords as she makes her case
my noble lords
the love i have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house nursed when sick played
games as children shared lifes celebrations
as anne delivers this speech our camera slowly pulls back back towards the door
that is the love i have for him
not what you suggest
our camera pulls out through the door
and into a corridor beyond where we find henry hunched in shadows eavesdropping his face cast in shadows
judge me my lords as you see fit
but never forget that your verdicts will be judged again by god in the greatest court of all
henrys face is a study of guilt
his knuckles whiten his nails dig into his hands
my lords the time has come to cast your vote
mary gallops through shallow streams spraying water
anne watches on as each lord takes it in turn to get to his feet and deliver his verdict
first cromwell then the seymours then henry percy
the verdicts rain down on anne guilty guilty guilty going round the courtroom until they reach the duke of norfolk
anne meets the eyes of her uncle
norfolk stares at anne
not a hint of compassion
in which case the burden falls on me to pass sentence
a terrified george boleyn is led to the scaffold
he is watched by francis weston
mary reaches the outskirts of london
gallops through villages
george boleyns eyes are covered with a cloth
he puts his head on the block
a priest says last rites as georges arms are held back
terrified his lips mouth prayers
the axe falls
a huge roar goes up
reverse angle to reveal this has been watched by sir thomas mary arrives in time to hear the roar from the crowds
she dismounts her horse exhausted from the journey he walks against a tide of crowds leaving
talking among themselves
marys expression changes
suddenly a shiver goes down her spine
mary feels sick
fearing the worst she goes up to a woman in the crowds
ho was it
henry walks through corridors arm in arm with jane seymour followed closely by the seymour brothers sir john seymour and the ever surviving duke of norfolk
henry turns a corner then stops in his tracks when he sees
mary waiting outside his privy chamber restrained by guards
seeing the king she curtseys deeply
the seymour brothers draw their swords but the kings dog runs excitedly towards her
henry gestures for the seymours to sheath their swords
h leave us
the seymours leave
the duke of norfolk hesitates
all of you
norfolk shoots mary a look then goes
henry turns and leads her into
his private room
where he took her before
the room to which only mary seems to have had access
falling into a deep curtsey as henry closes the door ensuring their privacy i understand my family has offended you
but having taken my brother today i beg you to spare my sister
i realise you must replace anne as queen
a beat but must she die too
she has been tried and found guilty
you could send her away
i am bound by the law
you could send her to a nunnery
no one would know
to a nunnery
henry almost manages a smile
there is precedent my lord
louis of france did it too
when his wife could not conceive
the french queen was a blameless woman
your sister a witch
i understand anne has offended you
i ask only that if there is any regret you might
for your part in the matter
mary treads delicately
realising the very suggestion is treason
does not unduly colour your thinking
killing anne will not make it go away
a beat it would only make it worse
enry stares at mary
how could i have made that mistake
suddenly his eyes are full of regret
henry contd choosing her over you
a long silence
i will reflect on the matter
mary falls on one knee
kisses his swollen bejewelled hand in gratitude
henry stares watching her as she goes
a team of carpenters erect gallows and scaffolding
hammers knock nails
a sickening metronome of death
otack tack tack
n the hill a blood stained chopping block is put into place
the doors to annes cell open
anne looks up
in the doorway is mary
mary stares at anne
annes appearance is shocking
she looks ten years older
haggard and lined by stress
anne puts on a brave face stares back at mary
the two sisters walk towards one another and embrace
tears run onto each others shoulders
how has it come to this
a lieutenant gives a nod
soldiers raise a barrier and allow the crowds that have been waiting to rush forward
he crowds swarm over the grassy hill
putting down coats
anxious to secure the best views
anne looks out through a narrow window
her intense fearful eyes flit and dart
theyre letting the crowds in
its all right
you will be spared
the king as good as gave me his word
the king saw you
anne manages a rueful smile
we all made a mess of that didnt we
we all underestimated little mary
anne looks at mary
i dont think he ever stopped loving you
thats not true
he never loved me in the same way
and deep down you know it
mary averts her eyes
you should have been queen
you even gave him a son
but instead all this has happened because
a beat because i couldnt bear to be the other boleyn girl
and now look
the sound of approaching footsteps
anne looks at mary suddenly frightened
the two sisters fall into an emotional embrace as the jailors keys turn in the lock
youll look after elizabeth
it will be all right
he couldnt ask for a better moth
breaks down composes herself mary hugs anne tight
e will spare you
i am sure of it
anne takes a deep breath
tries to look serene
a roar of the crowd
anne wearing a shawl of white ermine is violently jostled and spat at as shes marched across tower hill to the scaffold
she shoots mary an anxious look across the crowds
mary shoots a signal dont worry
anne climbs the steps and faces the crowds
finally the jeers subside
i come here to die
a loyal subject
more spit jeers and abuse
mary stands on tiptoe cranes her neck
anxiously scans the crowds for the guards that will free come on
i do not blame the king
never was there a more just or goodly lord
presently mary sees two soldiers pushing through the crowds towards her
her heart leaps
i beg gods forgiveness and his mercy
anne looks up to see the soldiers reaching mary and handing her a letter
anne smiles in relief
mary opens the letter and reads
thomas cromwell the former assistant to wolsey who has now replaced him sits at his desk writing the letter
the king has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son
mary continues to read the letter as anne is forced to kneel by the executioner
but you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again
you will not be shown the same clemency a second time
your sister anne was tried and found guilty her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die
mary who is reading looks up in horror
anne looks up
she sees the look on marys face
whoosh the masked executioner swings his sword
anne is beheaded
mary almost chokes
the crowd falls eerily silent
a stunned calm descends on tower green
nothing but the sound of the wind
mary sways then falls backwards having lost consciousness
she falls falls
but is caught by a strong pair of arms
william stafford who has followed her to london
suddenly the crowds burst into life
a great bloodthirsty roar echoes around tower green as annes head is lifted aloft
william stafford carries mary in his arms
they walk against the flow of teaming crowds and newly arriving families coming to watch the spectacle
sir thomas boleyn sits by a window
staring out at the fields beyond
were moving through a cornfield
the sound of childrens laughter
s in the opening scene three children a boy and two girls run through the fields playing
touchingly they are barely taller than the corn heads skimming along the sheaves
reverse angle to reveal the children are being watched from a distance by mary and william stafford standing outside hever castle
mary smiles shielding her eyes from the sun
caption marys son henry went on to become closest friend we close on young henry and annes unmistakable red headed daughter elizabeth
