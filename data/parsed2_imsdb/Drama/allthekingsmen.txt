and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one room slab sided schoolhouse
oh this hick knew what it was to be a hick all right
he figured if he was going to get anything done he had to do it himself
so he sat up nights and studied books
he studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some
for himself and for folks like him
sugar boy listens intently sharing in the anger in willies speech
no im not going to lie to you
he didnt start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them
no he started off thinking of number one
but something came to him on the way
how he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people
thats what came to him
and it also came to him with the powerful force of gods own lightning back in his home country when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics
it killed and mangled a dozen kids
but you know that story
the people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick
and some of the politicians down in the city they knew that
so they rode up to his house in a big fine shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor
jack electrified grips sadies arm
sadie hes wonderful
duffy fidgets as willie continues to pace and speak his face filled with conviction and with fury
so they told the hick
and he swallowed it
he looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how hed like to try and change things
he was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find hes got the stuff for the job
well those fellows in the striped pants
they saw the hick and they took him in
he points his finger at duffy who is coming over to speak to him

it could have nothing to do with my name being stanton
it could have
lets grant that
thats your answer
no its not
if that were the only answer i wouldnt be with him any more
theres another side of it
ive learned something from him
you cant make an omelet without cracking eggs
but at least a hospital will be built and the sick will be cared for
at what price
at any price
do you really believe that jack
i really believe that stark wants to do good
you do too
its a matter of method
many times out of evil comes good
well pain is an evil
as a doctor you should know that
pain is an evil it is not evil
it is not evil in itself
stark is evil
the people of the state dont think so
how would they know
the first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations
why be so afraid of criticism
if stark is interested in doing good he should also be interested in the truth
i dont see how you can separate the two
no stark is not for me
upset no stark is not for you
well what is for you
pride thats all it is
foolish stupid pride
all youve ever talked about is what you could do if
if somebody would tear down and build
all right all right somebody has and hes given it to you

no hes not for you

he slams the window shut and comes back into the room
the state capital is filled with rumors one of which is that stark is planning to seize power by force
as commander of the state militia he has jack turns it off
he goes over to his bed and starts putting clothes into a valise
there is a knock on the door
he ignores it
the doors open

she starts to cry
he grabs her pulling her face close to his
bitterly no i want to see you cry
he lets her go and she falls to the bed sobbing

he takes up his coat
a large billboard
it reads here on this site will be erected adam enters looks at the sign and walks on
exterior street near capitol building day crowds of people headed toward the building some with win with willie signs
a marching band plays music for them
exterior capitol building day crowd waiting outside the building
mounted policemen keep them in line
from a large platform loaded with people comes the chant we want willie we want willie
jack pushes his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing guard on the capitol steps
where do you think youre going

i didnt recognize you

jack turns and looks at the large crowd
a voice from a public address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd
all right now
that means everybody
lets let willie know were here
all together we the chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd
interior state legislature day the speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the chanting
we will first proceed to take the judgment of the senate on the question of the impeachment of the governor
speaker this is a farce to ask us to vote in the face of the kind of intimidation and pressure that has been exerted here in the past few weeks
even that crowd outside yelling on cue is part of that pressure
we want willie
we want willie
willie gets up and goes to the window
exterior state capitol day the crowd with jack in the foreground
the crowd suddenly goes wild as they see willie appear at the window
in the growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises his hands to wave to the crowd
we see various shots of people straining to get a little closer to the steps in order to see him better
willie then turns and goes back into the room
exterior state capitol day the crowd again still waiting
the camera pans upward to a loudspeaker
this is a special announcement from willie stark to you people out there
he doesnt want any one of you to leave
the camera moves over the faces of the people listening
he wants you to stay in front of this state capitol until the fight is over
if you want willie stark to win stay where you are
camera picks up jack watching the crowds reaction then up to a plaque over the entrance to the capitol building
it reads the peoples will is the law of this state do you hear me
stay where you are
dont go away
stay where you are
dont go away
exterior state capitol night newsmen photographers stand about bored
the crowd every bit as large is quiet but expectant
everyone holds still as the announcers voice is heard again
the balloting on the impeachment proceedings against governor stark has just ended
this is the result willie stark has won
the crowd explodes
people break through the police barriers
mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot
camera picks up anne in the crowd trying to push through
jack stands on the steps of the capitol watching it all
suddenly willie appears at the top of the steps followed by sugar boy
sadie duffy pillsbury follow close behind
willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd
they tried to ruin me
but they are ruined
they tried to ruin me because they did not like what i have done
do you like what i have done
loud applause and cries of yes
remember its not i who have won but you
your will is my strength and your need is my justice and i shall live in your right and your will
and if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will ill break him
ill break him with my bare hands
for i have the strength of many
having finished he waves at them all
then he notices jack and comes down the steps to greet him
hello jack boy im glad youre here
i knew youd come back
he walks back up the steps his arm around jacks shoulders
they start to go into the building that way when willie sees someone
he smiles and puts out his hand
oh doctor im very glad to see you
adam is seen waiting at the entrance of the building
before willie has taken a step adam fires several shots into him
willie falls to the ground and sugar boy whips out his pistol and fires at adam
three policemen with tommy guns open fire shooting into adams already fallen body
then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward willie forcing them back
stand back everybody
sugar boy kneels beside willie
sadie stands against a pillar looking down on him
nearly crying d does it hurt m much boss
d d does it hurt much
jack looks up to see anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to adam
she looks at adam for a moment then turns away
where are you going
she doesnt answer only walks away
he runs after her and catches hold of her arm
i dont know
leave me alone
to do what
i dont care
no thats too easy
i dont know i dont know i dont know
leave me alone please
no no more
my brothers dead
weve got to go on living
so that adams death has meaning so that it wasnt wasted
anne our life has to give his death meaning
dont you see that
look at those people
he turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at willie
look at them
they still believe in him
and weve got to make them see willie the way adam saw him or theres no meaning in anything
a policeman approaches
the governors asking for you
you better hurry
hes going fast
to anne will you wait here
will you wait here
she nods her head slowly
jack walks through the building to the pillar against which willie has been propped
sugar boy is still beside him
he stands behind sadie and duffy looking down at willie
it could have been the whole world willie stark
the whole world
why did he do it to me
his head droops to the side and he dies
