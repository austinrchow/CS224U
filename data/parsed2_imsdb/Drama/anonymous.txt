written by john orloff titles begin over the sounds of city traffic
the sidewalks are filled with theater goers heading for their shows
cabs line the streets
a cab quickly turns into the alley coming to a screeching halt
a man in a grey suit jumps out and rushes to the side entrance of a theater
in the background we see that the title of the play anonymous is written on the theatres marquee
we follow the man in the grey suit as he rushes through narrow backstage hallways passing several actors dressing in elizabethan costumes applying their make up etc
the curtains are still closed and the sound of the audience excitedly murmuring behind them is heard
stagehands are moving stage lights as takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the audience its a full house
he holds a prop umbrella in one hand anxiously checks his watch in the other
he looks on both wings of the stage and then relief floods his face as he sees the man in the grey suit hurrying over to him
the stage manager wordlessly hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in the background
the curtains start to open and the murmur of the audience dies down
the man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage a single light on him
he is prologue
we will see the same actor later as the prologue of henry v
prologue regards his audience for a beat before soul of the age
the applause delight the wonder of our stage
our shakespeare rise
beat repeating our shakespeare
for he is all of ours is he not
the most performed playwright of all time
the author of plays sonnets and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the english language
beat not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in shakespeares own hand
in four hundred years not one document be it poem play diary or even a simple letter
beat he was born the son of a glove maker and at some unknown time armed with but an elementary school education he went to london where the story goes
he became an actor and eventually a playwright
a stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a flat metal pate creating the sounds of thunder
another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a stage light back and forth to create lightning strikes
prologue opens his umbrella
he died at the age of and was survived by his wife and two daughters who were like shakespeares own father irrefutably illiterate
in the rafters a stagehand opens valves
it starts to his will famously left his second best bed to his widow
but it made no mention of a single book or manuscript
the actor who will play ben jonson mid s appears in the wings bearded ready to go on stage holding a prop leather manuscript
behind him a group of elizabethan soldiers strap on their swords
prologue continues as do titles
is it possible shakespeare owned no books at his death because
he could not read
that he wrote no letters because he like his father before him and his children after him could not write
lets that sink in then our shakespeare is a cypher a ghost his biography made not by history
but by conjecture
his story not written with facts but with
the rain has intensified
prologue turns and the camera starts to leave him and the titles end
more energetic so
let me offer you a different story
a darker story
of quills and swords
of power and betrayal
of a stage conquered and a throne lost
a flash of lightning and for a moment only sheets of rain are visible
no stage no prologue
then trough the rain we see a form of a man
then we make out the shapes of houses
were not on a stage anymore
we are pg
jonson carrying the manuscript runs up the street toward a large circular theater
he frantically opens the wooden door to the theater and he quickly bolts it behind him turns and desperately looks for a place to hide
he runs towards the stage as about a dozen uniformed guards reach the door
they are led by sir richard pole captain of the guard
break it down
and several of the guards charge the door with their pikes hitting it hard
jonson hurries backstage and disappears from our view just as the guards smash the door open
pole is the first in
the soldiers immediately spread out into different parts of the theater
because has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of props and costumes swords masks flags and banners
shields barrels canons etc
but jonson freezes when he sees pg
the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out pole amongst them
out with you
well smoke you out like a rat if we have to
a beat then to a soldier torch it
the soldier hesitates
all of you
the soldiers obey lighting fire to the walls the galleries the columns as gasps in horror
desperate he spies an open metal box nearby filled with un used fireworks
he tosses the fireworks out of the box and then places the bound manuscripts in their place then closes the box
then he grabs a nearby rapier as begin to take hold everywhere the columns at the front of the stage
the trompe loeil walls
the seating galleries
opens center stage and jonson jumps out the rapier in his right hand ready for a fight
but three soldiers jump onto the stage pikes ready
jonson no fool turns and runs for the other end of the stage but then runs smack into four other soldiers
jonson turns this way and that nowhere to run grins wryly drops his sword
raises his hands in surrender
jonson his hands tied behind him is pushed through the door pole following
a small crowd of actors whores etc
watch the theater burn
the guards have to push their way through them
the fire reaches the fireworks below the theaters stage and the sound of fireworks exploding makes jonson turn and see timbers crash and fireworks explode over the theater
a longboat carrying jonson pole and the guards makes its way towards the tower of london
jonson is thrown into a chair a guard on either side of him
its dark the only light coming from a few torches in the walls and a large fire pit at the far side of the room
an interrogator s faces him
dressed all in black he is wispy thin
you are benjamin jonson playwright
son of william jonson glass blower son of james jonson brick layer
and have you ever been arrested before mr
im a writer arent i
of course ive bloody well been pg
and a guard backhands jonson on the face full force hard enough to send jonson and the chair to the ground
his nose starts to bleed
as the guards pull him up the interrogator looks across the room there is someone else there a figure watching but cloaked in the darkness
jonson notices the figure as well
we hear a voice from the darkness
ask him about the plays
to the interrogator plays
to the figure which would you prefer my lord
an historical pastoral or an hysterical historical pastoral and smack
hes hit by the guards again
he spits out a tooth
we are not interested in your plays jonson
we are interested in the plays given to you by edward de vere earl of oxford
jonson stares at him a beat and then looks into the darkness
im sorry my lord but i am not sure i know whereof you speak
i have had the honor of meeting his lordship and smack laughing
not in this room somewhere else
before we really understand what we are seeing we are jonson blinks trying to stay conscious
his mouth is ripped bleeding
so is his nose
the skin has broken on his forehead
the interrogator leans into the bloody jonson
where are the plays
before jonson even has a chance to answer smack
we are and it is nine years earlier
the faces come from an audience watching a play
they find the performance hysterical
the rose towers above the nearby buildings bankside the part of london that houses the theaters whorehouses etc
the rose towers above the nearby buildings bankside the part of london that houses the theaters whorehouses etc
walk towards the theater
edward de vere the earl of oxford an intensely handsome man
his clothes have seen better days
his companion is henry wriothesley earl of southampton
blonde attractive a bit of a pretty boy and extremely enthusiastic
wonderful isnt it
frowning slightly well its certainly
i promise you edward youve seen nothing like it before
bricklayers and whores watching aristophones
youre quite right henry not only have i never witnessed it im not sure i care to
teasing youre an elitist you know that edward
oxford pauses at the entrance
there wont be puppets will there
southampton grins and gives a few coins to an usher who escorts the two of them the retainers stay outside inside
the usher takes them up a flight of stairs
oxford observes everything as they walk
the stage craft is quite spectacular
far more elaborate than anything ive seen at court
ive witnessed be headings that god as my witness look as real as at the tower cannons fired in battle
they come to the second floor where a selling maid has a box of food and drink in front of her bosom much like a match stick girl
mutton mi lord
southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up another flight of stairs
and last week they had some sort of a device to hoist cherubs into the air and fly over the entire audience
an apo mekhanes theos
deus ex machina
machine of the gods
and as they ascend up more stairs oxford catches glimpses of the stage and performance through the rafters and over the heads of the attending audience
whenever the greeks wrote their heroes into a situation from which they couldnt write their way out oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater almost despite himself
out came the apo mekhanes theos
as when hippolytus is saved by artemis or medea flown to athens
always good for an apo mekhanes theos was euripides oxford continues up two steps behind southampton
they come to the third floor and enter the box seating area reserved for nobles giving oxford his first real look at the theater itself
oxford looks around and sees audience members laughing others drinking maids selling food the actors acting
oxford takes it all in almost stunned by it
the actor william shakespeare plays a commoner
he is handsome sexy charismatic and holds a tankard of ale and swigs from it constantly
another actor spencer plays fastidious a pompous over dressed caricature of a nobleman
he wears an enormous feather on his hat
also on stage is an actor called john heminge late s who plays sogliardo and whither were you riding now signior
what a silly jests that
whither should i ride but to the court
o pardon me sir twenty places more your hot house your pig house or your whore house
the audience roars in laughter as shakespeare looks below at a buxom young lady among the groundlings
he smiles seductively
she smiles back
jonson now and clean shaven is watching the performance from behind a curtain silently speaking the lines with the actors
a group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an air of judgement
they are christopher kit marlowe young brilliant a bit foppish he likes the boys thomas nashe late s a heavy set a hard drinking satirist and thomas dekker considered a
bit of a hack by his colleagues
they are called the mermaids wits because they frequent a pub named the mermaids tavern
takes a swig of ale his second play and almost a full house
burps hes got a wit does jonson
that might be so but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find it and when you have it
its not worth the search
the others smile as a woman passes
marlowe spot me a few pence will you
henslowe still owes me for shoemakers holiday
retrieving coins that would be because no one saw shoemakers holiday
marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as kit
isnt that one of your unrequited loves in the box over there
marlowe glances across the theater and spots southampton siting next to oxford
frowns but with whom
tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as that
i think yes by the beard thats the earl of oxford
old tom hooker used to play for him
had his own acting troupe for private court performances and the like
i wonder if he needs any material
certainly not any of yours
no no that was years ago
had a falling out with the queen i heard
hes more of a recluse than a patron these days
shakespeare points to fastidious
who he the noble there
why hes a gull a fool no salt in him i the earth man he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub
shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place
the more he talks the more the audience roars in laughter
he sleeps with a musk cat every night and walks all day hangd in perfumed chains for penance
so thats what i been smelling
more groundlings laugh
interestingly in the box seats do not
shakespeare continues his rant speaking directly to the groundlings
he has his skin tannd in civet to make his complexion strong and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady
and sadly the poor mans brain is lighter than his feather
as the audience howls in laughter we see with a feathered hat gets up in fury and exits the theater his lady with him
the audience laughs at him as he goes
shakespeare smiles triumphantly
he is a good and empty puff but he loves you well signior
i wish you well with him
watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass by
later in the play
shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard
hes actually drunk though his performance didnt show it at all
he spots jonson and grabs him
i hope your next will
shakespeare turns to see a furious philip henslowe s heading his way
thats not ale in that goblet is it
shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back
drink during a performance
i am a professional sir
burps a complete and he is interrupted by screams
not from actors on stage but by the audience
complete panic erupts as dozens of the queens guard storm into the theater
everyone tries to get out as quickly as possible including the other actors henry condell s thomas pope s william sly
jumps on stage
this play has been declared seditious and illegal by lord william cecil
the audience begins to boo at the mention of cecil
all are herewith ordered to disperse immediately
why dont you disperse william cecils arse
arrest that man
damn it all
off to essexs then
he gets up
oxford does not seemingly interested in the real drama below as everyone hurries from the theater
oxford turns to him distracted and nods
jonson pushes his way on stage
to pole seditious
its a comedy for gods sake
theres nothing seditious about oi is that right is it
and you know this because
because i wrote the bloody thing
and arrest him as well
jonson is grabbed by guards
jonson is thrown into the cell the door slammed behind him
to the door a pox on you
beat and your carbuncled father
jonson looks around the cell is filled with a dozen or so other prisoners
people taxed to the point of starvation spain running the new world open revolt in ireland catholic plots everywhere you turn
robert earl of essex is playing tennis against southampton
hes handsome red headed and we will learn very ambitious
and how do the cecils spend their time and energy
shutting a theater
a theater for gods sake
no wonder the mob hates them so
the court is inside and slightly different from todays game the back walls are playable somewhat like racquet ball
oxford sits on a bench watching
essex slams a shot but it goes out
essex looks furious but holds his tongue
southampton prepares to serve
to southampton henry how many people were at that play
southampton pauses before serving
im not sure two thousand maybe more
essex returns and another heated rally begins
and how many performances are there of a play like that
five or six i suppose
he hits the ball again and this time essex misses it
to essex so
ten thousand souls
all listening to the writings of one man the ideas of one man
thats power robert
and if there is one thing the cecils understand its power
snorts and when did words ever win a kingdom
i think ill keep my sword thank you very much
southampton serves as oxford smiles at essexs naivete
southampton and essex are dressing out of their tennis clothes and into their normal clothes assisted by two valets
to the valets leave us
they exit henry
some of my men have
some of william cecils recent correspondence with king james of scotland
southampton pauses in clothing himself
this is serious
cecils all but promising him the throne
elizabeth would never agree to elizabeth is old
not of her old mind
sometimes she doesnt even recognize me
and yet still she refuses to name an heir
but a scotsman
on the tudor throne
you are not in the privy council
elizabeth does everything the cecils wish of her
they dont notice though
he instantly realizes he shouldnt say anything
he listens as think henry if james owes cecil his throne cecil will have more influence in the next reign than he does in this one
and after william cecil his hunch backed son will take his place
careful that is why we must do everything in our power to ensure that the right man succeeds her
beat a man deserving of the tudor crown
southampton stiffens at that last phrase
i ask you for the support of you and your men henry
if it comes to a fight
southampton looks at essex hard
you know you need not ask
i stand with you as i always have
essex smiles at him warmly
they both hear something shuffle behind them
they turn and see nothing
he is gone
they exchange a slightly worried look
moments later oxford and southampton are exiting the elaborate building that serves as essexs london residence
essex played rather poorly didnt he
southampton just nods distracted
oxford reaches out to him and touches his shoulder
the cecils brook no rivals
southampton pauses confused for an instant then re his discussion with essex you heard
always concerned for me arent you edward
they keep walking towards southamptons men
and what would you have me do
i would have you deny him
the son of the queen
that is rumor only henry they stop
southampton makes sure that his men are out of earshot
my god all you have to do is look at essex to see the queens reflection
everyone thinks hes her son everyone
and i for one would rather bow to a tudor bastard though he may be than a scotsman
i desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king
but what essex contemplates will surely lead to civil war
if this is to be done it must be done carefully skillfully
as i heard it elizabeth exiled you from her presence for the last twenty years because of your skill at court politics
and then he feels instantly ashamed of having said that
i only have your interests in mind henry
for as you so rightly point out my interests are already lost
you know how i feel about you
you have been a great friend to me ever since my father died
i promise you that i will do nothing rash without consulting you first
oxford nods still worried and southampton heads for his horse
will you do me one thing more
deliver a gift for me
the stone house is nothing like a stereotypical tudor house its enormous and very ornate and intricate in design
it faces the river and has an elaborate docking area which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting the noblemen off for a week end get away
most of englands nobility is assembled in small groups talking
its a dour quiet affair
some music no life
southampton is there but essex and oxford are nowhere to be seen
makes his way through the room causing conversations to cease as he walks by
even the most senior of the nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him
this is sir robert cecil mid s
he pauses near southampton
my lord of southampton
looking around have you seen essex
i believe he is still in the viewing chamber with her majesty
sharp annoyed alone
smiles with your father in london dealing with all the troubles in ireland who else should the queen turn to but essex
robert cecil looks annoyed but holds his tongue as the sound of pikes hitting the floor silences the hall
a footman clears his throat and by the grace of god her majesty elizabeth queen of england wales and ireland
open and elizabeth in her s enters
she is wearing a large sparkling pearl encrusted dress with a wide collar
she walks slowly and carefully and has a slight tremor in her head and hands
she seems un certain like shes not sure she recognizes all the faces around her alzheimers
and she compensates for it by being all the more regal all the more un human
essex is on her arm dressed in a splendid jewel encrusted doublet
robert cecil frowns at the sight of essex on her arm
essex ignores cecils glare notices southampton to elizabeth ah majesty ive been told my lord of southampton has a gift for you
eyes sparkle a gift
yes your grace though not from me
southampton claps his hands and a door across the room a dwarf enters followed by dancing faires actors swirling sparklers and musicians playing music
elizabeths rheumy eyes widen in complete delight a smile of total jubilation crosses her face
robert cecil on the other hand looks horrified
are you this gift my precious little man
no no my most majestic majesty
i am a free man
my gift is a play majesty
the dwarf bows his assent
to the dwarf plays are the work of the devil born from a cesspool of plague whoredom thievery fornication and heresy
you may tell your master that her majesty interrupting will gladly accept your gift
robert cecil turns to essex shocked
to elizabeth of course that is if you so desire majesty
to robert cecil the choice is her majestys to make not yours
is that not so sir robert
robert frowns as elizabeth looks around unsure of the political tides around her
then to the dwarf comedy
delighted a comedy
beat by whom
anonymous your majesty
then oh but i do so admire his verse
elizabeth lets go of essex and offers her hand to the dwarf who smiles brightly
lead us to this gift
and the dwarf leads elizabeth towards the door
essex follows and southampton locks into step next to him
they exchange a knowing look as robert cecil steps in line far after the queen not happy with this turn of events as we hear bless thee bottom
thou art translated
candles everywhere in stakes in the ground in the trees
they light a make shift stage surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides
i see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could
but i will not stir from this place do what they can
chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the grass
elizabeth is watching center front row of course
she loves it squealing in delight like a young woman
essex is next to her
several actors are mid scene in a midsummer nights dream act scene their make up quite elaborate and fantastical bottom who is costumed as a man except that he has
a donkeys head quince a commoner puck played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid and titania queen of the fairies who is presently asleep in a bed of fur
puck hides behind a tree watching
i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid
oxford watches from behind a curtain carefully observing the queens reaction
somehow we feel that seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep emotion in him
sings the ousel cock so black of hue with orange tawny bill the throstle with his note so true the wren with little quill titania awakens in her nest like
bed of fur
what angel wakes me from my flowry bed
strongly reacts to titania awakening
it stirs some memory in her
a pleasant memory
watches delighted by her reaction
we see elizabeth watching
but it is an elizabeth only years old referred to as young elizabeth in this script
we hear the sound of other dialogue but from the same play
we are pg
thirty eight years earlier
and young elizabeth watches an earlier slightly less sophisticated staging of a midsummer nights dream the costumes and sets are a bit more thrown together
all the actors are children from years old or so
a boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw oxford
this is boy oxford now only years old
but he is made up and wears a winged costume for the character of puck
and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest
trip away make no stay meet me all by break of day
and the characters of oberon and titania exit
boy oxford hurries if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumberd here while these visions did appear
next to young elizabeth john de vere oxfords father also watches his face beaming with pride
and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend
is watching a few seats away from young elizabeth
he is william cecil s roberts father
he is a puritan dressed all in black with a white lace collar and has a long beard
he is frowning loathing the play
so good night unto you all
give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends
the play now over young elizabeth applauds with delight as do the small group of courtiers all around her
a make shift back stage where all the young actors are removing their costumes and make up including boy oxford who sits in front of a make shift leaning mirror
much excited talking and commotion until boy oxford notices everyone has gone silent
he turns his winged costume still on just as ah
there he is
young elizabeth and her senior court including william cecil and john de vere have entered
boy oxford bows deeply
to boy oxford your father tells me you wrote this evenings play yourself
boy oxford glances at his father should he answer directly
his father nods
i did indeed your majesty
you sport with me
smiling compose something
on what subject your grace
then smiles truth
thinks then for
never so old
and time cannot make that false which once was true
she smiles claps
to john de vere my lord of oxford
it seems you have added a poet to your familys long line of warriors
madam i am as accomplished with the sword and the musket as i am with verse
amused are you indeed
nods seriously it is my only desire to one day be your majestys most trusted servant in matters both of war and state if you will but have me
charmed why lord cecil it seems we may very well have found your replacement
we hope not too soon majesty we hope not too soon
teasing and how liked you our young lords play william
william cecil stiffens in discomfort
to boy oxford conspiratorially our lord cecil is our most religious of subjects and no doubt thinks your little masque will deliver your soul straight into the arms of lucifer
dont you william
the boy oxford looks at william cecil perplexed by such a thing
that is gods decision your majesty
william cecil looks directly at john de vere resulting in an uncomfortable silence
well if plays are indeed such a sin i pray i do not find my salvation until very late in life
boy oxford smiles
he might very well be in love
thirty eight years later
the door sweeps open and a snoring sleeping jonson is awakened by jonson
the other prisoners make way as the guard approaches jonson
the guard tosses a wax sealed piece of parchment onto jonsons lap
youve been released
jonson looks at it confused
got powerful friends now dont you
jonson is in a noblemans longboat for the first time in his life
across from him sits francesco italian s wearing a doublet with the oxford coat of arms on its chest
the city of london is far in the distance
jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat for a moment before and who are you
francesco just stares back
and where are we going
francesco is silent
the boat approaches a large stone house oxford stone
as it is cut from its bush by ink stained hands
we are oxford smells the rose inhaling its essence
then he turns and sees francesco escorting ben jonson towards him
before they reach him he glances at his wife anne de vere s who sits in the distance knitting with one of their daughters bridget
jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand place
jonson clears his throat
the tudor rose
the most beautiful of flowers dont you think
it looks to me to have quite a number of thorns my lord
so it does
so it does
i am told my lord that i owe my freedom to you
that is true
and it was quite hard to come by
one does not cross my father in law lightly
jonson doesnt know who he is talking about
lord william cecil
i have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter
oxford looks over to his wife who watches them suspiciously
he begins to walk away forcing jonson and francesco to follow
it did however serve as helpful when i wrote to your jailers to release you in my father in laws name
jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back to anne
in a panicked whisper my lord im sorry does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned
dont be an idiot jonson of course it wasnt
beat but you are free are you not
they have come to an entrance to a garden maze and anne watches them as they disappear into the maze
oxford turns to jonson
i enjoyed your little comedy last week jonson
you have potential great potential
thank you my lord
but its politics did seem to have quite an effect on the tower
my father in laws men felt it quite seditious
my play had nothing to do with politics
it was just a simple comedy that showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth were it not for the
cleverness of their servants
beat all art is political jonson
otherwise it would just be decoration
and all artists have something to say otherwise
theyd make shoes
and youre not a cobbler are you jonson
as they enter the center of the maze oxford turns to his servant
francesco steps forward and hands jonson a leather bound manuscript
jonson looks at it confused and opens it
a play my lord
one you shall stage bankside
under your name
my name my lord
i cant very well use my name can i
im the seventeenth earl of oxford
the lord great chamberlain of england viscount bolebec lord escales sandford and badlesmere etc etc
i have a
reputation to protect
in my world one does not write plays jonson
people like you do
jonson tries not to be offended
you wrote an entire play my lord
i know how difficult not a play jonson ive written many
no doubt many more than you yourself
a good number performed at court years ago others never seen by a living soul
and you want
me to apply my name to this play
i mean you to put your name to all of them
all of them
well dont look like i just gutted your pet dog jonson
i mean to make you the most popular and therefore the most monetarily successful playwright in all of london
this is a disaster for him
i wish you god speed and good morrow
jonson looks down at the manuscript reads a few lines
my lord i really he looks up but oxford is gone having left the maze without so much as a good bye
but before he can follow francesco tosses a leather pouch of coins at his feet
that is for your trouble signor jonson
and your silence
if i hear you break that silence then
not so good for signor jonson
and francesco follows after his master as jonson picks up the pouch examining its contents
and then jonson realizes he doesnt know how to get out of the maze
he chases after them
i and hes lost
he looks this way and that then picks a path the wrong one
robert cecil is standing at the opulent river entrance to cecil house waiting for an enormous barge docking
william cecil now is at the front of the barge waiting to disembark
he constantly holds an ornately carved white cane
i am gone for three days and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the earl of essex
robert cecil looks at him sharply
how did he know
dont think because i was in london i didnt know exactly what went on here in my absence
he is an earl father
i cannot deny him of course not
you dont deny him anything
you find excuses
she is unwell she is reading she is seeing the ambassador from russia
for gods sake use your imagination robert
whatever will you do when i am gone
beat we will have to deal with essex soon
his ambitions are becoming a nuisance
william cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to his son
now tell me about the play
robert cecil looks surprised for an instant that he knows about that as well
it it was an anonymous gift
essex insisted it be performed just to spite me in front of court
of course he did
concerned but what was it about
some nonsense about fairies and cherubs
and dancing asses
robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped suddenly
realizing to himself edward
to robert cecil have you any idea what you have no how could you
and he starts back up the stairs
it was just a play
and do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence
she adores them
and edward knows it
beat mark my words robert he has done this for a purpose
thinking to himself what purpose indeed
to robert but through your carelessness i must now deal not only with essex but edward as well
for whether in shadow or in person edward has returned to court
and with that he slams the door shut
robert cecil walks over to a nearby window
visibly upset he starts to stare out of the window and remembers
we see servants carrying big trunks
there are at least men on horses
they all wear the oxfords crest
and it is thirty years earlier
boy robert cecil now is staring out of the window
his back must have been deformed either in utero or at birth because even now he is hunchbacked
more commanding robert
finally boy robert cecil turns and sees young oxford now entering the hallway with william cecil and his wife and daughter young anne
in front of them lined up are several men whom we will learn are boy robert cecil doesnt move
to young oxford i am sorry my lord
but my son robert prefers the company
boy robert cecil watches as his father turns to his mother and sister
may i present my wife lady cecil and my daughter anne
young anne curtsies
i am sorry for your loss my lord
the realm lost a great lord with your fathers death
we hope you will be happy in our house are you going to live here forever
everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has finally come over
only until i reach my maturity
because the queen has bade it so
to young oxford my lord when we first met you said you wished to become a great man of state
both the queen and i hope to make that so
to that end i have the honor of introducing you to your tutors
indicates one of them seven to eight you shall be tutored in french by mister crane monsieur
ca me fait plaisir de vous connaitre
master crane bows his head
nine to ten is greek with mister simmons
in greek dalon an dego hoti mathamata ge esti ha trafo psychas
is that homer
boy robert frowns at the correction
slight frown then and you know your uncle mister golding who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient latin texts into english
in latin continetne ut spero ovidii metamorphose
mihi honori erit patrue mister golding bows his head in appreciation
then cosmography with doctor richards
two to three is geography and history and four to five fencing
william cecil seems to have finished
to william cecil and composition
this is a puritan home your grace
we believe such activities to be the worship of false idols and therefore a sin before the eyes of god
but surely there must be room for beauty and art in life my lord
not in this household
young oxford is fencing with a tutor
hes quite good
in fact hes better than the tutor who is twice his age
boy robert cecil casually watches as he plays chess against himself
young oxford with a fierce beautifully executed attack disarms his tutor
the tutors sword flies into the air and hits making the pieces scatter
boy robert cecil looks up his face furious to see young oxford coming over to him
you were losing anyway
i was also winning
young oxford picks up the sword throws it to his tutor who catches it
you know i am going to one day succeed my father at the queens side
young oxford motions to go then picks up the black king and tosses it to boy robert cecil who cant catch it because of his deformity
it clangs on the floor
moments later the young oxford heads down the hall alone heading for his rooms his sword still in his hand
neatly written on parchment
we are and a servant is looking at the poems then quickly stuffing them into a bag
but then he hears footsteps coming
panicked he looks for someplace to hide a tapestry half covers a door he runs to it the door is locked
so he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens and young oxford enters
after a few steps young oxford senses something amiss
looks at his where the parchments are scattered
goes to his desk picks up one of the pieces of parchment
it has poetry on it
he goes through some other pages
and realizes other pages are missing
he becomes infuriated
he sees two feet
young oxford charges the tapestry sword in hand
he thrusts the sword through the tapestry
the man screams in agony as he falls
he doesnt just die but screams and screams and screams
young oxford steps back half in horror
half in triumph
the sound of applause takes us to thirty three years later
shakespeare is on stage taking a bow
the audience is applauding and screaming their approval of a performance that has just ended
he steps backwards where jonson stands holding the manuscript oxford gave him
is it any good
how in blazes should i know
you havent even read it
and shakespeare is drawn back where he bows again then steps so jonson can answer him
i read a line or two i promised henslowe id finish eastward ho by saturday
and you say hes a nobleman
jonson doesnt answer
jonson still doesnt answer which is answer enough
ohhhh you have to do it then dont you
and shakespeare goes back on stage
jonson and shakespeare are walking along bankside still mid conversation
they pass all sorts of vendors selling fish fresh water food etc
i tell you will i came to london to become a great poet to to be the conscience of our times the soul of our age
to change the world not to become someone elses amused change the world
yes why not
why cant a man change the world with words
shakespeare laughs at him
mimicking oxford i can make you the most popular and the richest playwright in all of london
takes a swig ballocks
i can do that myself thank you very much
shakespeare is perusing the manuscript
some of the actors from the rose are in the bg
you know its actually not half bad
jonson takes a swig of ale then not half
youre an actor what in gods name do you know about writing
hes an amateur will a complete and utter amateur
last week gardening this week playwrighting next week hawking
takes another swig no
i wont do it
it would be an affront against the muses
smiles well we musnt offend the muses whatever we do
thinks then how much money did you say he gave you
what you think my name can be bought if the numbers great enough do you
shakespeare smiles enigmatically
no not at all
i think we should keep your good name quite intact thank you very much
jonson frowns confused as we as it is placed on the head of elizabeth
we are elizabeth is behind an elaborately painted screen
several ladies in waiting attend her helping her get ready for the day
its an intricate process
make up multiple articles of clothing jewelry
king philip of spain sees the current catholic revolt in ireland as a weakness of ours
a weakness to be exploited
elizabeths wig is being glued into place
william cecil hasnt realized that his son robert has sneaked in the room behind him to listen in
there are rumors of his sending financial aid and even troops
we must act quickly
beat we must replace the lord lieutenant of ireland and send additional troops immediately majesty
william cecil hesitates slightly then i would recommend the earl of essex your majesty
frowns for how long
as long as the present crisis warrants majesty
he cannot be spared
we feel his counsel is of greater import with each passing day
not what william cecil wanted to hear
i only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed majesty
beat a last ditch effort philip of spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you
of burning you at the stake as a heretic
give him a foot hold in ireland and but essex
essexs martial abilities are in my opinion the only antidote to the plague of philip
clears his throat though essex would not unfortunately be able to remain in the privy council if he is in ireland
and who would you advise to replace him
three ladies in waiting approach with three different gown
elizabeth studies them as sir robert cecil
he is my own advisor first my son second majesty
his counsel has been invaluable to me and no doubt will be to you as well
elizabeth points to one of the dresses and waves the handmaidens away
yes yes yes
we will send essex to ireland and place robert on my privy council
but williams flash of victory is dampened by i saw a play this last weekend william
it made me think of
days long past
i should like to see more of them
has edward been happy william
with your daughter
william cecil doesnt answer
instead he thinks remembers as we hear his younger voice
thirty years earlier
william cecil is standing in front of an enormous fireplace pacing in a pique of anger
by your own hand
he was stealing my poems
he was doing my bidding
as soon as robert informed me that you were disobeying my express robert
robert told william cecil slams his fists on a table
thou shalt not worship false idols in my household
your everlasting soul hangs in the balance
my poems are my soul
william cecil turns away in frustration as much as disgust
you have placed me in a grave position edward
i cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part
i will not have it
we can claim self defense he drew sword first
i wish something in return
young oxford looks worried
my daughter is young impressionable
she has feelings for you edward
it is to be expected living in such close quarters
for the last three years you have managed to seize much of my inheritance hold your tongue edward before you make a claim you cannot retract
i have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses
and now you suggest you be reimbursed the rest of my once considerable estates through your daughters bed
william cecil studies young oxfords face
this is how i suggest you keep your noble head from the executioners block
stares at him
the sound of church bells ringing takes us to and young oxford and anne are being married by a bishop
and in the fear of god duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained
one was the procreation of children
he looks beaming over to
to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the lord and praise of god
secondly it was ordained for a remedy against sin
who presides over the whole affair
the first time we see a dress on her which makes her truly regal
thirdly for the mutual society help and comfort that the one ought to have of the other both in prosperity and adversity into the which holiest state these two persons
present come now to be joined
young anne looks at her young husband lovingly
young oxford is a bit overwhelmed and unsure of it all
and then we hear a trumpet blaring which takes us to thirty two years later
vendors hawk food and drink as they walk through the audience
oxford sits francesco behind him exhilarated by the scene below him
marlowe dekker and nashe are looking at their single sheet programs
henry v by
and why would any of you admit to trying to better me in a historical drama
comedy yes tragedy perhaps
but never will one of you best me in historicals
marlowe takes a swig of ale and spots jonson coming to join them
or will we be seeing a most hysterical historical
jonson sits next to marlowe
waiting to see how its received before you lay claim
before jonson can answer an actor condell s dressed all in white even his face is painted white enters stage
he is prologue
he addresses the audience directly
oh for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention
a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
then should warlike harry like himself assume the port of mars and at his heels should famine sword and fire crouch for his employment
can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france
jonson seems surprised
this is not what he expected
this is good
as they pound on cobblestone
we are pg
and southampton is riding his horse at full gallop through the countryside
about two dozen retainers follow the first few with southamptons coat of arms on flags
it is later in the play
on stage about actors are in full battle armor
they include henry v played by the actor called spencer westmoreland exeter salisbury
all the men on stage now wear battle armor
this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a tip toe when this day is named and rouse him
at the name of crispian
marlowe dekker nashe and jonson all watch obviously impressed
nashe takes a swig of ale
oxford watches loving the stagecraft involved in the production
he that shall see this day and live told age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say to morrow is saint crispian
henry v speaks to his men
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
the actor playing henry kneels at the front of the stage
he speaks to the groundlings as though they are his troops
and say these wounds i had on crispins day
old men forget yet all shall be forgot but hell remember with advantages what feats he did that day
this story shall the good man teach his son
become literally spellbound
and crispin crispian shall neer go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered we few we happy few we band
of brothers for he to day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he neer so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now a bed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their man hoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispins day
the entire audience stands and cheers madly
watches with a pride he has never felt
the wits look at each other amazed
my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
the french are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us
all things are ready if our minds be so
perish the man whose mind is backward now
you know your places god be with you all
which is a round tower on top of the stage contains several small cannons manned by stagehands
they shoot southampton and his retainers gallop through a city gate
above the gate the severed heads of murderers sit on pikes
actors portraying french soldiers storm the stage swords brandished
henry and his men begin fighting them their swordplay elaborate and impressive
southampton and his entourage gallop over london bridge
the battle rages on stage
one hardy audience member starts to actually attack one of the french soldiers himself
hes quickly joined by a few comrades and it quickly becomes a madhouse half play half real fight as more audience members join the battle
the play quickly degenerates into a bloody brawl between actors and audience
southampton arrives at the theater
he jumps off his horse and hurries jumping two steps at a time
we hear the sound of applause
the play is now over
southampton hurries into pg
he sees oxford who is applauding
all the actors of the play are taking their bows
william cecils convinced the queen that only essex can save ireland from the revolt
oxford processes this
ive pledged to go with him edward
we sail in an hour
henry i ask for your blessing edward
i cant give it to you
i for one wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours
marlowe and others join in
and shakespeare standing next to a small table of props quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them stained
he grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a piece of parchment under his arm then hurries where he bows deeply loving the adulation
if he is to be my king then it is my sacred duty to be with him in battle
oxford tries to understand southampton but then notices shakespeare on stage
his mouth opens in shock and he turns to look across the theater at who guiltily looks away
marlowes mouth is open his hands stop applauding
southampton is angered by oxfords distraction
i am sorry to have disturbed your entertainment
and he exits
but the younger man is gone
shakespeare bows then i i
i i want to
thank my actors whose great acting brought
to life due to their most finest acting
the multi arched ceiling is painted blue with gold stars
globes both terrestrial and astral abound
jonson stands in front of a very angry oxford
an actor for gods sake
my lord i thought that pg
you presumed to think
on my behalf
whatever made you believe you had that prerogative
jonson is a bit afraid
my lord your voice is completely different than mine
my my my characters are voice
you have no voice
thats why i chose you
beat softer you at least kept my name from him
and will continue to do so
oxford studies him believes him
then he opens a cabinet
in it manuscript after manuscript are stacked
jonson looks behind him stunned by the number
oxford looks up and down the cabinet
he pulls one out decides no and puts it back looking for just the right one
he pulls another out then hands it to jonson
a romantic tragedy
in iambic pentameter
amazed all my lord
is that possible
of course it is
jonson exits oxfords study still amazed at the manuscript as he walks
he passes anne oxfords wife now s who is on her way to the study with their eldest daughter bridget
she watches him go by and immediately realizes that she has seen him before
but she stays silent
oxford is writing at a desk as anne enters
who was that man
ive seen him before
oxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking while he finishes writing a thought
its a long thought
anne is obviously annoyed and interrupts him
edward we must discuss our bridgets dowry
looking up confused dowry
he remembers when he spies his daughter
she cannot go into marriage without a dowry that is becoming to the daughter of the earl oxford
i can give her brooke house and a hundred pounds
a hundred pounds
that is all we have to give at the moment
the matter over oxford goes back to his writing
speak to me
our family is in financial ruins and and you you play the flute while rome burns
nero fiddled whilst rome burned
and then he goes back to writing
for gods sake who cares edward
when your own daughter cant even have a suitable dowry
she stares at him
my god youre writing again arent you
after you agreed after my father expressly forbade it
oxford turns to her full of emotion anne if you could have seen them the mob
they they didnt just sit there like the reptilia of court faces motionless fangs momentarily retracted
they they jumped on stage they fought the french
a butcher he actually broke his arm
he was so stop
stop it at once
anne storms over and grabs the parchment from under him and begins ripping it up
why must you write
why must you continue to humiliate this family
he stares at her almost uncomprehendingly
then the voices anne
i i cant stop them
they they come when i sleep when i wake when i sup when i i i walk down a hall
the sweet longings of a maiden the the surging ambitions of a courtier the foul designs of a murderer the wretched pleas of his victims
only only when i put their words their voices to parchment are they cast loose freed
only then is my mind
anne steps back frightened of him
would go mad if i didnt write down the voices
she stares at him horrified
art thou possessed
he stares back at her
a long beat i
two households both alike in dignity in fair verona where we lay our scene shakespeare and jonson are walking along london bridge the only bridge that spanned the thames at
the time it is a street lined with multi storied buildings almost like a mall
shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of romeo and juliet from ancient grudge break to new mutiny where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
no longer reading incredible
the whole bloody thing in verse
nonchalant its really not that difficult if you try
and have you ever tried
jonson gives him a sharp look and pauses to pick some onions from a stand
shakespeare notices a buxom blonde women selling apples at the next stand
performing for the blonde but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she
the buxom blonde smiles at shakespeare seductively
to jonson ill have little trouble parting the legs of barmaids after that performance
you cant play romeo
jonson leaves the stall and continues down the street
shakespeare hesitates then gives the girl a dazzling smile
she smiles back then shakespeare runs after jonson
to jonson why not
i wont let that oaf spencer have another go at one of my roles
no only will shakespeare can pump the life into romeos veins
grins at another passing girl and his cod piece
beat desperate ben ben
im an actor every inch of me down to my very toes
i want no i need crave to act
i cant just idle the day by with so bloody well act like a writer
and for gods sake keep off the stage
writers dont have time to act
a performance of romeo and juliet
about a dozen actors are dancing
it is act scene
romeo played by spencer is staring longingly at juliet
romeo turns to his servant
what ladys that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight
i know not sir
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiops ear beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
the actor playing romeo plays to the women in the audience
and respond eye lashes twittering
watch in awe
now theyre all taking swigs of ale
shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of romeo
oxford watches the dance carefully
did my heart love till now
forswear it sight
for i neer saw true beauty till this night
twenty eight years earlier
a dance is taking place
young oxford now is dancing with young anne
but his eyes are on pg
young elizabeth who is dancing with the spanish seems less than interested in her dancing partner
she stares intently back at young oxford
there is a natural change in the music and all the dancers switch partners its part of the dance
young oxford goes to young elizabeth the spanish ambassador goes to anne
stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate moves
my lord of oxford
we liked your play tonight very much
your young king henry reminded us of you
rash yet brave
a boy and yet a man
fair on the eyes fairer to the ear
much of the court is watching this
they can tell there are sparks between them
all the dancers change partners including elizabeth and oxford
a few dance moves and oxford once again finds himself with elizabeth
we are glad of your return from the continent
two years is far too long to be without such excellent amusements
young oxford dips his head slightly in acknowledgment
if i had known my absence would cause your grace so much
longing i would have returned much much sooner
was that a come on
young elizabeth decides to find out
your wife must be much pleased by your presence once more at her side
young oxford glances over at who is now dancing with the spanish ambassador
but she watches young elizabeth and young oxford with a great deal of jealousy
follows his daughters look
he doesnt like what he sees any more than young anne does
if she is it is but a small comfort to me
i am returned only under my father in laws insistence
a beat as this sinks in
surprised cecil had told me your match was one of love
and so he would wish
long beat but how could one ever love the moon after having first seen the sun
he stares intensely into her eyes
and she stares right back
three ladies in waiting run onto the balcony to join bessie who is looking across the palace grounds watching young elizabeth and young oxford both on horseback unaccompanied trot over
a small bridge
the ladies in waiting giggle but are interrupted by where is her majesty
bessie turns to william cecil
her majesty went riding with the earl of oxford
the ladies in waiting share knowing smiles
young elizabeth and young oxford share flirty glances and then young elizabeth spurs her horse to a gallop and dashes into the fog
young oxford immediately follows
a servant places a silver plate filled with shucked oysters onto a table filled with quail venison wine etc
young elizabeth sits across from young oxford
its just the two of them dining
and which country did you like the most on your travels my lord
i think italy your grace
and why is that
no their theater which they call la commedia dellarte
and of course the women
she raises an eyebrow
they were more
clear with their desires than our english ladies
when they want something they take it
they do not wait to be taken
a door slams open and young elizabeth and young oxford dash in ripping each others clothes off in the fireplace lit room
young elizabeth gently pushes young oxford towards her throne
she kisses him
then begin to make love
on the throne
postcoital the fire still lit
young elizabeth is half asleep half awake nestled in furs in front of the fireplace
much like titania in midsummer nights dream
young oxford watches her as she stirs and wakes
she smiles at him
i cant decide
are you prince hal
smiles puck smiles puck
shes only teasing
ah but puck would never fight for you in the netherlands
surprised smiles the netherlands
but then she realizes hes serious and the smile vanishes
well why not
its an open secret on the continent that you support the rebels against spain and that you are commissioning englishmen to help their cause
spains loss is englands gain is it not
her eyes narrow as she studies his face
is this why you bedded me
for a commission
no of course not i she stands wrapped in her sheets furious at the thought of once more being used
leave at once
bess how dare you
how dare you
i command you to leave my presence
and she steps back waiting for him to exit
young oxford stands
and starts to approach her
hes nude his back to us
she steps back a bit stunned by his impertinence
he steps towards her as o mistress mine where are you roaming
o stay and hear
your true loves coming that can looks up and down her body kiss both high and low
a bit stunned by his approach she stumbles backwards on her sheets
trip no further pretty sweeting
but hes sexy
and spouting poetry
she stops retreating and allows his approach
journeys end in lovers meeting every wise mans son doth know
a small smile escapes her lips
what is love
tis not hereafter present mirth hath present laughter whats to come is still unsure he starts to kiss her neck
cautiously at first
but she likes it
in delay there lies no plenty then come kiss me sweet and twenty youths a stuff will not endure
she responds to him melting from both his words and touch
they start to kiss deeply passionately
and passionately you will stay in england
the flash of disappointment on young oxfords face about that last bit is tempered by young elizabeths sheet falling to the floor
they begin to make love passionately once more
i could do it if i wanted to
twenty seven years later
jonson marlowe dekker and nashe sit silently at a table mugs of ale in hand
having just returned from romeo and juliet all are a bit in shock
the actors from the perfomance are there as well in the bg
to nashe do what
a little drunk a play in iambic in iambic pen
in bic pentameter
its not that hard
think you so
have you ever tried
of course not
but i could if i wanted
it wasnt all in verse
shakespeare enters and makes a bee line for them
excited henslowe wants romeo to run a fortnight
unbelievable news a fortnight
a round for everybody
no response billy
and shakespeare goes over to the bar
the maids love the romantic tragedies
precisely why i avoid them
a one trick pony
hell never be able to do it again
a montage of various plays viola and sebastian are reunited
caesar is attacked by brutus cinna cassius etc
the witches are on stage
these three performances are inter cut with outside the rose announcing each plays title
at first shakespeares name is small with each succeeding play his name gets bigger
and shakespeare bows to the ever increasing applause of his audience
he looks up to see the mermaids wits all watching him with stony silence
and as each play is seen jonson and the rest of the wits seem more and more depressed
and after each performance shakespeare seems to be greeted with more and more adulation
the montage ends with
in front of the theater announcing william shakespeares hamlet
shakespeares name is now above the title
we hear the audience howl with laughter as an actor playing polonius does an obvious caricature of william cecil dressed in black with an exaggerated rendition of cecils beard
over acting beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear it that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
elizabeth watches the same play at a court performance
we see elizabeth smiling amused as polinous continues his rant
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressed in fancy rich nor gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man
this above all to thine own self be true
elizabeth absent mindedly starts to scratch her chest irritated by some sort of itch but still focused on the play
jonson watches tight lipped
the character of gertrude the queen is joined by hamlet
polonius is behind a curtain listening in and is seen by the audience
hamlet appears enraged
what wilt thou do
thou wilt not murder me
behind curtain what ho help
hamlet draws his sword
dead for a ducat dead
hamlet stabs polonius through the curtain
o i am slain
polonius emerges from behind the curtain covered in pigs blood and dies an anguished death
there is stunned silence in the audience
and then one lone groundling claps then another then the whole audience
not a day too soon for old cecil
elizabeth is still scratching her chest but more vigorously as some of the members of court give uncomfortable glances at each other over the death of william cecil er polonius
o me what hast thou done
nay i know not
is it the king
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou findst to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hands peace
sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damned custom have not brassd it so that it
is proof and bulwark against sense
elizabeth cant take the itching anymore
she rips open her bodice and violently scratches some sort of rash on her chest
oxford is in his usual box but completely alone
he has a smile of satisfaction on his lips while
looks over to oxford with astonishment
while on stage the world sees for the first time hamlet contemplating suicide
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against
a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
loud thunder and
and as only the stage and the galleries are covered the groundlings are pelted with the cold drops of water
but they stay
they cover themselves up and silently watch on
to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to
the audience soaked pelted with rain watches immobile
and then a again a loud thunder clap takes us to the end of the play
bows to the thunderous applause
it is still raining but nobody wants to leave
while watch in the crowd a complex range of emotions but jealousy and loathing at the top of the list
some of the audience members grab shakespeare and pull him on their shoulders carrying him triumphantly out of the theater
marlowe walks towards the tower of london
marlowe is waiting patiently
he is sitting across from pole the captain of the guard who is reading his report
looks up are you certain of this
almost confused william cecil was murdered
not literally of course
he was a character a fictional character
but the metaphor was clear for anyone to see
and see they did
pole reads more from the parchment
will you shut it down
pole continues to read
that is not for me to decide
he brings out a pouch of coins and tosses it across the table
your service to his lordship is once again greatly appreciated
marlowe takes the pouch of money
he butchered you
robert cecil is furious pacing back and forth in front of william cecil who sits behind a large wooden desk
william cecil is pale and sweaty he is deathly ill and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels attached to the legs sort of an elizabethan wheelchair
not only in front of court
but the entire city as well
we must arrest this shakespeare and no robert think
if he is really as popular as you say we would only anger the mob
we must strike at edward directly
william cecil slowly and shakily bends down from his chair as but we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks angry our authority comes from elizabeth
and from god
elizabeth is the key to all
robert cecil looks hurt by his fathers anger
you must think deeper
you must compensate
compensate for your
with the gifts god did grant you
william ceci pushes a hidden button on the side of his desk a spring loaded secret drawer pops open
robert cecil has never seen it before
cecil produces a folded piece of parchment from the drawer offers it to robert cecil
from king james of scotland
robert cecil looks surprised
robert cecil is pushing william cecil in his wheelchair
they are completely alone
james knows of the queens affection for essex
and the rumors of his birth
he is justly concerned
beat you will reply to him
i will reply to him
i am dying robert before robert can protest we both know this to be true
and i will not witness the next coronation
robert cecil wheels his father in
help me to my bed my son
robert cecil does so if we are to secure your place at the side of the next king you must get that king his throne not i
a beat as this registers on robert cecil
you will write to james that i am gravely ill but that all is in hand
much of the privy council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the english throne due to your tireless but secret entreaties on his behalf
beat and then tell him essex will not return from ireland alive
robert cecil looks surprised
this is how kings are made robert
so it was with elizabeth and so it shall ever be
there were many rival claims to her throne but none survived to make their claim
james must know that you will do the same for him and he will reward you for it
beat but we must do one thing more
william cecil has a coughing fit reaches for a glass vial of medicine at his bedside takes it
like essex edward must be removed
william cecil is slowly falling asleep
he uses the tools at his disposal as we use the tools at ours
but ours will win
as they always have
more confused i i dont understand father
what does edward edward seeks what we seek
to choose the next king
off robert cecils surprised face we hear i am with child
twenty seven years earlier
young elizabeth is pacing terribly agitated
bessie the lady in waiting we have seen constantly at her side is the only other person present
are you certain
young elizabeth turns to bessie
two cycles have passed my lord
william cecil thinks
i wish to marry him
william cecil looks startled
marry him your grace
he is already married
i can do what i will
she gives him a sharp look
most of the catholic princes of europe wish to topple you and end your protestant reign
the only things that stop them are the channel and the hope that they might marry you and thereby achieve your realm through other means
young elizabeth hears him thinks on it then begins pacing again
i love him
would you risk your throne for him
would you risk england for him
he knows the answer to that
we must do as we have done before
you must go on progress somewhere isolated accompanied by only those whom you most trust
after the birth i will find a suitable house for the child to be reared in
young elizabeth is uncertain
he must never know
a simple cold space like william cecil himself
william cecil is alone in prayer
a few beats then he senses he is not alone
he turns and sees young oxford still
what have you done
i am praying
ignoring him she wont see me
ive gone to her chambers three times and she will not receive me
and now shes gone
william cecil regards young oxford for a beat then stands
shes on progress
with this he leaves the chapel
young oxford runs after him
where did she go
william cecil is silent
what did you say to her
the queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart edward
if she had she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure
he has a point
you must have known her eye would move elsewhere edward
it always has
you are neither the first nor the last of her lovers
young oxford looks up at him like a bucket of cold water has hit him
william cecil stops
he looks at oxford with a stern face
go back to my daughter edward
she will accept you with open arms as she always has
behave as your great title demands you behave
tend to your estates your investments
a beat and make me a grandson an heir
off young oxfords pained expression
twenty seven years later
jonson is alone trying to write at a small table though its obvious from his fits and starts and crossing outs that he is having difficulty
its difficult to write isnt it
after watching something like hamlet
jonson looks up
marlowe sits uninvited
jonson looks annoyed at the interruption
ive seen you watch him
during a performance
it eats at you
at your soul
jonson stares at him his answer obvious
why do you think will hasnt been arrested
you or i make the slightest joke about a nobleman of no consequence and we find ourselves in a cell quicker than a fart spreads in the trade winds
will he murders a caricature of old william cecil himself and still whores all the way to westminster and back
shrugs perhaps they havent noticed
jonson gets up and walks towards the door
i made sure they did
jonson turns around
you informed on one of your own
to the tower
watch who you judge ben for as god is my witness you may well find yourself doing the same before you meet your maker
we do what we have to to survive and survive well in this life
all of us
and will is definitely not one of us
you know hes illiterate dont you
jonson is stunned
oh he can read well enough how else could he learn his lines
but the man never actually learned to form his letters
why are you here kit
smiles so who did write it
youd take credit for it
it must be someone who wants their anonymity protected
someone who might even pay to have it protected
jonson is getting nervous
jonson looks up
marlowe smiles knowing he is closer to the truth
you know dont you ben
youve had too much to drink kit
youre beginning to sound like one of your plays
jonson stands and hurries out of the tavern
jonson heads down the street marlowe chasing after him
we can go to him together
guarantee his anonymity
for a price
you reported on me as well didnt you kit
thats why i was arrested wasnt it
because you went to the tower
lying ben ben
i had nothing to do with that
jonson studies marlowe for a beat and then walks away
ben ill just go to will
hell tell me because he has so much more to lose than you
and youll profit nothing from it
but jonson is gone
a military encampment with dozens of tents on a cliff by the irish seaside
essexs tent is larger and guarded
an old servant carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches
a guard opens the tent for him to enter
essex is having a council of war with his generals and senior officers including southampton
they all stand around a table consulting a map of ireland
pointing if the rebels have stripped the northern borders
then we must march south
and take cahir castle
the servant stays in the background as he pours wine into various goblets
southampton notices him the servants hand shakes as he pours the wine
clears throat uncomfortable my lord
tis a well defended fortress
two thousand men at least
we cannot southampton notices the servants shaking hand slipping into a pocket as so what would you have me do
spend the entire spring encamped
i am sent to ireland to end this infernal rebellion not idle my days with robert
in an instant southampton draws a silver engraved pistol and shoots the servant
everyone is shocked but then we see pg
had drawn his own small wooden pistol
shares a look with southampton
a foggy day
in the foreground we see the maze
oxford and his fencing master beaulieu s are in the center of the maze dueling with rapiers for exercise
they wear outfits that are slightly more protective than ornamental
they duel for a few moments and then oxford touches beaulieus shoulder
the speak entirely in french
oxford backs off as does the fencing master
in french bien
faisons du travail
le coup droit dautorite
mais oui mon seigneur
and they once again begin to duel
but we quickly surmise something is amiss
beaulieu is much more aggressive than he was before
oxford realizes it but is an expert swordsman and defends himself well
and then beaulieu aggressively moves forward and stabs oxford in the leg
quest ce que vous faites
but oxford has little chance to react because beaulieu continues his attack
this has become an assassination attempt not an exercise
francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray carrying a pitcher and two goblets
though wounded oxford is a superior swordsman
and he begins his own attack with a ferocity that surprises beaulieu
francesco heads for the center as oxford pierces beaulieus heart with his rapier and beaulieu screams francesco hears the scream and starts to run
oxford collapses as francesco rushes in
what has happened oxford checks his leg wound and glances at the dead beaulieu
he tries to wave off francesos aid but to no avail as beaulieu he he tried to kill me
jonson slightly drunk walks down a street a whore under his arm and notices a commotion up ahead people talking by an alley near the mermaids tavern
to a passer by whats all that then
jonson peers over and sees on its back in the alley
someone turns it over
its marlowe a dried stab wound in his eye
must have been a cut purse
nowheres bloody safe anymore ill tell you that
a small open air theater where a chained bear is being led around the theater
a set of mastiffs are being led on the opposite side of the theater
the spectators are unruly loudly making bets for the mauling to come
jonson is among them taking a look at the bear deciding whether to bet on it or not
sired by the great arthur himself
no dogs yet been bred that can take him down
shakespeare suddenly sits next jonson hardly notices
i need more money
you already make more than any playwright bankside
but then here good friends i bring you a pack of dogs so fierce so dangerous that medusa herself would shrink in fear
im going to build my own theater ben one that fits the scale of my work jonson suddenly turns to him
not a one has had a morsel of food in a week
bred by the great john sinclow
fourpence on three dogs
they insist only a gentleman can own the land
a shilling on four
the bribes are outrageous but i found some one who will make me a coat of arms and change the stratford lists for me
eight shillings on six dogs
eight shillings on six dogs
ill take that bet
eight shillings on the bear six dogs
bad bet that
to shakespeare youll have to make do with what youve got
i wont be your beggar
shakespeare gives him a look to kill
this isnt a request ben
ill have more money
youll slit my throat like you did kits
release the dogs
release the dogs
shakespeare shows no reaction
i know he went to see you last night will
and i know he was planning to expose you if you didnt agree to his terms
the bear baiting begins
shakespeare stares at jonson
dead serious youre mad ben
kit was my friend
be careful will
you kill me off too and you wont have any good plays to act in after this is all done
some of the spectators boo while others cheer and ill have my guineas ben
one way or another ill have my guineas
and he gets up and leaves as the start to go for the bears throat
thge cheering goes to a roar as we pg
wears a beard and fake nose
he tries to stay hidden so jonson doesnt see him
we are jonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and drinks an ale
then oxfords servant francesco appears
after the two men have exchanged couple of words francesco gives jonson a leather folder containing a manuscript and a purse jingling with coin
jonson takes them and leaves
jonson safely gone shakespeare starts to follow francesco who heads back over the bridge
shakespeare is in a small boat following francesco who is in oxfords boat
they head towards oxford stone
shakespeare watches as francesco enters oxford stone
shakespeare is waiting clearly uncomfortable
its not the kind of room hes used to being in
he holds his wig and his nose
a door opens and oxford enters walking on a stick because of his leg injury
he is followed by his servant francesco
you are the famous shakespeare whose labors i have enjoyed so much
i am at your service sir
shakespeare is uncomfortable
he wasnt expecting oxford himself
then he just goes for it
my lord i i need more money
sharp i beg your pardon
my expenses have ah aggrandized
since this all began
and if if your lordship doesnt agree to an increase in my ah fee i shall be forced to make certain
have you any idea to whom you are speaking
i am addressing the writer of hamlet
of juliet and her romeo
am i not
oxford is silent
francesco goes to physically eject shakespeare from the room
how dare you insult my master in wait
beat how much
shakespeare looks at francesco then oxford
four hundred pounds
francesco is shocked
impatient in italian pagalo
shakespeare exits tossing a leather pouch filled with coins
oxford watches shakespeare walk down the road through a window
forgive me for speaking of things above my place or understanding signor
is this wise
they have already tried to kill you once
wisdom francesco is a quality i have unfortunately never possessed
francesco stares at oxford who is deep in thought
the sound of heated love making takes us to
twenty five years earlier
young oxford now and with a beard is making love to someone
we cant tell who at first and assume it is elizabeth
and then we see its bessie young elizabeths lady in waiting
an hour later post coital
a fire is burning and bessie is finishing dressing herself
you know she would be furious if she found out about this
young oxford doesnt answer
he is deep in thought
she still loves you
she abandoned me
you dont know do you
he looks at her quizzically
she had your child
a carriage drives towards the house
young anne de vere holds her sleeping daughter in her arms
bessie carefully closes oxfords bedroom door and suddenly freezes
she turns and sees young oxfords wife with her little daughter at her side standing in the hallway staring at her
for a moment nobody dares to move then bessie rushes off
i cannot be certain majesty when the
young elizabeth looks out a window obviously distressed
william cecil is across from her his face tense
but sometime soon after your return to court
they they havent been very discreet majesty
i presume he wanted you to know
to hurt you
she is crushed
majesty there is more
the lady is pregnant
young elizabeth freezes stunned
then arrest them
arrest them both
william cecil bows and exits
now alone young elizabeth lets her emotions out
she picks up a vase and throws it into a wall
from high above we see a carriage arrive
it stops and william cecil gets out
young oxford now is looking out a window at the river beyond
he has been imprisoned for some months
his beard has become ragged his clothes have seen better days
william cecil enters
your whore gave birth last week
young oxford turns to william cecil
the stare at each other for a beat
the queen has decided to release you
it seems time does indeed heal all wounds
beat these are her conditions for your release
you will not acknowledge the child
you will never see the mother again
you will avoid court at all costs
her majesty would prefer not to be reminded of you in any way ever again
a beat as young oxford thinks on all this
you have the freedom of the kingdom
just not of the court
beat those are her terms
here are mine
you will go back to my daughter
you will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life and accept the responsibilities of your great title
oxford reluctantly nods
william cecil goes to leave
i too have a condition
william cecil turns
i will go back to your daughter if
you tell me the name of the child
i dont know if the whore has even delivered the no
the other one
cecils face goes to stone
the other one
realizing who told you
cecil is obviously annoyed by this development
i will go back to your daughter
i will make you as many grandchildren as she can bare
william cecil thinks
or i can remain here
william cecil decides
there is no record of his true birth no trail that leads to you or the
his foster parents never knew the truth and both are now dead
make even a hint of this to the child or anyone else and this agreement is void and ill see your head on the block within a fortnight
and the boys as well
excited its a boy
young oxford cleaned up is watching a boy about five years old dueling with a tutor
the boy is quite good
the boy notices young oxford and stops duelling
young oxford smiles at the boy
im edward the earl of oxford
the boy bows a serious expression on his face
they tell me one day youre to be an earl as well
i shall be the earl of southampton
smiling well then we shall be earls together shant we
twenty five years later
william cecils body is in state in his coffin in the center of the apse
looking completely stricken approaches the coffin holding cecils white cane
she places it at his side
in the background we hear the archbishop of canterbury reading from the bible
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth for out of it wast thou taken because thou art dust and to dust
shalt thou return
scans the room to see how it is all playing out
watches stoically his wife and children at his side
the funeral over elizabeth exits the portal of westminster abbey and heads to her carriage
a huge crowd of mourners has assembled
robert cecil steps into place right behind her
we wish to recall essex from ireland
robert cecil is instantly concerned but hides it well
they continue to walk
we feel a terrible void now that your father is no longer at our side
robert cecil bows his head as he walks
a wise decision your majesty
if nothing else it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors
still walking she turns to him sharply
im sorry majesty i thought youd heard
essex is in negotiations with philip of spain
peace is at hand
we know this
majesty it is said that essex has promised phillip all of catholic ireland in return for
in return for what
spains support of essexs claim to the throne of england
they have arrived at her carriage
beat it is as of yet just rumor
bring him to me william
bring him to me at once
correcting robert majesty
elizabeth stares at him for an instant then gets into her carriage unsure of herself
my fathers death has been a great loss for us all
she ignores him trying to collect herself
robert cecil turns to the driver nods and the carriage takes off
as soon as it is away robert cecil turns and some in the crowd of commoners begin to boo at him
as they gallop over emerald green grasses
we are a group of horsemen gallop into essexs camp
a messenger jumps off his horse and heads for essexs tent
where essex and southampton are having dinner as the messenger enters
he hands him a sealed envelope
essex takes it begins to read
frowns slams the parchment down
he looks into the distance trying to process what hes just read
southampton picks up the parchment and begins reading
she cant believe this
oh cant she
its robert cecil
he failed to kill you now he tries to kill your name
essex heads for the flap of the tent
we leave with the tide
shakespeare enters the tavern carrying a rolled up parchment
he passes various actors drinking then hurries over to jonson nashe and dekker who are deep in drink
well ive got it
shakespeare unravels the parchment
he puts it on the table with a flourish
it shows a coat of arms containing a spear and a falcon
the colors are numerous and garish
the herald just finished it not an hour ago
everyone is confused by it
what in blazes is it
my coat of arms
it cost a bloody fortune but by god you can call me gentleman now
jonson looks over at shakespeare
shakespeare locks eyes with him but looks away ashamed of something
i cant quite make out the motto
non sanz droict
not without right
not without right
beat you went to him didnt you
you lying knave you went to him
shakespeare doesnt want to discuss this with the others present
let me buy you a he grabs jonsons shoulder but jonson pushes him away
youve already killed off one competitor
now you want another dead as well
shakespeare looks at the confused nashe and dekker nervously
i dont know what you mean
ben we should really i swore to him i wouldnt tell you his name
do you have any idea what he might do to me
to nashe pg
hes not even a writer you know
he cant even ben youve had too much to drink
shakespeare grabs jonson
shakespeare backs off
jonson pulls out a piece of parchment from his shirt
looks around a quill
nashe and dekker look at each other slightly embarrassed
jonson finds a quill deep in his pants
he thrusts it at will who ignores it
re the parchment go on will
write something for us
amaze us with your verse
try astounding us with the letter e
or an i its just a straight line
shakespeare stares at him
you havent got any ink
and he exits
southampton and essex are on horseback followed by several dozen armed retainers galloping towards the city of london
the party rides into the first gate
the palace is the city residence of the queen and is at the edge of the city
essex and southampton jump off their horses
essex and southampton walk quickly down the long hallway opening door after door
servants scurry behind them terrified of the intrusion trying to stop them
they open the doors into the ladies in waiting scream in fear when they see the two men in battle gear
to southampton wait for me
and he continues on into where elizabeth is still dressing putting on make up etc
she is not wearing her wig and is only wearing her undergarments
she looks quite ugly
she turns to see essex shocked at his intrusion
he knows he has just made an enormous faux pas
majesty i i
she stares at him horrified to be seen in such a manner
the she regains her composure and get out
he steps back in horror not at her appearance but what he has just done
the doors slam in front of him as we the insolence
elizabeth now dressed and wearing her wig on her throne is raging at robert cecil
who in gods name does he think he is
abandoning his post without my leave
she begins to absent mindedly unbutton the top of her bodice
coming into our presence in such a manner neither announced nor invited half his army in my courtyard
hes gone mad
unfortunately for us your majesty he is quite sane
he simply believes he is your royal equal
she turns to him sharply furious at the thought
it looks like an armed camp with part of essexs army encamped in the front courtyard
the soldiers are all tense
oxford followed only by francesco rides into the courtyard
he is immediately surrounded by armed men their muskets pointed at him
oxford raises his hands
i am edward earl of oxford
thank god youre here
southampton comes towards him
elizabeth has revoked all of his royal licenses
she believes every lie cecil tells about him
seeing oxfords wound edward
what happened to your leg
oxford continues towards the door
southampton follows his concern for oxfords wound noticeable
oxford southampton and essex are alone
oxford is sitting in a chair while essex paces impatiently southampton standing between them
she wont accept my letters
i cannot get to her
cecil plans to arrest me any day
i know it
beat and more determined but that wont be as easy as he thinks
fight him in london and you only validate every rumor and lie cecil has ever told about you
then what do you suggest i do
let myself be arrested so i can be tried and executed for crimes i did not commit
i will go to elizabeth myself alone how
cecil wont let her see a letter without reading it first
i wont send her a letter
i will send her a book
essex looks confused but oxford ignores it
she will call for me
and while i am with her you will come not with an army not with swords but with her loyal subjects
the cobblers the tinkers the bricklayers of london
all all calling for robert cecils banishment from court
words robert words will prevail with her not swords
essex looks unsure
and the mob
how will i leave that to me
oxford is in his rooms writing feverishly by candlelight
he completes a thought
closes the manuscript
writes down the title with a flourish the tragedie of richard iii a room for the whores to take their tricks
small with nothing much beyond a straw bed
shakespeare is bedding a buxom young lady
and then the door opens
francesco enters and oxford follows holding a manuscript
shakespeare looks shocked
she starts to scream and yell as she pulls a sheet to cover herself
to the whore hold your tongue whore and get out
she does so as oxford walks over to shakespeare
he tosses the manuscript to him
shakespeare starts to look at it
the whore is partially dressed so to the whore out woman
oos going to pay me then
shakespeare gives a look to oxford he certainly isnt going to pay for it
oxford nods to francesco who gives the whore a few coins
she smiles and leaves
you shall begin rehearsals immediately
but it is not to be performed until i tell you
and you may only have a days notice
shakespeare looks confused
that will be expensive keeping all the actors ready
having the props made but not oxford tosses a very large pouch of coins at him and then begins to leave
oh and congratulations
youve had an epic poem published today
you mean like in a book
renaissance music begins as we as a printer presses down the press onto it
the title page is printed in front of us
its called venus and adonis
a montage begins
and the printer brings the page out from the press and checks it for proper alignment
quoth she whereat a sudden pale like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale pg
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws the printer nods his approval
the poem continues with shakespeare exits the print shop continuing to read the book now out loud
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck he on her belly falls she on her back
not quoting oh i like this
that is held by a woman
fondling she saith ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale we are a lady in waiting is reading
out loud to other ladies
they listen giggling now and then
we only see them from the back
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
continuing seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty thou wast begot to beget is thy duty
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
they look up and see standing across the room
how much has she heard
they all stand abruptly worried
the women who was reading the book puts it down on a table
elizabeth silently walks over to them and picks up the book
she opens it as we robert cecil walks down the long hall heading for an audience with the queen
two guards open a door letting him into elizabeth is looking out the window
its raining outside
she is not wearing her wig not much make up and looks quite
robert cecil enters
turns you find me disgusting dont you
you you are the sun majesty
the glory of liar
robert cecil shuts his mouth
is it so hard to believe that once i was young
that i was
your father knew me as such
beat you have read the book
she doesnt have to say which one
robert cecil sees a copy of venus and adonis on a table
he writes to me
to remind me of that beauty
robert cecil knows to be silent
she looks out the window
throaty sexually graze on my lips and if those hills be dry stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
she smiles seductively transported in time
ive been foolish
the virgin queen
beat thou wast begot to beget is thy duty
by law of nature thou art bound to breed that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
beat your father told you of the child
hint of a smile which one your majesty
elizabeths eyes flare in anger for an instant then she regains composure
he still lives
robert cecil nods
he was well placed
robert cecil hesitates
i am your queen
now who is my son
his grace the earl of
southampton your majesty
she seems surprised
perhaps she was expecting essex
but then she smiles and nods in approval
you are not having doubts about james of scotland succeeding you are you
elizabeth goes into a rage
he is the son of mary
she plotted and schemed to steal the throne from under me
no son of hers will rule while a yet tudor lives
robert cecil is surprised by her fury
he bows his head as elizabeth tries to collect herself
i will decide what is best for my kingdom
calmer i have bid edward to come to me on my return to london on monday next
it is decided
she says no more the audience over
robert cecil hesitates and then she glares at him
he bows and exits the fury on his face plain
elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window
sotto and so in spite of death i shall survive in that my likeness still is left alive
ben jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands
he stops for a moment when he sees the new globe theater
workers are still painting the walls
he pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a performance of richard iii on monday next
jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new theater shakespeare and burbage have built
the actor condell is on stage rehearsing the character of gloucester
he walks on stage with a limp and has a large hump on his back
he is a caricature of robert cecil
in character but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass
richard burbage the theaters stage manager is watching his performance with spencer and a group of actors
jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat
in character i that am curtaild of this fair proportion deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world
good part that
and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
out of character is this wise
its only the one performance
i need a drink
and gloucester heads backstage
to burbage burbage
the best bankside
but only one performance
is it that bad
hardly its wills new play
richard the third
weve been hired to perform it free to the public
some anonymous nobleman paid for everything
god knows will never would
been rehearsing all week just found out this morning we go up next monday
jonson thinks a beat thats odd but then holds up his manuscript
grins my best so far
i guarantee more than one performance
though ill not pay for the tickets myself
winks no need to
jonson looks confused
hes part owner
im sorry ben but i had to agree no jonson plays at the globe
jonson is in shock
jonson is deep in drink by himself
he listens as patrons of the bar say to a woman you doin tomorrow
managed to get two tickets to shakespeares latest
cost me a fortune
ballocks did it
theyre giving them away free
some of the actors from the rehearsal enter all jolly and excited
they head for the bar
they are the actor who played gloucester spencer pope heminge etc
best villain in the history of theater richard the third
better than mephistopheles
your marlowe god rest his soul is fine for your everyday scalawag and your jonson wont even try the hard drama
no this is shakespeare for gods sake
the man knows drama
i tell you not even the greeks compare
toasting to shakespeare
jonson gets up furious and exits quite drunk
the actors dont even notice him
jonson stumbles down the streets alone deep in his own private hell
fancy a tumble
jonson waves her off
he looks up and sees the tower of london
he makes a decision
jonson sits in the same spot where marlowe was sitting earlier
and he hates himself for it
rain drips down the windows
pole looks up from some papers
i havent got all day man
there is a there is a play to be performed
theres many plays to be performed next monday isnt there
yes my lord but this one is to be performed one performance and one performance only
all bankside is talking of it
beat the history of king richard the third
by william shakespeare
pole is confused
he kills his brother the king and half the royal family to get the throne for himself i know who richard the third was
of course you do
but in william shakespeares version he is played as a hunch back
pole realizes this is significant
robert cecil has prayed all night
his lips silently move in a prayer for a miracle
when pole appears he doesnt stop his prayer
only after pole whispers in his ear does he stop and look slowly up to the simple cross and close his eyes in relief
from high high above a city of souls
its a beautiful sunny day but black storm clouds are on the horizon
all of london is on its feet
they all are on their way to bankside
the london bridge is crammed one way
the river thames is full of many small boats of theatergoers
we see that a huge crowd has formed in front of the globe
everyone is busy preparing for the performance actors stage hands etc
shakespeare adjusts an actors costume when burbage walks up besides him
we have to turn em away by the hundreds
never seen anything quite like it
and both men look out the curtains to the crowd outside
the theater is full to the last seat
the people are crammed together like sardines
oxford is being dressed in front of a mirror
his finest clothes
powder to face
francesco assists him
jonson is leaning against the edge of the balustrade watching the groundlings fill in
he bites his nails nervous
nashe joins him as so
i heard the earl of essex paid for this whole performance
mans never even been to the theater and still hes heard of will dekker also joins them
my cousins one of his men at arms
hasnt been paid in weeks
theyre all just sitting there waiting
waiting for what
wants to have an audience with the queen
as if cecil would ever let essex near her now
by the mass cecil in favor essex out
who can keep up with it all
takes a swig pg
zounds i tire of politics politics politics
oxford is in a long boat headed for whitehall palace
the oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the water
elizabeth is doing her toilette
she seems excited like a school girl before her first date
her ladies in waiting are attending to her
the audience hushes as gloucester the future richard iii enters
he is hunch backed and looks as much like robert cecil as possible in terms of beard and costume
first the people are in stunned silence but then like magic the hissing starts
it is followed by more hissing and the first boos
the actor playing gloucester nervously looks around
dekker seems surprised at the similarity to robert cecil
to nashe tired of politics are you
seems you picked the wrong day to come to the theater then
jonson gives dekker a sharp look
whats going on here
gloucester addresses the audience
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york
grim visaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
the hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the actor stops for a moment
but then he finds the courage again to continue
jonson looks down at the groundlings reaction and spots in the audience
but among the groundlings not in oxfords usual box seat
looks over to oxfords box
and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass
robert cecil watches himself in a mirror as armor is placed on him by servants
i that am curtaild of this fair proportion deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world
the huge crowd has stayed in front of the globe
it seems they are waiting for something
we hear hissing and booing from the crowd inside the theater
and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
on stage gloucester continues despite the concert of hissing and booing
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days
essex mounts his horse southampton at his side
their sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to elizabeth
edward knows what he is doing
does he not
he promised us a mob
theyll be here
essex looks concerned but says no more
the servant tightens the last strap of robert cecils armor
he smiles at himself in the mirror
plots have i laid
as they roll down a cobbled street
we are soldiers move people and carts off the street
others put cannons into place and then cover them with canvas tarps
inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other
shakespeare watches from backstage getting more and more nervous by the audiences reaction
to the actor playing gloucester a pox on you
a pox on cecil
a pox on cecil
a pox on cecil
the actors are getting nervous
people start throwing lettuce and tomatoes at them
why is oxfords man with the groundlings
shakespeare and burbage exchange a worried glance
the bells of st
james cathedral mark the hour as five oclock
essex looks to southampton nervously
the play continues
gloucester is plotting yet another death on his way to the throne
hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framd in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal down with cecil
the actor playing gloucester hesitates
the audience is getting unruly
up with essex
to essex house
to essex house
jonson is putting the pieces together
this is what essex is waiting for realizing oxford is bringing him a mob
jonson heads for the stairs
why would oxford i dont know i dont know
but the tower cecil he already knows
looks at francesco i i have to warn them
nashe and dekker are baffled as jonson rushes down the stairs
up with essex
death to cecil
shakespeare turns to burbage
we must close the play
are you off your head
we can start to hear the audience chanting ess ex ess ex
its getting unruly
in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal pg
ess ex ess ex ess ex jonson pushes his way through the crowd trying to head for francesco
but theyre separated by a sea of people
to essex house
to essex house
death to cecil
a moment as the whole audience thinks on this
and then these chants are repeated by hundreds in the audience as they are pushing towards exits
and jonson still struggling to reach francesco is carried along with the mob
the mob pours out of the doors
storm clouds are gathering
a rumble of thunder sounds in the distance
oxford is waiting for his audience looking out a window nervously
the crowd pours through bankside growing in numbers as more people come out of taverns whore houses etc
a shop owner comes out of his store confused
another man grabs him
and then to the queen
joins in the chanting ess ex
the shop owner begins to get the spirit of the mob
if anything the crowd is twice the size it was moments ago
they head down the shop lined bridge full of bravado
is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob
he spots francesco nearby
the mob has to slow down on the bridge
there is not much room
and then it happens
we are at the front of the mob when the first soldiers appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons
people scream as an officer appears and fire
and then the cannon fires
there is panic all around and runs with the crowd trying to escape
essex and southampton look tense
they expected a mob here by now
they should be here by now
we go as we are
and he spurs his horse and gallops down the street
to the queen
southampton has no choice and follows
so do the or so men behind them
oxford hears a cannon shot
but it could also be the sound of thunder
he goes to the window sees the rain clouds and dismisses the sound
a lady in waiting enters
her majesty will be with you shortly
omitted the mob is in panic
and is in the middle of it
we are betrayed
jonson looks on in horror as francesco is killed by a soldier wielding a pike
essex and his men roar past the token guards at the front gate and gallop into the essex rears his horse looks around at the many windows that surround them
to the queen
to the queen
his men repeat his plea
and then once again another trap springs
and line up in a colonnade in the story above
pole is in command
take your aim
its a trap
but before his men can obey pole orders fire
and a hundred shots fire down into essex and his men
oxford hears the shots fired
confused he goes to a window looks out and sees men fall all around essex and southampton
pole walks down the colonnade
elizabeth heads for the window just as a door behind her slams open and robert cecil hurries in with a dozen guards
you must away
essex is in armed revolt
hes come to usurp you
i edward is she seems like a confused old woman
you must flee
he means to kill you and take your throne for himself
it takes only an instant for that to sink in
she looks enraged
and then she turns with a flurry and heads back the way she came
the guards that were with robert cecil follow her
another fusillade is shot and more of essexs men go down
and then doors open on the ground floor and guards rush out to take down the survivors
essex and southampton valiantly fight but theres just too many
theyre soon surrounded
and essex knowing all is lost raises his sword in defeat
southampton sees this and does the same
oxford watches all of this through the window
she wont forgive him this edward
oxford turns devastated
essex will be convicted and executed for treason
beat as will your son
oxford looks shocked
didnt you think i knew
of course i knew edward
my father told me all his secrets
all of them
smiling though the most fascinating was not made known to me until after his death
he hated you edward how he hated you
and yet he married his only daughter to you
i never knew why until i read his last letter to me
he wanted his grandson to be an earl
he wanted his grandson to be a king
oxford now looks confused
elizabeth had several children edward not just yours
she was sixteen for the first
bloody mary was still queen and our future gloriana was out of favor
no one thought her very important at all
except my father of course
and when her first child was born a male my father took it and hid it
the grandson of henry viii the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman
john de vere the previous earl of oxford agreed to accept the task
oxford goes ashen
beat why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died
he had it all planned years in advance
he would teach you everything he knew about statecraft marry his daughter and after elizabeths death proclaim you heir
his own grandchild to follow you on the throne
but he couldnt possibly predict what kind of failure you would become
how you would fail in politics ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy all to write
beat or that you would commit incest
beat delicious isnt it
right out of a greek tragedy
elizabeth would never have what
slept with her son
beat i dont think she ever knew to tell you the truth
though you never know with the tudors
they all have had such strange tastes in bed fellows
beat you could have been a king edward
and your son after you
except for the fact that
you were you
its raining hard
oxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now empty courtyard
the remains of the battle are still visible
wounded screaming horses struggle to stand
oxfords a shell devoid of emotion
hardly alive at all
he drops to his knees the rain pouring down on him
we see the silhouette of a man watching through a window from the second story above
its robert cecil a slight smile on his face
pole approaches him from behind
robert cecil doesnt turn or acknowledge pole but speaks to him as he stares at oxford
i want a fair trial for southampton
evidence witnesses no false confessions
it must be above reproach
though with a guilty verdict of course
oh and pole turns if there is any mention of that play looks back at oxford pg
make certain the secretaries refer to it as richard the second
there will be no mention of hunchbacks in the official record
oxford is sitting in a chair watching the river thames alone
snow is falling and oxford is covered in a thick blanket
he looks ill
anne walks up behind him
sentence has been passed
oxford looks over at her
this news gives her great pleasure
they are to be be headed
with venom both of them
essex tomorrow southampton in a week
beat your son is going to be killed edward
by his own mother
put that in one of your plays
and she leaves him with that
essex dressed in black but with a bright red waistcoat is led up a scaffold by guards his hands bound behind him
snow covers the courtyard
there are only a few witnesses as befitting essexs rank
stands looking at life one last time
the executioner approaches with an axe
essex turns realizing it is time
he kneels resting his head on a wooden bench
god save the queen
just as the axe lands we we see the body of essex fall onto the scaffolding his head into a basket
we are southampton a prisoner is watching his future fate from a room high in a tower
as they walk limping along tiled floors
we are doors fly open and oxford appears before elizabeth who is on her throne regal and all in white surrounded by courtiers including robert cecil
but she looks very old very ill
everyone goes silent as oxford approaches elizabeth
oxford makes no notice of them
he bows deeply in front of her
all of you
people start to exit
but not robert cecil
majesty i leave us
cecil exits obviously worried
when they are alone you look old
oxford smiles sadly
i thank your majesty for seeing me
you cannot have him
he is our son
who did commit high treason
they only wished for a place in government equal to their station
equal to their birth
you caused this
your play your words caused my people to mob against me
do you think i wasnt aware of your plot with this man shakespeare that i wouldnt recognize your voice
it should be your head on the block next week not southamptons
then take my head
in our sons stead
elizabeth turns away from him angered
she walks to a window turns her back on him
neither they nor i ever conspired against you
cecil alone was our aim
he has corrupted your cecil
he has kept me my throne
beat mary queen of scots
philip king of spain
four french louiss
eight popes they all wanted my head
all of them
beat yet here i remain
because of the cecils
we would have protected you pg
you would have protected me
my loyal earls
snarls you think essex and southampton were the first to conspire against me to try to take my throne
beat only the cecils could i trust
they could never claim my throne
their wealth their power their survival all depended on me
me and no other
a long beat before let our child live
furious all englishmen are my children
she has a coughing fit
oxford patiently waits until she has recovered
does he know
oxford shakes his head
and if i give him to you
he will never learn of it from me
she pauses for a long moment
and then she decides
he must never know
beat take him
oxford dares to smile relieved
but only after my death
when all is complete
after james is crowned king his crown safe only then can you claim your son
beat this island will be whole
one island one kingdom one king
with disgust scotsman though he be
beat that that will be my final gift to my people
beat and i shall remain pure
elizabeth again looks out a window
that is all that has come from you
none will be claimed by you
and she leaves the throne chamber
oxford looks after her as the sounds of bells slowly begin gonging as we the bell ringing comes from st
pauls cathedral the largest church in the city
on the frozen river thames we see the funeral procession for the greatest queen england has ever seen
everybody follows the carriage with the casket of the queen
all the lords and ladies of the land
all wear elaborate black clothing
first is robert cecil
not far walks oxford
he is a statue
devoid of emotion
and then joyous choral music replaces the church gongs as we as it is placed on a head
we are pg
james i late s is being crowned by the archbishop
all the lords and ladies of the land are standing in attendance
is watching james
his face betrays his proud feelings
all of robert cecils desires have come true
oxfords wife anne is there but oxford is nowhere to be seen
god save the king
god save the king
oxford stands next to a carriage waiting as the gates open and southampton scruffy and a bit worse for wear is escorted out
southampton smiles weakly when he sees oxford waiting for him
the two men walk towards each other and embrace
both men have tears in their eyes
no no no no
shakespeare is on stage supervising a rehearsal of much ado about nothing
he doesnt look pleased
the line wont get a laugh that way
you must accent the word sirrah will
shakespeare turns and sees jonson heading his way
jonson is completely drunk waving a sword in one hand a tankard in another
off to the palace are you
shakespeare immediately sees jonsons condition
a command performance for our new king
even in bloody scotland theyve heard of bloody will shakespeare have they
counterfeiter of wit
the actors on stage are all watching nervous
but jonson charges shakespeare
shakespeare easily dodges the drunk jonson
jonson roars and attacks again
shakespeare dodges again turns and manages to grab jonson by the throat
they are face to face
you came to me ben
you came to me
they stare at each other and then shakespeare shoves him off
jonson falls to the ground
jonson only semi conscious is carried by the actors and dumped into the street
they leave him there
he wallows in the mud for a beat
then master jonson
jonson looks up to see one of oxfords servants standing above him
the servant guides jonson towards oxfords bedroom just as anne and a doctor emerge from it
she recognizes him
to servant what is this man doing in my house
the servant doesnt know what to say
to jonson you will leave at once
my husband is quite ill it was your husband who sent for me madam
and i am dismissing you a second doctor exits the sick mans room
are you jonson
hes asking for you
excuse me your grace
oxford in bed looks quite ill sweat covering his brow
he furiously writes on a small tablet on his lap
he holds up his hand for silence as jonson enters the doctor following behind him
thank you doctor
the doctor exits
come over here jonson
he points to a chair by the bed
when jonson sits down he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the bed
did you know jonson that my family can trace its peerage farther back than any family in the kingdom
we fought at crecy
at bosworth field
beat i inherited my earldom as one of the wealthiest men ever to breathe english air
and at last breath i shall be one of the poorest
jonson looks on sadly
never a voice in government
never a sword raised in glorious battle
no immortal deeds for my heirs to know me by
beat words merely words are to be my legacy
beat you alone watch my plays and know them as mine
when i hear the applause the cheering of the audience all those hands clapping they are celebrating
but in that cacophony of sounds i strained to hear the sound of two hands only
beat but heard them i never did
jonson stares at him
death takes away all pretense and demands honesty from its target
you you have never told me
never told me what you thought of my work
to answer is not an easy task for jonsons ego
almost a whisper i find
the most wondrous ever heard on our stage
on any stage
the two men now looking each other in the eye
sotto you are the soul of the age
oxford smiles at the thought of it
then promise me
promise me jonson that you will keep our secret safe
that you wont expose shakespeare
i have seen it in your face
he vexes you
how could he not
but he is not your burden
he is mine
then he nods to the manuscripts by his side
all my writings
the plays the sonnets
keep them safe
keep them from my family
from the cecils
wait a few years and then publish them
jonson looks stricken
i am not worthy of this charge my lord
i betrayed you
i told them of your i have made it my life to know the character of men jonson
i know you
you may have betrayed me but you will never betray my words
he puts the last manuscript on the pile
jonson looks at the pg
which reads dedication then more words starting with to the earl of southampton jonson leaves oxfords room visibly shaken
the manuscripts are under his arm
anne oxfords wife is still there surround by doctors
then she sees jonson leaving
you your friends your blasphemous theaters have brought nothing but ruin and dishonor to this family
you your family me even elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper
he turns and exits
jonson exits the building and walks away
he reads the dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he walks
to the earl of southampton
the love i dedicate to your lordship is without end whereof this pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous moiety
jonson freezes and looks back at oxfords house realizing there is another whole layer to all this exactly what he can only guess
a few hours later
oxford has died in his bed
anne watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet
what i have done is yours what i have to do is yours being part in all i have devoted yours
a casket is being interred into the family mausoleum
anne is there as are oxfords children
so is robert cecil
were my worth greater my duty would show greater meantime as it is it is bound to your lordship to whom i wish long life
still lengthened with all happiness
southampton is there as well
tears roll down his cheeks
where we began
a bucket of water is dumped on jonson
he regains consciousness and looks around
somewhat confused he sees robert cecil limping out of the dark towards him
robert cecil leans down and very close to his ear whispers i can make all this go away jonson
to be but a dream
like one of your plays
or i can bring you so much pain pain that were you given a thousand years and a thousand quills you could never justly describe
cecil steps back
i know you have them
all his manuscripts
my sister saw you leave oxford stone with them under your arm
jonson takes a long time before answering
will he betray oxford
they were destroyed
by your own men
cecil doesnt know whether to believe him or not
why would i lie
is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than i
jonson stares directly at cecil knowing he is speaking about cecil as well as himself
he was something i could never be
an undeniable perfection
that plagued my soul
and to him i was
cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment searching for the truth
then he smiles
let him go
he tells the truth
robert cecil turns to leave but then turns a last time
and jonson better him wont you
wipe his memory for all time
and for me
robert cecil smiles at jonson who can only stare at him
finally sotto i am afraid that this is not possible my lord
robert cecils smile freezes and he leaves
jonson is getting released
he walks away
a lonely figure
wide from above
still smoking from the fire
all the sudden we make out jonson searching through the rubble
set for a court performance of a play
courtiers bow as king james i enters the chamber robert cecil two steps behind him
james takes his seat right in front of the stage as elizabeth used to
jonsons eyes search the ground
and eventually he finds it that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration
opens the box
are the manuscripts oxford gave him
jonson smiles relieved
they are singed at the edges but they are there
we hear o for a muse of fire
that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention
he is the same actor who introduced the play at the beginning of the film
but now he wears elizabethan clothing but again all monochromatic and grey
a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
and he is standing on the stage
let us ciphers to this great accompt on your imaginary forces work
king james watches enthusiastically robert cecil right next to him
we had seen some of this shakespeares plays in edinburgh sir robert
i must tell you we enjoyed them immensely and look forward to seeing many more now that we are in london
i presume you are as avid a theater man as myself
robert cecils smile remains frozen
of course your majesty
the camera moves away from them and we realize we are on the theater stage where we started
prologue turns and addresses his audience and us in the modern theater
robert cecil remained the most powerful man in the court of king james though he could not prevent the public theaters from becoming ever more popular
william shakespeare however spent the remaining years of his life not in the playhouses of london but in the small town of his birth stratford upon avon as a businessman
and grain merchant
ben jonson succeeded in his desire to be the most celebrated playwright of his time becoming englands first poet laureate
and in he wrote the dedication to the collected works of the man we call william shakespeare
beat and so
though our story is finished our poets is not
for his monument is ever living made not of stone but of verse and it shall be remembered
as long as words are made of breath and breath of life
the curtains close
end credits start to roll
