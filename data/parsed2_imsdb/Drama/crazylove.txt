written by carol watson the sweet silence of slumber
suddenly an alarm clock on a nightstand shrieks the operatic tones of maria callas
a well manicured hand nails painted pink slaps the snooze button and mutes maria
a few seconds reprieve
then another clock stationed on a dresser broadcasts the fortissimo pounding of the william tell overture
toes also painted pink swing out of bed and run to the dresser
letty mayer late s and beautiful turns off the music
she opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color from white to beige to black
behind the panties are rows of bras also organized by color
letty pulls out some taupe undergarments checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties
letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored pink linen suit
she lays it on the bed
beast her cat jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket
letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit
what have i told you about linen
the scolding is cut short by an urge overkill song that screams out from another room
on cue letty heads down the hall dressing as she goes
she clucks for beast to follow
letty turns off the alarm clock that blasts urge overkill from the counter and checks the time against her watch
she swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type
seafood on the left chicken in the middle then naturally beef
letty reaches for a can
looking at beast its liver saute
letty considers the cat a moment and chooses another can
fine then chicken in gravy
but youre going to have to eat the liver tomorrow
letty puts the finishing touches on her make up and pulls back her hair plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray
yet another alarm clock sounds this time blaring the voice of shock jocks mark and brian
letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock which is mounted near the front door
she bends down to kiss the cat good bye grabs a briefcase and leaves
a school bell buzzes
grade schoolers clutching lunch pails scurry past letty who stands outside an office door
she straightens her jacket takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle
letty is stopped cold when chandra the victim of a bloody nose runs up to her bawling
letty looks quickly at chandra her watch the door
to chandra goodness this is a bad one
tip your head back
she bends down and pushes back chandras head
chandra off balance places one very bloody hand on lettys jacket lapel staining it for all eternity
letty grimacing takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides chandra down the hall coaxing the child as she goes
pinch it chandra
principal gail lauer s sits in uncomfortable silence with bill johansen the something school superintendent
also present are mrs
montes who is a school board member and two other board members
principal gail glances at the clock
montes taps her foot
johansen clears his throat
well i have a full calendar today and im afraid
the door bursts open
letty stumbles into the room
she clutches her briefcase to her chest trying to cover her blood smeared lapel
im so sorry im late
its very nice to meet you
letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with johansen and the others
the superintendent was just getting ready to leave
i do apologize
a student had a crisis
a crisis you say
a bloody nose
there is no response
letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain
a bloody nose of epic proportions
ok miss mayer
a bunch of boys play kickball in a haze of sawdust
chandra sits on a bench clamping an ice pack to her nose
jenny a limber year old hangs upside down from the jungle gym
letty talks on her cell phone
she glances around to monitor her wards eyes darting like a hawks toward the kickball game
no cherry drops jenny
into the phone yes hi
im calling for paul lascher
beat could you tell him its letty
beat he cant
um well tell him tell him that they went for my math idea
letty dials again
she sees two boys fighting over the ball and moves in to break them up
to boys not so rough guys
into phone mom
youll never guess what
ive got the best news
beat no about work
how about dinner
brawl averted out of the corner of her eye letty catches jenny make the daring cherry drop back flip off the bar
she blows a series of angry staccato notes on her whistle
to jenny youre in trouble young lady
into the phone i know mom
but its the only place i can call from
beat can you tell ruth about dinner
beat pauls fine just fine
the class bell buzzes
got to go mom
the monsters call
tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant where the patrons dare speak only in hushed tones
letty sits sipping wine with her mother mrs
martha mayer immaculate in a cream suit young looking for her odd years
lettys sister ruth early s and pretty with flyaway hair and an ever present smile bounds into the restaurant oozing happiness
letty discretely waves her over
sorry im late
letty pours her a glass of wine
letty was just getting ready to tell me her good news
to letty tell tell
leaning toward letty letty dear is that a cat hair on your blouse
letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse
so i got the district to approve my after school math program
ruth smiles at her but vacantly
how wonderful darling
beat what does that mean for you
ill be running it three days a week and
will you get time off to do that
not now but maybe later if they like the program
ruth stares around the restaurant a shit eating grin plastered across her face
to ruth whats up with you
tell me more about the job
to ruth not a job a promotion
no mom its more of a prestige thing
letty passes her hand in front of ruths eyes
just go ahead and tell us
theres nothing to tell
to ruth are you sure dear
tell me about the promotion
well my theory is that people can really enjoy math but they lose interest
ruth cant hold it a moment longer without bursting
almost screaming im getting married
mayers eyes immediately fill with tears
ruth leaps up and hugs her mother
other diners glance toward the table
one woman in the restaurant taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to ruth
other diners follow suit
ruth grins back and starts to giggle
im so happy for you
its just wonderful
mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin
ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned letty
to letty can you believe it
ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse
she slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of letty and her mother who peers at it with approval
tell us every detail
youve only known jake a few months
three and a week
screaming again isnt it great
what about an engagement party
we must start planning
signaling a waiter champagne
girls we need some champagne
off lettys frozen smile we
lettys in bed drawing a giant multiplication chart
paul lascher early s handsome in a corporate way shrugs off his expensive suit
he opens a drawer of lettys dresser and removes a neatly pressed t shirt
he smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process
so another one bites the dust
its not another one
its my sister
beat arent you happy for her
shes only known the guy a few months
paul lays his folded trousers across lettys desk
can i put these here for tonight
pointing to the closet in theres better
beat its kind of romantic dont you think
i really think if youre going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well
paul sits on the bed and leans against a pillow
believe me i know your feelings on the matter
the receptionist said you called earlier about something
letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to paul
my math program
the superintendent said hed fund it
i knew you could do it
paul kisses letty on the cheek
it looks like were both bucking for advancement
huntley told me today that if i come through on the benton deposition they may consider me for senior associate
letty hugs paul
we should celebrate
i was thinking dinner on friday with james and meg at the saint mark
i mean tonight
letty sensually caresses his shoulders
like right now
actually i need to review the deposition questions tonight
but i thought if you dont mind you could listen and see how i come across
letty continues coloring her multiplication chart
letty please i need your full attention
letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter
let me have it
letty rubs her eyes with fatigue
bobby stands next to her holding a crumpled paper bag
my dog ate my turtle and the shell went crunch
i brought it for show and tell
the children perk up at this news
im sorry about your turtle bobby but you know we only have show and tell on mondays
today were scheduled for grammar
but my mom says i have to throw it away tonight
bobby opens the bag
he reaches in to remove the turtle
the children titter
lettys on him in a second
dont even think about it
she grabs the bag
from outside there is a knock
letty and the students look toward the window
shes been crying
she waves to letty
chandra waves back at ruth
letty puts up her finger to signal just a minute to ruth
she sets the turtle bag on bobbys desk
class why dont you
ruth knocks on the glass again
letty glances at her distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door
to class you guys pull out your verb sheets and review them
letty leaves the room
the class watches through the window as ruth throws her sobbing self into lettys arms
she says she wont even come if dad brings monica
mom wont miss your wedding
shell come around
i promise she will
letty glances through the window at her classroom where bobby waves the turtle over his head
ill talk to her and to dad too
beat a few wisely chosen guilt tactics and theyll be ours
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something
letty looks again at the classroom where the students are lobbing the turtle back and forth
you always throw the best dinner parties letty
lettys attention snaps back to ruth
oh wait a minute now i see where youre going
mom and dad
at dinner together
are you crazy
ruth starts to sob big loud air gulping sobs
letty pats her shoulder
maybe it would work
i could throw you an engagement party maybe
principal gail trolling the halls spies letty with ruth
she dispatches a stern look in lettys direction
nodding toward gail you know what ruthie
i better get back to my class ok
and the party
yeah itll be fun
ruth grabs letty in another hug
thank you so much
letty strides into the classroom pulls the turtle away from bobby and drops it in the trash
who can come up here and give me a sentence with a to be verb in it
who was that girl
come on up zach
zach approaches the board and begins to write i am
he doesnt get any further before letty cuts him off
zach begins again but letty stops him when he reaches am
zach you know the line by the a has to come straight down or it looks like an o
zach looks back toward his classmates for help
whats wrong zach
letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an a
she erases it furiously and works at it until the a is perfect
try again zach
letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk
he sees lettys shoes her arm her contorted face and above all else that perfect a staring right back down at him
letty grips zachs arm guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good a
i dont believe it
you still cant do it
im sorry ok miss mayer
no its not ok
youll never get to college on ok
lettys fingers press into zachs arm
a tear slides ominously down his cheek
it has to be good zach
do you understand me
zach wrests free of letty
hes in full cry now
he backs away stumbles then makes a run for his seat
bobby snickers at zachs misfortune
other children glance around unsure confused
letty looks vacantly at the children stares at the board and looks at the children again
she sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands
lettys fists clenched at first slowly relax
she takes a deep breath and raises her head
im very very sorry zach
zach continues to cry
letty looks down at her desk
she grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste
you know what guys
wednesdays not a grammar day
its a collage day
its a collage on the wall day
letty jumps up
she slaps the paper on the wall with some paste
she motions for the students to join her
the children slowly approach her
zach lags behind
zach i want you to be in charge of paste
letty lies in bed
the alarm clock blasts opera
letty fumbles for the switch
she cant turn it off
she yanks out the cord
letty gets out of bed walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings
she goes to the kitchen and snaps off the alarm then heads down the hallway and shuts that alarm off as well
letty hurries back to her bedroom and crawls into bed
paul toweling his hair dry walks in
what are you doing
youre going to be late
im calling in sick
paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to lettys forehead
you dont have a fever
i dont feel like going to work today
wont it be hard for them to get a substitute this late
itll be ok
but what about that math project
paul i just cant go
is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime
forget i asked
beat im just
im so tired lately
maybe you ought to see a doctor
no its not like that
letty starts to cry
its just ive got those parent conferences and im supposed to set up the math program by next week
letty contd and shopping for ruths dress and that that engagement dinner
you can get out of the dinner
no i cant
ive already convinced both mom and dad to come
come on letty
itll get done
paul touches lettys shoulder
she pulls away from him
i dont think so
of course it will
remember the big talent show you planned last year
and what about the christmas benefit when santa canceled at the last minute
but you still pulled it off
you just need to get more organized
lets make a list of the things you need to do ok
letty nods her head and paul grabs a legal pad from his briefcase
anderson over eager parents sit across the desk from letty who stares at the legal pad in her lap
as the andersons talk letty twists a lock of hair tighter and tighter
so at home weve started our own little library for chandra
we thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card catalogue
letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her hair
but what im wondering is whether we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home
what do you think
because we dont want her to get behind her classmates
and we trust your opinion
chandras always talking about miss mayer
just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose
and she went on and on about the collage
that seems very inventive miss mayer
letty stares blankly at the couple
what the fuck
its my job
andersons raised eyebrow we
the room is a mess of scattered papers and the math twister game
letty sits on the ground crying
she makes a pyramid out of the wadded up tissues that surround her
the upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots of signs announcing sale day
frenzied women pick through dresses as pachelbels canon plays in the background
letty is wedged into a corner sipping coffee
a clerk approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries
rooting through the tray no more bear claws left
ruth bounces into the shop
to ruth danish
oh no thanks im too excited to eat
the clerk gives ruth an approving smile as letty rips into a sweet roll
ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns
to letty wheres mommy
do you have to call her mommy
wheres the old bag i sometimes call mommy
she said shed be here at
ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up
what do you think of this one
id have to see it on
ruth looks closer at letty
have you been crying
your eyes are all puffy
letty self consciously touches her eyes
things have been kind of stressful lately
but everythings ok
ruth is trying on a veil at this point
yeah everythings under control
what about the engagement party
everythings ready for tomorrow night except the artillery
thanks so much for planning it letty
jakes really looking forward to it
letty sighs moves to the racks and pulls out a dress
you better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones
uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as letty picks up discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up
what about this one
with sisterly pride you look beautiful
martha mayer is led in by the clerk
look mom i think ive found the dress
you look just wonderful ruthie
but i really think you should try on a few more dont you
letty and ruth shoot each other a look of doom
a bedraggled letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at dresses
they are bumped and jostled from all sides
has paul heard about his promotion
no not yet
but you know paul
hes sure to get it
ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown
i dont like the bias cut on that one
mayer holds up an ornate dress
i cant stand to try on one more dress
letty i think this would be beautiful on you
paul could pop the question at any time
especially with a promotion in the offing
go on letty
i want to see it on you
to ruth do you think i should
itll be fun
letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room
letty emerges from the dressing room
letty peers around the corner becoming a tad frantic
but neither her mother nor ruth is to be found
its just letty resplendent in ecru satin
i think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes
letty pushes back her veil sits down on the floor and takes a sip of her now cold coffee
a house and garden picture of elegance
letty paul ruth and jake stand at nervous attention decked out in their sunday best
a knock marks the first arrival
letty opens the door to her mother who does a quick reconnaissance of the room
i gather hes late as usual
to her mother can i get you a glass of champagne
the doorbell rings
letty greets her father a mid s business type and his wife monica a younger version of lettys mother
hi dad monica
im so glad you could come
suddenly the parents are face to face letty standing between them
mom this is monica
monica my mother martha
the two mrs
mayers make appropriate murmurs
lettys parents stare each other down
ruth shifts from foot to foot
silence falls in the room with a thump
dad mother youve met before right
ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air
the evening hangs in the balance
finally howve you been martha
mayer and monica cozy up to each other on the love seat while mrs
mayer ruth and paul sit on the opposite couch
letty passes hors doeuvres and jake doles out napkins
its mushroom time folks
biting into one i like the touch of cilantro
it is cilantro isnt it
you can always call it dad
you must get your cooking skills from your father letty
uncomfortable silence falls on the party
monica wipes the edge of mr
mayers mouth with her napkin
ruths narrowed the dress hunt down to two dad
tell me about them
ones a silk
not in front of jake ruthie
its bad luck
ruth looks at letty nervously
i remember how hard it was looking for my dress
i must have been to stores
mayer clears her throat
you know what i think we need
how about martinis to celebrate
that might be nice
as long as you have
would i forget
beat a round of martinis coming right up
letty leaves with paul hot on her heels
letty shakes the martinis while paul gets out the glasses
ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to letty
how can i help
paul can you hand me the olives
ruth i need you to what was it
what about the souffle
has that gone in
yeah i just put it in
but the squab i think that needs to be basted
paul hands letty the olive bottle
to ruth kind of icy in there
to paul thank god we have alcohol
letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis
bits of fleck rise from the olives then swim to the tops of the glasses
whats the matter
letty grabs the olive bottle
letty stands still fixated on the olive bottle
l olives aux herbes de provence
i got the wrong kind of olives
ruth holds up a glass
whats all the dreck
in a sarcastic french accent les herbes
itll be fine
theyve got to be puglia olives packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesnt overpower the palate
the three turn on him
you cant leave them alone
get back in there
are you nuts
jake whirls around and exits
letty looks for olives banging open the cupboards one after the other
quicker and quicker
more and more frantic
mayer monica and mrs
mayer stare at each other listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the kitchen
what do you think of those lakers
letty paws through her purse
what are you doing
wild eyed can you loan me a
im going to the store
i think youre overreacting
letty turns her best school marm look on paul
he hands over a crisp bill
letty dinners almost ready
ill be back before you can say souffle
letty leaves from the kitchens back door
ruth heads to the living room
paul leans wearily against the counter savoring one of the herb filled martinis
fluorescent lights beat down on letty
she races through the aisles
she clutches her keys in one hand a bill in the other
letty careens around a corner
at the last second she avoids smacking into another shopper
shelf after shelf of olives
letty darts up and down the aisle searching searching
letty scurries to the front of the store
she taps a store clerk on the shoulder
six people waiting in line mutter annoyed
i cant find martini olives
all you have are black
without looking up aisle a
letty whips down an aisle
she starts to sweat
an old lady blocks her path
excuse me miss
i cant reach the cat food
she reaches up and hands the woman a can of food
and a turkey and giblets too please
she does like her turkey
letty grabs another can throws it in the old ladys cart and darts away while the old lady continues to talk
the sign for aisle a
lots of them
lettys shoulders relax
she scans the shelf
lettys pov labels of olives big small with pimentos without
none from puglia italy
letty zooms back to the front of the store
to the clerk
theyre not there
i need the ones from puglia
she gets no response from the clerk who counts change for a customer
letty gestures wildly with her hands
theyre the ones that are packed in brine but they dont overpower the you know the palate
without looking up specialty foods
lettys off again
to the land of pink peppercorns dehydrated mushrooms and chinese spice
but no olives
not a single bottle
letty paws through the shelves knocking things over as she scours the aisle
she is oblivious to the mess that surrounds her
an employee with a price checker walks half way down the aisle
he spots letty and rushes away
where are they
where are they
more and more items crash to the ground
letty is beyond frenzied
manager to b
where are they
letty pounds her fist against the shelf
more goods fall
the manager rushes toward letty
whats wrong miss
tell me where they are
she knocks over a bottle of fat free lingonberry preserves
it crashes to the floor spewing jam
i think you should go now
i need my olives
its time to leave
the manager places his hand on the small of lettys back as if to guide her out of the store
letty backs away
the manager grabs hold of her wrist
letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand
she pushes him away
he staggers against the opposite shelf
customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle riveted by the spectacle
wheres security please
letty takes her arm and slides a shelf full of products onto the floor
they crash and break
fucking fucking olives
two security guards turn the corner
letty spots them
one creeps closer
no no no
guard one continues to approach cooing encouragingly
letty throws a jar at him
it clips him in the head
he turns away bleeding
guard two pulls out a billy club
yelling call police
she turns around
guard two walks toward her
his stance suggests hes stalking a wild animal
letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her skirt
she looks to both ends of the aisle
faces dozens and dozens of faces stare down at her
one boy laughs
letty backs against the shelf
she slides down it until she is sitting on the floor
she buries her head in her knees sobbing
the room is furnished like a hyatt hotel minus anything you might use to kill yourself
michael mid s in jeans and t shirt sits in a chair next to the bed
he looks intently at letty checks his watch and taps her on the shoulder
everythings a morning blur
gradually items come into focus the intercom for the nurse the door with a window in it the three tissue boxes on the bedside table
its a hospital all right
lettys vision is filled suddenly by michaels concerned face peering into hers
i know youve had a rough night but i have a few questions for you miss mayer or letitia
letty pulls herself up to a sitting position
do you mind if i call you letitia
consulting his notes first off letty can you tell me where you are
i answered these questions last night
i know this can be a real drag but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the
hillview psychiatric hospital
now letty id like you to remember three items
im going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes
they are chair cup and ball
did you get that
ok lets subtract from a succession of numbers starting with
sorry this makes me nervous
its not a pass fail kind of thing
letty smiles uncomfortably
now the three things i asked you to remember
chair cup and ball
letty smiles a real smile this time
let me shift gears here a minute
beat do you ever hear voices that other people dont hear or see things they dont
what about patterns
do you find yourself checking and re checking locks
or washing your hands over and over again
letty shakes her head no
how about arranging your possessions in a certain way
go right ahead
sometimes my food and my clothes and my underwear
michael leans closer
how do you sort it by lace and cotton
what if its got a pattern
is this really important
because i dont think its a problem
looking at his notes how long has it been since youve done something youve enjoyed letty
beat a while i guess
that must be really difficult
letty tears up
michael puts his hand lightly on her arm
hey itll be ok
well make sure of that
letty gives him an appreciative look
for now why dont you just take it easy while i confer with my colleagues
a nurse should be in shortly
letty dressed and made up sits rigidly on the bed
she writes in her organizer
robert emlee early s and in jeans enters with his own organizer
emlee and i have some questions to ask you
i did this already
its hospital policy
to be interviewed every hour
im the only doctor making rounds this morning
well i dont have hallucinations
this doctor was he tall with dark hair
yeah and a dimple
emlee shifts uncomfortably
im afraid lhes not a doctor
psychologist therapist whatever
michael the man who came to see you is a patient
what kind of place is this
i apologize for the inconvenience but i must ask you some
i want to see my mother immediately
we discourage family visits for the first hours after an emotional trauma like the kind youve experienced
i dont think you understand
i wont wait
youll have to
your family agreed to the conditions not to see you when they admitted you to hillview letitia
beat we can talk about how that makes you feel but we cant change the rules
letty sinks back on her pillows the wind knocked out of her
stones evaluation from last night indicates youre experiencing a great deal of anxiety probably related to depression
emlee continues to talk
his words become more and more distant as the ringing in lettys head grows louder
we need to talk about starting you on drug therapy
most depressive personalities benefit from a drug like prozac or maybe zoloft
its a bigger version of a waiting room youd find in a doctors office
and it has more games
some patients watch television
others play pool
several form a group around michael who holds the same notebook he used in his session with letty
john unkempt in a bathrobe hands him a few ratty dollar bills
im in for for manic depressive
thomas late s and in a suit waves a bill at michael
ill go with that as well
michael takes the money and turns to marie late s
to john and thomas you two always bet manic depressive
to michael tell me more about the guard she strangled
no just hit in the head
what about voices
does she hear voices
not that she admits to
is she a washer
no but she is exceptionally organized
she arranges her underwear by color
michael motions to mrs
hallstrom mid s who shuffles by
hallstrom you want in
all tapped out
ill float you
hallstrom keeps walking
to michael its been weeks since she played
what about you marie
handing michael a bill ill say major depression complicated by obsessive compulsive disorder
beat and could i get my change in ones
letty lags behind nurse gates early s and in civilian clothes as they walk down the hall
treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board
dinner at lights out at and no fraternizing between patients
pointing as she goes thats the rec room
we show movies there on wednesdays and fridays
and this is the dining hall
letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room an upscale version of a college cafeteria
groups of people eat and talk
a paper airplane sails from one table to another
im really not that hungry
just eat whatever you want
this will give you a chance to meet some people
you know my moms coming to get me tomorrow
ill be leaving
its ok letty
ill be right here with you
nurse gates guides letty to a table where john mrs
hallstrom marie and thomas sit
so i said to my publisher this afternoon i said dont you even interrupts hi gang
i want to introduce you to letty
to letty letty this is mrs
hallstrom and marie and john and thomas
to letty just discussing my pesky publisher
may i ask what you do when youre not vacationing
to thomas let the poor girl get some food for heavens sake
im a teacher
as you may have gathered im a writer
thomas ignores him
hallstrom stares down at her plate
i dont like to say novelist
that sounds a little grandiose but i am on my third novel and
excuse me for interrupting thomas but we really should get some food
nurse gates leads letty to a table and hands her a plate
letty looks up to see michael at the other end of the table doing a card trick for two other patients
to patients now im going to say that the card you picked was the ace of spades
he flips the top card up and its the ace of spades
the patients chortle
michael turns toward the nurse
michael this is letty
she just arrived yesterday
letty stares at michael coldly
to michael i missed you during rounds this morning
letty turns and leaves carrying her empty plate with her
to michael this doctor thing has got to stop
nurses gates hurries after letty
letty stands outside the waiting room door
she tucks her blouse into her jeans and enters
lettys mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that looks much like the library of an english country manor
she springs up as soon as she spots letty
they rush to each other
lettys mother strokes her hair
im here sweetheart
its going to be ok
im so sorry
oh letty what happened
mom i was there and i just i was so
letty contd they didnt have the olives and i i got so upset
i dont know how it happened
ive talked to doctor emlee and he says
im so glad to see you
you cant believe the people in here
theyve got patients posing as doctors
everyone says its the best facility in the area for this sort of thing
i just want to go home
can we go home now
i think the best thing for you right now is to stay here and get well
maybe i should talk about this with ruth or paul
we all agree with the doctor dear
he thinks its safer for you to stay here for a while
letty listens waits cant absorb it
you all really think i need to be here
but what about beast
ruths already taken him home
and my class
itll be hard to find a good substitute
and what about my math program
paul said hed call the school
beat and your father thinks hes convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help
for his injuries
i guess you
i guess he got hit in the head
mayer holds out a duffel bag to letty
i packed up some of your clothes and i can bring whatever else you need
letty refuses to accept the duffel bag
her mother sets it on the floor and stands
letty is five again
mom no please dont go
lettys mother holds her
mayer crying pulls away from letty
she kisses her daughter on the cheek
ill see you soon
as soon as dr
lettys mother walks out the door
letty stares after her
letty crying unpacks her duffel bag laboriously smoothing and refolding every item she puts in the drawer
finishing her task letty goes to the mirror and stares at her reflection
finally she fixes her makeup
letty leaves her room
we follow her footsteps down the hallway
in the distance letty sees the rec room
she hears the clamor of voices
every step is agony
letty stops herself just before entering trying to collect herself
four people bet ocd and clinical depression so i split the pool
yeah her diagnosis was no mystery
especially the ocd
sick realization spreads over lettys face
fuck i mean anyone who color codes her panties has big problems
michael rounds the corner
he stops when he sees her falters recovers his composure
theyre showing groundhog day if you
you took bets on my diagnosis
its no big deal
we all compare
voice rising ho do you think you are
patients are grouped in front of the tv watching bill murray
heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway
not even a moments hesitation before one by one they get up and hurry to the hall
john marie and others gather around the fighters
dont take it personally
you have no right no right to take the worst thing thats ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game
stop acting like youre someone special
youre just like the rest of us
im not the one whos masquerading as a doctor
im not the one whos whos
to letty hes schizophrenic
im not the one whos schizophrenic
i dont see people who arent there or run around acting crazy
letty pounds her fist against the wall
come on michael
oh no youre perfectly sane
thats why youre here
letty looks like shes been slapped
she thinks for a moment
the patients wait breathless for her retort
go fuck yourself
michael grins at letty
she turns and strides down the hall
theres a smattering of applause
it grows stronger
we see lettys eyes fill with tears as behind her the patients yell
letty unable to sleep tosses and turns
she gets out of bed and paces the room nervously trying to hold herself together
she slumps to the floor and starts to cry
emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs
michael who sits next to emlee practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers
letty sits across from michael and emlee her legs and arms crossed tightly
the group concentrates on mrs
i cant stop thinking about the things i did wrong when my daughter was little
and hows that make you feel
i just feel like sleeping
all the time
hells bells you can count me in on that
i havent had enough zs since i ran those sleep disorder experiments at stanford back in the s
we really miss doing things with you mrs
michael sitting next to mrs
hallstrom squeezes her arm
maybe when i hit my manic phase again
group members smile
ive noticed letty doesnt much like to do things with us
the group looks expectantly at letty
of course i do
then why are you so defensive
to john i dont think we need to sacrifice letty to pep up a slow session
to michael youre the one who told everyone about her panties
michael grimaces at john
lettys head is bent down
maybe youd like to share some of your feelings about ocd or depression with us letty
letty eyes the doctor
shes dangerously close to tears
do we have to talk about this
i think in the spirit of group therapy its beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others
michael reaches his hand behind dr
emlees head catching lettys eye in the process
michael pulls a silver dollar out of emlees ear
letty looks but doesnt respond
the other patients ignore michael
emlee is oblivious
you never know letty how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems
michael goes for a bigger trick
reaching again behind the doctors head he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers
letty almost against her will smiles
by revealing something thats going on in his or her own life
michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctors head
lettys smile broadens
responding to her smile there now i knew youd feel better once we discussed group process
lets talk a little about your ocd
letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks
michael turns the corner thumbing through a dog eared book
letty spots him and moves away
michael sidles up next to her
looking for a romance
what are you looking to read
michael holds out his book to her
this is good
letty glances at the title magic tricks
but youre checking it out
ive already checked it out times
michael reaches behind letty
she pulls away
he produces a scarf from behind her back and presents it to her
she doesnt take it
you keep the book
im looking for emily dickinson
letty walks away
hey if you take the magic book ill feel like maybe you accept my apology and dont hate me anymore
i havent heard an apology
michael drops to one knee
im really sorry i hurt your feelings
i got a little carried away
can you ever forgive me
letty takes the book from him and walks away
letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden
her attention is drawn to a nearby couch where michael sits opposite mrs
hallstrom apparently playing cards
michael lays a card down
hallstrom im pretty sure you could use that
she shakes her head slowly back and forth
michael places it in her hand of cards
now dont you have a gin rummy mrs
beat go ahead now just lay those cards down
hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch
i told you so
youre three games up on me
michael catches letty watching them and letty quickly looks away
letty opens her drawer to pull out a t shirt
several are rumpled
she starts refolding them when she spots it
there nestled among her clothes is a book of emily dickinsons poetry
letty picks it up runs her hand over the cover and starts reading
paul and letty walk onto a postcard perfect stone terrace overlooking the garden
paul pulls up a chair for letty and stares out at the scenery
its prettier here than i thought it would be
yeah i guess its all right
are you all right
thats a big question
i hope it wasnt something i did
something you did
that put you in here
of course not no
beat is that why youre here
i think we need to talk about some things
yes i suppose so
this has been really difficult this whole thing
paul contd these past few weeks its made me really go back and examine our whole relationship
beat i mean weve been going out for four years and it hasnt always been so easy
especially this last year
softly especially now
so ive been thinking a lot
i have too paul
i talked to ruth a little bit and i think its about time
we cant just keep going through the motions
its time to make decisions
you dont have to say anything else
ive known for a while that this was coming
i just wish wed done it sooner
paul takes lettys hand in his
will you marry me
paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on lettys finger
she stares at it mesmerized
i had to smuggle it in here
i guess youre not really supposed to have jewelry
by rote or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients
i hope you like it
its a marquis cut
they had one with emeralds around it but this was simpler more classic in its lines
its its really nice paul
you can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want
no youve done a perfect job
so what do you say let
letty looks him in the eyes for the first time
do you think really that its ok to get engaged when im in here
well save the formal announcement for when youre out
i already told your mother
i hope you dont mind
so will you
working up a smile of course
paul and letty kiss then hug
its completely dark
letty sits in the same position we saw her in hours ago
michael walks up to her
you missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner
i wasnt hungry
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs
i was getting tired of watching him try every night
was it bad news the visit from peter
he looked pretty serious
he asked me to marry him
very romantic setting
it was romantic
hes very romantic
so are you engaged or what
letty holds out her hand where the diamond glistens
michael bends forward to look at the ring caressing her hand as he does so
letty pulls away
the ring is gone
what have you done with the ring
letty stands up
this isnt funny
paul would kill me
michael holds his hands in fists toward letty
guess which hand
enough with the abracadabra
he left one
michael opens his hand
michael addresses an imaginary audience
to audience the fair maiden guesses incorrectly
should we give her one more try
to letty the audience says one more try
what guess you now
the right one
michael opens his right hand
a plastic cracker jack ring rests in it
come on michael
michael grabs lettys hand and slides the ring onto her finger
with this ring i thee
letty pulls her hand away
really this isnt funny
ok ok ill give it back
letty holds out her hand
for a price
a small price
i wont do your portion of kitchen cleanup
and im not covering for you when you sneak out to call dominos
i want a kiss
letty stares at him
michael moves close to her
letty looks into his eyes
softly everythings a joke with you
michael and letty kiss long and deep
letty pulls back
she gazes at michael
she steps closer to him
they kiss again longer and deeper
letty looks ready for another kiss
michael caresses her cheek
he walks back toward the hospital door
he stops comes back to letty
he hands her the diamond ring
he walks inside
letty watches him go
emlee and letty sit across from each other
the medicines still bothering me
it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain
well see about adjusting the dosage if that doesnt clear in the next week
beat how are other things going
i think ive told you all the news
lets see the engagement
oh and my sisters coming to visit me and they say my cat misses me
the question letty is how are you feeling
i miss beast a lot too
a christmas carol blasts through the intercom system
hark the herald angels sing
michael bolts awake
he stumbles out of bed in wildly striped boxers and races toward the hall
doors open like kernels of popcorn exploding
michael marie thomas john then letty
the music blares on
nurse gates runs down the hall and shouts to michael
what are you doing
yelling not me
the music lowers
hallstrom in a santa cap appears
she distributes erasers as she threads through the patients
candy canes are out of season
hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse
come with me mrs
nurse gates leads mrs
hallstrom away as the older woman continues tossing erasers down the hall
marie stares at michaels shorts
michael smiles awkwardly at letty
she returns to her room
letty climbs into bed
she opens the bedside drawer and pulls out a tiffanys ring box
there cradled in the satin lining is the diamond from paul
right beside it is michaels cracker jack special
letty puts on pauls ring
she studies her hand
with an air of secrecy she slips on michaels ring
she quickly takes it off
wearing pauls ring she turns off the light and snuggles into bed
afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned hedges and tea roses
letty and ruth power walk down a cobblestone path heading away from the english tudor hospital that looms large in the background
letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the university of south carolina cocks
i cant believe you finally gave me the shirt
and its only til you get out of here
that settles it
im never leaving
i can hardly wait til youre free
planning the wedding without you has been a disaster
picking up the pace mom and i fought for minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white
letty checks her stop watch
what do you think
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print
letty completely stops and faces ruth
do we have to talk wedding details
oh no of course not
i mean you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses
but its been so long since weve seen each other
besides we should be talking about your engagement
they start walking again
tell me more about beast beating up that other cat
bloody furry mess like i said
beat arent you so excited about paul
ruth stops this time
whats going on with you letty
ruthie do you ever wonder if youll meet someone else
someone besides jake
power walkings forgotten
ruth and letty start to amble
whats his name letty
i didnt say
dont even try
whats his name
nurse gates passes by the open door and pokes her head in
lights out letty
letty closes the door
she pulls a nightshirt from a drawer disrupting a perfectly folded t shirt
letty bends down to straighten it but changes her mind
she shuts the drawer
letty puts on the nightshirt crawls into bed and snaps off the light
she fluffs her pillow and turns over
she rolls back
letty turns on the light
she goes to the drawer opens it pulls out the t shirt and refolds it
she shuts the drawer
letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork
its a fight with the drawer
opened and closed
until letty takes a deep breath pulls it open a final time hesitantly ruffles the t shirt and slams the drawer shut
she runs to bed and hops in turning off the light and burying her head under the pillow
a few moments pass
a knock on the door
letty opens it to find michael
were supposed to be asleep
michael takes lettys hand and pulls her toward the door
well get caught
no rounds for another three hours
michael checks the hallway and pulls letty into it
worried youre not fit for a caper of epic proportions
dont be ridiculous
rendezvous at the closet in
letty forges ahead to the nurses station while michael turns a corner in the hall peeking out so he can watch letty approach nurse gates
letty you should be in bed
theres a spider in my room
its got a green dot on its back
i cant go to sleep with it watching me
i guess we better check it out
letty and nurse gates walk down the hall to lettys room passing the alcove where michael lurks in the shadows
he sneaks into the main hall and pads up to the nurses station
michael wanders around the desk crouches on the floor so he cant be seen from the hallway and pulls the phone down to his level
extra large pepperoni and mushrooms
beat and two cokes
beat hillview psychiatric hospital on glenfield
off the fourth street exit
michael reaches up to a hook and grabs a white lab coat
he puts on the coat which identifies him as val williams
letty and nurse gates sprawled on their stomachs peer under the bed
it had this red spot on its back
green and red
nurse gates looks letty squarely in the eye
i dont know why you feel you have to lie letty
if you feel lonely or need to talk all you have to do is say so
beat well ok that might be good
i understand you just got engaged
maybe thats where we should start
off lettys look of dismay we michael pays the dominos pizza man and tries to walk past the guard jim who blocks his path
im afraid i cant let you take that in without the proper invoice
its a pizza
all the same rules are rules
you dont understand
this is a very important very special morale boosting pizza
what i understand is how low morale gets when youre posted at a guard station all night val
reluctantly michael opens the pizza box and jim helps himself to two slices
michael starts to shut the box
jim reaches in for a third slice
letty and nurse gates sit cross legged on the bed facing each other
lettys face is puffy from crying
i dont mean to go on and on like this
its good to let it out
michael passes the open door with the pizza box and points down the hall
letty stares right through him
did you ever tell paul how you felt
he was graduating from law school and he just assumed i was ok with dropping out
beat we never really talked about it
but i know he was disappointed in me
the roomy closet houses an inconceivable number of white sheets and towels arranged on wide tall shelves
the pizza cokes and a candle sit in the middle of the floor which michael has draped with a sheet
michael stares at the dwindling candle
c i mean im just not sure i want the same things now that i did even a month ago
nurse gates nods sympathetically
is that so wrong
michael passes the open door again waving his hands wildly to attract lettys attention
she doesnt notice him
you can only do what feels best to you now
i guess so
i think thats right
michael blows out the candle
letty blows her nose as she walks nurse gates to the door
youve been so great
i just feel a lot clearer about things
and if i need to talk again
yes of course
whenever you want
letty gives nurse gates a hug
taps on the door
michael looks up
he jumps to his feet and lets letty in gesturing for her to sit
they lean against a stack of pillows
sorry im late
michael puts his finger to lettys lips
the two munch on pizza
michael picks off black olives and hands them to letty who plops them on top of her pizza
michael hands letty a cigarette
she gestures no
he lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings
michael offers letty pizza
she clutches her stomach to show that shes full
letty indicates she wants a cigarette
michael demonstrates how to smoke affecting the style of a s movie star
letty follows suit
letty grabs a pillow and hits michael over the head
he pulls the pillow away from her
letty stands up grabs another pillow and hits michael again
he whacks her in the back of the knees and she falls on top of him
enough of the fighting
michael strokes the back of lettys neck
footsteps approach the door and stop
michael and letty stop kissing and look at the door
the footsteps continue on
michael pulls lettys shirt up
she starts to pull it over her head but cant get it all the way off in the cramped space
michael kisses lettys mouth through the shirt
michael helps letty off with the shirt
he kisses her chest
letty bites him lightly on the shoulder
michael pulls away in surprise grinning
letty reaches up and bites him again
michael bites her back
letty reaches her hands behind her head searching for something to hold onto
she grabs a stack of sheets which topple onto michael
michael sits up trying to clear the sheets off himself and letty
letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him
close on her hands as they unbutton michaels levis and we mrs
hallstrom sits close to the television watching joan rivers hawk jewelry on the home shopping network
michael drapes the room with streamers and surveys his work
hows it look
theyre coming to the cubic zirconium
i like those sapphire earrings myself
i bet my daughter would love those too
michael sees letty pass by the room as she heads down the hall
he follows her
marie enters with her toothbrush and toothpaste
she moves towards the sink but stops as
giggles come from the stall
she looks closer sees two pairs of feet and one familiar pair of boxers
just get a room
marie walks out
letty and michael partially disrobed and hugging each other tight burst into guffaws
letty sits on the couch
emlee leans forward in his chair
i think its a problem that you never told me about michael
i had to hear it from another patient
i couldnt really say anything because of that fraternizing rule
well letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital
im a grown woman dr
i can take care of myself
what about michael
do you know the extent of his
i know michaels a schizophrenic and mrs
hallstroms manic depressive and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur
go ahead and put the guard back up letty
but you need to know what youre dealing with
i dont need a lecture
i care about michael
then thats even more reason to listen
look schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality
they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes
emlee contd beat you could be lying next to michael in bed one night and he could have a hallucination or a delusion
it might happen when youre driving or
look i know hes almost through with treatment here
and hes on medication
drugs can help suppress symptoms
but lots of patients stop taking them when theyre on their own because the side effects are so harsh
beat and michaels condition is often worsened by periods of stress
hes been in and out of
i dont want to hear anymore
id like you to promise you wont carry on a relationship with michael
otherwise ill consider moving one of you to another ward
first you tell me to do what i want to then you tell me to stop
all i want you to do is think about whats best for you
really think about it
letty lies in the middle of a copse of trees reading emily dickinson
michael walks up and hands her a dandelion
a daisy for the lady
the lady knows this is a dandelion
a rose is a rose
letty kisses him on the cheek
whereve you been all day
back to back sessions with the shrink
im not allowed to see you anymore
i had to sneak by the guards to get here
they say youre highly unstable have a depressive personality and may hold back my own recovery
im bad news
whats my rap
schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions
thats all true
my thoughts go haywire sometimes
what are the delusions like
i think people are after me crap like that
michael contd when i was my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table
i thought i was god
he waits for letty to register the information
but i took out a whole grocery store
i wish i could have seen that
im starting to think that everyones crazy to some extent
y grandma rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil and they grow right up to the sun tall and straight
other trees they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light
beat but even though they end up crooked theyre still trees just like the straight ones
lying on their backs michael and letty stare up at the leaves overhead
with a start why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors
thats no way for us to break up
michael and letty hug
nurse gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles into little paper cups
a federal express delivery man with a bunch of boxes stops at the station
i need a signature please
nurse gates looks at the form
what is all this stuff
i just deliver it maam
well who exactly is it for
can you wait a moment
nurse gates locks the medication in a cupboard and hurries down the hallway
our usual cast of characters
but how does that make you feel john what letty said about your hostility
she doesnt know what the hell shes talking about
nurse gates barrels in
the group looks up
im sorry doctor
i just need a moment with mrs
what seems to be the problem
they say she ordered
hallstrom did you order a bunch of stuff because federal express
hallstroms face glows
its here everyone
she runs out
nurse gates follows her
a moment passes
the patients look expectantly at dr
oh fine lets see
they storm the door
by the time the patients round the corner the federal express man is leaving and mrs
hallstrom has ripped open one of the boxes
she clutches a handful of jewelry
for you john
and michael i know youll love these
she hands michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings
he clips them on
letty and several others carry necklaces
thomas sports a rhinestone tiara
the patients compare jewelry
hallstrom you ordered all this
hallstrom thomas got a crown and all i got was a lousy bracelet
you must have spent thousands of dollars
dont worry doctor i didnt forget you
hallstrom hands dr
emlee a fake ruby hair comb
hallstrom you cant possibly afford to pay for this
it must go back
chatter in the hallway stops
why no doctor
most of its for my daughter lily
shes coming to family day tomorrow
all the way from cleveland with my grandson
beat you cant be taking away their welcome to california presents
its going back
well contact the company this afternoon
to patients take the jewelry off please
the patients reluctantly remove their gifts
but i have to keep something for my daughter
lets go back to group and discuss it there
back to group everyone
the patients head back to group
emlee turns to nurse gates
to nurse gates increase her lithium to milligrams three times a day
oh and nurse lets see about canceling the cable
the place buzzes with festivity
a welcome families sign hangs from a patio beam
a table is laden with cookies and lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls
letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where michael plays frisbee with his family even his grandmother rosa
nurse gates walks up to letty
your mothers in the rec room letty
letty passes mrs
hallstrom who sits by herself holding one small gift on her lap
letty spots her mom across the room and walks up to her
her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric
its so good to see you sweetheart
you too mom
youre looking good
a little thin but good
letty examines a fabric sample
thanks so much for doing this
ruthie and jake are up to a million things
and i just cant decide
letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color
which flowers did you order
i wanted to talk that over with you too
oh ok well better to choose the table cloths first anyway
was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask
letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow
this would complement the blue in the brides maids dresses
wheres your ring sweetheart
we arent allowed to wear jewelry in here mom
just think pretty soon well be doing all these wedding preparations for you
beat of course if thats what you still want
ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here
letty pulls out a cigarette lights it and starts smoking
i havent had a crush since i was
when did you start smoking
ill put it out if it bothers you
the puckering dear
it doesnt seem so now but in time it will cause wrinkles around the mouth
letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel
she bends over the fabrics
you know your life isnt about being in a mental hospital
i hear this michael fellow is schizophrenic
dont forget that pauls a promising young attorney who loves you very much
mom look if i want to dump paul ill dump him
if i want to screw michael or live with him or marry him then ill do that
thomas who sits across the room looks up from his book
whispering im only looking out for you
yelling and if i want to smoke ill fucking smoke
letty races out the door and into the garden
in the distance michael spots her and jogs over
lettys mother watches them
thomas approaches mrs
mayer im sorry but i couldnt help overhearing
i just wanted to say not that its any of my business
i think really i think id go with the cream damask
letty and michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall
nurse gates bends down in front of mrs
hallstrom who sits where we last saw her
its ok to be upset
why of course not
my goodness no
im sure she just got hung up
letty and michael stop
hallstrom why dont you join my family for dinner
youll love my grandma rosa
thats so sweet michael
but really ive so many things to do
if you change your mind well be in the dining hall
michael and letty walk on exchanging a sad look
santucci and mrs
santucci sit at the heads of the table
letty sits between rosa and michael
to letty what do you need now
santucci send down the lamb
this girls as thin as a stick
tell her to eat frank
whispering to letty you cant turn down grandma rosas lamb
or my eggplant
i make the best eggplant in l
the mozzarella i use its so fresh it sweats
letty heaps more food on her plate
michael says youre a teacher
im hoping ill still have a job when i get out
hallstrom walks into the room wearing her christmas stocking cap
she starts to dispense erasers
whats she doing
hallstrom practically skipping zeros in on grandma rosa
she hands rosa the gift meant for her daughter
rosa rosa you must have this rosa
hallstrom join us
but by this point mrs
hallstroms already bounded away divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children
she clambers onto a table in the middle of the room
marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help
merry christmas to all
ho ho ho ho
michael weve got to stop her
michael pushes back his chair
hes trapped between the table and the wall
my goodness its so very warm in here
she takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man
but she doesnt stop there
with haphazard abandon she begins to disrobe first her blouse then her skirt
way way way too warm for december
now lets sing jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
the group looks on in horror mesmerized by her behavior
then almost as one the patients spring into action
michael bolts over his dining table and runs to mrs
he jumps onto her table trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her
by this time john thomas and letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave
michael sets mrs
hallstrom on the ground
she looks up at the group and continues belting out jingle bells
letty and michael lie on the floor next to each other trading puffs on a cigarette
the glowing ember is the only light in the room
you must have thought about it
i just want to see beast
beat where would you go
the mission up in santa barbara
thats where i always go when i get out
my dad used to take me there when i was little
its totally quiet
and you can see the ocean for miles
they smoke for a while
what else would you do
id like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together
and wed get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper
and wed eat spaghetti os in bed from the can
how can you even mention spaghetti os after eating grandma rosas dinner tonight
i have a terrible confession
tell the doctor
i dont like lamb
michael sits up
then its over
michael lies down
its a good thing my family loves you
your family just met me
i guess i was projecting
what i should have said is its a good thing i love you
you dont have to say anything
but i do
i love you too
michael and letty lie still looking into each others eyes
osters of harry houdini and doug henning
handcuffs and card decks all over
your honor i feel i should be released
im sufficiently able to look after
his eyes glaze over
his head darts toward the corner of the room
to the corner what
nothing at all
but michael keeps staring
a knock on the door
michaels eyes refocus
he opens the door to find letty
john and nurse gates are waiting for you
how do i look
straightening his tie great
i came to tell you to break a leg and to give you this for good luck
letty hands him the cracker jack ring
michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a dozen other patients from various institutions
nurse gates sits a few rows back near johns mother and michaels family mr
santucci and grandma rosa
judge milton s questions john whos on the stand
why have you petitioned to leave the institution
i havent had an episode in more than a month sir
how do you plan to support yourself
my familys helping me out your honor
where will you live upon release
johns mother nods encouragingly at him
where do you plan to reside mr
with my mother
is your mother here today
john points to her
johns mother waves at the judge
thats the bitch
that cock sucking bitch
she put me here
shes the satan that did this all
as bailiffs remove john from the stand michael offers a wan smile to his family
michael outwardly poised and collected sits on the stand
his hands are clenched in tight fists
the records indicate no major episodes in the past four months
and it seems you have the support of the staff
but i see youve been in and out of the hospital more than ten times
eleven your honor
but im on a new medication now
do you feel ready to re enter the world
my family is prepared to support me until i find a job
theyve already located an apartment for me thats very near them
very well then
by order of the court you are released
i wish you good luck
michaels shoulders relax
he opens his fist
inside is the cracker jack ring and the magenta circle it has imprinted on his palm
michael walks to the car with his mother father and grandmother who keeps tousling his hair with pride
letty stands awkwardly in front of paul who sits in a wingback chair
whats so urgent
youve got me worried
i need to tell you something and im not sure how
you can tell me anything
beat do you want to postpone the wedding
is it too much pressure
thats a load off my mind
paul i want to break off the engagement
i dont mean to hurt you
i know this is a terrible thing
and i have really loved you
have really loved me
letty its natural to be nervous
but were going to work through our problems
ive met someone else
it doesnt matter who
have you been seeing another teacher
its a doctor isnt it
ill have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin
hes a patient here
paul considers this a moment
of all the crazy things
i understood when you dropped out of law school
and during this whole mess ive tried to be supportive
but really letty what can you be thinking
i love him
youre going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney tune that you misguidedly think is love
heres the ring
you keep the ring
youll come to your senses
ive made my decision paul
you keep it letty
this is not over
our life is not over
paul walks out the door and down the steps past michael who runs up them two at a time
hows it hanging paul
paul turns to watch michael as michael swings open the door and sails into the institute
letty waits as a nurse opens the door to the ward
letty is about to step through when michael enters
visitor for ms
letty whirls around
m home free
letty and michael hug
letty michael you have about five minutes until visiting hours end
the nurse retreats
tell me all
i was brilliant or at least boringly sane
so there were no problems
not a one
and did you go to the mission
no you goof i came to see you
i saw paul leaving
did you do the dirty deed
so its over
beat did you see your new apartment
one bedroom second floor no view
no i need some serious household advice
first off youll need to go to target
and lets see what should you buy
i better make a list
letty sits in the corridor opposite marie and thomas
they are playing blackjack
letty hands one over
thomas flips over his cards
letty looks to marie who waves her off
marie is fine with her cards
they look down the hall
nurse gates walks beside jamie a man in his late s who wears the same dazed expression letty did the morning after she was admitted
to jamie dr
stone will ask you some questions and then well get you settled
nurse gates and jamie come upon the gang
to letty bill lights out in guys
nurse gates continues down the hall hand firmly planted under jamies elbow as he weaves unsteadily beside her
wow that first night is hard
its going to be a difficult few weeks for him
it really makes you think
it really does
they look down the hall at the retreating figures
they look at each other
ill put in that its a straight diagnosis of depressive personality
are you kidding
with those glazed eyes
im willing to bet there was some break with reality going on there
without a doubt psychosis
letty is curled up in a chair opposite dr
but what i really cant believe is that im starting to actually miss work
have you been in contact with the principal about your job
i thought about calling but i want to wait until i know when ill be out
then you should call
i think its about that time letty
the charges against you have been dropped the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well
are you saying im through with therapy
lets not be hasty
beat im saying we should plan a release date for early next week
off lettys excited face we crowds crowds and more crowds
michael pulls unsuccessfully at a shopping cart that is stuck to another
a matronly woman walks up nudges michael out of the way and yanks the cart out of its row
she rolls it toward michael grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store
ichael takes several deep breaths
with trepidation in his step he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store
michael emerges from the store quite pleased with himself that he made it out alive
he commands a cart heaped full of useless gadgets and trinkets a half dozen picture frames and about decorative pillows
letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens
must you walk so quickly
its good exercise mom
ive got years on you
if we could just slow down we could talk so much easier
letty slackens her pace
im so thankful youll be leaving next week
if you want me to pick you up i will
ive already made arrangements
ruthie mentioned that michael might be coming for you
letty stops and wags her finger at her mother
mom we agreed
you can visit but youre not allowed to mention michael
not even if its something positive
thats the condition
mother and daughter keep walking in silence
have you spoken to paul at all
one more and youre out
a deals a deal
the two walk on in silence
have you heard the figure on how much queen elizabeths going to pay in taxes this year
letty stops walking
she turns a sunny smile on her mother then hugs her
l i knew you had it in you
letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase
emlee looks on
so well meet every tuesday and friday
and if you have any kind of emergency you can page me
thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off
it was just a little going away gesture
i have a going away gesture for you too
letty puts her hand in her suitcase and rummages through the clothes creating a jumbled mess
she snaps the luggage closed
bits of clothing hang out
letty sets her duffel bag down next to two suitcases
she hugs marie john thomas then walks over to mrs
hallstrom who hangs back from the group
letty embraces her
ill miss you mrs
theres no response
letty goes to nurse gates and hugs her
take care letty
and let me know if you need help with any spiders
you know i will
thanks for everything
letty walks toward michael who gathers up her bags
see you later guys
michael and letty walk through the visiting room
arent you supposed to throw a bouquet or something
arent you ever quiet
they walk out the doors onto the front steps of the hospital
michael grabs lettys hand as they hurry down the steps
ive heard the mission in santa barbara is the place to go
in the background the spanish style mission blends into the hillside
letty and michael sit on a bluff holding hands
they look out at the ocean where the sun heads toward the waves in a fiery red glow
michael and letty walk down the hall
michael stops at a door and showcases it
he jingles the keys
this is it b
check it out
i want to see
close your eyes
letty claps her hands over her eyes
michael opens the door and guides her into his castle
letty surveys the territory
forget tables chairs and couches
throw pillows are strewn everywhere
you like it
letty picks up a pillow and runs her hand over the fabric
she pauses a moment before speaking
i love the pillows
throw pillows letty
the sales lady said theyre the latest thing
lets see the rest
michael leads letty to the bedroom
a futon bed draped with a mosquito net rests in the corner
two tvs take center stage
its tv heaven
i was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch
now we can watch two shows at once
lets try out the bed
michael grabs her hand and pulls her toward the door
youve got to see the kitchen first
do you like it
i love your apartment
youll never get rid of me
michael kisses letty on the lips
what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate
are you kidding
ive got all the fixings here
off lettys look of surprise we watch michael open a cupboard door
the shelves are filled from top to bottom with cans of spaghetti os
letty squeezes michael in a bear hug
letty in a t shirt and michael in boxers lounge on the futon
they watch both tvs one tuned in to jay leno the other to david letterman
michael eats from a can of spaghetti os
letty reaches over with her fork and snags a mouthful from michaels can
how can you not like the top list
i like it
but headlines are better
youre so wrong
letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her tv
as letterman gets louder michael zaps his volume
its a war
letterman then leno get louder and louder and louder until letty makes a might lunge
she wrests michaels remote from him
letty mutes both tvs
its sex time
michael mockingly checks his watch
letty climbs on top of him
michael rolls on top of her
i think its my turn
close on their faces as michael gently licks the side of lettys mouth
did i get spaghetti sauce on my face
michael licks lettys nose
michael and letty look into each others eyes bathed in the blue light thrown off by the twin televisions
michael places a pillow gently beneath lettys head
he caresses her face
lettys eyes are alive to every look every touch
michael kisses her slowly on the forehead the nose and the lips
close on lettys hands as she reaches up to stroke michaels forehead and caress his temple
closer on her hands as letty runs them through michaels hair then twists a curly lock around her finger
soft moans as we close on lettys hand resting on the comforter on michaels bed
the alarm clock rings
lettys hand slaps it into submission
lettys still in bed a look of bliss across her face
rise and shine
michaels face fills her vision
lettys eyes close
ill be forced to tickle you
letty opens one eye and glares at him
how about this
letty bolts upright
im supposed to meet the principal in half an hour
ill see you tonight
michael gives her a kiss and walks into the living room
michael adjusts his tie
letty naked runs into the room and throws her arms around his neck
kick ass today
michael walks out the door
letty thinks for a minute
she flings open the door and yells to michaels retreating back
my apartment tonight
you can meet beast
michael swings around
oh and letty
yelling youve got one hell of a great body
the door across the hall opens
a little old man stares at lettys naked figure
she slams michaels apartment door
letty collapses in giggles
letty sits across from the principal
i didnt have any choice but to include the parents letters in your file
well i understand
i know my behavior was poor
so in light of how the parents feel and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute i dont think i can put you back in the
classroom just yet
look gail ive been a good teacher
i know letty
but the incident with zach was frightening for the children
beat now if youd come to me explained what was going on
believe me i wish id understood what was going on
ive worked really hard to get better
im glad youre doing well
ive already thought about how to tell the kids where i was
letty hands the principal a letter
and id like to send the parents this letter of explanation
with your support i think they can accept me
the principal reads the letter
its a very nice letter
but i have to go with whats best for the students
what does that mean
i need someone to work on budget projections
or of course you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year
michael sits at a back desk with mr
smythe who wears a three piece pin striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee
its not that were doubting your intelligence mr
but your work history shows so many interruptions
i know but as i said
i appreciate your candor about your illness but my bosses are concerned
i can do the job
between you and me my uncle he has some mental problems and i know what youre going through
if it were up to me id hire you
michaels already standing
thanks for your help
he shakes mr
smythes hand and downcast gets out of the bank as quickly as he can
letty sits on the floor
she gulps down some aspirin then hauls beast into her lap
the doorbell rings
michael walks in and looks around
gosh letty this is a great place
he kisses her and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat
this must be beast
beast to you
how was your day
its either work in the office or nothing
how was the job search
michael makes a thumbs down gesture
who ever said sanity was fun
it doesnt matter
itll work out
beat as long as we have steak
its a well known fact that a red meat dinner can cure the blues
beat you and beast wait here
ill be back in a jiff
letty gives michael a tired smile
michael jumps up and leaves
a moment passes
the door opens again
while im gone why dont you slip into something a little more naked
michael walks out of the grocery store loaded down with bags
he carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers
he passes two ladies who gossip outside the store
i cant believe he did that
what a weirdo
michael stops abruptly
he turns back and looks at the women
michael starts toward the car
he hears more laughter from the women
he turns back and walks up to them
dont ever talk about me again you hear me
the women pull back in fright
letty in a skimpy negligee lights candles on the table
michael enters with the groceries and wine
i thought maybe you got lost
the store was busy
you got wine
would you mind if we just called it an early night
you go ahead and relax
i think i should go home
are you ok
big restaurant interview tomorrow
but what about the red meat blues thing
you know weve got that dinner with my parents tomorrow too
i should really get some rest tonight
michael gives letty a kiss good night
she stares after him
reluctantly she blows out the candles and starts putting the groceries away
to beast hows filet sound
the coffee shop hasnt opened for business yet
michael and six people in their early s fill out applications
ichael stares blankly at his application
he fills out his name
he cant get any further
two other applicants glance toward him
michael tries to write
under his breath no no no
the other applicants look toward michael and quickly avert their eyes
the restaurant manager walks up to the group
michael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant
his application incomplete remains on the table
this kitchen is the heart of the home copper pots two pasta makers and every size wooden spoon made
letty lightly dusted with flour mixes fresh pasta with her hands
santucci peers into the bowl
its too pasty
letty pours in more water
ill never mget the hang of this
all the santucci women go through this
letty smiles at her and kneads harder
santucci enters and kisses his wife
hi there letty
santucci looks in the pasta bowl
it needs more water
he dumps some in
letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess
santucci maybe we should make lamb next week
michael walks in
howd it go
michael takes his tie holds it up like a noose and lets his tongue loll out of his mouth
four no gos
the restaurant too
i couldnt even face that one
santucci look at each other
we can call and reschedule in the morning
you dont have to take care of me you know
an uneasy silence falls in the room
maybe we should save the job talk for after dinner
michael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that letty continues to labor over
he reaches in to help with the mixing
to letty just promise youll love me even if i end up in a job where i have to wear a blue polyester cap
i think you know id love you even more in a blue polyester cap
michael finishes brushing his teeth
he opens the medicine cabinet pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill into his hand
youre going to miss the top ten
he raises the pill to his mouth then opens his hand and lets it drop in the sink
michael runs the water and watches the pill swirl slowly down the drain
michael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer
he opens the door sprints into the bedroom and leaps onto letty who lies on the futon
letty screams and laughs
michael sits in a booth drinking coffee
he bows over an application pen in hand
about a third is filled out
letty and superintendent johansen sit on the floor which is covered with math games posters and charts
i think i could get the program up and running in the next two weeks
from what i understand the principal has removed you from student activities
shes worried that im unstable
johansen studies her
but i wouldnt push for the program if i wasnt ready
what about the office work
id have to do that too
but ive gotten better at pacing myself
are you sure
ill call you if i have problems
i have to say im inclined to give it another try
letty hugs johansen
but letty why dont you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time
michael sits in the same booth eating a hamburger
about half of the application is now completed
letty and her mother sit in silence
letty smiles at her mother
her mother gives her a very tiny smile back
michael hurries in
i got worried
are you ok
michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts it on
m how may i help you
michael the shops about to close
maybe you could try on your tux
michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store
mayer michael just got a job
couldnt you congratulate him
i will dear
beat why mcdonalds
hes been looking everywhere for weeks mom
its not that easy after youve been locked away
letty looks toward the back of the store
her mother looks at her
letty ignores her mother
ive read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at mcdonalds and burger king
letty looks at her mother tries to read her
im going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded
dont be fresh
just remember that i love him
michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward the two women bowing in cary grant fashion as he nears
lettys mother turns to her daughter who beams brightly at the dashing michael
to letty ill say this dear
he looks damn good in a tuxedo
letty and michael jog
aunt lily is the one who married your fathers cousin
no thats aunt connie
lily is the one who looks like a hooker
and harry hes the one who likes magic
you dont have to know all this by saturday
it took me years
every inch of every pew in the baroque church is stuffed with guests
michael sits in the second row
he cranes his head around as pachelbels canon rings out and the flower girl advances
letty in the first part of the brides maids procession heads down the aisle next
the bride is nowhere in sight
but even so as soon as michael spots letty he stands
everyone else remains seated
they look at him
michael doesnt notice
he has eyes only for letty
lettys mother looks at michael with more than annoyance
begrudgingly she also stands
following the lead the entire church stands for letty
she smiles at michael
a parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet mr
mayer monica letty mrs
mayer ruth and jake
michael hovers close to letty
aunt lily with fluorescent red hair and a silver lame miniskirt spots him
to michael what a beautiful wedding
as she passes out of earshot to letty aunt lily
mayer talks to her brother cort
oh and have you met michael
hes lettys boyfriend
letty and ruth overhear this
they make eye contact
ruth raises her eyebrows toward letty
letty smiles back
ruth and letty talk while michael twirls across the dance floor with monica
the worst was when i stammered jakes name
i dont think people even noticed
i thought the ceremony was perfect
thats thanks to all your help
cort overweight and red from drink approaches ruth and letty
uh oh uncle cort at oclock
sorry to do this to you
but i am the bride
ruth turns and flees
cort pounces on letty and plants the wettest kiss ever on her mouth
to letty i dont think ive seen you in two or three years
has it been that long
you were with that lawyer
im dating michael now
met him in the receiving line
what is it that he does for a living
michael walks up to letty and cort as they speak
well he just got a job
in the restaurant business
letty looks at michael surprised
speak of the devil
beat how did you guys meet again
at the psych hospital
i wouldve sent a card but your aunt and i we werent sure if that was the thing to do
thats fine uncle cort
to michael so you were a volunteer over at the hospital
something like that
when he could get time off from the restaurant business
to letty how about a dance
you two go ahead
im going to go bother that pretty sister of yours for a dance
cort gives letty another big wet kiss
bye uncle cort
to michael whats with the lie
it wasnt exactly a lie
people at weddings dont want the truth
michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
its not good to drink so much with the medication youre on
whats with this music
ill go talk to the d
and see if we cant get something good going
michael heads toward the d
and confers with him
mayer walks up to letty
its good to see you so happy
michael then walks back to letty and pulls her out onto the dance floor as twist and shout booms out from the speakers
lettys mother departs the dance floor grimacing
ruth shoots michael a look of pure pleasure
and everyone begins twisting as we completely dark
letty in a nightshirt wanders in and stumbles through the room
she fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp
the light comes on illuminating a small circle
just outside of it sits michael
e stares straight ahead
letty kneels down in front of him
you should come to bed
michael remains focused on the space directly in front of him
did you take the aspirin and water
you dont want to feel awful in the morning
beat ill get you some
letty begins to stand up
the movement breaks michaels trance
he pulls her back down
what is it
are you ok
strangely calm always the drugs
i saw you talking to my mom
we both talked to her michael
and your dad
whyd you tell her i wasnt taking my meds
what do you mean not taking your meds
whyd you tell
i didnt talk to her about medications michael
dont be silly
michael beats his hand on the floor
silly am i
michael take it easy
silly silly silly
i think i should call someone
michael reaches out grabs the floor lamp and pushes it over
he lurches to his feet and pulls letty to a standing position
screaming dont upset my mom
dont you upset my mom
michael calm down
its michael knocks some flowers over then rips apart a pillow
letty hovers in back of him
she puts her hand on his back
michael whirls around
he slaps lettys hand away
she stumbles backward
he stares in her direction but he doesnt respond
letty cant make a connection
michael shoves his fist through a window
letty grabs the phone
not my mom
not my silly silly mom
letty runs with the phone
michael follows her
she rights herself
she locks herself in the bathroom
ichael pounds on the bathroom door
ive got an emergency
michael howls a long piercing inhuman sound
my boyfriends out of control
on the other side of the door michael screams
another window shatters
whats going on in there
into phone please please send someone
beat no hes having an attack
letty wearing michaels tux jacket is curled up on the floor in a fetal position
at the upset flowers at the ripped up pillows at a fist sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall
her gaze stops on a spaghetti os can lying empty on the floor
knocks on the door
letty rises slowly padding to the door like an old woman
the knocks grow urgent
letty opens the door to ruth
letty throws herself into ruths waiting embrace
immediately letty cries
after a moment letty steps back
im sorry so sorry
i never should have called
ruth looks into lettys eyes
you did the right thing
i ruined your wedding night
im glad you called
now not another word about it
ruth pulls letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind them
it is only then that she sees the destruction in the living room
horror flashes across her face
oh my god
tears stream down lettys face
ruth starts to cry
did he hurt you
letty shakes her head no
her sobbing intensifies
ruth puts her arm around letty and together they sit on the floor
ruth holds letty until the crying eases
oh ruthie what am i going to do
you dont have to make any decisions tonight
but what am i going to do
do you want to go see him
ill take you if you want to go
i cant see him there
ruth holds her close again
i was so sure
i really thought it would work
beat we have plans ruth
letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with michael
she smokes a cigarette and stares out at the ocean
letty remains on the bluff crying
a priest passing in the background looks over at her and continues on his way
in the darkness letty lies on her back
she stares up at the moon and stars bright against the night sky
letty walks along a pathway with paul
im glad you agreed to see me
im just glad there arent any hard feelings
i completely understand what was going on
hows work going
are you back at school
i start on monday
so things are back on track
i heard about your friend
i heard your friend was back in the hospital
i just wondered well if this meant there was a chance for us
because i think about you a lot and i still feel
our relationship meant a lot to me too paul
but its over
beat and michael being in the hospital doesnt really change things
i think ive heard this speech before
im really sorry
letty reaches up to hug him
he quickly disengages himself
ive got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on so if you dont mind
sure i understand
paul starts down the path
letty runs up to paul
i need to give you this
letty hands paul the engagement ring
he takes it and continues walking as she stares after him
letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility
we follow her journey through the visiting room past families conversing with patients to the nurses station
letty walks up to nurse gates who gives her a quick hug
john and bill watch as letty signs the visitors register
hes in jamies old room
letty walks down the hallway and pauses outside michaels door
michael is in the middle of taping up the same houdini poster we saw in his last room when letty enters
letty and michael kiss awkwardly
how are you
they smile nervously
i guess we need to talk
i guess so
its hard to know where to start
pretend like im your shrink
letty rolls her eyes
ill be quiet
i think about you all the time
i sure know what that feels like
and all the plans we have
yeah the plans
letty looks out the window
ive been thinking i could try to visit you at night after work and then thered be more time on weekends to see
like ive told you before i dont want you taking care of me
someone has to take care of you right now michael
you tore up the apartment
you stopped taking your medications
but that wasnt me
i didnt mean to do that
well then whyd it happen
i dont know
i dont fucking know
letty and michael glare at each other
letty looks away
i didnt come here to blame you
i didnt mean for any of this to happen
oh god michael i know
softly why does everything have to be so hard
michael shakes his head
what are we going to do
what do you want to do
i know i dont want to lose you
i dont think i could stand it
yeah but can you stand to be with me like this
she looks away
she turns back and stares into michaels eyes
finally she says it
i cant michael
im so sorry but i just cant handle all this right now
letty starts to cry
tears well up in michaels eyes
i cant either
michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other
i love you so much
i love you too letty
i love you too
letty and michael grip each other
finally they pull apart
maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach
thats the best idea ive heard in a long time
letty wipes a tear from michaels cheek
dont you have a magic trick or something to make this easier
how about something better
like a kiss
he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before
i can still come visit you you know
would that really be such a good idea for either of us
just promise me youll be ok ok
and you make sure you take care of yourself
michael puts his hand under lettys chin and draws her head up so he can look into her eyes
promise you wont fall for any guys pretending to be doctors
letty shakes her head no as tears stream down her face
i guess i should go now
you should go
letty stands up and walks toward the door
she comes back and embraces michael again
slowly they separate and letty leaves the room
michael stares out the window
letty walks out the door down the steps and along the front walkway until finally the hospital recedes in the distance
letty sits on top of a desk
children of all ages stare her down
a few familiar faces bobby and jenny grace the room
principal gail passes outside the window and glances in
first of all i want to welcome you to mathshop
i have lots of fun games planned for us
beat lets see bobby can you help me pass out these cards
bobby doesnt move
is something wrong bobby
why were you gone so long
my mom said you went crazy
i had what some people call a nervous breakdown
i wasnt dealing with life so well so i went
to a place for psychos
to a psychiatric institution
its a place where you figure out what you want and what things in your life arent working
you learn to look out for yourself and not get
letty trails off
she sees that shes lost the class
bobby launches a spit wad that hits the boy in front of him
let me show you the best thing i learned
she walks up to bobby
he twists around in his seat trying to hide the rest of his supply of spit wads
letty waves her hand around bobbys head
the children stare delighted
she pulls a bright coin out of his ear and hands it to him
do it again miss mayer
letty puts her hands behind her back and produces a bouquet of paper flowers
now shes got the class hooked
