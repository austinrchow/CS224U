b if window
href b b revised final screenplay by frank nugent behind the main title and the credits the hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground picking their way through scrubby desert
an occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints and lightly blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them
the camera following the hoofprints we see the rider now
back to camera jogging slowly along heading down a long valley toward a still distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals
the camera frames and moves with the lone horseman
he is ethan edwards a man as hard as the country he is crossing
ethan is in his forties with a three day stubble of beard
dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing
he wears a long confederate overcoat torn at one pocket patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows
his trousers are a faded blue with an off color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the yankee cavalry
his saddle is mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the texas poncho
rider and horse have come a long way
the camera holds and pans the rider past and we see another detail strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around
horse and rider pass moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house
she is staring wide eyed at the distant horseman o
her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly
debbie quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck crouching over him
debbie is years old with a piquant memorable face
here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable so that if we were to see her again five or six years later we
would know it is she perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger
the ranch house is of adobe solidly built with a sod and cross timbered roof deep windows
a small gallery or porch extends across the front
aaron edwards comes through the door attracted by the dogs barking and then he too sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out curious but not at all apprehensive
aaron is a lean weathered and tired man with a down swept mustache a gentler looking man than ethan and possibly a few years older
as he squints off studying the rider his older daughter lucy comes out to stand behind him
lucy is from to a pleasant feminine girl
she is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger
in the next instant martha edwards follows the daughter onto the porch
martha is a still lovely woman although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth and work has worn and coarsened her hands
those hands will never be idle when martha is on scene
and now while she shares the familys interest in the approaching horseman she automatically notes that lucy has forgotten her task and she takes the mixing bowl from her and
stirs the batter
along the side of the house comes ben edwards with a man sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest
he too has spotted the stranger and is all attention
so much so that he trips but recovers his footing
he pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider and then he moves toward the others biting a splinter
out of a finger
beyond ben martin pauley emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward camera
martin is somewhat under a lithe perfectly coordinated male animal with indian straight hair and a white mans eyes
he is carrying bridle or other horse gear
he looks to the family on the porch to see if they recognize the stranger then out again
he continues followed by ben toward where debbie crouches over her dog
as he rides downslope toward the house
suddenly marthas eyes widen as she even before aaron recognizes the distant rider
her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips
an instant later aaron too identifies the oncoming horseman
he looks at her frowning then slowly steps out onto the hard ground
martha hands the bowl back to lucy and follows aaron
as ethan rides in and sits his horse looking down at them
there is a noticeable constraint on all of them
finally hello aaron
his eyes shift to martha and hold
ethan is and always has been in love with his brothers wife and she with him
a bit shakily hello ethan
ethan slowly stiffly swings out of the saddle
aaron and martha exchange quick glances
aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as ethan comes around his horse toward their side
how should i know
but mose harper said
that old goat still creakin around
whynt someone bury him
he goes to his saddle pack begins unlacing it
ben and debbie have inched closer half shy half curious
debbies dog begins sniffing at his heels
ethan looks down at them not unfriendly just a man not used to children
ben aint you
frowning at debbie lucy you aint much bigger than when i saw you last
pointing shes lucy
ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger
as lucy steps down from the porch and approaches
lucys going on seventeen now
an shes got a beau
kisses him too
go on inside and help lucy set the table
you too deborah
as martin with slightly averted face crosses to take the bridle of ethans horse and lead him away
wheeling on him martin checks his stride stares in surprise
here weve been standing
ethan you havent forgotten martin
mistook you for a half breed
levelly not quite
the rest is welsh
so they tell me
youve done a lot of growin
it was ethan found you squallin in a sage clump after your folks was massacred
bluntly it just happened to be me
no need to make any more of it
ill take care of your horse for you uncle ethan
again he starts to lead away
martin stops again
ill take this
he completes unlacing the pack and takes it treating it as though it contained something of value
martin watches with a touch of resentment ethan doesnt trust him
ethan turns and sees the look
he doesnt care what martin thinks nor does he explain
martin leads the horse off
supperll be ready by the time you wash up
let me take your coat for you ethan
he hesitates then grudgingly surrenders it conscious of its sorry condition
smiling faintly and
he just nods then turns to follow aaron around the side of the house toward the wash up
she stands alone looking after ethan his coat in her arms
she holds it against her breast for just a moment and her eyes are tender
the family is finishing dinner and the scene is not quite but almost a still life
loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a seth thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace in which logs are burning briskly
ben crouches near the fireplace fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre ethan has brought home from the wars
he tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard
aaron sits at one end of the hand hewn table martha at the other
at her right is ethan his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate
lucy sits at her fathers right and martin at his left
next to martin is debbie
in the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal
lucy and martin have finished eating
aaron is sipping his coffee and martha her own plate largely untasted is watching ethan
ethan has shaved changed his shirt
he straightens contentedly and every eye is on him expectantly
the clock rattles alarmingly the usual preliminary to its striking and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire alarm gong
eight fast clangs
but ive got to help with the dishes
ben put that sword back
its not a sword ma
its a saber
moving to ethan did you kill many damyankees with this sabre uncle ethan
matter of factly some
how many damyankees uncle ethan
martin hell sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight
martin nods and crosses to kiss martha good night
good night aunt martha
he hesitates good night uncle ethan
ethan doesnt like being called uncle as we must know from the quick look he shoots at martin
but he acknowledges it
ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away turns to ethan
will you tell me tomorrow about the war
the war ended three years ago boy
then whynt you come home before now
go long with martin
as ben reluctantly heads out with martin deborah crosses to ethans side and studies him gravely
lucys wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl
she dont wear it much account of it makes her neck green
defensively well it does
but i wouldnt care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not
ethan looks at her gravely
then he remembers something rises wait
he crosses to where his pack is a side table or something and burrows into it
debbie is at his side
how about this
it is a gold medal or medallion something appropriate to maximilian of mexico suspended by a long multi colored satin ribbon
my gold locket
she holds it high for mother and all to see
martha takes it and reacts at its weight
its solid gold
ethan i dont think shes old enough
let her keep it
just something i picked up in mexico
martha reluctantly surrenders it to debbies eager hand
aaron hasnt missed the word mexico and looks sharply at ethan
oh thank you uncle ethan
to debbie come along
the two girls leave the main room
martha and aaron both look at ethan half expecting some further explanation
he turns from them and looks into the fire
martha begins to clear the table
aaron gets up takes a pipe and a spill lights it at the fire
passed the todd place comin in
what happened to em
they gave up
went back to the cotton rows
sod the jamisons
without martha i dont know
she wouldnt let a man quit
ethan turns and looks at her still busy with her dishes
change of tone ethan i could see it in you before the war
ethan looks at him you wanted to clear out
martha freezes in what shes doing listening
and you stayed out beyond all need to
ethan cant answer but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it
hard you askin me to clear out now
straightening with grave dignity youre my brother
youre welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to
aint that so martha
almost a whisper of course he is
i expect to pay my own way
martha resumes her activity
ethan crosses to his pack reaches into it for a leather pouch brings it back and tosses it onto the table
it lands with a resonant clink
both martha and aaron draw close to the table
note to winton hoch this scene should be dramatically back lighted
theres sixty double eagles in there
twelve hundred dollars
he opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table
an twice that in here
he reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table
only these got the late emperor maximilians picture on em
martha picks up one of the gold pieces staring at the face on the coin the same as that on the medal staring sharply then at ethan
aaron is examining another coin with a different interest
not a mark on em
he glances questioningly at ethan
aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair
he raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots some rags of clothing and then raises a false bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into
carefully he replaces everything
during this ethans attention has gone to marthas hand to one cut finger its wound barely healed
he takes the hand gently
she nods and withdraws the hand
softly you were always hurting about your hands
she looks quickly at him and self consciously tries to hide her hands conscious of their work worn appearance
then for a moment their eyes meet and hold and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look
aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair
time for bed
he picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their bedroom door
martha looks at ethan again
his expression is bitter
come long martha
she turns obediently and follows aaron
ethan looks after them and waits as aaron opens the bedroom door
martha goes into it and aaron follows and closes the door
ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel blows it out
only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly at the closed bedroom door
debbies dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly ride toward the house and dismount
a lamp goes on inside
captain the reverend sam clayton a big man with frosty blue eyes graying hair a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority
he is a minister of the gospel with a

lars jorgensen the edwards neighbor is a harried little man scandinavian
as we shall find out soon he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children
brad jorgensen is one of these sandy haired brash amiable impulsive
he is in his early twenties
charlie maccorry slightly older than brad is sergeant of company a of the rangers
he is also company a
charlie is a taciturn gently spoken competent man clearly patterned by his association with captain the rev
mose harper is an old scout a walking bone rack yet capable of tireless feats of endurance
some think him tetched yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren
he wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather a narrow brimmed hat with a feather in its band
ed nesby is a rancher and homesteader in his mid thirties resolute honest self effacing nothing picturesque or dramatic about him just a solid citizen and a realist
she is at the window of her bedroom wrapper clutched with one hand lamp upraised in the other as she stares into the dawn to see who these callers are
we hear the heavy foot falls of the approaching men then a loud knock thrice repeated an ominous sound
the door is opened by aaron holding a lamp and a gun
he is only partly dressed pants boots undershirt
the bar of light slashes across the faces of sam and some of the men behind him
sorry to get you out of bed so early
as martha enters tightening her wrapper mornin sister edwards
what is it reverend
lars jorgensen claims someone bust into his corral last night and run off his best cows
you mean those pure breds he just bought
jorgensen enters an angry little man closely followed by mose harper who is grinning foolishly
next time i raise pigs by golly
you never hear of anyone running off pigs i bet you
injuns has em

kiowas or caddoes
mose spots martha and at once whips off his hat and makes her an exaggerated cavaliers bow
respects to a charmin lady maam
ed nesby enters
coffees made if you
coffeed be fine sister
she heads for the stove
an old mans whimper my bones is cold
his eyes brighten as he looks toward the fire and spots a rocking chair
he shuffles toward it plants himself and begins rocking and half crooning to himself

crooning lookit me old mose harper rockin in a rockin chair

the front door opens to admit martin fully dressed and armed with charlie maccorry
over here martin
martin ranges himself next to aaron and both face clayton
raise your right hands
martha sets out cups on the table begins pouring the coffee
during the swearing in ethan will enter the room from the inner door unnoticed by the other men but not by martha
and as the scene plays the audience must always be conscious of the by play of glances between martha and ethan as they face the prospect of being left in
this house together
you are hereby volunteer privates in company a of the texas rangers and will faithfully discharge the duties of same without recompense or monetary compensation meaning no pay
amen and get your shirt on will you aaron
stubbornly aint goin volunteerin after rustlers without my morning coffee reverend
drink your own
sternly as he reaches for his cup from now on call me captain
but ethan advances and calmly appropriates the cup clayton is reaching for
mockingly captain the reverend samuel johnson clayton
clayton marks his surprise
the prodigal brother
whend you get back
ethan sips his coffee and doesnt answer
havent seen you since the surrender
a pause come to think of it i didnt see you at the surrender
i dont believe in surrenderin
i still got my sabre reverend
never turned it into any ploughshare neither
is no time for kaffee klatch while a mans beef is been run off
taps his nose caddoes or kiowas
mose harper drinkin coffee in a rockin chair
martha has left the room briefly to fetch aarons shirt and vest and stands behind him
aaron drains his cup
ethan countin on you to look after things while im gone
ethan cup to his lips looks over its rim at martha as aaron starts to put on his shirt
their eyes meet briefly then she looks away
ethan sloshes the dregs of his cup into the fire some of it spattering mose
you aint goin
he sure is goin
hes sworn in
angrily well swear him out again
ill go with you
martha stands submissively with her head bent eyes averted as ethan crosses the room to get his coat guns etc
aaron follows him
now ethan i aint sure
and stay close
maybe theyre rustlers
and maybe this dodderin old idiot aint so far wrong
thankin ye ethan
grudgingly all right
ill swear you in
you can forget that
as sam stares wouldnt be legal anyway
a pause then shrewdly you wanted for a crime ethan
martha waits intent

im askin as a ranger of the sovereign state of texas
got a warrant
you fit a lot of descriptions
levelly i figger a mans only good for one oath at a time
i took mine to the confederate states of america
he pauses then so did you reverend
he looks past him then at martha and then at aaron
stick close aaron
he looks at martha again
and then strides out
as ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight of a couple brad and lucy in each others arms standing near the saddled horses of the posse
clayton and jorgensen following him out spot the couple who now belatedly are conscious of their audience
is no time for lolly gagging
in confusion lucy runs back around the side of the house as brad unrepentant grins at his irascible old man and heads for his waiting horse
clayton chuckles and turns toward martha who has followed them out
looks like ill be reading the lines over that pair before long sister edwards
is no time for talking weddings
better say prayers for those dirty thieves by golly
running off a mans beef
mose last to emerge bows elaborately to martha
grateful to the hospitality of yore rockin chair maam
the men are mounting
mose nimbly vaults onto the back of his horse which he rides bareback with only a blanket pad
as ethan and martin ride to join the group
lets get on with it
she comes flying out of the house in her long flannel nightie and runs to martin
ride me as far as the well
he swings her up in front of his saddle
they start away
ethan is last to ride out
he is watching martha
he brings a gloved hand up in a salute
she starts to raise her hand but only brings it just above her waist a fluttering gesture with tremulous fingers
it is the last he will ever see of her alive
as the posse slowly rides out with ethan last
martin reins in to let debbie slip to the ground
ethan passes her
debbie stands watching the men ride away waving at them
calling she turns and comes running back camera panning to the little group on the porch ben in the door lucy crossing the porch aaron and martha at the steps
ethan and mose are advancing at a steady walk both men leaning slightly out of their saddles to study the terrain the trail they are following
out to one side fifty yards distant is the main body of the posse sam jorgensen charlie ed moving roughly parallel to ethan but at a faster clip
martin comes riding in toward ethan from behind camera
calling uncle ethan
ethan reins in compressing his lips at the uncle
somethin mighty fishy about this trail uncle ethan
stop callin me uncle
i aint your uncle
dont have to call me sir neither
nor grampaw neither
nor methuselah neither
i can whup you to a frazzle
mose lets out a snickering laugh
what you want me to call you
now whats so mighty fishy about this trail
well fust off
he breaks and all turn at a distant hail from jorgensen
he is holding his rifle with both hands straight over his head and he repeats the signal until he sees they have seen him
hes found them
as jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way
the other riders follow
he waits grimly until he sees them coming then wheels his mount and takes off over the hill
as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest
jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay
the other men look down into the long valley on the far side with equally grim expressions
call that young fool back
jorgensen doesnt even seem to hear him
angrily ethan whips out revolver and fires into the air
then he swings his arm in a come back gesture
he rides out ahead then a short distance and dismounts
and slowly the others follow
we see now the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun
ethan goes to the nearest one
a feathered lance is driven into it
he pulls the lance out
mose comes over beside him
angrily caddo or kiowa huh
aint but one tribe uses a lance like that
he hands the lance to mose
almost a whisper ay he
brad rides in shrill with anger
killed every one an not for food either
whyd they do a thing like that
stealing the cattle was just to pull us out
this heres a murder raid
facing jorgensen it shapes up to scald out either your place
or my brothers
jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the miles they have ridden
and with that one word jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off
ed nesby and charlie maccorry follow
sam clayton pauses
jorgensens place is closest
if theyre not there well come straight on
then he too rides
martin swings his horse back to where ethan and mose still are standing
well come on
he starts toward his horse its forty miles sonny
horses can do with some grain and a little rest
comanch generally hits at moonrise
itll be midnight before
i aint waitin
he wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the others
ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed his horse
mose does the same
wisht it was caddoes
shakes his head comanche
ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle
nothing could be more tranquil
the shadows are long
a thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney
and then debbies little dog trots around the side of the house out into the yard
he comes to a standstill and his nose is working
he begins to make excited little sounds deep in his belly
then he lies down muzzle between his paws watching listening
debbie sits on the floor playing with a little rag doll
the slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting
beyond her on the porch steps ben is squatting whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame
we hear martha and lucy busy with the dishes
aaron comes from behind camera and stands in the doorway absently rapping out his pipe
near the doorway on a wooden peg hangs his gun belt
he puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at deborah intent on her play
he looks swiftly at where the women are busy then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt
he hasnt made a sound and is sure hes got away with it
he clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door
think ill see if i can pick off a sage hen or two martha
busy at the wooden sink
martha doesnt turn
you do that aaron
still pleased with himself wont go far
he steps out
only then does martha turn and her and framing the empty holster as aaron pauses on the porch
my the days are getting shorter
as lucy heads for the lamp
we dont need the lamp yet
lucy frowns at her mother
easily lets enjoy the dusk a while
aaron is slowly scanning the terrain
to ben mind you sweep up them shavins
undertone man to man an if you see any sage hens im ready
aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket or whatever by his side to disclose ethans cavalry sabre
aaron smiles and rubs the youngsters head then sets out across the yard
debbies dog rises at aarons approach and joins his master as they set out across the plain
he is walking through the scrub and brush grass every sense alive and straining
he pauses every three or four strides casting each quadrant in turn
once he whips gun ready as a sage hen or quail whirrs up not far from him
he smiles grimly as he watches it fly away
he keeps on
martha comes to stand in the doorway
ben doesnt look at her
his eyes like hers are fixed on the figure of the man
quietly its all right ma
i been watchin
only i wish
quietly what ben
i wish uncle ethan was here
dont you ma
she doesnt answer
lucy comes to the door
mother i cant see what im doing
he stands on the near slope of a rise and then gradually moves toward its summit so that only head will be silhouetted
he drops to one knee half leaning against the slope and slowly looks out
the camera pans very slowly following his careful sweep of the terrain
the scene is entirely peaceful
with narrowed eyes slowly scanning the ground
suddenly the head whips right
we hear a birds sharp call
it is taking flight sweeping away in erratic arcs
he squints closely at the ground from which the bird had flown
then slowly his eyes range toward the left
across the meadow a shadow seems to touch the grass and at once a covey of quail takes off whirring loud
aaron waits no longer but slides down the slope and starts running at a crouch for the house stopping every so often to look backward
note to w
hoch what j
has in mind for this and the following scenes is the same kind of dramatic use of red you achieved in yellow ribbon in the scene telling of custers defeat
they are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and ben has ethans sabre in his hand
we hear aaron coming at a run breathing hard
ben takes a step as though to go to him but marthas hand at once is on his shoulder
aaron gains the porch
in the house boy
he puts finger to his lips sign for ben to say nothing
ben nods and goes inside
aaron and martha face each other the question large on her face
slowly he nods the confirmation of her fears then gently propels her ahead of him through the door
the room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness
ben is waiting and martha turns toward aaron as he pulls the door shut bars it and sets the shotgun down
he takes the revolver from his waist and martha holds it as he reaches for his gun belt
ben close the shutters
buckling on his gun belt he moves toward the middle of the room looking around him taking inventory of his resources
lucy slowly approaches biting a knuckle eyes wide with fright
one shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing in goes out
martha aaron and lucy are dark silhouettes now against the red beam from another window
sudden fear wheres deborah
calling it debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light
she is clutching her rag doll nibbling a cookie
she holds it for them to see
i only took one ma
topsy was hungry
ben closes the shutter
and now the room is almost completely blacked out except for the dying light filtering through the rifle ports of the closed shutters
this should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the posse has split the main group heading for the jorgensen place martin forking off to race alone for
the edwards ranch
coming toward and passing camera is martin riding all out
several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction are the others brad and charlie sam jorgensen and ed nesby
the men are not compactly bunched but strung out each taking his own best course and his own speed
as the riders pass and the dust of their passing we see two other riders ethan and mose minute specks in the distance possibly a mile or two behind
note to w
hoch what we are trying to get here is that moment of swift transition from twilight to night of riders briefly touched with the last colors of day and then
as they pass becoming one with blue shadows of night
ethan and mose are holding their mounts to a jog in marked contrast to the all out pace of the others
the camera pans after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across the valley
the wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the hills a coyote pack yaps
aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers into the night through a partly opened shutter
suddenly the room leaps alight as lucy opens an inner door and enters holding a lighted lamp
aaron closes the shutter spins on her angrily
martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp
in the brief moment the room has been lighted we see that lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand that ben is crouched at another window rifle ready
and that deborah is on her feet standing like a child who is being dressed
i couldnt find the shawl
moons fixin to rise
he cautiously swings the shutters open
a pale light filters into the room
we see martha wrapping the shawl around deborah
softly to the child were going to play the sleep out game
where you hide out with grandma
wheres she buried
and youll go along the ditch very quietly like a
her voice breaks like a little mouse
he reaches for the child but he has to wait for marthas last embrace
and you wont come back or make a sound
no matter what you hear
no matter what
cant i have topsy to keep me company
theres no time
here she is baby
aaron takes the child swings her out the window
down low go
martha would come to the window to look out but aaron bars her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to watch her go
outside the little dog barks a welcome and presumably starts to follow the girl
hoarse whisper here dog
the dog whines but obeys
aaron continues watching the childs course unconsciously imitating her every run and twist
then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners of his eyes
she reached the ditch
he closes the shutters and turns and his arms go around martha weeping soundlessly
shell be all right mother
shell be all right
nothing stirs and we hear nothing
then with faintest little rustle debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down pressed against topsy
she becomes one with the earth and the stillness
and then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by the moonlight reveals something glittering like beads
and the camera from that ground level shot the comanche we are later to know as scar is painted for war tall savage mockingly looking down at what we know
is the childs hiding place
and in that instant from a dozen quarters and a dozen throats sounds the wild yammer of the warwhoop
he stands beside his spent and fallen horse
its breathing is a rasping whistle
martin tries to haul its head up
breathing hard himself his face ashen in the moonlight martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch
then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard struggling with it because it is under the horse
he freezes then listening
and we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching
martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope
he gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders
the camera swings with him and we see ethan and mose approaching at the same steady gait
waving uncle ethan
ethan doesnt slacken nearly rides him down
out of my way
martin goes sprawling to his hands and knees
mose continues without slowing
he goes running stumbling after the riders desperately calling to them
and then at the crest of the rising ground he stops we see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the barns and the hayricks and the
house of aaron edwards
martin runs down the slope
note to w
hoch here again that use of red is suggested
the angle is past the porch uprights toward mose and ethan as they ride in
little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights
a few arrows imbedded in the wood are burning along their shafts
beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred smouldering rails of the corral
there are no bodies in evidence
the red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount
ethan strides to the porch knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door
he stops there and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop the huge frame slump
slowly then and removing his hat he goes in
mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief
we hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and ethans muffled voice calling through the house lucy
he strides back through the main room and out onto the porch just as martin comes at a shambling run across the yard
ethan takes a few steps out toward him
martin would pass him but ethan grabs his arm
harshly you stay out
martin tries to fight his arm free
nothing for you to see
ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw
martin goes down out cold
and only now do we understand how merciful the blow was as ethan looks compassionately at the fallen figure
dont let him go in there mose
and he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop
as he nears the graves
calling lucy lucy
he runs in looking around him
he sees the little dog dead on the ground
and then he sees a shadowed something the shawl debbie had worn
it is spread out almost as though concealing a body
fearfully he stoops and pulls it away
there is nothing there but the shawl
he drops to his knees his head bowed his face tortured
the moonlight is clear on the face of the nearer headboard
it is of weathered wood and the chiselled letters on it read a good wife mother in her st year the funeral is begun
in the foreground are three newly made crosses at the head of as many open graves which we need not see
with head bared sam clayton is concluding his prayer
near him stand the jorgensen family mrs
jorgensen lars and laurie blonde just beginning to reach her maturity and a stepping stone of tow headed children
and to your keeping we commend the souls of aaron
and benjamin edwards
jorgensen and laurie impelled by the same feminine sympathy and interest turn to look at ethan and martin
the panning camera picks them up
ethan standing dry eyed looking at the grave of martha martin with bruised lip looking out across the plain
clayton now opens his small well worn bible to a marked page
man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble
ethan looks at him angrily impatiently
he cometh forth like a
put an amen to it
like a flower and is cut down
ethan turns on his heel and walks camera panning to where ed nesby has been holding the horses
brad is already mounting
mose is there too and charlie maccorry
silhouetted against the dawn light are the rifles in each mans saddle scabbard
clayton is right behind ethan
charlie you and brad ride point
dont get too far ahead
the young riders spur out
ethan is about to mount when mrs
jorgensen comes up and catches his arm
he turns impatiently those girls mean as much to me as though they were my own
maybe you dont know my brads been sittin up with lucy
and my lauries real fond of martin
ethan glances back at where martin and laurie are standing
the girl is looking at martin full of compassion tries to console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares blindly at the graves and jorgensen stolidly
beginning the work of shovelling them full
ethan looks back at her stone faced
impatiently id be obliged if youd get to the point maam
its just that i know marthad want you to think of her boys as well as her girls
and if the girls are
ethan dont let the boys waste their lives in vengeance
ethan shrugs his arm free and mounts
promise me ethan
he ignores her and turns angrily to where martin is
harshly come on if youre comin
he digs spurs and rides out with the others
martin comes over with laurie a step behind
his face is set his eyes almost unseeing
a heartbroken murmur oh martin
well find them mrs
well find them
he swings into his saddle
laurie impulsively runs to his side steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the mouth
he looks at her dully as though hardly conscious of it
and she is back beside her mother
martin rides away after the others
slowly i almost hope they dont find them
laurie looks at her mother and understands
the search theme begins as we see the riders in turn
a series of portraits of the men
close shot brad and charlie riding point they come to a pause surveying the terrain ahead
charlie with an arm signal indicates he will take the left
brad nods and he rides out to the right
the main body of the men clayton passing first expression resolute competent
then ed nesby and old mose squinting at the ground as they ride all but sniffing like an old hound dog
martin next to last in file
finally ethan his face a study of relentless purpose
the two men are at a cairn of rocks their horses nearby
in the near distance clayton is leading the men of the search party at a fast clip toward the cairn
charlie is standing brad tearing the rock cairn apart
in charlies hands is a comanche head dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers
brad doesnt even look up as the men ride in and dismount but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried indian
another one eh
this un come a long way fore he died
well thats seven we can score up to your brother ethan
i dont like it
what dont you like
injuns on a raid generly hides their dead so you wont know how many theyve lost
if they dont care about us knowin it only spells one thing
they aint afraid of us followin or of us catchin up with em either
you can back out any time nesby
didnt say that
angrily indicating brad whats he doin that for
he wants to be sure
brad shifts another rock and looks grimly upon the face o
of the dead comanche
then he spits at it and stands
grim lets get along
to brad why dont you finish the job
with that he strides to the cairn whipping a knife out
he crouches over the body o
concealing what he is doing he bends to his bloody task
sam clayton crosses to stand behind him
gravely what good does that do
by what you preach
he stands now and he faces sam
but by what the comanche believe now he cant enter the spirit land but has got to wander forever between the winds
because i took his mangy scalp
he flings the scalp down and grinds it into the dirt with his heel
he wipes clean the blade of his knife as he crosses back to his horse
the men mount those who have dismounted and they ride off
brad is looking out into the night strain and tension in every line
beyond them we may see some of the other men sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire
a whisper if only shes alive
ill make it up to her
no matter whats happened
ill make her forget
shes just got to be alive
ethan crosses behind them carrying his blanket roll
he looks at them sourly
get some rest
they move off heading for their blankets
the camera holds on ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side
he fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies it by the light of the flickering little fire
it is a picture of martha
the camera pulls back to show ethan studying it gravely then putting it away and lying back to stare broodingly into the night
the four faces are just over the ridge peering at something far distant far below
could be a buffler
its horses i tell ya
its them all right
he starts to squirm down the ridge the others following
ethans group crosses to where the other men are waiting with the horses
theyre camped by the river bout twenty miles from here
soons it gets dark well circle out sos to jump em before daybreak
slowly youre right sure you want to jump em ethan
martin and brad stare at sam not understanding the question
but mose knows what he means and studiously looks into space
touch of defiance its what were here for aint it
i thought we were trying to get the girls back alive
we jump those comanches theyll kill em
you know that
bewildered angry but
but what are we doin then
what are we supposed to do
what i had in mind was runnin off their hoss herd
a comanche on foot is more apt to be willin to listen
that makes sense to me
angrily what do you know about it
whats a quarter breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him
you got as much chance of stampedin their herd as
as you have of findin those girls alive by ridin into em
i say we do it my way ethan
and thats an order
but if youre wrong captain clayton dont ever give me another
they look into each others eyes a moment then sam turns to mount
and the others follow
slowly then they start riding down the slope
note it is now planned to shoot this on sound stage
fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp
some cattails in the near ground
the effect is eerie very still except for the trilling of frogs
then very quietly the men emerge from the mist swirling around them
they are leading their horses
sam looks baffled angry
they stand still listening then slowly continue
the mist is thinning
in the f
is a small blackened area the ashes of a campfire
the men come through the mist wary vigilant
it is mose who first spots the fire
he runs to it and drops beside and feels the ashes
the others come up around him
they was here
to sam sure
they were here
now theyre out there
an waitin to jump us
he looks at clayton
you got any more orders captain
quietly just keep goin
they move on slowly
the mist is thinning as the men warily move along
suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and to one side
the men turn slightly hearing it
a moment later another owl hoot from the same side but up ahead
from the interchange of looks we must know that the riders are aware of its significance
mose cups hand to his mouth and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls
clayton glares at him
in soft apology jus bein sociable capn
ethan grins wryly
and now the first faint ruddy touch of the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn through the mist
the camera slowly pans from a sun touched butte or crag to the file of men slowly walking their horses
an occasional shred of mist drifts by
everything about the little cavalcade bespeaks tension watchfulness
suddenly and every man sees it at the same time we see a file of eight comanches ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance walking their horses at
the same pace and on a course roughly parallel with but slightly converging on our group
softly keep goin
brad who has been looking up ahead sounds a new warning
another indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group riding slowly very quietly
clayton slightly alters course veering slightly away from the converging files but still riding slowly
and then from ahead but at a yards another comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap
to clayton if you were tryin to surround em you sure succeeded
how fars the river from here mose
i been baptized reverend
yes suh been baptized thank ye
well you better brace yourself for another one
and with that yell he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an angle to the converging indian files and every man is with him
in the next instant the comanches whoop and give chase
with the ranger group short cutting in such a way as to outstrip the comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river
clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the rangers reach the bank
they rein in wheel their horses and are reaching for the rifles as the comanche vanguard races into view to find themselves opposed by seven veterans sitting their horses rifles
at their shoulders
the charge breaks as the seven rifles bark almost in unison and the indians wheel to shelter
and once again he spins his mount and takes off across the river followed by the others
as the men pound across
they dismount and charlie and nesby take the horses and run them to some place of protection as the men group around clayton and ethan
during this shouting his orders this is as good as any
charlie you and ed take the horses
mose runs over and crouches beside ethan
beyond ethan is martin then brad
nesby and charlie will rejoin the group after an appropriate interval
with all the men shielded behind river boulders etc
ethan and mose are hunkered down behind some rocks very casual and business like as they check rifles set out and carefully wipe cartridges
chattily minds me o the time joe powers an me fit us some kiowas
martin is in the throes of buck fever wiping mouth with back of his hand peering anxiously across the river
you think they mean to charge us uncle ethan
we found us an ole buffler wallow
staring across river criminy
on the opposite bank we see the full force of comanches riding into sight racing their mounts to the edge then wheeling off jeering taunting
brad starts to bring up his rifle
steady daniel boone
you dont want to miss
it makes them think their medicines stronger than yours
thats jest what i tole joe powers
that uns gettin kinda sassy aint he ethan
one comanche rides a few yards into the water brandishing his rifle taunting the white men
a moment later he is joined by a second brave
grimly real sassy
he and mose slowly bring their rifles to bear and then the two shots crack out almost simultaneously
and within split seconds both comanches fall
the others race away
sam comes charging over to ethan and mose
angrily i didnt give any order to fire
thats all right captain
i dont need any formal invitation to kill a comanch
grimly you got one now
and he drops behind a rock as with a wild whooping the comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit the river
the men open fire all but martin who has frozen staring wild eyed at the oncoming comanches
brad charlie clayton nesby are snapping shot after shot
only martin seems out of it
ethan shoots him a glance
slack your shoulders
your handsll take care of themselves
some of the tension leaves martin
somehow his gun is in position and he is firing as fast and well as the others
the comanches are coming in crouched low over their ponies necks whooping and firing
men and horses go down counted off by the expert marksmanship of the texans
but they keep coming
they drop their rifles now and pull out revolvers for close range work
one comanche breaks through from the side his buffalo lance ready for the thrust
ethan whirls and fires
the comanche horse charges through the defense line and out and there is a muffled scream of pain from ed nesby
the charge breaks and comanches wheel left and right racing back across the river
with magnificent horsemanship one brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows and swings him up behind
two others riding together head for one of the two dead comanches ethan and mose had downed on their first shots
swinging simultaneously from their saddles they grab the dead man and carry him off
cackling there goes yer scalp ethan
ethan snuggles his rifle to his shoulder as two other racing comanches prepare to pick up the other dead indian
most of the comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing away
the firing from the texans has stopped
i still got one out there
the angle is along his rifle barrel as it beads on one of the racing comanches trying to pick up the dead indian
claytons big hand grasps the rifle barrel
quietly no ethan
ethan looks up into claytons face
let them bury their dead
ethan pulls the gun free and looks out across the river
the comanches have done their work are riding away and over the saddle of one lies the limp form of the dead indian
ethan looks back at sam
that tears it reverend
from now on you keep out
mad now facing the others all of you
i dont want you with me
i dont need you
for what i got to do
quietly no need to shout mister
the camera swings to pick up the figure of nesby outstretched on the ground writhing in pain with charlie kneeling beside him
the men cross to stand around the fallen man
reckon we got to go back eds shoulder is smashed bad
i can make it
just get me on a horse
no good ed
and ethans right
this is a job for a company of rangers
or its a job for one or two men
right now were too many
an not enough
facing ethan only one way you can stop me lookin for lucy mister
an thats kill me
thats how i feel uncle ethan
correcting the slip ethan sir
ethan glares at them but has to accept it
but im givin the orders
you take em or we split up here and now
quickly why sure ethan
theres just the one thing were after
finding deborah and lucy
grimly turning away if theyre still alive
he heads away for his horse
brad and martin look at each other as the full import of ethans footnote strikes home
then they head for their own horses
ethan martin and brad mount
clayton crosses to them
you boys got enough shells
vaya con dios
the three re enter the river and slowly start across with clayton gravely looking after them
the three riders continue across the river
and the search theme resumes
a region of buttes and giant rock formations treeless arid and seemingly reaching out to infinity
far off we see a cloud of dust miles and miles off
only the dust nothing else
from behind camera ride the three men ethan brad and martin dust powdered eyes bloodshot
the three are watching that distant cloud of dust
they force their weary horses onward
the angle is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock into another long reach of valley different from the first view of it yet alike in its suggestion of
but now there is no cloud of dust far away nothing to suggest the passage of anything but time itself
ethan martin and brad ride into the fringe of the buttes shadow and scan the terrain ahead
shrill they got to stop sometime
if theyre human at all they got to stop
a human man rides a horse till it dies
then he goes on afoot
a comanche comes along
gets that horse up
and rides it twenty more miles
then he eats it
ethan turns to catch martin thirstily drinking from his canteen
angrily easy on that
we dont even know if debbie n lucy are with this bunch
maybe they split up
theyre with em if theyre still alive
brad wheels on him
youve said that enough
maybe lucys dead
maybe theyre both dead
but if i hear it from you again ill fight ya mr
an aside thatll be the day
note this is the gap in the rocks near the medicine country at monument
the three riders come to where the trail they have been following forks
the main horseprint track leading ahead a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes
four of em cut out here
ethan thinks he knows why
his face is bleak
but he tries to be casual
ill take a look
you keep after the others
he turns his mount toward the gap
eagerly you want us to fire a shot if
nor build bonfires
nor beat drums neither
ill meet you on the far side
hes still grumbling as he rides off
an abashed martin rides ahead along the broad trail with brad
note ethans serape tied behind his saddle should be clearly seen as he rides away not pointed up but visible
martin and brad riding in a direction opposite to that in which they had taken off indicating their circle route haul up momentarily as they spot ethan standing beside his
horse his back to them some distance along
they turn slightly off their course and ride out toward him
ethan turns almost startled as the two youths ride in
his serape is no longer behind his saddle
ethan looks at them blankly for a minute as though not really seeing them
they both stare at him
a vague gesture i
heres where they met up again
they both can see that
pointing trail leads off there
they look at him and each other for these are clearly unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from ethan
whyd they break off
no answer was there water in that canyon
you all right ethan
more like his usual gruff self sure im all right
he goes to his horse mounts
martin is right beside him and he notes the missing serape
what happened to your blanket
anyway i aint goin back to look for it
he leads out
brad rides up beside martin
again the two exchange puzzled looks
martin shrugs and the three continue along the broad trace of the indian ponies into the setting sun
ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so that barely the glow of the flames can be seen
beyond him martin is leading their unsaddled horses away
the men have come to the end of another long day
both men look up as brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the incline to their camp
his horse is lathered
shouting it i saw her
i saw lucy
martin runs to his side as brad slides off his mount
ethan moves more slowly
continuing theyre camped bout two miles over
i was just swingin back when i saw their smoke
i bellied up a ridge an they was right below me
did you see debbie
no but i saw lucy all right
she was wearin that blue dress
an she was walkin along
voice flat what you saw wasnt lucy
it was i tell you
what you saw was a buck wearin lucys dress
they stare at him i found lucy back there in that canyon
i wrapped her in my blanket an buried her with mown hands
i thought it best to keep it from you long as i could
he cant look at brad or at martin
brad cant speak and then finally did they
ethan wheels on him in shouting fury
blazing whatve i got to do draw you a picture
spell it out
dont ever ask me
long as you live dont ever ask me more
brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand
he turns walking stiff legged as though on stilts back to his horse
he bends his head against the saddle as though to hide his grief
martin turns away from him and walks back to ethan
and in that moment brad mounts and takes off in the same direction from which he had ridden in
frantically they run for their horses
he comes pounding down a slope and he takes off his hat and skims it away
he rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve the rush of raging blood
he reaches the crest and reins in
a distant firelight is on his face
he takes one moment to look down into the comanche camp o
then he has his gun out
his eyes are wild his face wet with sweat
then he throws back his head and he yells and with the yell goes charging into the camp
they rein in staring as from afar they hear brads yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls
there is nothing they can do
they hear his shouts then the quick bark of his
and the angry shouts of the comanche
his face is red with the reflected light of the fires he is passing o
and his eyes are alight with a crazy savage joy
his gun cracks once then again and the hammer clicks on a spent shell
he stands apart warbow drawn and arrow notched
he releases it at his running target
we hear its impact and a high gasp of pain
and then the jubilant yammering yells of other comanches
the distant yammering of the comanches doesnt quite drown out one stifled scream of pain we can surmise a scalping knife was busy in the last instance of brads life
martin slumps in his saddle
ethan listens a moment then turns to martin
lets just hope he took some with him
he turns his horse back the way they had come
martin stares at him
what you goin to do
get some sleep
tomorrows another day
slowly he rides away
slowly reluctantly but helpless to do otherwise martin follows
a study of horseprints etched in the soil the mark of the passage of many horses perhaps an eagle or turkey feather fallen from a warbonnet
and then we hear and see the approach of two plodding horses and the dusty boots of the horsemen ethan and martin following the trail
the search theme resumes and continues over the next three shots helping us suggest the passage of time the change of scene
the two figures are little more than specks in a vastness of savage country
again we study the hooves of two horses fighting their way up a rocky slope and past a thorn bush on which fluttering in the mountain wind is a torn
scrap of scarlet cloth with a bit of beadwork or indian decoration
it is a portrait study of two faces etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic fanatic masks
martin has aged years in a matter of months
falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly beards
bitterly say it
our turnin back dont change anything
not in the long run
if shes alive shes safe
for a while
theyll keep her to raise as one of their own til shes of an age to
he turns his mount
and you think we got a chance to find her
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks hes chased it enough
then he quits
same when he runs
seems he never learns theres such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin on
so well find them in the end i promise you that
well find them just as sure as the turning of the earth
the time is spring
it is a year and a half later
the jorgensen house is larger than the edwards place of sod and logs with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house one being the keeping room
the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous jorgensen brood
a meadowlark breaks into his sudden song
a dog or two come barking around the side of the house as ethan and martin ride slowly from behind camera toward the house
in that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and lars jorgensen comes to the door
jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up recognizing them of course but ill prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions
bearing a lamp mrs
jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes
two tow headed boys or come after her
jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand not even looking at the boys and they hurry out to take the reins as ethan and martin dismount
the passage of time has stamped martin and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him in the image of ethan
now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing later it will be in his walk in his speech or paucity of speech
neither man is sure of his reception
they are thinking of brad dead because of their search and martin is thinking of laurie
and then mrs
jorgensen is running across to martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son saying nothing just holding him
he stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace
ethan watches a moment then crosses to jorgensen
to jorgensen you got my letter about your son brad
just about this time a year ago
it came the day before his
the lord giveth the lord taketh away
jorgensen starts to lead the way inside
martin hangs back
i aint fit to go indoors miz jorgensen
these clothes is
laurie rushes past her mother
she kisses him hard and full on the mouth and has no eyes for anyone else
jorgensen looks on with amusement
martin is just bowled over
teasing and him probably forgettin all about you
probably cant even call your name to mind
and laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother
continuing but i fairly forgot just how pretty you was
laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors and there is no further resistance from martin
jorgensen and her husband converge then on ethan and her face is gravely questioning
the little one
ethan shakes his head
she squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors
this is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room and described in the book as the grandmother room with narrow slit like windows a set of single
bunk beds possibly a fireplace
martin is in a deep wooden tub taking a hot bath currying his back with a long handled brush
beyond him is the door
it opens and martin turns casually and at once stops being casual as laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered
what you doin
she picks up the shirt puts it over one arm she reaches for his long handled and ragged underwear runs a fist through a hole in its seat clucks and
shreds it into rags
during this a yelp dont go takin that stuff
aint worth the mendin
she turns and looks at him matter of fact
what you gettin red in the face for
i have brothers havent i
well i aint one of em
im a woman martie
he tries to say something but she goes right on we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives
when youre little we even wash you
how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman ill never know
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid
wouldnt bother me
she heads for the door i wouldnt try it in front of pa though was i you
and she is laughing as she closes the door behind her
it is a plastered room everything bright and shiny a big wood burning cookstove above it a row of shiny copper pots the furniture handmade and probably not too much
unlike the good plain swedish modern of today
there should be scandinavian accents in the decor
all told a cheerful warm smelling room
ethan is talking as laurie enters the room still carrying martins shirt the rags of his underwear
she will wait listening for a break in what ethan is saying to try to get her mothers attention
jorgensen is sitting in his usual chair with his boots off puffing his pipe more or less in tune with what ethan is talking about
jorgensen is in her rocker darning or knitting
ethan is standing near the mantel
an then it snowed and we lost the trail
no need to tell ya all the places we went
fort richardson fort wingate an cobb
the anadarko agency
trouble is we dont even know which band that war party belonged to
jorgensen looks up from her darning
well you did all a body could ethan
i got your boy killed
gently dont go blamin yourself
angrily its this country killed my boy
yes by golly
it so happens we be texicans
we took a reachin hold way far out past where any man has right or reason to hold on
or if we didnt our folks did
so we cant leave off without makin them out to be fools wastin their lives n wasted in the way they died
a texicans nothin but a human man out on a limb
this year an next and maybe for a hundred more
but i dont think itll be forever
someday this country will be a fine good place to be
maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come
the speech impresses everyone but laurie who probably hasnt heard a word of it
marties drawers is a sight
aint fit for rags
would it be all right if we gave him some of brads things
there is just the briefest hesitation
course it would
theyre in the chest
and she leads the way briskly with laurie following to a big chest at the far end of the room
rising excitedly by golly the letter
in the chest mama
it came for you ethan
ethan and jorgensen cross together to where mrs
jorgensen is raising the top of a huge dower chest
she extracts a letter wrapped in oilskin against moths
continuing joab wilkes of the rangers brought it
ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before venturing to open it
jorgensen is quite curious but trying not to seem nosy
the women remain at the chest pulling out various folded garments etc
finally ethan carefully opens it and takes out a letter dirty as to paper crudely printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two inch square snip of
calico to the bottom of the sheet
he reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused to words and then he turns the letter removes the nail and looks at the snip of cloth
she comes to him her arms piled with clothing and laurie a step behind her holding up a new pair of long handled underwear measuring it with her eyes for
will you look at this
he holds out the snip of calico
why its just a snip of calico
you ever see it before
like mebbe on a dress debbie wore
yes i remember
have they found her ethan
he takes the calico snip places it within the letter and carefully pockets it
he looks broodingly into the fire
continuing not yet
lauries face is troubled as she turns from him and heads for the grandmother room carrying the armful of clothes
martin is sitting sulkily on a cot wrapped in a blanket
he glares up as laurie enters
his feet are in his boots
might at least have left me my pants
time for bed anyway
putting clothes near him likely thesell need some takin in
oh martie youre that gaunted
mas havin a turkey for dinner tomorrow and
ethan opens the door enters
good night martie
good night mr
she wants to kiss martie but is shy in ethans presence and hurries out
martin stoops to remove his boots
ethan studies him and looks thoughtfully after the girl and at martin
he takes the letter out of his pocket as though he meant to read it and then he puts it back decisively
he starts to undress
martin lies back on his bunk
jorgensens been runnin his cattle with my own
staring your cattle
ethan returns the stare without any change of expression
hes agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while im gone
ill be pushin on tomorrow
i aint stayin
i set out lookin for debbie
i aim to keep on
because shes my
shes your nothin
shes no kin to you at all
i always felt like she was
her folks takin me in raisin me like one of their own
that dont make em kin
i aint got no kin
im goin to keep lookin thats all
you got any horses or money to buy em
you aint even got money to buy cartridges
jorgensens offering you a good livin here
martin throws himself back turns his face to the wall
ethan looks soberly at him and is sorry for the brutality of his words
i want you to know somethin
turning mad as hell yeah
you want me to know i aint got no kin no money no horses nothing but a dead mans clothes to wear
you tole me that already
now shut your head
it is a still scene with the first light of day in the sky a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney
she is in a robe made of an indian blanket belted snugly around her waist
she wears moccasins for slippers
her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor
she is at the stove frying bacon and eggs a coffee pot is on the boil
beyond her the door to the grandmother room opens and martin comes in dressed in brads clothes
his eyes whip around the room
laurie doesnt turn as he slowly approaches
quietly ethan rode on
an hour ago
the starch goes out of him
he walks heavily to the table and sits slumped
she looks at him compassionately
i dont know what you can do about finding debbie that he cant
he just shakes his head not looking at her
she lifts the food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him
hell find her now martie
please believe me
he shakes his head
she crosses to the stove for the coffee pot
thats what scares me him findin her
now it is her turn to stare
laurie ive seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word comanche ive seen him take his knife an never mind
but hes a man can go crazy wild
it might come on him when it was the worst thing could be
what i counted on i hoped to be there to stop him if such thing come
laurie has poured his coffee
now he sips it
she sits at the table with him
slowly i hoped i could hold you here
but i guess i knew
so i stole this for you
she takes ethans letter from her breast and hands it to him
he takes it puzzled and slowly reads it aloud
i bought a small size dress off a injun
if this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward
i know where they gone
martin is on his feet
hes got a little tradin post on the south fork o the brazos
laurie i just got to get me a good horse

but thats sweet face your own good horse
laurie goes to the front door and throws it wide
hysterically take it and welcome
but dont count on finding me here when you get back
ive been dallying around this god forsaken wind scour almost two long years waitin for you
i aint cut out to be an old maid
miserably i cant help it laurie
i just gotta catch up with ethan
he runs out and she slams the door then rests her head against it
jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees laurie with head pressed against the door
she wants to offer some word of sympathy but doesnt know what to say
she crosses to the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee
then we hear the drum of horses hooves the sound of martin riding away
laurie flings open the door almost as though to call him back
angling from behind laurie in the doorway as martin riding one horse leading another goes galloping away
low squat adobe structure with a crudely lettered sign board proclaiming it there are adjacent outbuildings and corral
four horses are tied outside two being pack animals
a surly looking white man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door whittling with a long bladed knife eyeing the horses covetously
he glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back
fearfully she quickens her step
the man gets up shoves knife into belt and heads into the post
it is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on shelves a counter which serves as a bar a few plank tables and benches
the breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table where another mean looking hombre sits preparing to play a game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards
ethan and martin are at a table in the center of the room examining a dirty rumpled childs dress debbies
martin nods soberly in answer to ethans inquiring look yes its hers
both look up as futterman crosses from the bar carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses his fingers thrust inside the glasses
futterman is a squaw man and a killer dead eyes in a white face
he sets the jug down picks up one of the glasses so grey and thumb printed it is almost opaque
both ethan and martin regard it with disgust
futterman gives a slight shrug takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it
martin snatches it out of his hand
harshly howd you come by this
you said thered be a thousand dollar reward
thats what i said
you got it with you
ethan looks at him and beyond toward the two men
the solitaire player has a card in mid air frozen watching
the other man has the same buzzard watchful look
rewardll be paid when i find her an if shes alive
futterman uncorks the jug prepares to drink
mans got a right to expect some kind o payment
i laid out for the dress an sendin you the writin
he tilts the jug to his mouth as ethan reaches for his heavy leather pouch
futterman watches greedily as ethan lets a gold piece slide out
he tosses it onto the table
twenty yankee dollars
futterman puts the jug down
his hand inches as though pulled by a magnet toward the gold piece
an a mans time is worth somethin
ethans big hand clamps over futtermans and he starts squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon
futtermans lips whiten
a young buck fetched it in late last summer
ethan eases the grip said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar
never heard of any chief scar
but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches
scars band was headin north
to winter in at fort wingate
eatin agency beef
thats what this buck said
maybe he lied
and maybe you lie
in that case you wont find her and i wont get my thousand dollars
martin takes the dress and folds it carefully
too casually stay the night if you want
ethan shakes his head cards
if youd like some company we got a few squaws on the place
ethan and martin head for the door
the two plug uglies stand mean ready to do their masters bidding
dont forget to come back with my thousand dollars
aint yours yet
the camera holds on futterman as he slowly rubs his bruised hand
his henchmen drift toward him
slight smile bad manners
he shoulda said good bye
they have set up camp near a cluster of cottonwoods to which the horses have been tied
one of the horses is restless possibly nickering
ethan strokes its neck looking out thoughtfully into the night listening
acts like somethins out there
heading toward campfire smells a change in the weather
camera pans him to where martin is spreading his blanket some little distance from the small fire
wouldnt surprise me if we didnt have a frost fore mornin
he picks up a saddle and puts it close to fire whynt you bed down closer to the fire boy
martin is a bit surprised as ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle making the saddle serve as a pillow
then ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire making it blaze up
whats the idea
maybe im gettin like mose harper my bones is cold tonight
he spreads his own blanket as martin wraps into his bedroll and when martin turns he casually arranges the blanket to suggest it is over the figure of a man
during this funny
when we passed through fort wingate last winter we didnt hear mention of any nawyecky comanche there
ethan steps back and studies the dummy
not so funny
if you recollect what nawyecka means
ethan studies martins back the light on him and looks around figuring the range of fire
sorta like roundabout like a man says hes goin one place when he means to go just the reverse
you all settled an comfortable now
martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket
ethan nods his satisfaction sure martin isnt going to change positions
then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy
he picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp
three shadowy figures futterman and his two henchmen are quietly dismounting taking rifles from saddle scabbards
at a hand signal from futterman they quietly fan out afoot
still snug in his blankets sound asleep the fire burning a little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him
at a crouch or crawling the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp
martin is asleep and next to him is ethans dummy hat over its face and the fire still burning
the two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position
a shot cracks
and one man is knocked flat on his face
the other whirls in the direction of the shot his rifle swinging in search of a target
a second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist
martin is sitting up now staring wildly around
futterman starts to run down slope away from the hidden marksman dodging between the rocks
a third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area
martin is on his feet now
he is staring at futterman face down and almost at his feet
he looks around in fear at someone approaching hand going to his gun
then he relaxes as ethan casually enters the camp bareheaded carrying his rifle
you did just fine
ethan kneels beside futterman turns him over reaches into his pockets first one then another
he just couldnt wait
watching him go through pockets whatchu doin
ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold piece in the air catches it and pockets it
even got my twenty dollars back
we did all right
and now martin is getting the whole picture
and hes mad
you just used me for bait staked me out like a
buildin up the fire
fixin it sos
i coulda had my brains blowed out
ethan is just grinning at him completely unruffled denying none of it
explosively suppose youd missed
ethan sobers a little seems honestly surprised
never occurred to me
it is a day in early winter
charlie maccorry short coated is galloping across the yard as jorgensen crosses it carrying a load of firewood
calling it howdy mister jorgensen
maccorry swings off his saddle near the porch as the door opens and mrs
jorgensen comes out shawled against the cold
got a letter here
jorgensen lets the cordwood drop
for miss laurie
come in charlie come in
calling inside laurie
two letters in the one year
as charlie enters following mrs
jorgensen excitedly enters and closes the door
laurie comes in from another room
charlie smiles and bows clumsily
to laurie a letter for you laurie
figgered it might be the news you been waitin for
he hands the letter to laurie who comes over eagerly takes it and studies the wrapper before opening it
real good o you to ride all the way over charlie
might at least say your thank yous laurie
no need to
but laurie has no interest in anything but the letter which she is reading skimmingly
dont keep a body just standin
laurie looks up then
impatiently i was just readin to see if
anyway its my letter
agreeably course it is
now lets all get comfortable an set sos we can listen while laurie reads her letter
turning as if to go maybe id better be goin
you stay charlie
after all charlie brought the letter laurie
he got a right to listen too
jorgensen has been pulling and pushing chairs around and now they all take places
jorgensen automatically reaches for his glasses on the mantel and puts them on even though he isnt going to read the letter
laurie has been sneaking looks at some of the other pages
surrendering oh all right
from the beginning
dear miss laury
he spells it with a y instead of an i
wouldnt you think hed know
who cares what he spells it
read the letter
dear miss laury
i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them comanches the late mister futterman told us about
she breaks off looks up puzzled
the late mister futterman
that means mister futterman is dead by golly
wonder what happened to the poor man
go on laurie
resuming the letter we cut north through indian territory and
her voice fades leading their pack animals
martins voice picks up the narration
soon we was meeting up with kiowas an wichitas an even some comanches camped by one of the agencies
the camp is on the outskirts of a trading post
indians watch unsmilingly from tepees or in little clusters afoot a few mounted braves ride on parallel courses as ethan and martin ride through camp toward the post
but none of them was nawyeckys nor claimed to know a war chief named scar
hes the one the late mister futterman said had debbie
this trading post is in marked contrast to futtermans being well stocked clean and presided over by hiram appleby a resolute clean looking man of middle years
ethan and martin in winter garb are being shown a variety of trade goods including a shoebox full of ornate ribbon rosettes such as are awarded animals at stock fairs
appleby is solemnly affirming the trade value of these as well as sleeve garters etc
at one o the agencies we outfitted with all kind an manner of trade goods
figgerin thatd make it easier for us to come an go
youd laugh if i told you what was our biggest seller
ethan is ceremoniously pinning something on the stern faced buck
it is one of the rosettes seen in the shoebox
camera moves to an extreme closeup of the rosette
on it in gold letters is as the indian proudly steps back we see beyond him a half dozen other braves all rosetted
ethan looks them over complacently while martin to hide the smile that threatens to split his face bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs
reading the letter
she is at the bottom of a page
there is one other thing i got to tell you before you hear it from ethan
how i got myself a wife
she stops and stares
she looks at them dazed
delightedly he did
smacking his knee very happy indeed good
a young man should get married early in life
jorgensen full of sympathy for laurie just glares at her husband
every young man should at least once
go on laurie
haltingly a little comanche squaw squaw
and with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the fire
jorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace to recover the letter
he fetches it out beating the sparks out
the letter is basically undamaged
sternly is no way to treat a letter laurie mama maybe you better read it
to charlie proudly my wife was a school teacher charlie she reads good
laurie snatches the letter back
ill read it
charlie crosses the room picks up a guitar
smugly so he married a comanche squaw
haw haw haw
laurie glares at him
he begins chording the guitar
look is somewhat under five feet tall pigeon toed platter faced and wide eyed
over her arm is a very handsome blanket
she is coming forward shyly toward martin propelled by a comanche her father
martin with an armful of trade goods a few yards of bright calico a couple of aged sow rosettes and some trinkets is indicating the blanket
look glances shyly at her father
he shakes his head negatively
look is disappointed
the father points to martins pile of trade goods
martin bends and picks up the indicated object it is a battered high crowned beaver hat
the indian grunts his approval and puts it on
look looks relieved
martin reaches for the blanket
look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger wait
then she runs back through the other comanches now crowding forward
who rides in slowly leading their pack horse and martins horse
quietly lets go
i think i stumbled onto somethin
the name registers with some of the nearer braves
there is a quick interchange of glances frowning hostile
angrily when are you goin to learn to keep your mouth shut
lets get out of here
but i just bought a good blanket
curtly forget it
martin mounts and the two ride out
the comanches stare after them suspiciously resentfully
they are riding down a slight grade beyond which we can assume is the comanche camp
what i heard back there was that a band o hostile nawyeckas came through this way lessn two weeks ago
excitedly think it might be
he breaks and both turn as look rides over the hill on a little spotted indian pony with her squaw bag slung up behind her and her blanket over the
she closes the gap between them
whats she followin for
look smiles shyly at martin
look i changed my mind
you can keep your blanket
he gestures for her to go back
go on back
she stares and then dutifully wheels her horse
martin and ethan face front again
look wheels her horse again and is right with them
martin stops exasperated
you dont understand
he waves her away i dont want it
look just sits
explosively you dont understand ya chunkhead
you didnt buy any blanket
ya bought her
you got yourself a wife sonny
a wail oh no
tell her shes got to go back
and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin one o their women
come on mrs
look smiles and sets her horse in motion as ethan moves ahead
martins face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up
he is mouthing the words mrs
and ethan suddenly breaks into song to the tune of skip to my lou singing i got another gal purtiern you
i got another gal purtiern you
i got another gal purtiern you
skip to my lou my darlin
ethan is wrapped in his blanket roll head propped by an elbow grinning sardonically as he watches a strange ritual in the camp
the score is softly reprising skip to my lou
look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm her head shyly downcast not far from where martin back to her is spreading his own bed roll
he sits on it then and begins pulling off his boots
he is very conscious of ethans watchful scrutiny
finally he is ready
he lies back on his blanket
at once look is at his side to spread her own blanket
martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free and wraps it protectively around him
she stares at him puzzled
in comanche pah
she nods her understanding hurries off to fetch a canteen
martin glares at ethan
thats the way to train em
looks like mrs
pauleys goin to make you a fine beautiful wife
cut it out will ya
look returns with the canteen hands it to martin and kneels beside him
he looks at her sympathetically
i wish i could explain to you
and now look speaks for the first time
she indicates herself
now she jabbers in comanche and at the appropriate time will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying
nay tzare tsala ta komal ta name
unt kang yah look
which means my father calls me wild goose flying in the night sky
but you call me look
martin looks blank but ethan chuckles
says her names wild goose flying in the night sky
but shell answer to look since it pleases ya
she nods and smiles and quickly settles alongside him and spreads her blanket over them both
martin recoils plants his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling
ethan busts a gut laughing
martin jumps to his feet angrily
hotly i dont think its so funny
if you want to do some good whynt you ask her where scar is
ethan stares at the girl
her face is suddenly impassive as she looks from martin to the ground
grimly she heard ya all right
an she knows
he gets to his feet and he crosses to stand before her
so does martin
unt osupanet cah nay scar
meaning you know where scar is
she stares sullenly not answering
you ask her
she faces him scar
sign talk do you know where he went
and if he has a girl with him
a white girl nai bist pabo taibo
she indicates martin
she indicates herself
mah nee koo ur
meaning your woman
shaking head no
not my wife
to ethan how do you say sister
in comanche nami
she looks gravely from ethan to martin
then with impassive face she bends swiftly picks up her blanket and walks away from them to choose her own sleeping place
the two men dont know what to make of it
it is the same scene the following morning
the men are standing above where look had bedded for the night looking at the ground
clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely drawn arrow
beats me how she could get that pony out o camp without neither of us hearin a thing
she aint goin back to her family thats certain
not if she took off where the arrow points
think she means for us to follow
how should i know
shes your wife
he walks toward their horses starts to saddle up
i think maybe we oughta
hiding a grin yeah i kinda figgered youd say that
bein a new husband and all
and ethan starts singing skip to my lou half under his breath
martin gives him a sour side glance and continues saddling
jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table where laurie is reading against the fading light of day
jorgensens pipe has gone out and he lights it
maybe she left other signs for us to follow but well never know cause it snowed all day and all the next week
we were heading north through the buffalo country when something happened that i aint got straight in my own mind yet
her voice fades the two men are picking their way through a snow mantled grove
martins voice resumes the narration
ethans always been throwing it up to me that im a quarter breed
i never figgered it made much difference
but this day we came on a small herd
we needed some meat so we circled round
and came up on em afoot
they hadnt been hunted so it was no trick workin in close
the two men walk from behind camera
ethan aims fires and brings down a bull
ethan got a nice one on his first shot but then he began killing one after another cows as well as bulls fast as he could fire and load
it was just a slaughter
no sense to it
shots cracking out the terrified bawling of the bulls the beginning of the stampede
martin strides across to where ethan is firing
ethan quit it
firing again nine
another shot ten
whats the sense in it
ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches martin by surprise and fells him
in a fury hunger
thats the sense in it you cherokee
he swings up his gun and fires again and again
as martin stares at him from the ground
fear maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing the deadly marksman
rifle shots keep cracking out
the thunder of the hooves is receding and ethan grimly lowers his rifle
martin picks himself up still staring at ethan as though at a madman
ethan turns and looks at him
least they wont feed any comanches this winter
killin buffalos as good as killin injuns in this country
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo too
aint that too bad
if you feel that sorry for your kinfolk im surprised you didnt take up with that squaw wife of yours
he whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead buffalo o
martin looks after him with troubled expression
suddenly he hears something borne faint by the wind
now faintly little more than a shred of sound is the distant blowing of a bugle
aint that a bugle
ethan stares and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots from long miles off
grimly just hope we aint too late
and the two break and run for their horses
as narrator it was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high tailin it back to the agency with their prisoners squaws mostly by the time
ethan and me reached the camp
horses and riders plunge downslope through breast high snow
it was the nawyecky comanches all right the ones wed been looking for all this time
as they ride in passing dead horses a few bodies of men
trouble of it was that the soldiers had hit when most of the fightin men was away huntin maybe
so most of the dead was old men and women an kids
and it was in one of the tepees ethan found her the little squaw who wanted me to call her look
ethan has dismounted in front of one of the tepees heads inside
as ethan enters
a body looks is sprawled on the ground
he crosses turns her over
martin enters behind him
well youre a widower now
angrily whatd the soldiers have to kill her for
he sees something clutched in her hand
he stoops quickly
ethan who has turned indifferently to leave pauses
martin shows him what look had been clutching debbies rag doll
its hers debbies
ethan snatches it stares at it
then he turns and runs from the tepee
martin stares at looks body then covers it with a robe
so we knew debbie had been in the village
what look was doing there whether shed come to warn them or maybe to find debbie for me
theres no way of knowing
he turns and then slowly heads out
ethan stands there his expression bleak looking at the scene
martin joins him
we gotta catch up with them yellow legs
maybe they got her with them
ethan isnt thinking of that at all
harshly and maybe they got scar
they start away fast
a long line stretching across the landscape women falling and being prodded along by their captors
from behind camera ride ethan and martin and move to intercept the column
as ethan and martin come closer and look at the shawled prisoners stumbling along
as a young officer spurs out of the column and rides toward them
were looking for a girl a white girl
shed be about thirteen now
we got two around that age
youll have to wait until we reach the agency
fall in behind the column
protestingly but couldnt you
shouting it keep the column moving
close ranks there
the officer spurs out to rejoin the column
martin looks at ethan his face alive with hope
but ethan is just looking stonily along the line of passing prisoners
the column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency colorado footage
we see the dead and wounded on travois the agency indians watching stoically the prisoners some of them being herded into a chapel
the office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters
the general is being interviewed by two eastern newspaper correspondents
at a table beyond is a telegrapher sending out a report of the victory
a pot bellied stove supplies heat and the general is warming his hands at it intermittently
an adjutant is rather wearily filling out a long official form
the general for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well known glory hunter of the indian wars
he wears a colonels straps but insists upon his brevet rank
and it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one
with all the advantage of terrain
four to one
what did you do general
ethan and martin enter stand in the doorway
impressively sir we charged
gentlemen and i hope you will quote me i cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp
blurting it cheyenne
turning and staring i beg your pardon
that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche
chief scars bunch
what a wonderful name
to his aide are you getting this keefer
to ethan how do you spell that word nawyecka
ethan ignores him still facing the general
my names edwards
im looking for my niece
she was in that camp when you attacked
i know there were some captives recovered
bitterly four of em dead
so we were told
uncomfortably unfortunately the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village
are you sure they didnt die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o yank bluebellies so scared they couldnt tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche
put this man under arrest
thatll be the day
scornfully as we developed the village
next time you develop a village hit it where the fightin men are
you wont get any headlines for killin squaws
shall i show him the captives sir
just get him out of here
he crosses to ethan this way
the door is opened by a guard and ethan takes a step into the room then stops in manifest shock
martin is at his heels eager and expectant
beyond them stands keefer grave and compassionate
there is a keening sound in the room almost an animal sound
it is a simple log sided room with plank benches without backs
up front is a small box like pulpit no altar
across the front of the room set up either on benches or on boards over saw horses are four blanket covered figures at least two being the bodies of children
squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in indian robes
standing facing the newcomers is a woman who may be no more than in her mid thirties
she is mad wild eyed frightened with matted unbrushed golden hair torn garments
it is she who has been making the keening sound the animal moans
now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape
two girls are asleep heads together and backs to the door
one has light hair like debbies the other brown hair
the afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair
he has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room
now the madwoman begins her screaming running from side to side like a trapped animal
ethan follows martin into the room keefer behind him
martin comes to a stop realizing the woman is afraid of him
the two sleeping girls stir but do not turn
dont be scared maam
the madwoman crouches behind one of the benches looking at them with frightened eyes
just dont pay any attention to her
martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light haired girl
he reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder
at the touch the girl is on her feet crouching one hand like a claw drawn back to rake his face
she is unmistakably a white girl but she is painted like a comanche woman her ears red inside streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face
her eyes are frightened yet full of hate
the other girl has risen almost in the same instant but more out of fear
she is younger but painted like the other
she moves to stand behind the savage one
i aint sure
wheres that doll
martin stares at him then realizes what he has in mind
he fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl
she looks at it
and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory but then she spits at it
the other girl laughs
martin turns away and hes sick
was your niece about their age
not far from it
hard to realize theyre white isnt it
grimly theyre not white any more theyre comanche
lets see the bodies
martin nerves himself for the ordeal turns to follow
i dont need you
ethan and keefer move away
as they do the madwoman eyes fixed on the rag doll in martins hand begins creeping up behind him
martin is torturedly watching ethan and keefer as first one blanket then another is raised we will never see the dead
during this the dispassionate pro id like you to see them all
it might help us identify them
shot in the head flash burn range
the boy got his skull cracked
heres the girl
martin stiffens waiting
and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands
she cradles it and she croons
martin reaches to take it away
but she calmly sits cradling the doll and rocks to and fro humming a lullaby
he cant take it
well we only got the one lead scar
and where we begin to look i dont know
theres one thing
we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp
couldnt help noticing that most of it was mexican
maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border
what do they call themselves
thats the breed
course it might take time
times running out
but im obliged to you
laurie has reached the last page of the letter reading it by the lamp on the table
jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe
charlie is in the shadows a guitar in his hands not playing it but occasionally softly picking a note or chord
jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron
so were setting out for new mexico territory in the morning
i am sorry i wont be back for christmas again this year
she swallows hard pauses a moment in her reading
quick sympathy and you knittin that muffler
impatiently whats the difference
well i just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let someone get some good of it
she looks almost too obviously at charlie which annoys laurie
laurie resumes her letter reading peering closely theres a word crossed out
it looks like i wish or i will
she gives up anyway
i set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same
i remain respectfully
forlornly yours truly martin paulie
thats all there is
not a cross on it
laurie just looks at it
jorgensen stands pocketing his pipe easing the crick in his back
he ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel
they never find that girl
half to herself yours truly
hotly and he even has to write his full name
not even just martie
she stands i dont care if he never comes back
she heads for the front door
rising saying it without conviction now laurie
charlie hits the guitar a little stronger
jorgensen looks at him and the matchmaker is at work
charlie youll stay for supper
now i wont take no for an answer
thought of saying no never crossed my mind miz jorgensen
no place id rather be than right here right now
jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties
laurie has opened the door and is staring out wistfully
and charlie begins playing and singing a verse from skip to my lou
singing one old boot and a button shoe one old boot and a button shoe
the search theme is heard again as the two riders with single pack horse are heading south through new mexico
it is hot country
their faces are sun tanned burned dark and dry
gone are the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days
they do not speak just ride and there is the same bleak fanatic hard look about them both
the music theme segues into something livelier and mexican as we it is a small place a single dirt street a few adobe houses a few racks of dried meat
a burro with a load of faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy the music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the street
before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse without a saddle only a blanket pad
there is something familiar about the horse and ethan is staring at it as they ride in
the two men dismount beating dust out of their clothes
ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside
martin pauses beside ethan
martin shakes his head
they start toward the cantina
there couldnt be two like that in all the world
as ethan and martin enter
it is a dirt floored room with a small bar near the door chairs and benches along the walls
a pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room
a couple of mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes slapping the dominoes down hard
emilio figueroa back to the door spurred boots across one of the tables is sipping a drink
emilio is a cynical middle aged aristocratic looking man in modified charro costume
watching the domino game is estrella lithe sensuous smoking a brown paper cigarette she is barefoot
behind the bar is the proprietor dozing on his stool
ethan takes a step into the room
loudly the proprietor awakens
the domino game is suspended in mid play
and from beside emilio previously obscured by the mans back and the big charro hat pokes the head of old mose
emilio turns then to look at the newcomers
he is on his feet and advancing to meet them
as he recognizes them a wide foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that wont come out
he grabs and shakes ethans arm then martins
leggo my arm
you look mangier n ever
aint been too good
no sir not too good
gettin old ethan
you were born old
all smiles as they head for the bar bienvenidos senores
beaming y par el viejo el vino del pais
martin puts his back to the bar leans elbows on it and looks around
she is giving him an appraising once over then signals the musicians to play
she rests her buttocks against a table and waits her eyes challenging martin to make a move
emilio is watching estrella and martin with something akin to bored amusement
ethan has poured a drink for mose now one for himself leaving martins glass empty
i been helpin ye ethan
i been lookin all the time
martin turns back to the bar to take his glass
he finds it empty
to ethans back thanks for nothin
he angrily throws a coin on the counter appropriates the bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to estrella
neither ethan nor mose seems aware of his going
well the reward still stands
dont want no money ethan
jus a place a roof over m head
a little grub
a bunk to sleep in
an a rockin chair by the fire
my own rockin chair by a fire
you help me find her you got your rockin chair
swear it ethan
impatiently told ya didnt i
i found a mans seen her
knows where little debbie is
ethan stares at him
mose nods his reaffirmation of it
then ethans hand locks on the old mans shoulder
where is he
mose winces under the grip
he cant speak but he looks past ethan and he points
emilio swings his boots off the table and slowly crosses to them
he lets cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth
then he smiles
i am this man senor
emilio gabriel fernandez y figueroa
at your service
afterthought for a price
he smiles always for a price
as the men study each other estrella begins her dance and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a metronome
emilio looks at the bottle on the bar disdainfully pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to bring something better
he is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl hungrily
she is doing her swaying dance playing up to him and with unmistakable effect
he sloshes another drink into his glass and never taking his eyes off her downs it
beyond estrella we see ethan emilio and mose at the bar gestures headshakes the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation
then ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into emilios hand
meanwhile dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with martin
and the tequila is working
he gets to his feet a little groggily
estrellas smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes
ethan turns then his deal with emilio concluded and he sees what is going on
he starts for martins table just as martin moves out to take the girl
tolerantly come on don juan
were on our way
martin tries to push him away his eyes still on the girl
thickly lemme alone
taking his arm you breeds are all alike two drinks an
martin breaks free and squares off
take yer hands offn me
this lady an me got some things to talk over
estrella ranges herself alongside of martin and slips an arm possessively through his
a shrug suit yourself
while youre enjoyin your little conversation ill be ridin out with senor fernandez here
the comanch medicine country aint far
theres one camp with a chief named cicatriz
never heard of him
cicatriz is mex for scar
an he has a white girl in his tepee
be seein you
he turns and heads out
emilio who has come up behind him gives estrella a slight smile and bow
buena suerte estrella
hasta la vista
he follows ethan
estrella swings her body close to martin and lets her arms slide around his neck
softly tu quieres
martin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire
a bitter laugh sure
only not this year
he pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others
mose catches his arm
mind ethan bout my rockin chair
martin continues out and mose stands there his head rockin as though he already were in his chair
a small pack train nine or ten horses six or seven men winds through a canyon behind which we can see huge needles of rock majestic savage country
at the head of the column ride ethan emilio and martin
behind them come emilios cargadores lean hard bitten wiry little mexicans
one leads a handsome palomino
the sound of the castanets echoes in the musical theme
ethan is looking around with grim interest
medicine country huh
slight smile medicine so strong they believe the feather of an eagle found here can guard a man against bullets
looking ahead if you got one handy nows the time
ethan and emilio both look in the direction of his glance
they are turning a bend and now ahead we see a cordon of comanches all armed all quiet all very menacing as they watch the approaching column
emilio calls a greeting in comanche
it gets no answer
the camera picks up the faces in turn as from the white mens viewpoint as they ride slowly by
one tepee stands apart from the others scars
beyond it are other tepees the gathering of braves and some squaws the drying racks for meat etc
emilio leads the way toward the central tepee
they dismount nearby and emilio inclines his head toward the one tepee
ethan and martin brace themselves and wait
the flap of the tepee is closed
gruffly what are we waiting for
emilio cautions him with a hand gesture
the flap is thrust aside and scar steps out the same comanche we had seen at the grave when debbie was captured
he stands tall arrogant eyeing the white men with hard implacable eyes
he has a robe gathered about him
across his face is a scar
this is cicatriz
the white mens eyes are as hard as the comanches this is the man they have long sought the killer the raper
they cannot mask the hatred they feel
at last scar
its plain to see where you got your name
scars hand moves to the scar on his face and a finger runs along it
your name big shoulders
his name he who follows
you speak pretty good american for a comanche
someone teach you
it is a leading question and scar knows it
he looks long at ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips
but he makes no direct answer
he looks instead to emilio
in comanche ah we pabbo tie bo ee kee tay
why did you bring the gringos here
a shrug in comanche pabbo tie bo kim te moo er
the gringos want to trade
we come to trade
only not out here
with sign language accompaniment i dont stand talkin in the wind
emilio quickly turns and calls to one of his men
emilio is worried
one of the mexicans comes on the trot leading in the palomino
emilio makes a gesture giving it to scar
co bay tabitz chat
meaning very fine horse
scar looks at it greedily then nods
hell accept it
he looks at ethan
again that faintly contemptuous smile
he signals them to enter his tepee
to martin stay out here
he follows ethan into the tepee
and a worried emilio goes along
a small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak
two chunky squaws who have been tending the fire or grinding corn in a rock pestle scuttle to a side of the tepee
two others one half grown and the other slightly taller sit with their backs to the fire huddled over some leather work or stitching
both are shawled
as scar enters he barks a word to the squaws near the fire
then he turns to the white men sit
he sits on some robes signs for them to sit opposite
slowly they look around them
they are sitting with heads averted slightly profiled but clearly indian women broad faced dark of hair and skin
his sons are dead
so his wives sit on the honor side of his lodge
glancing at them are those his wives too
one of the squaws turns and even in the shadows we see it is another indian face
the other does not turn
scar leans in blocking the view
two sons killed by white men
for each son i take many scalps
in comanche mayah kay zee eh
bring the lance
the slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesnt move
louder the girl gets to her feet
ethan and martin watch as still with averted face she crosses to where a lance hangs from the tepee wall
it has several scalps on it including one with light red hair
slowly she carries it back
scar never takes his eyes from the faces of the white men savoring every moment of it
the girl extends the lance between them so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists
neither ethan nor martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole
then slowly their eyes lift
and the camera moves in and raises to as the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair the slant green eyes looking at them from a tanned but still
white and very beautiful face
note to music the search theme should cover all the foregoing action but at the first clear view of debbie it ends dramatically
debbies eyes hold theirs and then scars voice is heard in comanche pie kay
swiftly she straightens takes away the scalp pole and goes back to her former place
scar is watching the white men like a hawk
martins eyes are wide and his breathing seems suspended
but ethan is playing it like a poker player
his voice controlled ive seen scalps before
scars eyes are mocking
he lets his robe slip back from his shoulders revealing a bare bronzed chest on which glinting in the reflected firelight is the medallion that ethan had given debbie
it is suspended by a chain or rawhide string
scar touches it
ethan smiles and hes still playing poker
and the others follow
scar is puzzled
to emilio i came to trade not to admire his collection
tell him were going to pitch camp across the crick
maybe we can talk trade tomorrow
scar hasnt understood all of it
he scowls and looks at emilio
in comanche ee sap
pabbo tie bo ee sap
the gringo lies
placatingly tomorrow manana puetze
scar looks at ethan and at martin
he smiles slightly and he nods his agreement
martin and ethan turn to go
only then does debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away
martin cant help but pause but ethan prods him toward the tepee flap
they emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away not fast not slow and without a side glance
scar emerges and looks after them glowering
a few other comanches begin to gather near his tepee
urgently walk with dignity
after a moment lips hardly moving if you gringo heretics have any prayers say them
transfigured shes alive
can you believe it shes alive
an we found her
i too am alive
i wish to stay that way
they reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train surrounded by suspicious comanches
to his men vamanos
they mount and ride out
emilio is standing near his horse talking to ethan and martin
you understand senores
it is not that i am cobarde
you did your job
emilio nods and mounts
he knows you who you are and why you are here
this i did not understand
or i would not
even for gold senores
have led you here
he fumbles for a pouch holds it out to ethan
i do not want blood money
vaya con dios
he digs spurs and rides out
ethan turns and looks soberly at martin
we hear the rest of the riders moving away
ethan and martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the creek where their horses are waiting
you figger scar means to kill us
hes got to
all these years runnin dodgin knowin we were after him
now we caught up
its him or us
why didnt he make his move back there
i dont know
somethin tied his hands
he breaks and both wheel as sand slides from the top of the dunes
they look up
debbie is silhouetted atop the dune looking down at them
barely breathing the name debbie
she slides down the dune to stand across the creek from them
her hand cautions them to silence and against coming any closer
in comanche unnt meah
both men move closer
she takes a frightened step back as if to run
dont you remember me
she looks long at him
in comanche unnt meah
softly we aint goin
we aint goin without you debbie
ethan get the horses
ill try to keep her talkin
shes even forgot her own language
debbie youre comin with us
these have been her first words in english
and they bring new hope to martin
i dont care what theyve done to you
angrily they have done
they are my people
they murdered your family
reverting to comanche ee sap
furiously white men killed them to steal cows
i ran away
they find me
take care of me
that aint what happened
they been lyin to you
all white men lie
debbie think back
remember how i used to let you ride my horse
tell you stories
dont you remember me debbie
at first i prayed to you
come and get me
take me home
you didnt come
ive come now
these are my people
in comanche unnt meah
grimly stand aside boy
martin turns as ethan slowly reaches for his gun
it takes martin a moment to realize what he is about to do
he moves quickly then to put himself between ethan and the girl and in that instant there is the crack of a rifle
ethan is hit in the leg
it goes out from under him
martin swings and his gun is out and firing
a mounted comanche is on the crest of the dune above them rifle raised
martins first shot brings him down the dune in a spectacular horse and man fall
debbie goes running like a deer up the creek away from martin in the same instant we hear the angry yells of distant comanches charging from the far left
martin turns to see debbie running away
ethan is on his feet now and limping frantically toward their horses
he shoves martin ahead of him
angrily never mind her
they mount and take off just as the vanguard of the attacking comanches swings around a point of rock and comes charging toward the creek
as ethan and martin race their horses from the creek area and down a long incline as from the heights above a dozen or more comanches led by scar come
tearing after them
ethan is swaying in his saddle just barely hanging on as martin races up behind him driving ethans horse along
they swing past a huge outcrop of rock and go tearing along a vaulting wall of stone
their hoofbeats and those of the pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls and bullets whine and ricochet
they swing around giant boulders up ended like pancakes
ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle barely conscious
martin spots the cave ahead and drives his mount and ethans toward it
martin pulls his horse in and swings off just as ethan slides from his saddle
he runs toward one of the huge boulders crouches and starts firing
the comanches are spread out but coming on fast
one goes down under martins fire
another is hit in the arm
he pulls up and the other comanches wheel away from the hidden marksman
martin runs back from his firing post toward where ethan has fallen
angrily go on
get out of here while you can
pointing to the cave over there
ethan turns and sees what he means
he starts dragging himself to the cave as martin grabs the rifles from their saddle scabbards yanks off the water canteens and then drives their horses away
then he too runs for the shelter of the cave
both men are crouching rifles ready
in the distance we see their horses running off pursued by some yelling comanches
four or six others come into sight heading for the cave moving cautiously uncertainly not seeing their quarry
then the white men open fire and the comanches bend low over their horses necks and clear out of there
ethan looks grimly at martin
theyll be back
we wont be here
he gets an arm under ethan and hauls him to his feet
camera pans from the top of the rock chimney to where martin is snaking his way through carrying newly filled water canteens
he stands there listening and looking back the way he has come and then satisfied there has been no pursuit he continues away
ethan is lying on the hard earth perhaps cushioned with some boughs
he is half delirious
a small fire is burning
martin enters carrying the canteens
he looks unsympathetically toward ethan then continues to the fire takes a knife and starts to sterilize it
ethan gasps mumbles and then a word comes clear
martin stares at him and now perhaps for the first time he is fitting pieces into the jig saw puzzle
he shifts closer to ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet
ethan opens his eyes and looks at him
i gotta open that leg and let the poison out
he poises the knife
he fumbles in his shirt pocket brings out a greasy folded piece of paper
just in case
martin sets the knife down takes the paper opens it and slowly reads i ethan edwards being of sound mind and without any blood kin do hereby bequeath all my
property of any kind to martin pauley
he stares then i dont want your property
sides what do you mean no blood kin
debbies your blood kin
not no more
angrily you can keep your will
he thrusts it back into ethans shirt i aint forgettin you was all set to shoot her yourself
what kind o man are you anyway
sitting up eyes blazing shes been with the bucks
shes nothin now but a
martin shoves him back onto the ground
a shout shut your dirty mouth
he gets to his feet trembling and stands looking down at ethan his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his eyes
then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket
he picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man
slowly i hope you die
and he kneels again to open the wound
martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in which lashed by vines and some clothing is the unconscious figure of ethan
eyes shadowed whiskered drawn he is an implacable figure as he drags the weary miles home
he hears a groan from ethan o
he barely lets his eyes drift to the sound
he doesnt stop
we see he is delirious lips parched strapped to the poles
the travois jolts over the ground
as he passes out of frame the camera holds on the marks of the travois poles scraping across the desert
a party is in progress
fiddler and banjo player are playing a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers ranchers their wives and daughters
laurie is not in evidence
at the far end of the room is a table with a punch bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about
jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new arrivals
leading them into the room is captain the reverend sam clayton with a bulky oil skin package under his arm
with him is charlie maccorry dressed in his best black suit and scrubbed until he looks raw
behind them come three or four other competent looking men rangers all of them
shouting theyre here mama
come in come in
clayton waits for charlie to come abreast then hits him on the back and drives him inside
here he is lars
combed curried n washed behind the ears
jorgensen hurries over beaming to admire charlie
why charlie you look real handsome
scarcely recknize myself
jorgensen smiles and playfully pushes him toward the guests
youll see her soon enough
clayton and the other rangers have been hanging gunbelts on pegs along the wall
now he shakes out his parcel disclosing a green black frock coat
nodding to the music say that music sounds so good it must be sinful
grab a partner reverend
well now a man of my age just cant haul off and dance in cold blood
but if theres any of that wild cherry brandy of yours lars
suddenly sober nooo
change of heart yah by golly
one jug left
i get it
jorgensen glares as he heads out
last winter that man swore up and down there wasnt a drop left and me with pneumoney
reverend youd better start clergyin again
horses wagons fill the yard
we can hear the lively music of the square dance
as jorgensen opens the door and sets out toward the barn a battered dusty trap drives in and on it are martin and ethan
jorgensen at first doesnt recognize them
hailing them hi
and then he sees who they are and his jaw drops
no dont get down
you cant come in
they stare at him
the rangers are here
he says it as though that explains everything
whats that got to do with us
eyeing the house whats goin on
whos forgotten they wouldnt know why my lauries getting married
martin throws the reins aside and jumps out
jorgensen grabs his arm
dont you hear me
you been posted for murder
both of you
that trader fella the late mister futterman
martin tries to break free
i gotta see laurie
desperately go around the side
the grandmothers room
ill tell her
he heads around the side
ethan meanwhile has climbed stiffly down slightly favoring his leg
hide in the barn ethan
why would i
he brushes past the little man and heads for the door
as he enters with jorgensen at his heels
for a moment as he stands there the party breezes on
then first one then another sees him
they gape and the music falters and stops
sam clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the room
jorgensen tries to be the easy smiling host and makes a very bad job of it
he cant even finish it but stands there making flapping gestures
during the opening lines jorgensen will covertly back toward the door to the inner room lauries room
to all evenin
or do i call you captain
came here for a wedding ethan
until thats over i reckon reverend will do
coming forward and news of our little girl ethan
his face contorts and his smile is twisted
shes not a little girl any more
eyes wide youve seen her
ive seen her
and shes alive
jorgensen throws herself against his chest sobbing
ethan looks past her at clayton
and the faces of both men are grim
the room is dark
martin is pacing eyes constantly turning to the inside door
and then it opens and laurie is inside holding a lamp
she is in her bridal gown and very obviously trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under
quietly hello martie
he just stares at her very lovely strangely remote
he suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands his dusty worn clothing
i wrote you a letter
reckon you didnt get it
setting the lamp down one letter in five years
i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out
it wasnt much of a letter
no it wasnt
you mighta said you loved me
you mighta asked me to wait
at least thatd have been something
but i allus loved you
you know that without my sayin it
i couldnt bring myself to ask you to wait
the little i had
not knowin how much longer until we found debbie
breaking it isnt fair
she sinks onto the bench
sobbing it isnt fair martin pauley and you know it
she begins to cry very softly
he is beside her and his arm goes around her shoulder comfortingly
dont cry laurie
i understand how it is
ill just go way
spinning on him you do and ill die martie
ill just die
and they are kissing through her tears when the outer door is flung open by charlie maccorry
they part as he glares
ill thank you to leave the room laurie
martin stares at him then at her
incredulous charlie maccorry
you werent fixin to marry him
she sure is
an dont think your comin back is goin to change it
as to that i dont know charlie
we hadnt got around to talkin marriage
what right you got to be talkin marriage to any decent woman
angrily if youre talkin about that crazy murder charge
and other things
mebbe you thought you was gettin away with being comical about that indian wife you took
i bet she wasnt the first squaw you
martin swings wildly but charlie is a wily fighter
he side steps and chops martin in the jaw and drives him against the wall
laurie runs between them
both of you
i wont have any fighting in this house
martin gently brushes her aside
its all right
charlie lets move outside
i aint wearing no gun
martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt
the men head outside as laurie runs to get help
charlie waits assuredly as martin follows him outside
martin makes a wild run swings
the blow is neatly guarded by charlies left and countered with a crisp right that puts martin down
martin gets to his feet more cautiously this time and comes in at a crouch hes fighting like an indian not a white man
the men from the wedding party come out now at a run
yelling sergeant maccorry
charlie turns slightly and in that instant martin springs and drives a straight right at his face almost as though there were a knife in the hand
maccorry stumbles back into claytons arms
is this in the line of duty sergeant
regaining his balance no sir
in that case give the boys room
martin waits at a crouch as charlie comes in feints his right and crosses his left
it is a hard blow but martin recovers and waits
charlie circles and starts to repeat
he feints his right but this time martin springs in ducks and as the left shoots out he grabs the wrist and throws charlie over his head
what we are looking at in effect is a wrestler against a boxer
fight fair son
use your fists
drily comanches dont use their fists reverend
let em alone
charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling now trying to imitate martins crouch
suddenly martin feints a right swing and connects with a solid left reversing the order of business
charlie staggers and martin follows up with a wrestling hold leaping behind charlie locking both legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back so that his face
is in the dirt and so he could under other circumstances be neatly and expeditiously scalped
with the hands locked martin then calmly draws a knife
he looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd
could scalp him
but ill just count coup
with that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to grab a lock of charlies hair and neatly snip it off
he stands then and laughs as charlie lamely gets to his feet easing the tortured arms
clayton goes to charlies side
laurie moves to martins side
you all right sergeant
well go get cleaned up and well proceed with the weddin
charlie frowns and looks off at where laurie and martin are standing
aint goin to be any weddin not till we get a few things cleared up round here
he walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck assembly murmurous with surprise
the last of the wedding guests is leaving ed nesby carrying his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller children preceding him out the door
the jorgensens stand by trying to put a good face on the wedding debacle
charlie maccorry is sitting dejectedly studying a spot on the floor
ethan is at the mantel
laurie is in her room presumably changing out of her wedding gown
martin is at a sink bathing a cut on his lip
clayton still in his clerical coat is near the door
a grin well
it was a nice weddin party
considerin no one got married
good night ed
jorgensen puts her handkerchief to her eyes letting down now that the guests have gone
jorgensen crosses to her pats her sympathetically
he leads her away
clayton faces ethan
i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me ethan
this an invite to a necktie party reverend
nope wouldnt say that
likely you had your reasons for killin futterman
probably needed killin
im speaking as a ranger now not as a reverend
fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing thats raised some question that and a missin gold piece known to have been on him just
prior to his demise
ethan casually reaches into his pocket takes out a gold coin and spins it
casually that so
martin crosses to confront clayton
i aint goin to austin reverend
charlie gets to his feet and he has his gun in his hand
youre goin if the captain says youre goin
lets not grow disputatious
fast hoofbeats sound o
signalling the approach of a four man cavalry detail
turning whats that
he and jorgensen head for the door
kinda late getting here arent they
a voice hails from outside
clayton stands in the opened doorway jorgensen behind him looking out
drawn up outside is the four man cavalry detail led by a young and very crisp lieutenant
we may or may not see the sixth man slouched over his horse
the lieutenant swings off and crosses
is captain clayton here reverend
the lieutenant gapes at claytons ministerial coat
doubtfully youre captain clayton
ethan chuckles to claytons very obvious annoyance
recovering he salutes colonel greenhills compliments sir
the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field fully armed and
hold on son
whos this colonel greenhill youre talking about
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill sir
commanding officer fifth u
im lieutenant greenhill sir
now whats this your pa wants to know
my pa wants to know
colonel greenhill wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field fully armed and equipped for joint punitive action against the comanches
weve received information about a band of comanches under a chief named scar
that maybe hes not far from here holed up somewhere waiting his chance to get back over the border
he raided north about a month ago
ran into more army than he bargained for
now hes running for cover for keeps this time
and what makes you think hes in this territory
yesterday one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago
he talks crazy but i brought him along
says he lives here
keeps mentioning a rocking chair
half to himself mose
and then he is striding to the door calling it ay he
and the old man totters in half supported by a trooper hollow eyed weak almost delirious
come fr my rockin chai
shouting it wheres scar mose
ask him about debbie
is she all right mose
my rockin chai
bustling over leave the poor man be
cant you see hes out of his mind
she tries to lead him away but ethan shoves her aside and grips the old man by his arms
try to remember
you were in scars camp
made out i was crazy
he giggles foolishly ate dirt
i fooled em ethan
an i got away
wheres he holed in
he staggers and this time mrs
jorgensen wont be denied
now thats enough
by the fire
what you needs a good bowl of soup
she leads him away at last to his rocker by the fire
during this ethan and clayton have been mulling moses answer
blankly seven fingers
thats what he told us
but theres no such place on the maps
wait a minute
isnt that the caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the malapai
from his rocker caddo or kiowa
sam clayton wheels on the lieutenant
you tell your pa a company of rangers all fourteen of em fully armed an equipped will be in the field by daylight
headin for the south end of the malapai
if he can catch up with us well an good
but captain we cant possibly take the field tomorrow
for your own protection
sonny yonders a passel of murderers complete with texican scalps an white girl captive
you want to protect us you just get out of our way
the lieutenant skedaddles
sam whirls on martin and ethan
ethan you an martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts without pay
charlie hightail it to headquarters an spread the word
martins hands go to his side recalling where he left his guns
he heads for the inner door to the grandmother room
as martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his gunbelt
even before he reaches it laurie is in the room closing the door after her
not this time
staring you crazy
its too late
shes a woman grown now
i got to fetch her home
fetch what home
the leavins of comanche bucks sold time an again to the highest bidder
with savage brats of her own most like
shouting it laurie
shut your mouth
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance
hell put a bullet in her brain
and i tell you martha would want him to
only if im dead
he strides out past her
as martin re enters
ethan and sam are waiting
martin looks hard at ethan
eyes never leaving ethans face im ready
as they stride out as she stands at the window in her bridal gown and sadly watches martin again going away
softly the score reprises sadly now skip to my lou
a file of eighteen men and horses rangers is walking under the shoulder of a mesa keeping well below the skyline
they pass camera one by one sam clayton in the lead martin behind him leading two horses then the others grim looking capable men of varying ages some with long
drooping mustaches some in need of shaves some chawing tobacco
he is lying prone his hat off squinting down into a long reach of desert canyon at the comanche encampment with tepees set up a thin wisp of smoke rising
from a fire the horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral of rawhide ropes
the camp is sleeping
a dog yaps shrilly
one of the tepee flaps opens and scar steps out
he picks up a stone or a chunk of wood and throws it
the dog yelps and runs off
scars air is troubled suspicious
he heads for the horse herd
the camp sleeps on
his face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction
he looks back along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the ranger company
then he squirms back retrieving his hat
sam seeing ethan in the near distance raises his hand in a signal for halt and waits
ethan scrambles down the trail to join him
he takes the reins of his horse from martin
we can get within yards
theres a hogback to the south
how many would you say
drily enough to go around
id say about a dozen apiece
mount em up
he moves as though to mount but martin steps forward
we go chargin in theyll kill her
and you know it
calmly its what im countin on
sam stares at him but martin isnt surprised
i know you are
only it aint goin to be that way
livin with comanches aint bein alive
same tone shes alive
better shes alive and livin with comanches than her brains bashed out
now son its a bitter thing to say but theres more than your sister at stake here
there sure is
im going to tell you somethin
i wasnt going to speak of it
but ill tell you now
did you notice them scalps strung on scars lance
did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance
i saw it
and dont try to tell me it was aunt marthas or lucys
you dont remember it but i remember
that was your mothers scalp
martin stares quick disbelief in his eyes
but ethans eyes hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them
i didnt want to tell you
but maybe its your right to know
quietly now mount up son
sam puts his hand on martins elbow as though to turn him to his duty
but martin jerks the arm away
it dont change it
all im askin is a chance to sneak in there
an try to get her out before you come chargin in
what if youre caught
it wont tell em anything will it
just a man alone
i say no
go ahead son
but at the first alarm were comin in and we aint goin to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do
ethan looks long and hard at martin then reaches into his shirt for the folded dirty dog eared paper that was his will
slowly he tears it into shreds
its your funeral
martin squats and starts pulling off his boots
he glances up as charlie maccorry comes over an indian blanket in his hands
he tosses it onto martins shoulder
you fight like a comanch
maybe thisll help ya pass as one
then he grins and extends his hand
martin takes it and they shake as charlie pulls him to his feet
martin drops his hat and then at a crouching run he heads for the distant comanche camp
as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward the unseen camp
clayton waves an arm at his men and starts leading out in a somewhat different direction
they are leading their horses down the slope still under the lee of the butte when two riders are seen approaching at a fast gallop lt
greenhill and his courier
the latter is a bugler
calling still distant captain clayton
sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to greenhill to shut up
greenhill pulls to a canter puzzled and rides in
exploding go on
whynt you have your bugler sound the charge while youre at it
your pa know youre out here
troops about ten miles back
the colonel sent me looking for you
dismissing him well you found me
good work son
he starts away
if theres anything i can do sir
under his breath god forbid
no son you flog on back and tell your pa where were at
and where hes at
but he knows that sir
cant i stay sir
reluctantly all right
but keep your eye on me boy
im the hard case youre up against here not these childish savages
if you dont hear me first time i holler you better read my mind
i dont aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand
he whips out his sabre to the imminent peril of captain sam who quickly shifts out of the way
watch that knife boy
then sam continues away and the rangers after him
martin runs from behind camera and dodges behind a rock
the camp is still asleep very quiet
martin runs out from behind the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta
a dog runs out of one of the tepees begins barking
he stands with another comanche inspecting the horse lines
in the near distance the dogs barking is heard shrill insistent
scar almost like an animal sniffs the air suspiciously
the other comanche laughs
scar isnt satisfied but returns to his work
he is staring at it remembering it from certain distinct decorations
the lower part of the tepee is rolled up for better air circulation
martin wraps charlies blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee
the line is drawn up dismounted the men checking their sidearms tightening cinches etc
sam moves briskly along the line of men then mounts his horse
the state of texas is payin you boys a month
heres your chance to earn it
now i dont want any foolin around after scalps
we aint got the time
yankee cavalrys on its way here to set those comanches free
we gotta beat em to it our way
now mount an guide center on young greenhill here
son you just follow me
and watch that the last comes as greenhill tries to mount simultaneously flailing out his sabre perilously close to clayton
martin has gained the tepee takes one quick look around then strides in
as martin enters
one robe tossed back shows where scar has slept
against one wall lie the huddled figures of two squaws
two other figures one being debbies sleep in robes
martins eyes go to scars place and then rove slowly and hold on she moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair
martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder to awaken her
her eyes open then widen in fear
martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth
silently she fights him trying to pull the hand away
a hoarse whisper debbie
and then her fingernails rake his hand
he winces and lets go
she screams and tries to leap up
he grabs her
the other squaws wake begin squawking
grimly im takin you whether you want to or not
debbie sees something beyond him
her eyes widen
a scream he looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her
he has a scalping knife in his hand
scar whips his arm back
behind him we see the other comanche the one from the horse herd
martin spins and his gun is out
he fans the trigger hammer twice and both slugs hit scar
as the other comanche leaps in martins gun speaks again
and then he is on his feet catching debbie by the arm unresisting now and pulling her after him through the camp
shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp
they are mounted and in line
the echo of a shot comes bouncing back
clayton is facing the men
he solemnly doffs his hat and bows his head
for these thy gifts which we are about to receive
donning his hat he turns to the bugler sound that horn son and leave us go amongst them
and shouting the rebel yell he leads the charge
the yell is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge as though he had a regiment at his back
greenhill a west point beau sabreur in strange company has his sabre at the charge
in the swamp of men and horses we just have time to notice that sam is darting a somewhat worried look at greenhills saber ominously close to his back
the charge is sounding the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they did when they rode with bedford forrest reins in their teeth guns in their
comanches are running from the tepees trying to reach their horse herd as the file of rangers knifes in
the bark of hand guns is a steady sound now and the comanches have never been up against such marksmen
one charging ranger rides down a tepee
another with two guns drawn scores a running double on two indians racing toward him from opposite sides of his fast running horse
a dodging comanche screams as a barrel chested roan hits him broadside and sends him sprawling into the embers of the campfire
he yanks his horse back to its haunches firing at a comanche crouched near the tepee
the charge races past him
ethan swings off and runs to the tepee flap whips it open and glares
a squaw comes running out at him knife upraised but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep
he turns and his face is a mask of frustration and then he freezes seeing what he has been looking for martin is running with debbie trying to pull her
along while she kicks and claws and tries to break free
they are about thirty yards from the camp proper
riderless horses are milling circling
we can hear the firing the yells
ethan remounts and heads around the side of scars tepee
in the distance we see martin and debbie
the rangers regrouping are charging back through the camp driving the comanche horse herd
martin hears ethans horse riding down at them he turns and debbie pulls free and starts to run away
he goes running into the path of ethans horse
as martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup trying to fight the horse to a stop
ethan swings on him once twice and martin is knocked sprawling
ethan rides on relentlessly
she is running and dodging trying to escape the horseman
ethan has his gun drawn
she ducks to one side and the horse goes past
both figures are almost obscured in the dust
ethan spins his mount and charges after her
she runs and then falls and he is off his horse and striding toward her
ethan is at the left of camera and slightly closer to the foreground with debbie at the right supine on the ground and the dust swirling around her
ethan draws and raises his gun
the hammer goes back
quietly im sorry girl
shut your eyes
the dust clears
the camera moves slightly forward along the gun arm and holds on debbies face the eyes gazing fearlessly innocently into ethans
we hold for a long moment and then the gun lowers
ethan slowly holsters it and walks over to her
he looks down at her
softly you sure favor your mother
he extends his hand to her
she takes it and he helps her to her feet
and then she is against his chest and his arm goes protectingly about her
they are standing that way when martin stumbles up and stares
the line of rangers is afoot now each man near his horse each man with rifle out pumping shot after shot at the fleeting remnant of comanches riding down the
long valley with their scattered horse herd milling and criss crossing in mid ground
and then as the firing slackens from afar we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge sign of the approach of greenhills troop
it is perhaps half an hour later
clayton is very grim of face and occasionally wincing
his trousers are down over his ankles his shirt tails flapping over his long handled red underwear
behind him charlie maccorry is kneeling applying some crude first aid to sams rump
beyond them some of the rangers are readying for the move out
sam looks up angrily as colonel greenhill a guidon bearer and bugler ride in
greenhill is a choleric man
clayton if you were in my command id have you courtmartialed for this
angrily to maccorry hurry it up
whats the matter sir
what is it sergeant a bullet or an arrow
charlie just gapes but clayton grim lipped bends a meaningful glare on someone off
greenhill looks that way
he is standing with his sabre at salute looking as miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace
it could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend
sam suddenly slaps maccorrys hand away and grabs for his pants and pulls them up and around a tepee come three figures ethan debbie and martin with ethan holding debbies
and sams face is split by a grin as he tucks his shirt tails in and goes to meet them
he is in a rocker on the porch
suddenly he stares out and stops rocking
faint in the distance but coming closer the clop clop of two horses moving at a walk
a moment later jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside mose shading his eyes and squinting against the sun still not recognizing the distant horsemen
he is joined by mrs
and then laurie comes out and she too stares frowning at first then with dawning realization
lars and mrs
jorgensen also begin to guess
and then to know
and laurie starts to run
the camera moves ahead of her as she runs blindly over the hard packed ground running as hard as she can toward the still unseen but nearing horsemen
ethan has debbie on the pommel of his saddle his arm supporting her and she is asleep
martin is riding beside them
laurie comes running up to stare at ethan and at the girl
he smiles and puts a finger to his lips cautioning her against waking debbie and then he rides by
laurie looks then at martin
he doesnt know whether to smile or not he just waits
and then she is beside him and she steps onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him and she kisses him just as she had on the day he
left the graves to take up the search
and still holding her beside him he rides slowly after ethan and debbie toward the house
