written by tony kushner based in part on team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln by doris kearns goodwin final shooting script december heavy grey skies hang over
a flooded field the water two feet deep
cannons and carts half submerged and tilted their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen
a terrible battle is taking place two infantry companies negro union soldiers and white confederate soldiers knee deep in the water staggering because of the mud beneath fight each other
hand to hand with rifles bayonets pistols knives and fists
theres no discipline or strategy nothing depersonalized its mayhem and each side intensely hates the other
both have resolved to take no prisoners
some of us was in the second kansas colored
we fought the rebs at jenkins ferry last april just after theyd killed every negro soldier they captured at poison springs
rain and fog
union army companies are camped out across the grounds
preparations are being made for the impending assault on the confederate port of wilmington north carolina
two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked negro unit harold green an infantryman in his late thirties and ira clark a cavalryman in his early twenties
abraham lincoln sits on a bench facing harold and ira his stovepipe hat is at his side
so at jenkins ferry we decided warnt taking no reb prisoners
and we didnt leave a one of em alive
the ones of us that didnt die that day we joined up with the th u
from camp nelson kentucky
whats your name soldier
private harold green sir
im corporal ira clark sir
fifth massachusetts cavalry
were waiting over there
he nods in the direction of his cavalry
were leaving our horses behind and shipping out with the th infantry for the assault next week on wilmington
to harold green how longve you been a soldier
two year sir
second kansas colored infantry they fought bravely at jenkins ferry
thats right sir
they killed a thousand rebel soldiers sir
they were very brave
hesitating then and making three dollars less each month than white soldiers
harold green is a little startled at clarks bluntness
us nd kansas boys whenever we fight now we another three dollars subtracted from our pay for our uniforms
that was true yessir but that equal pay now
still no commissioned negro officers
i am aware of it corporal clark
yes sir thats good youre aware sir
its only that to lincoln trying to change the subject you think the wilmington attack is gonna be now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing negro men with
guns fighting on their behalf and now that they can tolerate negro soldiers getting the same pay in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of negro lieutenants and captains
in fifty years maybe a negro colonel
in a hundred years the vote
greens offended at the way clark is talking to lincoln
whatll you do after the war corporal clark
perhaps youll hire me
perhaps i will
but you should know sir that i get sick at the smell of bootblack and i cant cut hair
ive yet to find a man could cut mine so itd make any difference
you got springy hair for a white man
yes i do
my last barber hanged himself
and the one before that
left me his scissors in his will
two white soldiers have come up two young kids nervous and excited
president lincoln sir
we we saw you um
we were at at we was at gettysburg
you boys fight at gettysburg
damn i cant believe its to green with mild naw we didnt fight there
we just signed up last month
we saw him two years ago at the cemetery dedication
yeah we heard you speak
damn damn damn
uh hey how tall are you anyway
jeez shut up
could you hear what i said
no sir not much it was he recites fast and four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal
thats good thank you for now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure
we are we are we are met on a great battlefield of that war
thank you thats we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
he chokes up a little
his uncles they died on the second day of fighting
i know the last part
it is company up
move it out
uh it is rather soldiers all over the field rise up at the mustering of the troops
names of regiments brigades divisions are called all across the field the men put out fires put on knapsacks
to the two white you fellas best find your company
thank you sir
god bless you
god bless you
the second white soldier salutes and the two move out
green salutes lincoln as well and glances at clark who remains looking down
clark looks up salutes lincoln and turning smartly walks toward his unit
then he stops turns back faces lincoln who watches him
a beat and then in a tone of admiration and cautious admonishment reminding lincoln of his promise that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
clark salutes lincoln again turns again and walks away
lincoln watches him go
as he walks into the fog clark continues reciting in a powerful voice that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the
people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
lincoln watches clark until the fogs swallowed him up
a huge dark strange looking steamship part wood and part iron turreted like a giant ironclad monitor is plowing through the choppy black waters of an open sea
lincoln is alone in darkness on the deck which has no railing open to the sea
the ships tearing through rough water but theres little pitching wind or spray
the deck is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret
the ships moved by some terrible power at a terrific speed
lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon indicated by a weird flickering leaden glow which appears to recede faster than the fast approaching ship
though its imperceptible in the darkness i have an intuition that were headed towards a shore
no one else seems to be aboard the vessel
the rooms cozy attractive cluttered part dressmakers workshop part repository of marys endless purchases clothing fabrics knicknacks carpets
lincoln reclines on a french chair too small for his lengthy frame
hes in shirtsleeves vest unbuttoned and tie unknotted shoeless
he has an open folio filled with documents on his lap
mary lincoln sits opposite in a nightgown housecoat and night cap
she watches him in her vanity mirror
she looks frightened
i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space
were it not that i have bad dreams
i reckon its the speed thats strange to me
im used to going a deliberate pace
mary looks at him stricken with alarm
i should spare you
i shouldnt tell you my dreams
i dont want to be spared if you arent
and you spare me nothing
he looks down at the carpet then back up at her
perhaps perhaps its the assault on wilmington port
you dream about the ship before a battle usually
rapping lightly on his hows the coconut
she delicately touches her head
almost two years nothing mends
another casualty of the war
who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident
you tell me dreams thats all im your soothsayer thats all i am anymore im not to be trusted with even if it wasnt a carriage accident even if it
was an attempted assassination it was most probably an it was an assassin
whose intended target was you
hows the plans for the big shindy progressing
i dont want to talk about parties
you dont care about parties
not much but theyre a necessary mary studies lincoln thinking
then a revelation i know
i know what its about
the ship it isnt wilmington port its not a military campaign
its the amendment to abolish slavery
why else would you force me to
invite demented radicals into my home
lincoln closes his folio
youre going to try to get the amendment passed in the house of representatives before the term ends before the inauguration
dont spend too much money on the flubdubs
mary stands goes up to him
no ones loved as much as you no ones ever been loved so much by the people you might do anything now
dont dont waste that power on an amendment bill thats sure of defeat
seeing that hes not going to discuss this she turns away walking to an open window
did you remember roberts coming home for the reception
lincoln nods though mary isnt bothering to look at him
i knew youd forget
she closes the window
thats the ship youre sailing on
the thirteenth amendment
you neednt tell me im right
i know i am
she watches as he leaves the room smiling in bitter victory shes right
lincoln encounters elizabeth keckley a light skinned black woman marys dressmaker and close friend holding a dark blue velvet bodice embroidered with jet beads
its late mrs
holding out the bodice she needs this for the grand reception
lincoln bends down to look at the intricate beading
its slow work
he nods smiles straightens up
he continues down the hall
keckley starts to enter marys boudoir then stops sensing something amiss
she calls quietly after lincoln concerned a little did you tell her a dream
a working room sparsely furnished
lincolns desk is heaped with files books newspapers
the desks near a window now open
comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner
near the fireplace in which embers are dying theres a long table eight chairs around it settings by each chair of inkwells and pens
dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases
lincoln opens the door and enters to find his year old son tad lincoln near the hearth sleeping sprawled on a very large military map
lead toy soldiers are scattered across it
a large mahogany box imprinted alexander gardner studios is open near tads head
the box contains large glass plates each framed in wood these are photographic negatives
tads been looking at several which lie near him on the map
lincoln kneels by tad and looks down at the map a topographical and strategic survey of the no mans land between union and confederate forces at petersburg
he scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines
he lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the firelight its a large photographic negative of a young black boy
theres a caption in elegant cursive script abner age and another two young boys lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid
carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside he lies down beside tad
he touches tads hair and kisses his forehead
tad stirs as lincoln gets on all fours without really waking up knowing the routine tad climbs onto his fathers back
tad holds on as his father stands weary and maybe a little surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he was the night before
papa i wanna see willie
me too taddie
but we cant
three years now
lincoln carries tad out of the room closing the door
a new flagpole is being dedicated
lincoln in a black overcoat and his stovepipe hat and treasury secretary william fessenden stand by the pole
they face an audience of officials clerks dignitaries wives soldiers
a marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of we are coming father abraam
two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards
lincoln moves into place as the crowd applauds he takes a sheet of paper from inside his hat and glances at it
then he looks up
the part assigned to me is to raise the flag which if there be no fault in the machinery i will do and when up it will be for the
people to keep it up
he puts the paper away
the audience waits expecting more
thats my speech
he smiles at them
they applaud some laughing
as lincoln turns the crank hoisting the flag a solo trumpet plays we are coming father abraam and the audience joins in
among them secretary of state william seward in a thick exquisite winter coat and hat and lincolns dapper assistant secretary john hay
seward looks pleased
we are coming father abraam three hundred thousand more from mississippis winding stream and from new englands shore
we leave our plows and workshops our wives and children dear with hearts too full for utterance with but a silent tear
were coming father abraam
in a four door carriage top down seward sits opposite lincoln
hay next to seward organizes papers in a portfolio on his lap
even if every republican in the house votes yes far from guaranteed since when has our party unanimously supported anything
but say all our fellow republicans vote for it
wed still be twenty votes short
we can find twenty votes
twenty house democrats wholl vote to abolish slavery
in my opinion to which i always listen
or pretend to
with all three of my ears
well win the war soon its inevitable isnt it
aint won yit
youll begin your second term with semi divine stature
imagine the possibilities peace will bring
why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the house
its a rats nest in there the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back
i like our chances now
lincoln is at his desk hay feeding him documents to read and sign
seward warms himself by the fireplace holding a brandy
consider the obstacles that wed face
the aforementioned two thirds majority needed to pass an amendment we have a republican
majority but barely more than fifty percent fifty six
we need democratic support
theres none to be had
since the house last voted on the amendment theres been an election
sixty four democrats lost their house seats in november
thats sixty four democrats looking for work come march
i know but thats they dont need to worry about re election they can vote however it suits em
theres a knock at the office door
but we cant um buy the to hay vote for the amendment
its might as well let em in
i said nothing of buying anything
we need twenty votes was all i said
start of my second term plenty of positions to fill
hay opens the door to the outer office admitting the sound of a sizable crowd
john nicolay lincolns rather severe german born senior secretary ushers in mr
jolly mid s mud spattered coat hat in hands followed by mrs
jolly similarly road worn holding a suitcase
president may i present mr
jolly whove come from missouri to from jeff city president
lincoln shakes mr
this by the fires secretary of state seward
seward nods slightly as he lights a cuban cigar
lincoln looks at the jollys
they are worried and a little awed
i heard tell once of a jefferson city lawyer who had a parrot thatd wake him each morning crying out today is the day the world shall end as scripture
and one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet i presume thus fulfilling for the bird at least its prophecy
the jollys dont get it
jolly looks back at seward who gestures for him to speak then exhales a plume of smoke
launching into his theys only one tollbooth in jeff city t the southwest n this man heinz sauermagen from rolla been in illegal possession for near two yar since your
man general schofield set him up there
but president monroe give that tollgate to my granpap and quincy adams give my pap a letter saying its ourn for keeps
jolly got the to his wife show mr
lincoln the quincy adams letter
jolly opens the suitcase and begins to dig frantically for the letter
thats unnecessary mrs
just tell me what you want from me
seward exhales more smoke
jolly starts coughing while mrs
jolly tries to fan away the cigar smoke with the quincy adams letter
jollys emphysema dont care for cigars
do you know about the proposed thirteenth amendment to the constitution yes sir everybody knows of it
the president favors it
you know that it abolishes slavery
i know it
and is that why you favor it
what i favors ending the war
oncet we do away with slavery the rebsll quit fighting since slaverys what theyre fighting for
lincoln you always says so
with the amendment slaverys ended and theyll give up
the war can finish then
if the war finished first before we end slavery would president lincoln says the war wont stop unless we finish slavery but if it did
the south is exhausted
if they run out of bullets and men would you still
want your uh whos your representative
thats uh congressman burton
beanpole burton i mean josiah burton yes sir
undecided on the question of the amendment i believe
perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm
if the rebels surrender next week would you at the end of this month want congressman burton to vote for the thirteenth amendment
jolly is puzzled and looks to mr
then if that was how it was no more war and all i reckon mr
jollyd much prefer not to have congress pass the amendment
seward glances at lincoln then turns back to and whys that
jollys surprised the answers so obvious
in a hoarse voice niggers
if he dont have to let some alabama coon come up to missouri steal his chickens and his job hed much prefer that
seward takes the letter from mrs
jolly and hands it to lincoln
to lincoln quietly the people
i begin to see why youre in such a great hurry to put it through
jolly would you let me study this letter sir about the tollbooth
come back to me in the morning and well consider what the law says
and be sure to visit beanpole and tell him that you support passage of the amendment
as a military necessity
the jollys nod skeptical now
to the jollys thank you
nicolay escorts them out
before he closes the door oh nicolay
when you have a moment
nicolay nods and steps into the anteroom where dozens more petitioners are waiting to speak with lincoln
hay confers with the doorman
seward closes the door behind them
lincoln kneels at the fireplace stoking the fire
he puts more wood in then stands
seward watches him then if procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend ill fetch a friend from albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this
kind of shady work
spare me the indignity of actually speaking to democrats
spare you the exposure and liability
there is a sharp knock on the closed door followed by two long ones
pardon me thats a distress signal which i am bound by solemn oath to respond to
lincoln opens the door
tad enters cross
tom pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves mr
gardner sent over because tom says mama says theyre too distressing but you had nightmares all night mamas right to but ill have worse nightmares if you dont let me
look at the plates again
we cant afford a single defection from anyone in our party
not even a single republican absent when they vote
you know who youve got to see
lincoln turns to him
send over to blair house
ask preston blair can i call on him around five oclock
a shudder a swallow of god help you
god alone knows what hell ask you to give him
lincolns perched on the edge of an ottoman
if the blairs tell em to no republican will balk at voting for the amendment
the room is baronial
preston blair patriarch of his wealthy and powerful family years old sits facing his son montgomery blair whip thin
a fire blazes in a massive fireplace behind monty
prestons handsome elegant daughter elizabeth blair lee sits across from monty next to tad whos wearing a union infantrymans uniform a real musket by his side
no conservative republican is what you mean all republicans ought to be conservative i founded this party in my own goddamned home to be a conservative antislavery party not a
hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and damp down the dyspepsia daddy youll frighten the child
you need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the radicals and bundle up with thaddeus stevenss gang
you need our help
yes sir i do
well what do we get
your manners monty must be why mr
lincoln pushed you out of his cabinet
he was pushed out i wasnt pushed
oh of course you werent
he was pushed out to placate to tad the goddamn radical i agreed to resign
a nod at tad oh daddy please
you dont mind boy do you
he spends his days with soldiers
they taught me a song
soldiers know all manner of songs
hows your brother bob
hes at school now but hes coming to visit in four days
for the shindy
aint that fine
good hes not in the army
oh he wants to be but mama said he dangerous life soldiering
your mama is wise to keep him clean out of that
now your daddy knows that what i want in return for all the help i give him is to go down to richmond like he said i could soon as
savannah fell and talk to jefferson davis
give me terms i
can offer to jefferson davis to start negotiating for peace
hell talk to me
conservative members of your party want you to listen to overtures from richmond
that above all
two black servants who have entered begin to pour and serve tea
theyll vote for this rash and dangerous amendment only if every other possibility is exhausted
our republicans aint abolitionists
we cant tell our people they can vote yes on abolishing slavery unless at the same time we can tell em that youre seeking a negotiated peace
the blairs look at lincoln waiting for an answer
a light snows beginning to fall
a lacquered coach stands outside the house the blair crest in gold on its doors
elizabeth blair lee a blanket in her arms comes out of the house talking to leo an elderly black servant formerly a slave belonging to the blairs
theyre followed by an elderly black woman in a housekeepers uniform
leo its a hundred miles to richmond
get him drunk so he can sleep
elizabeth goes to the carriage where preston awaits
she passes the blanket through the carriage window and tucks it around her father
fussing with the lets fix this up
wheres my hat
leo has your hat
as leo climbs into the carriage elizabeth kisses her hand then slaps the kiss on her fathers cheek
go make peace
the cabinet has assembled
lincoln heads the table seward at his left and edwin m
stanton secretary of war barrel shaped long bearded bespectacled at his right
next to him are secretary of the navy gideon welles luxurious white hair its a wig and a flowing snowy beard postmaster general william dennison secretary of the interior john
usher secretary of the treasury william fessenden and attorney general james speed
nicolay and hay are in chairs behind lincoln taking notes
thunder forth god of war
stanton clears his throat
hes noticed the singed edge
well commence our assault on wilmington from the sea
why is this burnt
was the boy playing with it
it got took by a breeze several nights back
this is an official war department map
and the entire cabinets waiting to hear what it portends
from the largest fleet the navy has ever assembled
shake thy hoary locks
fifty eight ships are underway of every tonnage and firing range
welles gestures on the map to the positions of many ships
well keep up a steady barrage
our first target is fort fisher
it defends wilmington port
stanton indicates the lines tracing artillery trajectories
these converge particularly heavily on fort fisher
a steady barrage
a hundred shells a minute
theres a moment of shocked silence
till they surrender
wilmingtons their last open seaport
wilmington falls richmond falls after
and the war
the rest of the cabinet applauds foot stomping table slapping
only john usher doesnt join in
then why if i may ask are we not concentrating the nations attention on wilmington
why instead are we reading in the he smacks a newspaper on that the anti slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the house floor for debate because your eagerness in
what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the executive into legislative prerogatives is compelling it to its
to whats likely to be its premature demise
you signed the emancipation proclamation youve done all that can be expected the emancipation proclamations merely a war measure
after the war the courtsll make a meal of it
when edward bates was attorney general he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign different lawyers different opinions
it frees slaves as a military exigent not in any other i dont recall bates being any too certain about the legality of my proclamation just it wasnt downright criminal
somewheres in between
back when i rode the legal circuit in illinois i defended a woman from metamora named melissa goings years old they said she murdered her husband he was
he was choking her and uh she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire
wood and fractured his skull n he died
in his will he wrote i expect she has killed me
if i get over it i will have revenge
this gets a laugh
no one was keen to see her convicted he was that kind of husband
i asked the prosecuting attorney if i might have a short conference with my client
and she and i went into a room in the courthouse but i alone emerged
the window in the room was found to be wide open
it was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it
i told the bailiff right before i left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water and i told her tennessee
goings was seen no more in metamora
enough justice had been done they even forgave the bondsman her bail
im afraid i dont i decided that the constitution gives me war powers but no one knows just exactly what those powers are
some say they dont exist
i dont know
i decided i needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the constitution which i decided meant that i could take the rebels slaves from em as property
confiscated in war
that might recommend to suspicion that i agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place
of course i dont never have im glad to see any man free and if calling a man property or war contraband does the trick
why i caught at the opportunity
now heres where it gets truly slippery
i use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and
citizens of belligerent nations
but the south aint a nation thats why i cant negotiate with em
so if in fact the negroes are property according to law have i the right to take the rebels property from em if i insist theyre rebels only and not
citizens of a belligerent country
and slipperier still i maintain it aint our actual southern states in rebellion but only the rebels living in those states the laws of which states remain in force
the laws of which states remain in force
that means that since its states laws that determine whether negroes can be sold as slaves as property the federal government doesnt have a say in that least not yet
a glance at seward then negroes in those states are slaves hence property hence my war powers allow me to confiscate em as such
so i confiscated em
but if im a respecter of states laws how then can i legally free em with my proclamation as i done unless im cancelling states laws
i felt the war demanded it my oath demanded it i felt right with myself and i hoped it was legal to do it im hoping still
he looks around the table
two years ago i proclaimed these people emancipated then thenceforward and forever free
but lets say the courts decide i had no authority to do it
they might well decide that
say theres no amendment abolishing slavery
say its after the war and i can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts decisions like i sometimes felt i had to do
might those people i freed be ordered back into slavery
thats why id like to get the thirteenth amendment through the house and on
its way to ratification by the states wrap the whole slavery thing up forever and aye
as soon as im able
end of this month
and id like you to stand behind me
like my cabinets most always done
a moments silence broken by a sharp laugh from seward
as the preacher said i could write shorter sermons but once i start i get too lazy to stop
it seems to me sir youre describing precisely the sort of dictator the democrats have been howling about
dictators arent susceptible to law
neither is he
he just said as much
ignoring the courts
what reins him in from from
well the people do that i suppose
i signed the emancipation proclamation a year and half before my second election
i felt i was within my power to do it however i also felt that i might be wrong about that i knew the people would tell me
i gave em a year and half to think about it
and they re elected me
and come february the first i intend to sign the thirteenth amendment
nicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit perpetually worried james ashley r oh
tad eyes him from a chair by the window
lincoln enters the room with seward
tell us the news from the hill
lincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated but flattered representative on the shoulder
news why for instance is this thus and what is the reason for this thusness
james we want you to bring the anti slavery amendment to the floor for debate excuse me
immediately and you are the amendments manager are you not
i am of course but immediately
and were counting on robust radical support so tell mr
stevens we expect him to put his back into it its not going to be easy but we trust its impossible
no i am sorry no we cant organize anything immediately in the house
i have been canvassing the democrats since the election in case any of them softened after they got walloped
but they have stiffened if anything mr
there arent nearly enough votes were whalers mr
as in um whales
lincoln moves in standing very close to ashley
weve been chasing this whale for a long time
weve finally placed a harpoon in the monsters back
its in james its in
we finish the deed now we cant wait
or with one flop of his tail hell smash the boat and send us all to eternity
on the st of this month
of this year
put the amendment up for a vote
ashley is agog
the rooms redolent of politics ideology a bust of robespierre a print of tom paine long occupancy and hard work
on the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded banner re elect thaddeus stevens republican ticket th congressional district lancaster pennsylvania
at the desk sits thaddeus stevens r pa bald under a horrible red wig a gaunt powerful face resembling lincolns though beardless and bitter
in the office are ashley speaker of the house schuyler colfax r in formidable senator bluff wade r ma whos never smiled and asa vintner litton r md
thats what he said
the mans never been near a whale ship in his life
withdraw radical support force him to abandon this scheme whatever hes up to he drags his feet about everything lincoln why this urgency
we got it through the senate without difficulty because
we had the numbers
come december youll have the same in the house
the amendmentll be the easy work of ten minutes
hes using the threat of the amendment to frighten the rebels into an immediate surrender
i imagine wed rejoice to see that
will you rejoice when the southern states have re joined the union pell mell as lincoln intends them to and one by one each refuses to ratify the amendment
if we pass it which we wont
why are we co operating with with him
we all know what hes doing and we all know what hell do
we cant offer up abolitions best legal prayer to his games and tricks
hes said hed welcome the south back with all its slaves in chains
three years ago he said that
to calm the border states when we were i dont
this confuses the room
stevens turns to vintner litton
you said we all know what hell do
i dont know
you know he isnt to be trusted
im sorry i was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics
ive never trusted the president
hasnt he surprised you
stevens he hasnt
nothing surprises you asa therefore nothing about you is surprising
perhaps that is why your constituents did not re elect you to the coming term
collecting his cane and its late im old im going home
stevens limps to the door opens it and turns
lincoln the inveterate dawdler lincoln the southerner lincoln the capitulating compromiser our adversary and leader of the godforsaken republican party our party abraham lincoln has asked us to work with
him to accomplish the death of slavery in america
retain even in opposition your capacity for astonishment
stevens leaves shutting the door
they watch him go ashley excited litton unmoved insulted skeptical
in a cramped private alcove a low sagging timber ceiling sooty walls sawdusted floor ancient curtain closing it off seward sits at a small table with robert latham an albany
ny political operative richard schell a wall street speculator and w
bilbo a tennessee lawyer and lobbyist
a chandelier with candles drips wax on them
on the table a leather folio lies open prospectuses for jobs in the administration
latham and schell study these
bilbo is studying seward
the president is never to be mentioned
youre paid for your discretion
hell you can have that for nothin what we need money for is bribes
itd speed things up
nothing strictly illegal
its not illegal to bribe congressmen
they starve otherwise
i have explained to mr
bilbo and mr
latham that were offering patronage jobs to the dems who vote yes
jobs and nothing more
congressmen come cheap
few thousand bucksll buy you all you need
the president would be unhappy to hear you did that
well will he be unhappy if we lose
a waitress brings in a platter of roasted crabs which she slams down on the table and leaves
the money i managed to raise for this endeavor is only for your fees food and lodgings
if that squirrel infested attic youve quartered us ins any measure you aint raised much
shall we get to work
bilbo takes a mallet to a crab smashing it
a gavel slams down on a sounding block in an attempt to silence the raucous tumult in the large chamber
it subsides enough for colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central the house recognizes fernando wood the honorable representative from new york
floor and balcony are full although the desks of representatives from seceded states are bare and unoccupied
on the democratic side members applaud fernando wood d ny as he takes the podium
the democratic leadership including george yeaman ky has gathered around house minority leader george pendleton oh
on the republican side of the aisle enraged booing from the republicans including hiram price ia george julian in vintner litton and ashley all gathered around stevenss desk
two bloody years ago this month his highness king abraham africanus the first our great usurping caesar violator of habeas corpus and freedom of the press abuser of states rights
loud radical republican autocrat if lincoln really were a ruling by fiat and martial tyrant mr
wood heda had law affixed his name to his your empty head impaled on a heinous and illicit pike and the country better emancipation proclamation for it
promising it would hasten the end of the war which yet rages on and on
murmuring from the floor and the balcony in the front row of which mary and elizabeth keckley sit
mary turns her gaze from the floor to watch latham and schell a few seats away scrutinize the floor whispering latham taking notes
schell holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap
bilbo sits behind them
they study the other ny democrats charles hanson nelson merrick henry lanford homer benson giles stuart who
comprise a cluster of glum uncomfortable passivity on that side of the aisle
he claimed as tyrants do whispering to schell that the wars emergencies the new york delegations permitted him to turn our looking decidedly uninspired
army into the unwilling instrument of his monarchical wood points at stevens granite faced
stevenss eyes burn back at wood
and radical republicanisms abolitionist fanaticism
this prompts shouts and boos from the republicans
his emancipation proclamation has obliterated millions of dollars worth of personal property rights schell examines the pennsylvania democrats an openly appalled archibald moran ambrose bailer and chewing his thumb a
painful fake grin pinned to his face alexander coffroth
schell leans in to latham
and liberated the over in pennsylvania whos hundreds of thousands of the sweaty man eating his hopelessly indolent negro thumb
refugees bred by nature for servility to settle in robert latham squalor in our northern unknown to me
perhaps hell jump
cheering and booing
in the connecticut delegation john ellis winds his pocket watch looking contemptuously at wood
schell makes a note

wild cheering and booing
every member of the house whats more interesting is loyal to the democratic party how dismal and disgruntled and the constituents it mr

looks like he ate a bad oyster
thaddeus stevens calls out from his desk
a point of order mr
speaker if you please
when will mr
speaker i still have the floor and the gentleman from pennsylvania is out of order
when will mr
wood conclude his interminable gabble
some of us breathe oxygen and we find the mephitic fumes of his oratory a lethal challenge to our pleural capacities
wild cheering applause from the republicans
we shall oppose this amendment and any legislation that so affronts natural law insulting to god as to man
congress must never declare equal those whom god created unequal
the democrats cheer
mary watches with concern
keckley is angry and uncomfortable
slavery is the only insult to natural law you fatuous nincompoop

back to the democrats we are in session
the corridor as usual is lined with petitioners
theyve lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting laughing clapping and cheering egging on tad as with furious concentration he drives a cart pulled at considerable
speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down
white house doorkeeper and unofficial child minder tom pendel follows admonishing the petitioners as he goes
please dont encourage this
dont encourage this
robert lincoln enters from the stairs carrying several pieces of large and heavy luggage
tad sees him jumps out of the goat cart runs up to and tackles robert causing him to drop his luggage
they embrace as pendel captures the goat and leads it away
youre back youre back youre back youre back youre i am
your goat got big
robert disentangles himself from tad and hands him a suitcase

a nervous glance at the door to marys bedroom is she in there

he grabs the trunk as roberts lifting it

preston blair still in his traveling cloak and lincoln stand near the fireplace facing one another
jefferson davis is sending three delegates stephens hunter and campbell vice president of the confederacy their former secretary of state and their assistant
secretary of war
theyre coming in earnest to propose peace
both men look into the fire
preston moves closer
i know this is unwelcome news for you

spring slaughter commences

jacob graylor d pa and bilbo walk outside the capitol
graylor looks over the prospectuses
we have one abstention so far jacob graylor graylor selects one and hands it to bilbo
hed like to be federal revenue assessor for the fifth district of pennsylvania
a small room two beds in disarray newspapers overflowing ashtrays whiskey bottles empty on the floor
latham and schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker game
bilbo lies on one of the beds
all three are in their shirtsleeves
seward is at the table
so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is reduced to which means yes votes to reach the requisite two thirds of the house
assuming all republicans vote for the amendment
seward nods less assertively than latham would like
then despite our abstention to reach a two thirds majority we remain yeses short
bilbo is drinking schooners of beer with edwin leclerk d oh and clay hawkins d oh
hawkins listens as bilbo gives his pitch
leclerk looks at the prospectuses
for which were seeking from among lame duck democrats
fully of these we deem unredeemable no votes
leclerk throws his beer in bilbos face soaking bilbo and the prospectuses
hawkins looks shocked
leclerk storms out
the kind that hates niggers hates god for making niggers
the good lord on high would despair of their souls
thank you for that pithy explanation mr
weve abandoned these to the devil that possesses them
schell stands at the door of a small grubby row house
he presents the folio warped from its beer bath to william hutton d in eyes red from crying dressed in mourning black
hutton slams the door in schells face
a funeral wreath that adorns the door falls to the ground
a daguerreotype attached to the wreath depicts a young officer huttons brother frederick
the remaining lame ducks on whom weve been working with a purpose schell hands latham a stack of folded prospectuses each with a name scrawled on it
representatives merrick lanford benson stuart and hanson the new york lame ducks descend the stairs discussing the opening of the amendment debate to which theyve just been listening
latham smoothly holds hanson back from the group extending a hand the still pristine portfolio under his arm
he smiles as the other ny lame ducks proceed down the stairs unaware then nods his head back up toward the capitol steps where bilbo and schell wait
latham opens the folio as he talks to hanson
in the grand lobby there are federal bank windows
schell is in line at one of these behind giles stuart who completes a transaction and leaves counting money
bilbo barrelling the other way intentionally slams into stuart causing him to drop his money
bilbo and schell both kneel to help
schell places the open folio in stuarts hands
as the men pile his recovered money into the folio stuarts puzzled then intrigued
schell gives him a meaningful look
a folded prospectus now with the name stuart scrawled on it is added to a growing file
visitors file past cabinets containing animal and plant specimens and inventions the line circles around a large case in which an amputated leg capped with a brass plate is displayed
a sign identifies it left leg of general daniel nelson merrick
latham looks through the case at schell whos next to nelson merrick who nods solemnly staring at the leg
schell proffers merrick the folio
merrick flips through the folio
a hall packed with working men soaped up windows
a gypsy fiddler saws away
homer benson incongruous in a suit slurps
as he lifts his spoon to his mouth the folio is placed in front of him
he looks over puzzled as schell smiles and extends a hand
benson takes the folio
schell slides his chair closer
another prospectus joins the pile benson and lastly
bilbo retrieves a paper from the floor and hands it to seward
bilbo walks with clay hawkins who peruses the folio
bilbo has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder
hawkins follows happy and sick with fear
t tax collector for the western reserve
th th that pays handsomely
dont just reach for the highest branches
they sway in every breeze
assistant port inspector of marlston looks like the ticket to me
uh boats they they make me sick
bilbo retrieves a snare a small bird is trapped by the foot
bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket
so just stand on the dock
let the assistant assistant port inspectors stomach go weak
bilbo eyes hawkins who anxiously eyes the folio
seward hands the last prospectus to nicolay who unfolds it places it on top of the other prospectuses and records details about hawkinss appointment in a notebook
seward smokes a cigar nicolay a pipe
lincoln sits feet up examining a newspaper
and lastly democratic yes vote number six
hawkins from ohio
well thus far
plus graylors abstention
from tiny acorns and so on
whatd hawkins get
postmaster of the millersburg post office
hes selling himself cheap aint he
he wanted tax collector of the western reserve a first term congressman who couldnt manage re election i felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to postmaster
scatter em over several rounds of appointments so no one notices
and burn this ledger please after youre done
time for my public opinion bath
might as well let em in
nicolay helps lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public
seven yeses with mr
thirteen to go
one last item an absurdity but my associates report that among the representatives a fantastical rumors bruited about which i immediately disavowed that youd allowed bleary old preston blair to
sojourn to richmond to invite jeff davis to send commissioners up to washington with a peace plan
lincoln is silent
a horrifying reality dawns for seward i of course told them you would never
not without consulting me you wouldnt
because why on earth would you
three union cavalry officers consult with three confederate cavalry officers all mounted
the officers exchange documents and salutes
the ranking confederate trots to a buggy in which three confederate officials sit vice president alexander stephens short john a
campbell assistant secretary of war and senator r
theyre well dressed for winter stephens especially heavily bundled
stephens campbell and the indignant hunter leave the buggy and are escorted by confederate officers to the waiting company of union cavalry and infantry
a union army ambulance a large american flag painted on one side driven by two black soldiers stands near broken wagons and a derelict cannon
another black soldier stands at attention by the ambulances rear door
the soldier staring coldly at these men gestures brusquely to the ambulance
the confederate peace commissioners hesitate hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers
then stephens pushes past hunter
he nods to the soldier
with polite dignity much obliged
he boards the ambulance
his fellow delegates follow in his wake hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers before climbing in
seward stands stunned
lincoln sits at the cabinet table
nicolay is gone
why wasnt i consulted
im secretary of state
you you you informally send a reactionary dottard to what will happen do you imagine when these peace commissioners arrive
well hear em out
and next the democrats will invite em up to hearings on the hill and the newspapers well the newspapers the newspapers will ask why risk enraging the confederacy over the
issue of slavery when theyre here to make peace
well lose every democrat weve got more than likely conservative republicans will join em and all our work all our preparing the ground for the vote laid waste for naught
the blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people oh the blairs promise do they
you think theyll keep their promise once we have heard these delegates and refused them
which we will have to do since their proposal most certainly will be predicated on keeping their slaves
what hope for any democratic votes willum if word gets out that ive refused a chance to end the war
you think word wont get out
its either the amendment or this confederate peace you cannot have both
if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me
this is a disaster
time is a great thickener of things willum
yes i suppose it is actually i have no idea what you mean by that
get me thirteen votes
in a thick kentucky them fellers from richmond aint here yit
the ambulance has come to a stop
the rear door opens and the soldiers immediately hop out
the commissioners squint blinded into the dazzling sunlight at the river queen grants side wheel steamer docked on the banks of the james river
tad in fancy military uniform sits on the bed gardeners box of glass negatives open beside him
he holds up a plate to a lamp an old black man with a thick beard and hair shirtless
tad looks at another plate a young black woman headscarf huge ugly scar across her cheek and down her neck
he studies these with solemn concentration
you drafted half the men in boston
what do you think their families think about me
lincoln is being dressed in formal wear by his valet william slade a light skinned black man in his s
robert already in his morning suit is standing by the door
the only reason they dont throw things and spit on me is cause youre so popular
i cant concentrate on on british mercantile law i dont care about british mercantile law
i might not even want to be a lawyer its a sturdy profession and a useful one
yes and i want to be useful but now not afterwards
slade hands lincoln his formal gloves
i aint wearing them things mr
slade they never fit right
the missus will have you wear em
dont think about leaving em
youre delaying thats your favorite tactic
to robert you wont tell me no but the be useful and stop war will be over in a month distracting him
and you know it will
ive found that prophesying is one of lifes less prophet able occupations
he accepts the gloves
slade laughs a little robert scowls
tad holds another glass negative up to the light
why do some slaves cost more than others
if theyre still young and healthy if the women can still conceive theyll pay more put em back in the box
well return them to mr
gardners studio day after next
be careful with em now
tugging at his gloves these things shouldve stayed on the calf
to slade putting the when you were a slave mr
slade did they beat you
i was born a free man
nobody beat me except i beat them right back
theres a knock on the door and mrs
lincoln could you come with me mrs
keckley was a slave
ask her if she was beaten
were you shakes his head tad
i was beaten with a fire shovel when i was younger than you
you should go to mrs
shes in willies room
she never goes in there
lincoln starts towards the door just as john hay enters dressed in the uniform of a brevet colonel
the reception line is already stretching out the door
robert shoots an angry envious glance at hays uniform as lincoln slade mrs
keckley and hay leave
robert calls to ill be the only man over fifteen and under sixty five in this whole place not in uniform
im under fifteen and i have a uniform
robert storms out
lincoln enters a dark room its heavy drapes closed against the dim afternoon light
there are two beds
one is stripped bare
the other is canopied with a thick black veil
mary dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and beading perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence is seated at the head of the canopied bed
on a nightstand next to the bed theres a toy locomotive engine a tattered book of b o railroad schedules
mary holds a framed photograph an image of willie handsome bright eyed confident
lincoln crosses to the window
my head hurts so
i prayed for death the night willie died
the headaches are how i know i didnt get my wish
how to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night
trying not to think about him
how will i manage
somehow you will
every party every
and now four years more in this terrible house reproaching us
he was a very sick little boy
we shouldve cancelled that reception shouldnt we
we didnt know how sick he was
i knew i knew i saw that night he was dying
three years ago the war was going so badly and we had to put on a face
but i saw willie was dying
i saw he bends and kisses her hand
its too hard
mary stares up at him her face heavy and swollen with grief
mary radiant her charm turned to its brightest candlepower is greeting the blairs who are part of a long receiving line
the blairs proceed from mary to lincoln
the enormous room is splendid decked with garlands of flowers tall candelabra burning flags from army divisions
an orchestra plays
lincoln and tad stand together
slade is near lincoln
marys a distance away from lincoln to his right
robert takes his place next to his mother as conspicuous as hed feared hed be in his civilian clothes
a sea of people surround the president and his family
nicolay hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to greet the lincolns into the line wealthy people many more middle class people some working people and farmers and many
officers and soldiers
tad watches his father shake hands
lincoln is in his element
he stands close to each person touches each one gently stoops to be nearer them he puts everyone at ease
hes bothered only by the white kid gloves hes wearing
he tugs at the right hand glove
with a glance in marys shes just ten feet yonder
id like to keep my job
lincoln takes off the right hand glove his hand shaking hand but keeps the other glove on
approaching mary on the line stevens ashley senators bluff wade and charles sumner all in formal wear except stevens
senator sumner it has been much too long
oh who can look on that celestial face and cutting him off she pretends not to recognize ashley
james ashley maam weve met several times but she ignores him and greets stevens
her southern accent becoming more lustrous praise heavens praise heavens just when i had abandoned hope of amusement its the chairman of the house ways and means committee
stevens bows to her
madame president if you please
oh dont convene another subcommittee to investigate me sir
smile senator wade
i believe i am smiling mrs
ill take your word for that sir
as long as your household accounts are in order madame well have no need to investigate them
you have always taken such a lively even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts
your household accounts have always been so interesting
yes thank you its true the miracles i have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices
but i had to
four years ago when the president and i arrived this was pure pigsty
tobacco stains in the turkey carpets
mushrooms green as the moon sprouting from ceilings
and a paupers pittance allotted for improvements
as if your committee joined with all of washington awaiting in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor further proof that my husband and i were prairie primitives
unsuited to the position to which an error of the people a flaw in the democratic process had elevated us
lincoln suddenly without anyone in line to receive looks to see the backlog forming behind the radicals
he notes the exchange but says nothing
robert sees him looking
the past is the past its a new year now and we are all getting along or so they tell me
i gather we are working together
the white house and the other house
hatching little plans together
robert leans in to her
youre creating a bottleneck
oh im detaining you and more important the people behind you
how the people love my husband they flock to see him by their thousands on public days
they will never love you the way they love him
how difficult it must be for you to know that
and yet how important to remember it
she gives him a slight lethal smile
he holds the look his poker face yields to a barely perceptible smile amused and perhaps a little admiring
the kitchens piled with unwashed cookware eggshells flour bins muffin and pastry molds spoons and knives the detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at the reception which
has now transitioned into a dance and is still underway upstairs
music the tramp of dancing feet and rhythmic clapping is audible
a black footman carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and cups comes down the stairs
he hastily beats a retreat when he sees lincoln and thaddeus stevens quietly talking amid the mess
since we have the floor next in the debate i thought id suggest you might
temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends
ashley insists youre ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving democrats
i cant ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole house with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats when the war ends
i intend to push for full equality the negro vote and much more
congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property
well use their confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free negro farmers and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors
well build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom
the nation needs to know that we have such plans
thats the untempered version of reconstruction
its not exactly what i intend but we shall oppose one another in the course of time
now were working together and im asking you for patience i expect
when the people disagree bringing them together requires going slow till theyre ready to make up
ah shit on the people and what they want and what theyre ready for
i dont give a goddamn about the people and what they want
this is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of em
and i look a lot worse without the wig
the people elected me
to represent them
to lead them
and i lead
you ought to try it
i admire your zeal mr
stevens and i have tried to profit from the example of it
but if id listened to you idve declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck fort sumter then the border states wouldve gone over to the confederacy the
war wouldve been lost and the union along with it and instead of abolishing slavery as we hope to do in two weeks wed be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the american south into south america
stevens glares at him then smiles
oh how you have longed to say that to me
you claim you trust them but you know what the people are
you know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women north and south unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil
white people cannot bear the thought of sharing this countrys infinite abundance with negroes
lincoln reaches over to stevens and gives his shoulder a vigorous shake
stevens endures this
a compass i learnt when i was surveying itll itll point you true north from where youre standing but its got no advice
about the swamps and deserts and chasms that youll encounter along the way
if in pursuit of your destination you plunge ahead heedless of obstacles and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp whats the use of knowing true north
spectacles on lincoln unlaces marys corset
roberts going to plead with us to let him enlist
hes unlaced enough she unhooks the front and steps out of her corset and petticoats turns to him in her plain thin chemise and drawers
make time to talk to robbie
you only have time for tad
too young for the army
plenty of boys younger than robert signing up
dont take robbie
dont let me lose my son
theres a knock on the door
mary turns to it furious go away
lincoln opens the door
nicolays standing there
secretary stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hour ago the shelling of wilmington harbor has commenced
lincoln leaves with nicolay
mary watches frozen unable to let him go knowing she cant stop him
the telegraph office looks improvised even after four years
formerly the war department library its lined with bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches
telegraph cables stretch across the ceiling to the cipher operators desks
stanton perpetually exhausted and impatient storms down the stairs with welles and the chief telegraph operator major thomas eckert in his wake
they cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault
terrys got ten thousand men surrounding the goddamned fort
why doesnt he answer my cables
fort fisher is a mountain of its the largest fort they a building edwin
twenty two have sir
theyve been big seacoast guns on each reinforcing it for the last rampart two years they reach the desks for the key operators
among these samuel beckwith and the key manager david homer bates sit at their silent keys waiting to receive news
stanton scribbles furiously on beckwiths small notepad
theyve taken shells since yesterday
the commander is an old goat
i want to hear that fort fishers ours and wilmington major eckert has fallen
they said send another damn cable
stanton thrusts the cable at beckwith who taps it out immediately
stanton turns to a table where the large map of wilmington from the cabinet meeting is laid out heavily scribbled on
gustavus fox assistant secretary of the navy and charles benjamin stantons clerk are checking the marks on the map against a stack of dispatches
the problems their commander whiting
he engineered the fortress himself
the damned things his child hell defend it till his every last man is gone
he is not thinking rationally hes hollering
come on out you old rat
everyones startled and confused
they all turn to lincoln who sits in major eckerts chair wrapped in his shawl
thats what ethan allen called to the commander of fort ticonderoga in
come on out you old rat
course there were only forty odd redcoats at ticonderoga
but but there is one ethan allen story that im very partial to no
no youre youre going to tell a story
i dont believe that i can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now
stanton stalks out shouting down the corridor as he goes i need the b o sideyard schedules for alexandria
i asked for them this morning
lincoln pays no attention to stantons fulminations and continues with his story
it was right after the revolution right after peace had been concluded and ethan allen went to london to help our new country conduct its business with the king
the english sneered at how rough we are and rude and simple minded and on like that everywhere he went till one day he was invited to the townhouse of
a great english lord
dinner was served beverages imbibed time passed as happens and mr
allen found he needed the
he was grateful to be directed thence relieved you might say
allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of george washington
ethan allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room
his host and the others were disappointed when he didnt mention washingtons portrait
and finally his lordship couldnt resist and asked mr
allen had he noticed it the picture of washington
well what did he think of its placement did it seem appropriately located to mr
allen said it did
his host was astounded
george washingtons likeness in a water closet
yes said mr
allen where itll do good service the whole world knows nothingll make an englishman shit quicker than the sight of george washington
i love that story
beckwiths and batess keys starts clicking
they transcribe furiously
theres a general rush to the operators desks
lincoln walks quickly over and is joined there by stanton who arrives just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being decoded
stanton and lincoln hold hands as theyve done many times waiting for news of the battle
bates hands the decoded cable to benjamin who reads it quickly then announces to the room fort fisher is ours
weve taken the port
eckert shakes his head as beckwith hands him the next telegram
weve taken the fort but the city of wilmington has not surrendered
a beat as this sinks in
then how many casualties
eckert looks up at stanton and lincoln stricken
one representatives reading a paper with the headline the fallen at wilmington followed by hundreds of names
pendleton and wood are conferring
and more to come
sours the national mood
that might suffice to discourage him to what
to bring this down
not in a fight like this
this is to the death
are you despairing or merely lazy
this fight is for the united states of america
theyre not lazy
theyre busily buying votes
while we hope to be saved by the national mood
he looks over at stevens whos at his desk consulting with ashley and julian
before this blood is dry when stevens next takes the floor taunt him you excel at that get him to proclaim what we all know he believes in his coal
colored heart that this vote is meant to set the black race on high to niggerate america
stay on course
bring stevens to full froth
i can ensure that every newspaperman from louisville to san francisco will be here to witness it and print it
colfax gavels the chamber to order as george yeaman approaches the podium
the floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman from kentucky mr
i thank you speaker colfax
the democrats applaud as yeaman takes his place at the podium and surveys the chamber
although im disgusted by slavery i rise on this sad and solemn day to announce that im opposed to the amendment
we must consider what will become of colored folk if four million are in one instant set free
cheers and boos
theyll be free george
thats whatll become of them
whatll become of any of us
thats what being free means
schell latham and bilbo are perched in their usual gallery seats taking notes
think how splendid if mr
shaking his head too publicly against us
he cant change course now
not for some miserable little job anyways
we will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race it would be inhuman not to
who among us is prepared to give negroes the vote
hes momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the chamber
what shall follow upon that
votes for women
yeaman is stopped baffled and dismayed by the explosion hes provoked
hawkins enters and stops when he sees pendleton and wood
its a trap
leclerk follows closing the door
bless my eyes if it isnt the post master of millersburg ohio
hawkins looks at leclerk who guiltily avoids his glance
leclerk felt honor bound to inform us
of your disgusting betrayal
is that true postmaster hawkins
is your maidenly virtue for sale
bilbo and clay hawkins are again in the woods
bilbo with his basket clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges
my neighbors hear that i voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace they will kill me
a deals a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants just cause theres talk about peace talks
my neighbors in nashville look ill find another job
they found out i was loyal to the union they came after me with gelding knives
hawkins runs away from bilbo
bilbo chases him
to himself as he you do right clay hawkins
runs and make yourself some money any other job
in the bargain turning back to bilbo i want to do right
but i got no courage
hawkins runs away sobbing
you wanted what was it tax man for the western reserve hell you can have the whole state of ohio if you bilbo stops winded
seward smoking unhappily strides toward his carriage with schell latham and bilbo in pursuit
two days ago we had twelve
its the goddamned rumors there are defections in the regarding the richmond ranks
the peace delegation
i told you that
and yet the rumors persist
they are ruining us
among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible there is a perceptible increase in resistance
seward has reached the carriage bilbo alongside him
before the secretary of state can climb on board bilbo shuts the carriage door
seward is outraged
thingamabob hollister dem from indiana
i approached him the sumbitch near to murdered me
bilbo is talking to harold hollister d in who pulls out a derringer
bilbo bolts dropping the folder
he stops runs back and bends to retrieve the folio as hollister fires the gun over bilbos head
seward now inside the carriage slams the door
perhaps you push too hard
i push nobody
perhaps we need reinforcements
if jeff davis wants to cease hostilities who do you thinkll give a genuine solid shit to free slaves
get back to it and good day gentlemen
schell and latham lean in to the carriage
we are at an impasse
tell lincoln to deny the rumors
tell us what you expect of us
i expect you to do your work
and to have sufficient sense and taste not to presume to instruct the president
schell steps up on the running board intent
is there a confederate offer or not
grant beard uniform worn and rumpled crosses the dock followed by three aides
they approach the gangway for the river queen
grant and the commissioners stand in an expansive cabin at the stern patriotically decorated large windows
grant hands the commissioners peace proposal back to them
hes scribbled notes all over the document
i suggest you work some changes to your proposal before you give it to the president
were eager to be on our way to washington
lincoln tell you to tell us this general grant
grant fixes stephens with a look bemused a little disappointed
securing peace for our two countries
and it goes on like that
i dont know what you theres just one country
you and i were citizens of that country
im fighting to protect it from armed rebels
blair told us he he told president davis we were a private citizen like preston blair can say what he pleases since he has no authority over anything
if you want to discuss peace with president lincoln consider revisions
he lights a cigar
if were not to discuss a truce between warring nations what in heavens name can we discuss
terms of surrender
as a somber grant disembarks with his aides from the river office united states military telegraph war dept
for abraham lincoln president of the united states
state confidentially that i am convinced upon conversation with these commissioners that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union
i fear now their going back without any expression of interest
sewards voice takes over from grants
from anyone in authority
from anyone in authority mr
sewards in a fancy robe and slippers reading a telegram
will have a bad influence
i will be sorry should it prove impossible for you to have an interview with them
i am awaiting your instructions
grant lieutenant general commanding armies united states lincoln is in his coat shawl over his shoulders holding his hat
after four years of war and near lives lost
he believes we can end this war now
my trust in him is marrow deep
seward looks up at lincoln then down again at the telegram
he stands and crosses to lincoln
you could bring the delegates to washington
in exchange for the souths immediate surrender we could promise them the amendments defeat
theyd agree dont you think
wed end the war
lincoln has closed his eyes
if you could manage without seeming to do it to lincoln shakes his head no
the peace delegation might encounter delays as they travel up the james river
particularly with the fighting around wilmington
within ten days time we might pass the thirteenth amendment
lincoln shawl still wrapped around him walks the long empty hall
lincoln sits before an open window
hes dishevelled in shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest next to an inkwell papers and books of law scattered about and a lit candle in a candlestick guttering
grants telegraph is in one hand and in the other hand his spectacles and dangling from a chain his open pocket watch
his bare left foot keeps time with the watchs loud ticking
he stares out into the cold night
the room is spare and neat
nicolay and hay are asleep in their beds
lincoln is sitting at the foot of hays bed spectacles on reading a petition the others in his lap pencil in hand
now heres a sixteen year old boy
theyre going to hang him
hay startles awake then settles
hes used to this
he reads a little he was with the th indiana calvary near beaufort seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle
i dont think even stanton would
complain if i pardoned him
you think stanton would complain
nicolay stirs in the next bed
i dont know sir i dont know who youre uh
what time is it
its three forty in the morning
not waking up dont
let him pardon any more deserters
nicolays asleep again
stanton thinks you pardon too many
hes generally apoplectic on the subject he oughtnt to have done that crippled his horse that was cruel but you dont just hang a sixteen year old boy for that
ask the horse what he thinks
thered be no sixteen year old boys left
a beat then grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to washington
there are secesh delegates
scribbling a note signing the petition he was afraid thats all it was
i dont care to hang a boy for being frightened either
what good would it do him
he signs the pardon
then he gives hays leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze
it hurts a little
wars nearly done
aint that so
what use one more corpse
any more corpses
putting the rest of the petitions on hays bed he stands to leave
do you need company
as before lincoln continues his slow and solitary walk
times like this im best alone
lincoln is seated at eckerts desk shawl wrapped around his shoulders glasses on he stares down into his hat held between his knees
homer bates and sam beckwith are waiting for him
lincoln draws a handwritten note from his hat and carefully unfolds it
lieutenant general ulysses s
grant city point
i have read your words with interest
sam beckwith transcribes lincolns words into code on a pad with a pencil
i ask that regardless of any action i take in the matter of the visit of the richmond commissioners you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle as you
have done until now
he stops for a moment
beckwith waits pencil poised
lincoln looks at the note folds it tucks it in a band inside his hat
have captain saunders convey the commissioners to me here in washington
and the date
lincoln places the hat on the floor
shall i transmit sir
a beat then you think we choose to be born
i dont suppose so
are we fitted to the times were born into
i dont know about myself
you may be sir
what do you reckon
im an engineer
i reckon theres machinery but no ones done the fitting
youre an engineer you must know euclids axioms and common notions
i mustve in school but
i never had much of schooling but i read euclid in an old book i borrowed
little enough ever found its way in here touching his cranium but once learnt it stayed learnt
euclids first common notion is this things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other
homer doesnt get it neither does sam
thats a rule of mathematical reasoning
its true because it works has done and always will do
in his book euclid says this is self evident
there it is even in that two thousand year old book of mechanical law it is a self evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are
equal to each other
we begin with equality
thats the origin isnt it
that balance thats fairness thats justice
he looks at his scribbled note then at sam and homer
read me the last sentence of my telegram
have captain saunders convey the commissioners to me here in washington
a slight emendation sam if you would
beckwith writes as lincoln dictates
have captain saunders convey the gentlemen aboard the river queen as far as hampton roads virginia and there wait until
further advice from me
do not proceed to washington
the chambers noisy and packed
in the balconys front row a wall of newspapermen notebooks at the ready
ashley colfax and stevens approach stevenss desk
colfax nods towards the journalists in the balcony the world the herald and the times new york chicago the journal of commerce even your hometown papers here
say you believe only in legal equality for all races not racial equality i beg you sir
or you risk it all
stevens sees mary with mrs
keckley claiming front seats from two journalists
stevens at the podium is being challenged by fernando wood standing at his desk
ive asked you a question mr
stevens and you must answer me
do you or do you not hold that the precept that all men are created equal is meant literally
all eyes are on stevens the chamber quiet except for a scratching sound the journalists have begun scribbling
is that not the true purpose of the amendment
to promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate the true purpose of the amendment mr
wood you perfectly named brainless obstructive object
you have always insisted mr
stevens that negroes are the same as white men are
the true purpose of the amendment stevens looks up at the balcony at the waiting journalists and mary who raises her eyebrows then at ashley and litton at their desks
seward watches from the balcony
stevens returns to wood
i dont hold with equality in all things only with equality before the law and nothing more
thats not so
you believe that negroes are entirely equal to white men
youve said it a thousand leaping to his feet for shame
stop prevaricating and answer representative wood
i dont hold with equality in stands all things only with after the decades of fervent equality before the law and advocacy on behalf of the nothing more
colored race hes answered your questions
this amendment has naught to do with race equality
pendleton persists through cheers and catcalls
you have long insisted have i dont hold with equality in you not that the dusk all things only with equality colored race is no different before the law and
nothing from the white one
among the amendments supporters including vintner litton a group of women suffragists in the balcony and elizabeth keckley theres visible audible shock and dismay at stevenss capitulation
marys surprised by stevens and impressed
whispering to mrs
whod everve guessed that old nightmare capable of such control
he might make a politician someday i need to go
keckley leaves the balcony pushing past journalists
on the floor your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative
it is in fact unworthy of a white man
giving in to his anger how can i hold that all men are created equal when here before me pointing to pendleton stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman
from ohio proof that some men are inferior endowed by their maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood
you are more reptile than man george so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you
yet even you pendleton who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law
and so again sir and again and again and
again i say i do not hold with ashley sits nearly weeping with relief while the chamber explodes laughter applause boos
the journalists pack up their notebooks this is fun but not newsworthy and only a few bother to record it
stevens limps out through the aisle to wild republican applause
he looks up to the balcony mary is looking down approvingly
he looks down before she can see him smile
stevens sits on a bench alone thinking troubled
asa vintner litton approaches him
you asked if ever i was surprised
stevens i was surprised
youve led the battle for race equality for thirty years
the basis of of every hope for this countrys future life you denied negro equality
you refused to say that all humans are well
have you lost your very soul mr
is there nothing you wont say
stevens nods then quietly im sorry youre nauseous asa that must be unpleasant
i want the amendment to pass
so that the constitutions first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition
for this amendment for which i have worked all of my life and for which
countless colored men and women have fought and died and now hundreds of thousands of soldiers no sir no it seems there is very nearly nothing i wont say
lincoln and robert are in the buggy driven by the old soldier a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs
lincoln is on one side reading over a stack of documents
roberts on the other side of the buggy staring sullenly at his feet
the buggy stops outside an army hospital
lincoln packs up his papers
im not going in
you said you wanted to help me
this is this is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement
ive been to army hospitals ive seen surgeries i went and visited the malaria barges with mama
she told me she didnt take you inside
i snuck in after ive seen what its like
this changes nothing
at all rates im happy to have your company
stepping out of the buggy he hands his folio to the bodyguard and enters the army hospital
hes met in the antechamber by an army surgeon
good to see you again
they move into the main ward lincoln removing his hat
well boys first question you getting enough to eat
he walks from bed to bed shaking hands with each patient
most are amputees
whats your name soldier
good to meet you robert
nice to meet you
whats your name
tell me your names as i go past
i like to know who im talkin to
ive seen you before
robert brooding waits in the buggy
hearing a creaking rumbling sound robert turns to see two black orderlies in grey uniforms wrangling a large top heavy wheelbarrow covered with filthy canvas
one orderly pushes while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over
robert notices in the barrows wake a trail of blood
he gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a corner of the building
behind the building where the ground is bare pitted with puddles of water robert watches as the orderlies reach the edge of a shallow pit
one orderly pulls the canvas back revealing severed legs arms hands rotten burnt shattered by bullet or bomb
robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit
quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs
robert walks away unsteady
around the corner he fumbles through his pockets for rolling paper and tobacco
he locates these and tries to focus on rolling a cigarette his hands shaking
he tries harder to control his hands his feelings but he cant
he has a panic attack crying hiccupy shallow breathing face flushed
frustrated he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold back tears
whats the matter bob
robert looks up mortified to see lincoln watching him with concern
he wipes his eyes his mouth
i have to do this
and i will do it and i dont need your permission to enlist
that same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began
i dont need your damn permission you miserable old goat im gonna enlist anyhow
and what wouldnt those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons as i now say to mine im commander in chief so in point of
fact without my permission you aint enlisting in nothing nowhere young man
its mama youre scared of not me getting killed
lincoln slaps robert in the face
it shocks them both
lincoln tries to embrace robert but robert shoulders past him and walks back toward the front of he building
i have to do this
and i will
or i will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life
whether or not you fought is whats gonna matter
and not just to other people but to myself
i wont be you pa
i cant do that
but i dont want to be nothing
he hurries away
we cant lose you
outside driving rain and wind
lincoln sits by the window in his coat vest and tie hair combed neatly
hell be fine molly
city points far from the front lines from the fighting hell be an adjutant running messages for general grant
mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress pale with rage
the war will take our son
a sniper or a shrapnel shell
or typhus same as took willie it takes hundreds of boys a day
hell die uselessly and how will i ever forgive you
most men their firstborn is their favorite but you youve always blamed robert for being born for trapping you in a marriage thats only ever given you grief and caused
thats not true and if the slaughter of cold harbor is on your hands same as grant god help us
well pay for the oceans of spilled blood youve sanctioned the uncountable corpses well be made to pay with our sons dear lincoln rises from the window seat angry
just just this once mrs
lincoln i demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view
you imagine robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition
with a mocking smile and if i refuse to take the high road if i wont take up the rough old cross will you threaten me again with the madhouse
as you did when i couldnt stop crying over willie when i showed you what heartbreak real heartbreak looked like and you hadnt the courage to countenance it to help me thats right
when you i was in the room with refused so much as to comfort willie i was holding him in tad my arms as he died
the child who was not only how dare you
sick dangerously sick but beside himself with grief
oh but your grief your how dare you throw that at grief your inexhaustible me
and his mother wont let him i couldnt let tad in
i near her cause shes couldnt risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry i was
night pacing the corridors howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts
i ought to have done it i ought have done for tads sake for everybodys goddamned sake i should have clapped you in the madhouse
then do it
dont you threaten me you do it this time
lock me away
youll have to i swear if robert is killed
then i couldnt tolerate you grieving so for willie because i couldnt permit it in myself though i wanted to mary
i wanted to crawl under the earth into the vault with his coffin
i still do
every day i do
talk to me about grief
i must make my decisions bob must make his you yours
and bear what we must hold and carry what we must
what i carry within me you must allow me to do it alone as i must
and you alone mary you alone may lighten this burden or render it intolerable
as you choose
she opens her mouth to make an angry reply then stops and watches as he leaves the room
onstage gounods faust act three scene eight the garden outside marguerites cottage a gorgeously romantic night
marguerite and faust are alone singing
the lincolns in their box watch quietly
elizabeth keckley sits next to mary
mary turns to lincoln
they speak in whispers
keckley tries not to listen but she cant help hearing what they say
you think im ignorant of what youre up to because you havent discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done
when have i ever been so easily bamboozled
i believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war
and since you are sending my son into the war woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment
seward doesnt want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town
no one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths
seward cant do it
because if you fail to secure the necessary votes woe unto you sir
you will answer to me
the carriage has pulled up and mary is entering the white house
lincoln helps mrs
keckley down from the carriage
she hesitates before proceeding in
then she faces lincoln
i know the vote is only four days away i know youre concerned
thank you for your concern over this and i want you to know theyll approve it
god will see to it
i dont envy him his task
he may wish hed chosen an instrument for his purpose more wieldy than the house of representatives
then youll see to it
lincoln looks at her considering
then are you afraid of what lies ahead
for your people
if we succeed
white people dont want us here
what about you
i dont know you mrs
any of you
familiar to me as all people are
unaccommodated poor bare forked creatures such as we all are
you have a right to expect what i expect and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other
i assume ill get used to you
but what you are to the nation whatll become of you once slaverys day is done i dont know
what my people are to be i cant say
negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave
i never heard any ask what freedom will bring
as for me my son died fighting for the union wearing the union blue
for freedom he died
im his mother
thats what i am to the nation mr
what else must i be
the room is far filthier and more cluttered than before
bilbo and latham are playing cards
schell is asleep in bed
my whole hands gonna be proud in about five seconds lets see how proud you gonna be
oh it is
what you got goin
theres a quick knock on the door
that watch fob is that gold
you keep your eyes off my fob
seward enters displeased as they show their cards laughing
oh my god damn
you have a visitor
latham jovially collects his winnings
he stops short when lincoln steps into the room cloak and stovepipe very tall
well ill be fucked
i wouldnt bet against it mr
schell startles awake as bilbo puts down his cigar and wipes his hand on his vest
why are you here
no offense but mr
sewards banished the very mention of your name he wont even
let us use fifty cent pieces cause they got your face on em
the secretary of state here tells me that uh you got eleven democrats in the bag
oh youve got no cause to be encouraged
are we being
lincoln sits at the card table
we have heard the chimes of midnight master shallow
im here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us
the democrats weve yet to bag sir
the patronage jobs simply wont bag em
they require more
he turns to bilbo
do me a favor willya
snagged my eye in the paper this morning
governor curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed congressional election for the pennsylvania th district
what a joy to be comprehended
hop on a train to philadell call on the governor
looking askance at send latham
no hell do fine just polish yourself up first
bilbo cigar back in mouth laughs
the incumbent is claiming he won it
name of uh
he is a democrat
i understand he is
let governor curtin know itd be much appreciated if hed invite the house of representatives to decide who won
hes entitled to do that
hell agree to it
then advise coffroth if he hopes to retain his seat that hed better pay a visit to thaddeus stevens
pity poor coffroth
stevens is at his desk paperwork piled high
theres a knock at the door
a nervous man enters hesitantly alexander coffroth
stevens glares at him with what looks like horror
coffroths frightened smile transforms into a rictus of pain
then you are canfrey
stevens alexander coffroth im im are we representatives of the same state
y yes sir
we sit only three desks stevens waves him into a chair
i havent noticed you
im a republican and you coughdrop are a democrat
um that is to say
i the modern travesty of thomas jeffersons political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself the democratic party
you are a dem o crat
whats the matter with you
are you wicked
well i felt um formerly i never mind coffsnot
you were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in novembers election by your worthy challenger a no sir i was not um trounced
uh he wants to steal my seat
i didnt lose the election
what difference does it make if you lost or not
the governor of our state is
no hes a
baffled terrified a um a ruh
i know what he is
this is a rhetorical exercise
and congress is controlled by what party
coffroth doesnt know whether to answer
he shakes his head
your party was beaten your challengers party now controls the house and hence the house committee on elections so you have been beaten
you shall shortly be sent home in disgrace
i know what i must do sir
i will immediately become a republican and vote yes for no
coffroth will vote yes but coffroth will remain a democrat until after he does so
why wait to switch
im happy to we want to show the amendment has bipartisan support you idiot
early in the next congress when i tell you to do so you will switch parties
now congratulations on your victory and get out
continue with lincoln and his operatives around the card table
now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting
schell latham and bilbo exchange looks then george yeaman
but yeaman thatd count
lincoln looks up from his notepad smiling
i got it
seward sits at his grand desk looking on with an anxious scowl
lincoln sits on the edge of sewards desk
yeaman sits in a chair facing him
i cant vote for the amendment mr
i saw a barge once mr
yeaman filled with colored men in chains heading down the mississippi to the new orleans slave markets
it sickened me n more than that it brought a shadow down a pall around my eyes
slavery troubled me as long as i can remember in a way it never troubled my father though he hated it
in his own fashion
he knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations
he took us out from kentucky to get away from em
he wanted indiana kept free
he wasnt a kind man but there was a rough moral urge for fairness for freedom in him
i learnt that from him i suppose if little else from him
we didnt care for one another mr
well im sorry to hear that lovingkindness that most ordinary thing came to me from other sources
im grateful for that
i hate it too sir slavery but but were entirely unready for emancipation
theres too many
were unready for peace too aint we
when it comes itll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any weve faced during the war bloody as its been
well have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is
lincoln moves from the desk to take the seat beside yeaman no longer towering over him
he leans forward and rests a hand on yeamans knee
i read your speech george
negroes and the vote thats a puzzle
no no but but but but negroes cant um vote mr
youre not suggesting that we enfranchise colored people
im asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers
ill let you know when theres an offer on my desk for surrender
theres none before us now
whats before us now thats the vote on the thirteenth amendment
its going to be so very close
you see what you can do
lincoln leaves yeaman considering
lincoln stands in front of william huttons row house talking to hutton
the funeral wreath still hangs on the door behind them displaying the marks of time passing faded weatherbeaten dusty
i cant make sense of it what he died for
lincoln i hate them all i do all black people
i am a prejudiced man
the door opens slightly behind hutton
his wife looks out
hutton exchanges a glance with her and the door shuts again
id change that in you if i could but thats not why i come
i might be wrong mr
hutton but i expect
colored people will most likely be free and when thats so its simple truth that your brothers bravery and his death helped make it so
only you can decide whether thats sense enough for you or not
hutton walks slowly back to his house
my deepest sympathies to your family
lincoln goes back to his buggy
hutton pauses at his door to watch lincolns buggy drive away
lincoln is seated at the head of the cabinet table along with seward
ashley preston and montgomery blair
hay and nicolay sit in their usual chairs
weve managed our members to a fare thee well youve had no defections from the republican right to trouble you whereas as to what you promised where the hell are
lied to me mr
you evaded my requests for a denial that that there is a confederate peace offer because because there is one
we are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing
and well be discredited we dont need a goddamned the amendment itself will be abolition amendment
what if what if the constitution alone
state these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate appear today
or worse on the morning i cant listen to this anymore
i cant accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war and whether any of you or anyone
else knows it i know i need this
this amendment is that cure
were stepped out upon the worlds stage now now with the fate of human dignity in our hands
bloods been spilt to afford us this moment
he points around the table at ashley monty preston
now now now
and you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging tammany hall hucksters
see what is before you
see the here and now
thats the hardest thing the only thing that accounts
abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate for all coming time not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come
two votes stand in its way and these votes must be procured
we need two yeses three abstentions or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass you got a night and a day and a night and several
perfectly good hours
now get the hell out of here and get em
yes but how
buzzards guts man
lincoln rises and keeps rising till he seems eight feet tall
i am the president of the united states of america clothed in immense power
you will procure me these votes
the chamber is quiet and dark
pages and clerks prepare the desks laying out pens and paper filling inkwells
a clerk is draping red white and blue bunting on the desks of representatives from seceded states
these will of course remain unoccupied during the vote
the first congressman to arrive thaddeus stevens clumps in
he goes to his desk and sits
he looks around the empty chamber ready and waiting
thaddeus stevens is at his desk
the house is in session the floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing
the balconys packed
mary and keckley sit at the front nicolay and hay behind them
the blairs are among other officials rich people foreign dignitaries
theres a sudden quiet then murmuring
ashley stevens and everyone on the floor look up ellis hollister hutton and hawkins among these
in the balcony twenty well to do black people mostly men are escorted by several senators including sumner and wade to a reserved section of the balcony
the black people glance at their surroundings but are rigidly composed
asa vintner litton sees them enter
he looks about at the representatives caucusing or staring up at the visitors
something powerful strikes him
in a voice coarse with emotion he calls up to the black visitors
we welcome you ladies and gentlemen first in the history of this peoples chamber to your house
theres tense applause
some of the black guests bow most arent sure how to respond
yeaman watches this deeply moved
bilbo catches hawkinss eye and waves
hawkins looks anxiously around blushing
everyone is seated and the place is packed
schuyler colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum the sergeant at arms to his right
colfax gavels the house into session
ashley is at the podium
ashley the floor is yours
on the matter of the joint resolution before us presenting a thirteenth amendment to our national constitution which was passed last year by the senate and which has been debated
now by this estimable body for the past several weeks
today we will vote
cheers boos applause
by mutual agreement we shall hear brief final statements general cheering for this laughing
beginning with the honorable george pendleton of ohio
pendleton taking the podium is handed several letters by wood
he holds them over his head
the chambers quiet
ive just received confirmation of what previously has been merely rumored
affidavits from loyal citizens recently returned from
they testify that commissioners have indeed come north and ought to have arrived by now in washington city
bearing an offer of immediate cessation of our civil war
the chamber explodes
through the ensuing ruckus to ashley fake shock are there confederate commissioners in the capitol
i have no idea where they are or if theyve arrived or if theyve arrived
i appeal to my fellow democrats to all republican representatives who give a fig for peace
postpone this vote until we have answers from the president himself
in the balcony hay and nicolay exchange worried glances
postpone the vote
ashley turns to stevens do something
as pendletons democrats begin to chant postpone the vote
mary worried looks from mrs
keckley to preston blair who is focused on the leader of the conservative republican representatives aaron haddam r ky
haddam looks up at preston awaiting instructions
democrats and republicans rush to the speaker to support or protest the motion
in the balcony preston slowly stands saddened and angry
i have made a motion
does anyone here care to second preston nods at haddam go ahead
in a powerful voice gentlemen
the conservative faction of border and western republicans cannot approve this amendment about which we harbor grave doubts if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success
joining with our democratic colleagues i second the motion to postpone
the debate swells again as in the balcony schell scribbles in a notebook while latham whispers furiously in his ear
latham rips the page out before schells finished bilbo snatches it from him
bilbo pushes his way out of the balcony
nicolay then hay follow on his heels
mary sees this shes concerned
hay and nicolay emerge
they see bilbo running far ahead
hay immediately sprints after him and trips
nicolay continues running
bilbo puffs his way across the portico through the door and up the stairs
hay gains on him
its become a race
in the second floor hallway bilbo gets winded and hay dashes past him
hay reaches the doors to lincolns office and flings them open
lincoln is at his desk working when hay bursts in
bilbo appears in the doorway beet red and gasping for air
hays too winded to speak
bilbo holds out the note limp with sweat and brings it to lincoln
lincoln reads it
this is precisely what mr
wood wishes me to respond to
tad runs into the room excited by the commotion
he wraps his arm around his fathers neck then tears wildly out of the room
word for word
this is precisely the assurance that he demands of me
as nicolay heaves into the room in last place wheezing terribly lincoln deliberates for a moment then writes a note
he blots folds and hands it to hay who immediately reads it nicolay looking on
give this to mr
hay looks at nicolay who cant speak he waves at hay to speak for him
i feel um i have to say mr
lincoln that this annoyed impatient to could you please just step outside
you gonna have a chat now with with the whole of the house of representatives waiting on that
nicolay continues gasping trying to speak
making false representation to congress is its um its its impeachable
ive made no false representation
but there are
there is a delegation from richmond
give me the note johnnie
hay gives lincoln the note
lincoln takes it holding on to hays hand with his free hand lincoln passes the note to bilbo
please deliver that to mr
bilbo pushing past the pages runs in holding the note ashley snatches it reading as he makes his way to the podium
all eyes are on ashley
from the president the chamber falls silent
so far as i know there are no peace commissioners in the city nor are there likely to be
applause booing furious discussion
so far as i know
that means nothing
are there commissioners from the south or arent there
in the balcony mary looks to mrs
the president has answered you sir
your peace offer is a fiction
that is not a denial it is a lawyers dodge
is your faction satisfied
preston in the balcony hesitates
he looks at his daughter who gives him a questioning look do you want this on your head
he indicates to haddam with a small shake of his venerable head drop it
the conservative republican factions satisfied and we thank mr

the clerk continues

yeaman i didnt hear you rising to his feet i said aye mr

leclerk gapes at hawkins

leclerk seated next to hawkins and transfixed by his courage turns dazedly to mcpherson
then standing abruptly oh to hell with it shoot me dead too
the noise gets wilder
pendleton fixes leclerk and hawkins with a murderous look
i mean abstention
disgust briefly flashing across his face mcpherson crosses out and changes leclerks vote to an abstention
the cheering and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this means for the vote count
in the balcony bilbo looks at hawkins well pleased
coffroth looks towards stevens who doesnt look at him
proud of himself and happy about the reward i
stevens still doesnt look at coffroth but tickled he grins and nods
grant stands with robert at the balcony rail waiting
on a nearby board a large map has been tacked backwards on its reverse side the count is being scrawled by an officer who marks off the votes in quintiles
in columns marked yea and nay
i vote yes
then in a sequence of rapid cuts mr
tad is on lincolns lap
theyre examining a book the pages of which feature illustrations comparing the varieties of species of insects zebras finches
the room is quiet and tense

the clerk tallies the vote then passes the recorded vote to the speaker
theres absolute silence
in the balcony mary checks her own tally not quite believing it
the final vote eight absent or not voting fifty six votes against one hundred nineteen votes for
with a margin of two votes lincoln stands waiting
the only sound is the ticking of the clock
and then the ticking is slowly drowned out as bells begin to peal throughout the city
lincoln raises the window as tad rushes to him
the bells are joined by a cannonade
the sound of jubilation fills his office
lincoln turns from the window to tad who stares out eagerly seeking out the source of the noise
lincoln puts his hand on tads head
he looks down at his son silent
representatives throw papers in the air embrace weep shout dance climb on desks
in the balcony mary stands slowly beyond tears or joy mrs
keckley stands with her smiling crying
preston blair applauds vigorously
the black visitors join the general exultation overwhelmed some praying others embracing and weeping
lathams schells and bilbos seats are empty theyve gone
ashley grinning from ear to ear tears streaming down his face is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room as on the floor and in the balcony people
start singing the battle cry of freedom
pendleton with the face of someone whos seen his world collapse into ruin walks straight at yeaman whos listening to the singing deeply moved his face full of wonder
pendleton turns without a word and leaves the house
yeaman laughs and loudly joins in singing
stevens clumps over to the clerk of the house who is placing his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a folio
he looks up
the bill mr
mcpherson may i
the clerk hands the bill to stevens who folds it and pockets it
thats the official bill
ill return it in the morning
creased but unharmed
celebrating crowds move towards the mall singing carrying placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment
thaddeus stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction making difficult headway against the crowd pushed and shoved unrecognized he shoves back his ferocious scowl utterly at odds with the prevailing
he reaches a modest house unlocks the door and steps inside
stevens is met at the door by lydia smith a black woman in her fifties
as she helps him off with his coat he takes a piece of paper from his pocket
a gift for you
she takes it
the greatest measure of the nineteenth century
passed by corruption aided and abetted by the purest man in america
stevens in his nightgown takes off his wig
he lies down in bed
smith is in bed already beside him
shes holding the paper he gave her
i wish youd been present
i wish id been
it was a spectacle
you cant bring your housekeeper to the house
i wont give them gossip
this is enough
its more than enough for now
he lies back
he grabs her hand
read it to me again my love
an amendment to the constitution of the united states
section one neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place
subject to their jurisdiction
congress shall have power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation
thaddeus stevens grins nods thinking eyes sparkling
sailors cheer lincolns arrival
lincoln walks across the gangway
seward greets him amidst the cheers
lincoln seward and the commissioners are seated
seward looks concerned at lincolns fatigue
let me be blunt
will the southern states resume their former position in the union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the thirteenth amendment
id like peace immediately
id like your states restored to their practical relations to the union immediately
if this could be given me in writing as vice president of the confederacy id bring that document with celerity to jefferson davis
surrender and we can discuss reconstruction
surrender wont be thought of unless youve assured us in writing that well be readmitted in time to block this amendment
this is the arrogant demand of a conqueror for a humiliating youll not be conquered people mr
you will be citizens returned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the constitution
which now extinguishes slavery
and with it our economy
all our laws will be determined by a congress of vengeful yankees all our rightsll be subject to a supreme court benched by black republican radicals
all our traditions will be obliterated
we wont know ourselves anymore
a nod then we aint here to discuss reconstruction we have no legal basis for that discussion
but i dont want to deal falsely
the northern statesll ratify most of em
as i figure it remains for two of the southern states to do the same even after all are readmitted
and i been working on that
tennessee and louisiana
arkansas too most likely
itll be ratified
slavery sir its done
hunter storms out of the cabin
if we submit ourselves to law alex even submit to losing freedoms the freedom to oppress for instance we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us
had you kept faith with democratic process as frustrating as that can be
come sir spare us at least these pieties
did you defeat us with ballots
howve you held your union together
how many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration
your union sir is bonded in cannonfire and death
it may be youre right
but say all we done is show the world that democracy isnt chaos that there is a great invisible strength in a peoples union
say weve shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere
mightnt that save at least the idea of democracy to aspire to
eventually to become worthy of
at all rates whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice mustve been proved by now
shall we stop this bleeding
like a vision of apocalypse a city on the banks of a broad river is being consumed in a hellish fire as artillery shells rend the dark sky asunder raining
the morning is grey and a dense fog covers a vast field
lincoln his stovepipe hat atop his head is mounted on a horse on a rise at one end of the field
behind him several union officers are also mounted
its chilly the breath of the men and the horses is visible
lincoln flicks the reins of his horse which starts down the slope
the officers follow behind him
no one speaks
lincoln rides slowly his focus on the ground before him
debris is scattered all around him along with the bodies of fallen soldiers
he looks up and across the battlefield a terrible battle has concluded a couple of hours ago
looking down as he rides he sees soldiers killed by artillery fire whose bodies lie twisted burned headless limbless torn in two blown out of their clothing or charred too
badly to tell
he sees soldiers killed by rifle and bayonet whose corpses are intact
at the beginning of his ride all the dead and wounded are in union blue the casualties of confederate cannon fire felled as the union army about six hours earlier
began its final successful drive to break through confederate lines
as lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle
he reaches the other side of the field passing a confederate flag to enter the now ruined town of petersburg
grant smoking his cigar his uniform dusty and rumpled is sitting on the small porch
he stares piercingly at lincoln in a rocker next to him watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town
lincoln closes his eyes
he has grown older the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases and his hairs thinner softer suffused with grey
his brow has grown smoother
once he surrenders send his boys back to their homes their farms their shops
yes sir as we discussed
liberality all around
i dont want that
and the leaders jeff and the rest of em if they escape leave the country while my backs turned that wouldnt upset me none
when peace comes it mustnt just be hangings
by outward appearance youre ten years older than you were a year ago
some weariness has bit at my bones
i never seen the like of it before
what i seen today
never seen the like of it before
you always knew that what this was going to be
intimate and ugly
you mustve needed to see it close when you decided to come down here
weve made it possible for one another to do terrible things
and weve won the war
now you have to lead us out of it
officers of the confederate and union army stand around in the afternoon sun
everyones solemn even stunned by whats just happened
no one is speaking
lee comes down the steps of the mclean house as a confederate officer brings his horse to him
his face is blank
lee mounts his waiting horse
lee should leave having just surrendered to grant inside but hes immobile
some of the officers of both sides look at lee some cant bear it
lee tries out various expressions pride defiance blankness
grant stomps onto the porch of the house followed by his staff
among them is robert lincoln
grant lost in thought stops taken aback realizing that lees still there astride his horse
everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another
then grant removes his famous slouch hat
everyone freezes for a moment and then one by one the officers of the union army remove their hats
lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect
he raises his hat briefly only an inch from his head
then pulling slightly on his horses reins he rides away
a beautiful spring afternoon
lincoln and mary are riding in the buggy driven by the old soldier
youve an itch to travel
id like that
to the west by rail
shaking her head no overseas
the holy land
a laugh then awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy riding on good friday
where david and solomon walked
i dream of walking in that ancient city
she seems sadder
they ride in silence
all anyone will remember of me is i was crazy and i ruined your happiness
anyone thinks that doesnt understand molly
she nods then tenderly
when they look at you at what it cost to live at the heart of this theyll wonder at it
theyll wonder at you
but they should also look at the wretched woman by your side if they want to understand what this was truly like
for an ordinary person
for anyone other than you
lincoln laughs takes her hand
she leans against him
we must try to be happier
both of us
weve been so miserable for so long
lincolns in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening wear his hair brushed down and plastered in place
william slade is working the tie and gloves
james ashley and schuyler colfax stand with him holding glasses of scotch whiskey
slade waits with lincolns coat clothes brush the stovepipe hat and gloves on the table
john hay tears down several of the military maps heavily marked from the bookcases where theyre tacked
he drops these on the floor
as they watch hay i did say some colored men the intelligent the educated and veterans i qualified it
stevens is furious he wants to know why you qualified it no one heard the intelligent or the educated part
all they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of negro voting
still i wish id mentioned it in a better speech
stevens also wants to know why you didnt make a better speech
theres a knock on the door nicolay enters
lincolns waiting in the carriage
she wants me to remind you of the hour and that youll have to pick up miss harris and major rathbone
slade enters with lincolns hat coat and gloves
lincoln begins to dress hurriedly
am i in trouble
thank you mr
slade hands lincoln his gloves as colfax and ashley drain their drinks and rise
i suppose its time to go though i would rather stay
he leaves the room
on the way out lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table
slade grabs them considers chasing after lincoln then thinks better of it
he walks back towards the office
then some strange feeling stops him and he turns around again
lincoln is walking away past the petitioners chairs down the empty hallway
slade watches till lincoln turns the corner and hes gone
the theater is adorned with patriotic bunting
onstage a caliphs palace
a young man duels with scimitars against a huge hideous afrit
a young woman in chains cowers in distress
the young man gymnastically avoids being killed then plunges his scimitar into the afrits heart
the demon screams and topples to the ground
the audience gasps as a
flame colored bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrits heart
the audience applauds
in the center box tad lincoln is joining in as is his companion for the evening tom pendel
onstage the bird flies off the young man is freeing the young woman when the scene is halted by the red curtain lowering surprising actors and audience
the music dies the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of the theater leonard grover steps out before the curtain and walks to the center
of the stage pale and badly shaken
in the box tom pendel glances quickly at tad whos fixed on the stage eyes open alarmed
the audience knows somethings wrong
their rising murmur of concern dies immediately when grover raises his hands
the president has been shot
there are screams of horror from the audience people leap from their seats
the president has been shot at fords theater
the theater is a scene of complete pandemonium
people cry jam the aisles call to each other across rows of seats shout questions at grover whos calling for calm inaudible in the uproar
tom pendel is frozen in shock then turns to draw tad close to him
tad pulls away and begins shrieking clinging to the railing so tightly that pendel cant pry him loose
tad cant stop screaming his eyes wide open seeing nothing
mary is gently escorted into a tiny room
a small hissing gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light
stanton speed general henry halleck and a minister are standing
welles sits by the head of the bed
charles leale a young army surgeon and dr
robert stone the lincoln familys doctor stand uselessly by the foot of the bed while dr
joseph barnes the surgeon general listens to lincolns faint breathing
robert in uniform red eyed pale as a ghost sits at the bedside and stares at his father barely breathing
lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal his knees bent on a bed hes too tall to fit properly clad only in a nightshirt
barnes moves his head closer then closer
the room is utterly still
barnes takes out his watch looks at the time softly clears his throat
its in the morning saturday the th of april
its all over
the president is no more
no one talks or moves
stanton looks at lincolns body
now he belongs to the ages
robert begins to weep
fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
lincoln wearing spectacles stands at a podium before the capitol dome still under scaffolding under cloudy skies
he reads from the two pages
yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop
of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
he glances at his audience people from all over the country wounded soldiers civilians in black
and for the first time in the crowd not at its edges hundreds of african americans civilians and soldiers
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we
are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
