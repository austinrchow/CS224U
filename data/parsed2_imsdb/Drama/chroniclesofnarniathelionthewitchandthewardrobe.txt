she told me that i if i ever was to come across a son of adam or a daughter of eve i am supposed to turn it over to her

tumnus starts to return her handkerchief but she gives it back keep it you need it more than i do
tumnus laughs and touches lucys nose
come on go
lucy runs off and mr
tumnus returns to his home lucy heads for the wardrobe
ready or not here i come

i dont think lucy wants to play anymore
susan looks in the wardrobe
the only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe
one game at a time lu we dont all have your imagination
but i wasnt imagining

lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night pan down on candle burning out lucy gets out boots and not slippers and takes candle
flushing toilet as edmund comes out and sees lucy follows her to wardrobe candle blows out when she opens it and walks in as edmund does lucy lucy
i hope youre not afraid of the dark shuts door lucy lucy
edmund is soon in narnia he walks around
and is amazed by it all lucy
i think i believe you now
whipping sound edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf jumps out and throws a whip around edmunds legs dwarf puts knife to edmunds throat
what is it ginarrbrik
he wont let go
is that how you address the queen of narnia
i didnt know
well you shall know her better afterwards
what is your name son of adam
edmund your majesty
and how was it edmund that you came to enter my dominion
i walked through a wardrobe following my sister
how many are you
four edmund you look so cold
come and sit with me here on my sledge
edmund joins her now would like something warm to drink
take vial and drops a green drop on snow that become a hot drink that the dwarf gives edmund how did you do that
i can make anything you like
could you make me taller
i can make anything you like to eat turkish delight drop once again comes down and makes the box of turkish delight and the dwarf gives it to edmund id
love to see your family theyre nothing special i have no children of my own and you are such a good little boy i never could hear those words right where i could see one day you becoming prince of narnia maybe even king
mouth full really
nods of course youd have to bring your family
theyre nothing special oh peter will be king too
but a king needs servants
i i guess i could bring em
beyond these woods do you see those two little hills
my house is right between them
youd love it there edmund it has whole rooms simply stuffed with turkish delight
couldnt i have some more now
smiles dont want to ruin you appetite
im going to miss you edmund
but we are going to see each other soon
i hope so
ww drives of and ed is left alone edmund
hugs her brother i saw mr
tumnus again and hes fine
the white witch hasnt found out about him helping me
the white witch
she calls herself the queen of narnia but she really isnt
are you okay
you look awful
well what do you expect
how do we get out of here
turns on the light and jumps on peter peter peter wake up
its there its really there
rolls over still half asleep lucy what are talking about
its all in the wardrobe like i told you
susan comes in
oh lucy youve been dreaming
no i wasnt i saw mr
oh and this time edmund went too
you saw the faun
well he didnt actually go there with me
what were you doing edmund
i i was just playing along
you know what little children are like these days they just dont know when to stop pretending sits on his bed looking smugly at lucy lucy starts to cry and
runs out of the room
susan runs after her and so does peter who shoves edmund over ow
lucy runs down the hall and smack into the professor she looks up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again hugging him you children are one
shenanigan shy of sleeping in the stable oh professor
i told them you were not to be disturbed
oh its alright mrs
macready im sure theres a logical explanation
but i think this one needs some hot chocolate
come on dear
macready takes lucy down the hall
peter and susan turn to go ahem the two turn and follow him into his office and the professor sits at his desk and takes some tobacco out of its
silver apple case and puts it in his pipe you seem to have upset the internal balance of my housekeeper
we are very sorry sir it wont happen again
its our sister sir lucy
the weeping girl
yes sir shes upset
hence the weeping we can handle it
takes susans sleeve oh i can see that
she thinks shes found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe
what did you say
the wardrobe upstairs lucy thinks shes found a forest inside
susan and peter sit on a couch and the professor sits in a chair across from them what was it like
like talking to a lunatic
no not her the forest
youre youre not saying you believe her
no not her the forest
you actually believe her
well dont you
well logically it couldnt possibly be there
what do they teach at these schools
edmund said they were only pretending and hes the more truthful one is he
no this would be the first time
well then id your sister isnt lying and isnt mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth
shes your sister isnt she
youre a family
its high time you start acting like one
peter winds up goes for the bowl
ball hits edmund in the leg ow
wake up dolly daydream
cant we play hide and go seek again
i thought you said that it was a kids game
besides we can all use the fresh air
not like theres air inside are you ready then
smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball peter pitches the ball hard and edmund whacks it good and it smashes through an upstairs window
and crashes into a suit of armor
the children are looking at the broken window and the suit of armor on the floor well done ed
you bowled it
macready is coming run
runs to the wardrobe and opens the door come on
you have got to be joking
susan and peter fall backwards
dont worry its probably just your imagination i dont suppose saying were sorry would quite cover it
no it wouldnt
but this might
lucy nails peter in the face with a snowball he throws one back at her and a snowball fight begins
susan hits ed in the arm with one ow
rubs his arm stop it
they all realize that ed lied you little liar
you didnt believe her either
apologize to lucy
he just looks at her say youre sorry
peter steps up to him alright
thats alright some little children just dont know when to stop pretending
looks at him smugly mutters very funny
maybe we should go back cant we at lease take a look around
i think lucy must decide
i all want you to meet mr
tumnus it is walks into the wardrobe again we cant just walk around in these clothes
comes out we can use these coats
peter they dont belong to us
well i dont think the professor will mind
and if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe
hands coat to edmund but thats a girls coat
start walking toward mr
tumnus cave through snow and tea and
sees open door and runs off they all run to tumnus house who would do something like this
edmund steps on broken picture of tumnuss dad peter what is that on the wall
the former occupant of these premises the faun tumnus is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of high treason against her imperial majesty jadis queen of narnia
chatelaine of cair paravel empress of the lone islands also to comforting her said majestys enemies harbouring spies and fraternizing with humans
signed maugrim captain of the secret police long live the queen
now we should really go
but we have to help him
its out of our hands now lu
you dont get it do you
im the human
he helped me
maybe we should call the police these are the police
besides hes a criminal
dont worry lucy well think of something psst
did that bird just psst us
they step outside they hear rustles from the bushes
beaver approaches its a beaver
peter approaches the beaver clicking his tongue here boy clicks come here
clicks peter lets out his hand mr
beaver stares at it then sits upright well i aint gonna smell it if thats what you want
its a talking beaver
beaver hands her the handkerchief this is the handkerchief i gave to mr tumnus
he gave it to me just before they took him
is he alright
beaver scurries off susan grabs peter by the arm peter we dont know what you are doing
how do we know we can trust this beaver
he says he knows the faun
hes a beaver
he shouldnt be saying anything
is everything alright
we were just talking thats better left for safer corners
he means the trees
walk to beavers dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then they see the dam there is home sweet home
oh what a beautiful dam mr
merely a trifle
is that you beaver
i find out youve been out with badger again ill
oh theyre not badgers
i never thought i would see this day to mr
beaver you couldnt give me ten minutes warning
look at this fur
i would have given you a week if i thought it would help hee hee well you must be cold and hungry
lets get you inside for some food and civilized conversation
lucy susan peter follow mrs
beaver inside edmund sees jadiss castle
right where its suppose to be enjoying the scenery are we
edmund shakes off that comment enters the dam
beaver follows him fish and sticks dear
is there nothing we can do about mr
yeah theres a load full of hope
aslan is on the move
beaver sees they are serious and lays her hand on mr
you silly little blighter
you dont know do you
well we havent actually been here very long hes only the king the whole wood the true king of narnia
and hes waiting for you
waiting for us
you got to be joking
look aslans return tumnus arrest
the secret police
theyre all happening because of you
youre blaming us
not blaming you dear thanking you
a prophecy when adams flesh and adams bone sits in if cair paravel in throne the evil is over and done
you know that doesnt really rhyme
i know but youre missing the point
its long been told that two sons of adam and two daughters of eve will appear to defeat the white witch and restore peace to narnia
and you think were the ones
well youd better be aslans already fitted out your army
i think youve made a mistake were not heroes
were from finchley
i think its time we were going
but what about mr
its out of our hands
thank you for your hospitality
ed time to go ed
looks around the room im going to kill him
you may not have to
has edmund been to narnia before
shot of ed walking to the witchs castle without his coat shot of the others trying to catch up to him hurry up
they reach the top of the hill and see ed going through the witchs castle gates shouting edmund
theyll hear ya
peter starts to run after edmund but mr
beaver grabs him by the sleeve of his coat get off me
we just cant let him go
dont you get it
hes the bait
she wants all of ya in there
to kill ya
this is all your fault
none of this would have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place
so you knew this would happen
i didnt know what would happen
stop this fighting isnt going to help edmund shes right
only aslan can save him now
then take us to him
edmund is walking through the courtyard and sees giant rumblebuffin
he walks further in and sees a stone lion he draws glasses and a moustache on it edmund continues through the courtyard he steps over what he thinks is a
log of some sort
only to be lurched on by maugrim
stand still stranger
im a son of adam i met the queen in the woods
maugrim gets off him
my apologies fortunate favourite of the queen or perhaps not so fortunate
walks into the throne room wait here edmund sees the glorious throne and sits on it longingly
then the witch comes up behind him and says scaring him half to death
you like it
he jumps up startled ye
yes your majesty
i thought you might tell me you sisters are they deaf
no and your brother unintelligent
well i think so but mom says
then how dare you come alone
edmund i ask so little of you they just dont listen to me
couldnt even do that
i did bring them half way
there at the dam at the house of the beavers
i guess your not a total lost then
edmund approaches again
is there any chance i may have some more turkish delight now
ginnabrick our guest is hungry this way
for your num nums
you know what to do
maugrim lets out a howl edmund realizes the horrible truth as wolves surround the castle
they charge from the castle take them hurry mum they are after us
what is she doing
dont worry youll thank you me later
its a long journey and a beaver gets cranky when hes hungry
do you think we should bring jam
only if the witch has toast
this should lead to aslans i thought it lead to your mums
lucy falls howling
theyre in the tunnel
run further comes to dead end you should have brought a map
there was no room next to the jam
he jumps out of the hole
everyone else follow
once peter gets out lucy falls on a bunch of stone things
lucy gets up
they all see stone animals
he was my best mate
cries what happened to them
this is what happens to the enemies of the white witch
stand still there traitor
relax im one of the good guys well you look mighty like one of the bad guys
an unfortunate family resemblance but we can discuss family breeding later right now we need to move
what do you suggest
the fox stays on lower ground the beavers the children are in a tree
the wolves approach wolves break through barrier as fox is out in centre evening gents did we lose something
dont patronized me i know where your allegiance lies
we are looking for some humans humans in narnia now thats some valuable information where are they
lucy cries out peter shushes her the fox looks around hopelessly and then hangs his head in shame they they were heading north
quickly smell them out
they cast aside the fox where he lays whimpering on the ground mrs
beaver is patching up the fox as the children listen to his tale are you all right
well i wish i could say their bark was worse than their bite
he winces in pain and continues to talk stop squirming
youre worse than beaver on bath day worst day of the year well i am afraid that is all the healing i have time for
it has been a pleasure my queen
i have been asked by aslan himself to gather more troops
youve seen aslan
what is he like
like everything we have ever heard
hell be a good help fighting the white witch we are not planning fighting any witch surely king peter
we just want to get our brother back
edmund in chains at the witches palace
he attempts to eat the food he is given but coughs and spits it out because of its taste
he then attempts to drink a cup which is frozen
he then throws it on the tray

from the other prison edmund gives him the food
your lucy pevensies brother

edmund rubs his nose

turns to dwarf and guard take him tumnus upstairs and ready my sleigh edmund misses his family
now aslans camp is just over there by the stone table just across the frozen river
its been frozen for years it seems so far its the world dear did you expect it to be small
they continue their journey
dwarf brings edmund up and he sees tumnus turned to stone whenever you are ready son of adam

i hope youve been good because there is someone here to see you
father christmas stands there

thanks to you
i thought there was no christmas in narnia
it hasnt been for a hundred years
but now the witchs power is crumbling
he goes to his bag and throws it to the ground presents
lucy eves daughter
these are for you
the juice of the fire flower
if you or one of your friends are wounded one drop of this cordial will restore them
and though i do not expect you to use it this
well i think i could be brave enough

but battles are ugly affairs
eves daughter susan

what happened to battles are ugly affairs
and though you dont seem to have trouble making yourself heard this
when you put this horn to your lips and blow it wherever you are help will come
these are tools not toys
the time to use them may be soon at hand
bare them well

look just because some man in a red suit hands you a sword doesnt make you a hero
so just drop it
narnia need ya
whats it gonna be son of adam

and neither is the river
hold onto me
stabs sword into the ice and they float away
they get to shore
peter has lucys coat in hand but no lucy
what have you done
has anyone seen my coat
your brother has you well looked after
everyone laughs and embraces
i dont think youll be needing those coats any more
walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding as they leave there coats and head toward aslans camp its so warm here
cold look from witch i think ill go check the sleigh
we found the traitor carrying the fox he was gathering troops near the sharwood forest
nice of you to drop by
i understand you were so helpful to my wolves last night
forgive me your majesty dont waste my time with flattery
not to seem rude but i wasnt actually talking to you looks at edmund looks first to edmund and than at fox where is aslan
about to hit him with wand wait
the beavers said something about the stone table and an army
thank you edmund
it is good for this creature to see some honesty before he dies
fox to stone and white slaps edmund across face think whos side you are on
turns his head or theirs
if it is a war aslan wants turns butterfly to stone its a war he shall get
why are they all staring at us
maybe they think you look funny
oh stop your fussing mrs
you look lovely
peter pulls out sword
to oreius we have come to see aslan
tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels
aslan comes from the tent and the children kneel welcome peter adams son welcome susan and lucy daughters of eve
you have my thanks but where is the fourth
thats why we are here
we had a little trouble along the way
hes been captured by the white witch captured
he betrayed them your excellence
then he has betrayed us all peace oreius
it is my fault really
i was too hard on him
we all were
sir hes our brother
i know dear and that makes the betrayal all the worse
it may be harder than you think that is cair paravel of the four thrones one of which you must sit as high king
you doubt the prophecy no thats just it
youre not who i think i am peter pevensie formerly of finnchley
beaver also said you wanted to turn him into a hat
light laughes peter there is a deep magic that rules over narnia
it defines right from wrong and helps us fulfill destinies both yours and mine
i dont think i will be able
you were able to get your family here
not all of them
i will do what i can for edmund
i too want my family safe
mother hasnt had a dress like this since before the war maybe we had bring back a whole trunk load when we go home
if we go home
sorry i guess i am like that
remember when we use to have fun
yes before you go boring
oh really splashes water and this continues as susan goes to get towel and
now were very tired
wed prefer to kill you quickly
throws towel peter and aslan susans horn is blown peter runs to her direction aslan follows him susan and lucy susan and lucy are in a tree and wolf trying
to get them
peter come back through the river aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group stay back
this is peters battle
the wolf attacks him
and everyone thinks he is dead peter
they run up to him and see he is alive and looks disgusted by killing the wolf
aslan lets go the other wolf follow him
hell lead you to edmund
peter clean your sword
rise sir peter wolfsbane knight of narnia
peter looks at aslan in awe all embrace him and are excited about this edmund is tied to tree as the dwarf taunts him the minotaurs on the left send
in the dwarfs first
white witch looks at the plans and then
aslans army comes in and there is confusion
white witch goes through camp and see dwarf to tree knife in hat and him tied and gagged
she takes the knife and looks like shes going to kill him then cuts him down youre not going to kill him
we have work to do turning to otmin aslan and edmund are on the rock above camp peter comes out and see him and then the girls peter stops her
aslan motions edmund down and they go to the group of his siblings whats done is done
there is no reason to bring up the past with your brother
oh edmund hugs him and susan does too how are you feeling
im feeling kinda tired get some rest
and edmund try not to wander off again
some time later breakfast narnia isnt going to run out of toast edmund then you better pack some for the journey so were going home
you are i promised id keep you three safe but theres no reason i cant stay and help
but they need us
all four of us lucy its too dangerous
you almost drowned edmund was almost killed
which is why we have to stay
they all look at him
ive seen what the white witch can do and ive helped her do it and we cant leave these people behind to suffer for it
lucy holds eds hand
well i guess thats it then
gets up where are you going
picks up bow and quiver to get in some practice
susan and lucy practice shooting at the target
then it cuts to peter and edmund practicing sword fighting come on ed sword hand up like oreius showed us
the beavers come running up
edmunds horse rears whoa horsey
my name is philip
oh sorry you better come quick the white witch has requested a meeting with aslan
jadis arrives at the camp cyclops carry her bed thingy
she hops down and walks towards aslan you have a traitor in your midst aslan
his offence was not against you
have you forgotten the deep magic
do not cite the deep magic to me witch
i was there when it was made
then you will know that the boy belongs to me
turns to crowd that boy points to edmund will die on the stone table
come and take it then
you think that a simple threat will deny me my right little king
aslan knows that if i do not have blood as the law demands all of narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water
enough i shall talk with you alone
time passes and the witch exits tent the witch has denounced her claim on edmund narnians cheer
how will i know your promise will be kept
the white witch falls into her seat and the narnians laugh
the white witch leaves
aslan sighs and walks into his tent
lucy is quietly resting when she sees a shadow
she wakes susan susan
susan sees the shadow the two leave their tent
aslan is leaving the camp
they follow him
and follow him
and follow him
until arent you suppose to be in bed
we couldnt sleep please aslan
couldnt we come with you
i would be glad of the company tonight
walk further it is time
from now on i must go on alone
thank you susan
thank you lucy
later after lots of jeers towards aslan as he walks to the stone table why doesnt he fight back
first let him be shaved
more jeers and catcalls
tonight the deep magic will be appeased but tomorrow we will take narnia forever
you know aslan im a little disappointed in you
did you really think that by giving your life you would save the human boy
you are giving up your life and saving no one
so much for love
in that knowledge
and she plunges in the knife and aslans growls in pain and his eyes slowly close the great cat is dead
her army cheers loudly
general gather your army and prepare for battle
however short it may be
otmin lets out a huge roar the girls come up and cry and lean on aslan
lucy gets an idea unscrews her potion its too late
im sure he knew what he was doing
we have to go
we cant just leave him here
lucy theres not time
we have to tell the others
the trees back at aslans camp in the boys tent fear not my princes
i come with tidings of grave news
peter walks out of the tent
it is true hes gone then youll have to lead us
theres a whole army out there waiting to follow you
i cant aslan believed you could
and so do what are your orders
peter looks at map
you see the battle field they come you highness in numbers and weapons far greater then our own
numbers do not win a battle no but i bet they help arrival of the witchs army i take no interest in prisoners
kill them all army charges gryphons attack look to the sky are you with me
to the death
back to the girls at the stone table lucy and susan wake up
we should go
im so cold
they start walking away
stone table cracks susan
what have they done
aslan appears sending shivers down everyones spine
we saw the witch the knife
if the witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice she might have interpreted the deep magic a little differently
for she would know that if a willing victim who had committed no treachery died in a traitors stead the stone table would crack and death itself would begin to
we sent the word that you were dead
peter and edmund would have gone to war
draws knife we have to help them
we will but not alone
now climb on my back
we have a long ways to go and little time to get there
