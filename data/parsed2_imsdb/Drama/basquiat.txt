we hear waltzing matilde by tom waits
fade out music
a well dressed black boy and his mother walk through several galleries
they stand before picassos guernica holding hands
the mother is disturbed
the boy looks up confused and frightened concerned to see his mother crying in public
she looks at him tenderly
her brow furrows
she stops crying
she stares just above his eyes
somethings happening she looks with wonder at the top of his head
his eyes roll upward trying to see its a crown
he raises his hands
he touches it
a beam of light illuminates the crown casting its glow on his mothers face
the beam gets whiter the rest of the screen gets black
in darkness we hear a voice imbued with a sense of its own history everybody wants to get on the van gogh boat
theres no trip so horrible that someone wont take it
the idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one
we must credit the life of vincent van gogh for really sending this myth into orbit
how many pictures did he sell
he couldnt give them away
we are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for van goghs neglect
no one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another van gogh
the beam of light shines through a small hole
it falls upon a sleeping dreaming delighted face
it belongs to jean michel outdoor daytime sounds filter in
hearing the voice jean frowns at being woken up
a long rectangular cardboard box
rene ricard early s seated at a park bench hunched over a notebook
hes a raggedy dandy a poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops
as he writes he reads aloud as if addressing posterity
sighing theatrically in this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor
ones public appearance is absolute
beyond him a hand gropes its way out of the box
it tosses a can of yoohoo chocolate drink
i consider myself a metaphor of the public
i am a public eye
i am a witness
a head appears from the box
jean sees the start of a crisp colorful autumn day
the urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life
he eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night
theres something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests hes almost surprised at his own body the adultness of his limbs just a subtle hint of
him coming out of a dream
he squints in the sunlight
he has a soft gentle haitian face
his hair is pulled tight to his head
he wears two pairs of blue jeans one cut like chaps over the other a paint covered wesleyan university t shirt and the inside lining of an overcoat
his appearance is unruly but its deliberate
he shakes himself off and collects his stuff which includes a small book of pontormo drawings a can of black spray paint
and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape
jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky jean sees the surfer riding the nose in glistening shimmering sunlight
rene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out loud as he writes
part of the artists job is to get the work where i will see it
as he speaks we see jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor
he spraypaints samo as an alternative to god when you first see a new picture you dont want to miss the boat
you have to be very careful because you may be staring at van goghs ear
jean signs his words with his logo a triple pointed crown
as he presses the spray can we hear the roar of a breaker
pressed into the concrete is a pair of eyeglasses
a light colored piece of rock completes the picture to make a face
jeans pov his shoes pause next to the face in the concrete
is a metal billboard with red plastic magnetized letters that reads todays special clam chowder
it now reads samos day old teeth
bending over a countertop we see gina cardinale
he fixates on her
she looks up and notices his stare
she continues to work
still staring at her he sits down at a table
he pours maple syrup onto the table
he draws in the syrup with his fingers
another waitress arrives at his table
shes put off by the syrup
whatll it be
jean thinks about it eyes still following gina
itll be great
well live together in peace
whats her name
indicates gina he looks up at the waitress
whatll it be
she leaves and whispers something to gina
gina turns and glances over at jean
jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name
at the grill leshko the burly owner cook has his watchful eye on jean
he doesnt like what he sees
jean smears the syrup thinly so it doesnt erase itself
he draws a picture of gina using his fingers and the silverware rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines
a gaunt young man saunters up to jeans table
hes sort of a tall puerto rican alain delon with sleepy eyes
he is benny
hey willie mays
suddenly rene ricard enters a one man parade
he beckons to gina snapping his fingers
we dont serve that amigo
a greasy cheeseburger
fries and a vodka
under his breath whos that
the devil man
art critic writes for artforum
people read him
tell him who you are
who am i
rene lands at the counter
jeans gaze is still on gina
she waits on a man at a nearby table
hows the special today
its your stomach
she hurries past jean
she slows down not wanting to
what do you think
she looks at her portrait in the syrup
she cant resist smiling
ive never been done in maple syrup
heres a rag
she offers him one
as she holds it out their eyes lock
she tries to resist his smile
she puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off
benny takes it all in
leshko is upon them
look at you staring at this girl making a mess
he waves jean toward the door
jean takes ginas rag and begins cleaning his mess seemingly compliant
how about those pancakes
he brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open
dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts
the manager explodes
pipe down lech
let him order
let him order
you on his side
youre not such a good waitress
you get out too
i just dont think youre being fair
i need this
i need this
gina quietly removes her apron in disbelief
benny gets up to leave very casually
waving gbye to jean willie mays
to gina thats right
you go with them
make babies the government has to pay for
leave the restaurant
behind them we see rene absorbed in his writing
they stand outside not knowing quite what comes next
jean gives benny a look i
catch you later
a chilly wind picks up
jeans mood is suddenly downcast
they button up their overcoats about to leave
whats a job anyway
pause whats wrong with you
the truth is he feels awful for causing ginas trouble but shows it by moping like a child
no dont tell me you just got fired by your crazy boss
i guess you did
guess i just got sick of him
can i walk you home
i think i could do that alone
gina walks away
he runs after her
wait im in a band
were at the mudd club on halloween
ill put you on the list
gina turns and looks back at jean
i hate the mudd club
he catches up to her
gina notices a dead leaf in his hair and picks it out
have you been camping
you could use a scrub
i always smell good
i dont know why i just do
he leans forward offering his neck
smelling you do
you definitely do
just come to the mudd club on friday
i dont go there
too many party girls
can i call you
teasing him yeah if you have any dimes left
he writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic marker
here this is for you
i made this
he hands her the small speaker
she takes it
she admires the speaker watches him walk off
we see jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital
patients fill a cavernous day room engaged in arts and crafts
some of the sadder patients stare off into space as jean crosses the room
he carries a plate of cookies and a full glass of milk
he approaches a sad nice looking middle aged black woman the same one from the dream earlier
she sits alone fondling a pillow in her lap
its his mother matilde
she doesnt see him coming
as he sets the plate in front of her she notices him
she recognizes him and seems pleased even in her isolation
he kisses her on the cheek
she smiles slightly
jean takes a cookie
she does likewise
they eat in silence looking at each other communicating what they can
in between cookies her fingers find and break the stems of the pillow feathers
i met the girl im gonna marry
his mother brightens
she drinks the milk
they finish the cookies
do you like it here
id like it better in hawaii
jean tries to sleep in the box
rain falls heavily onto it
drops of water hit his face
he wills it to stop
finally he cant stand it
rain forces his blinking eyes open
a door opens to reveal jeans wet face
benny lets him in
jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments beer cans and homemade art
theres a couch with a sheet over it
junk is piled in a corner mostly art books and drawings
benny sits down at an electric piano which hes evidently playing
he sings along softly working out the words concentrating absorbed
jean sets his belongings on the couch walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words
she loves me
oh yeah she loves me
she loooooooves me oh yeah she loves me
bring me some chicken baby
would you shut the fuck up
you hear what im doing
youre always great benny
goes back into act her name is g i n a gina and she lo oooves me
i did say chicken
benny turns off the piano and lights a roach angry at jeans self centeredness
jean digs through a pile of garbage
finally he finds what hes looking for a pile of samo baseball cards color xeroxes of his favorite images and words
he pockets them
i knew i left these somewhere
one of thesell send your kids to college someday
hands it to benny solemnly here i made this for you
beat your dad called again something about a job
he hands jean a slip of paper
he notices the number on jeans pants
you got a date already
exhaling were getting married
she said she could tell i was a great artist she could see it in my eyes
she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter racial babies with me
he grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his index finger
see you in court tomorrow
jean turns on the tv
he notices the roach
he picks up the paper benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire
he lights the roach with it
he looks up on television we see a bum being interviewed
jean turns up the volume
the bums on the ground looking beat up
jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on the guy just hit me and i was on the ground
boom for real
jean mutes the sound on the tv
he rewinds and proudly plays back the words boom for real
he picks up the phone and dials
he turns on the speakerphone
jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone
jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following
deadpan i is this the s s suicide h h hotline
my name is chris
thats a beautiful name
im going to kill myself
im taking pills
reds blues greens
jean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly random words
he comes to the words in order liquid hijack and marlboros
wait a minute
talk to me
about to sob life doesnt
this citys k killing me
i want my liquid hijack marlboros
depression isnt permanent
dont you believe that
pause what is it did your girlfriend leave you
i have a boyfriend
he loves me
jean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in
you have someone to live for
no i dont
we all are
the worlds unjust
the respect fools get
the disrespect i get
what is it you want
i have respect for you just for making this call
one philosopher said sadness is a sin against the richness of the world
think about it
you dont even know me
i want real respect
he jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the receiver right next to it giving the guy an earful close up a speaker
it fills the screen
we continue to hear beat what
what do you want
breaking loose fame
my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it
jean and benny are on stage with two other guys members of the band gray
everyone but jean is dressed in some sort of halloween costume
we hear the words boom for real blasting from the p
what follows is a continuation a collage of words from jeans suicide hotline call one philosopher said give me my liquid hijack marlboros
you have someone to live for
what do you want
thats a beautiful name
jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members
benny plays the organ
the other band members play percussion and guitar
the crowd loves it
the song ends abruptly
we begin to hear james browns sex machine
jean looks out into the crowd and notices gina
shes looking right back at him from the bar
pleased to see her face he says to himself boom for real
we see him walk offstage into the crowd
i thought you hated this place
beat i just said that
i was never here before
i actually like it
music segues into pils public image
lets get out of here
he leads her towards the exit
they step out of the club
its raining heavily
jean motions for gina to wait under the entrance
he tries to hail a cab
a parade of them passes but each time they slow down they get a glimpse of jean and drive off
finally gina steps out of the entrance
she raises her hand and a car pulls over instantly
they scurry into the backseat
the cab pulls off
through a steamy rain wet window we see jean and gina seated at a table dining
they seem to be having a nice time
gina lays in bed
daylight streams into the apartment
jackhammers rattle outside
music reggae song errol scorchers cockroach in de corner
a cockroach crawls from ginas bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where jean sits naked on the floor working on a drawing
it crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box
jean rummages through a cabinet
he finds a can of bugspray
jean tears off a side of the box
with cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other he forgets the cockroach
hes mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can
someone pounds furiously at the door
ignoring the pounding he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list
open up for me please
he gets up and peeks through the security hole
he sees a middle aged hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door
he opens it
ohhh dios mio
she stares at him levelly
i just want the rent
why didnt you say so
jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him
he hands it to the landlady
its a a little shack with a big head next to it that says here for rent
the landlady looks at him like hes crazy
she balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket
gina arrives in the doorway wearing a robe
the landladys trapped between them
to jean whatre you doing
the landlady wags her finger at gina
gina and jean look amused as they watch her leave
wanna go get some breakfast
a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery
hes an electrician
i was supposed to be there an hour ago
she looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor
ohh thats nice
jean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing
we hold on the drawing
white dust sprinkles down onto jeans face from the ceiling
unable to use his hands he tries to blow the dust out of his eyes
his boss greg a mild mannered hippie electrician works above him on the ladder
jean steadies the ladder
gregs head is out of frame
the gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an opening
jean could you get me a phillips screwdriver
a phillips head
from the toolbox
jean searches through the toolbox
he picks up a screwdriver and reads the handle craftsman phillips head right
jean shakes his head and puts it back
he tries a couple more they each say craftsman
he puts them back
finally he finds one with a different handle
it says g
you dont have any
ive got like five of em
he comes down off the ladder
youre holding one in your hand
beat youve never done this kind of work before have you
demonstrating see this is a regular screwdriver and this is a phillips head
the cross thing
ill tell you later what all the tools are so youll know
a group of people arrives
albert milo comes into view tailed closely by rene ricard and mary boone well dressed petite intense
milo also about wears casual clothes splattered with paint
mary boone is engaged in conversation with milo
rene chatters away
greg climbs back up the ladder
he holds a piece of wire down to jean
jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible
i need to make a call mary
you dont mind do you
you can use my line
rene picks up the phone
bernard picasso to mary you know bernard wincing be my guest
jean watches the group talking
hold this please
beat he sees why jeans so distracted youll get there
but its good to have something to fall back on
thats why i became an electrician
it pays the rent
yknow im an artist too
i didnt know
im really just starting to find myself
how old are you
youre just like i used to be
im forty one
and im glad i havent gotten any recognition
it gave me time to develop
jean watches mary and milo talking
to milo i cant tell you how happy i am with this show
mary yells across the room to jean
her tone impersonal excuse me you whats your name
would you move those tools there and put them somewhere else
he looks at her
milo watches to see what hes going to do
to milo my name is jean michel basquiat
have you heard of me
should i have
im a painter too
excuse me would you please move those tools
jean looks at milo
milo looks back at him
jean walks past the tools and continues toward the door
he walks out without turning around
milo smiles to himself
the art world crowd fills the gallery
jean lurks across the street watching through the window
cabs and limousines line the block
a crowd outside blocks the street
jeans obviously impressed jealous and estranged he feels entitled to all this
he crosses the street to get a closer look
he sees albert milo talking with andy warhol and bruno bischofberger
andy of course is thin silver haired and nearly albino
bruno is a swiss art dealer in his s
he exudes money a pillar of security
on the other side of the room rene ricard is surrounded by a coterie of young mostly black and hispanic males
rene looks drunk enjoying the moment holding court
rene crosses to albert and andy
people pass by
jean starts to walk
about half a block away he sprays on a wall he looks pleased
he turns and looks up west broadway beyond the buildings at the sky we see a surfer emerging from a huge wave
he looks powerful and exalted
angle on a wall
we see the following graffity a basketball bounces against a wall
jean and benny amble onto a basketball court
jeans changed his hairstyle
now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head
benny dribbles with skill while jean puffs furiously on a cigarette
he doesnt look like hes slept but hes happy
benny throws the ball to jean
it bounces off a puddle and splashes jean
come on jean
get rid of your cigarette
beat fuck i didnt think we were actually gonna do this
concentrate on the ball
it flies up up up and over the backboard
he runs after the ball gets it and dribbles clumsily
youre shattering all my myths
oh you mean black people
he shoots and misses again
he throws it to benny who does a picture perfect lay up
changing the subject how long do you think it takes to get really famous
during the following benny performs a series of amazing shots while jean looks on admiringly
for a musician or a painter
to where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else
six to get rich
first you have to dress right
he shoots again
then you have to hang out all the time with famous people the right people the right chicks the right parties
he shoots again
and you gotta do your work all the time when youre not doing that
the same kinda work the same style over and over again so people recognize it and dont get confused
then once youre famous you have to keep doing it the same way even after its boring unless you want people to really get mad at you which they will
benny tosses jean the ball
jean walks off the court
i hate this
im no good at it
jean shoots the ball and keeps walking
the ball goes in
he doesnt notice
benny runs after it
benny and jean walk along
famous people are usually pretty stupid
youre too smart
youd get bored to death
you dont wanna be like john henry fighting the machine
just do what you do
its about integrity
follow your heart
whos john henry
folklore guy worked on the railroad
yknow pounding in spikes and laying down track
then one day they invented a machine to do it
and he says fuck that im a man and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track
it takes two days
neck and neck the whole time
they get right to the end and he beats it by one spike
pause got a cigarette
so then what
he drops dead
just do your shit like you do it
your friends like you you get laid everyone walks by sees your stuff everywhere
what else do you want
they watch a long stretch limo cruises up across the street
like i said my liquid hijack marlboros
indicates limo check it out
the limo driver opens the back door
andy warhol and bruno bischofberger step out
hes famous and hes not boring
jean scrounges in his pockets pulls out his xerox cards and readies himself as bruno and andy enter ballatos restaurant
whatre you doing
youre doing something
hes the best painter in the world
im gonna give him one of these
dont give him anything man
your arts worth a lot
thats what real artists do with each other
besides hell just use you
hes famous for that
benny watches jean crosses the street
jean passes the limousine
inside the driver a year old rasta takes a hit from a joint and watches jean
the drivers eyes
he watches jean cross the street
jean enters the restaurant
andy and bruno spot him
the maitred becomes alarmed
but its too late hes at their table
he spreads his cards on the table
the topmost card reads andy stares dead ahead sphinxlike
bruno watches the non interaction between the two
to jean flustered can i help you
he taps jeans shoulder
to jean sir
sympathetically i think its ok
of course mr
bruno picks up one of the cards
you wanna buy some ignorant art
like stupid ridiculous crummy art

to bruno can i borrow some money bruno
bruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill

as waiter arrives with the tray jean pockets the bill

he leaves all the cards and walks toward the door
jean leaving past stupified maitred
jean and benny are outside the entrance to ginas building
jean carries two huge bags overflowing with groceries and flowers
theres no answer
ill be right back
he produces a key and lets himself in
he enters the building
jean sets the groceries on the counter and leaves
we notice the bugspray painting on the wall along with more of jeans work and supplies
jean rejoins benny in front of ginas building
as theyre leaving gina comes up the street
to benny check you later man
flowers and groceries are strewn on the counter
over the following montage we hear apt
the church bells would ring at noon and six a
strokes how many times we counted them
we called our bed the cloud
and there wed float
the bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up
wed bathe together afterwards
oh the countless cigarettes and take out chinese food
the bed was so narrow three years we made it fit
the sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past
little home farewell the broken windows and the bodega on the corner
now from my balcony i look out over all new york
jean and gina are sleeping
series of dissolves as theyre turning together in their sleep
filled with jeans paintings
series of dissolves paintings and objects fill the room
jean watches the little rascals on tv in the living room
the sound is turned off and a record player plays gypsy music loudly
rolled up in a large drop cloth gina is asleep on the floor
next to her jean works on all fours drawing figures crowns and houses
working feverishly he writes hey hey hey in big clusters then writes other words shark immortality john the revelator fame ink teeth hawaii supermarket pole star baboon and tar
he has an acoustics manual and bible open on the floor
he copies the technical blueprints from the manual
he reads the bible following the text with a dirty finger
it seems that he watches tv draws listens to the music and reads at the same time
he mixes liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings
he draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor
up the wall
through the fridge
across the window
he takes off his paint covered clothes and changes into ginas black slip
he rummages around the room gathering pieces of his and ginas clothes
he spreads the clothes on the floor and selecting wide brushes with long bristles picks up the cans of liquitex paint
when paint spills on the clothes he spreads it into shapes
gina wakes up
she reaches for one of the painted shirts
in disbelief basquiat those are my best clothes
what are you doing
cmon baby i painted them for you
theyre beautiful now
im going to my parents this weekend
what am i going to wear
she begins to cry how could you do that to me
jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around gina holding her
ill buy you some new ones
you dont have any fucking money
jean lets her cry for a moment then notices the music playing on the stereo a gypsy song sung in spanish
do you know what hes saying
what whos saying
translating song if one day i die and you read this piece of paper i want you to know how much i love you
although ill never see you again gypsy gypsy your hair your hair your face your face gina looks up at him
even though you were never mine and you never will be you have a piece of my heart you have you have you have
he reaches down wiping off ginas face gypsy gypsy your hair your hair your face your face
no longer crying gina leans her head against jean
we hear a call from the window willie mays
at the window come on in
benny and two guys come barreling into the apartment
benny holds up a packet of drugs and jiggles it temptingly
they make themselves at home
jean sits with them and starts to chop up the drugs
gina gives jean a look
she stands still wrapped in the drop cloth
she lets it fall to the floor
shes wearing only her underwear
she walks to the bedroom
benny watches her
gina dont you want any of this
you could use some
gina doesnt respond
she comes out of the bedroom with a small suitcase
see you later
they start to laugh
kneeling on the floor jean covers the surface of the refrigerator door with fast rushing strokes
he mixes paint in a large soupbowl and dips his hair in the bowl
pressing his head to the door he paints with his hair
he stops to examine the marks
he hits his head against the door harder and harder
camera pulls back revealing jeans eyes
theyre open and motionless
his head is tilted toward his chest
off screen we hear the sounds of gina coming home the lock turns
the door opens
gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor
she picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room
theres a lump on the floor
she shakes his arm
she lifts his head revealing his painted hair
she shakes him harder
his body is totally limp
the whites of his eyes are red his pupils slowly float up vanishing
jean what did you do to yourself
she listens to his breath then to his heart
panicking jesus christ
she finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him
slapping his face dont do this to me
she shakes him until his eyes unglue
his pupils float into their proper place
whats the matter
furious oh god basquiat you scared the shit out of me
how the fuck could you do that to yourself
its monday morning
its not sunday
i missed you
you shouldnt leave me alone
youre blaming me
i had to go see my family
im your family
basquiat what did you take
jean tries to pick himself up from the floor
he gets up stiffly like pinnocchio
the long sleep made his limbs wooden
nothing special just some weed
he finds an old joint and lights it up
basquiat dont lie
holds up powder this is smack
you want some
he offers her the joint
jean and benny walk along sharing a beer in a brown paper bag
they approach a drug dealer and exchange money for dope
jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him
they sit down on a stoop
jean rolls up a dollar bill empties the dope onto the window and splits it into two lines
he hands the rolled up bill to benny who snorts the line
benny shakes his head involuntarily making a violent face as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus
we got beat
jean takes a taste with his finger
he tastes his tongue and makes a face
he snorts part of his line anyway to make sure
they continue onwards
jean still carries the window
you gonna carry that around all night
ill paint on it
the partys winding down hip hop kids lower east side types
jean and benny pass through the room ignoring the two or three clusters of people maybe fifteen in all
jean encounters a familiar face an enormous red haired dealer rockets
they greet each other as friends
rockets leads jean aside
they stand near a wall where a painting hangs flats fixed
it bears jeans three point crown
you did that didnt you
i gave it to maripol
she let me stay here for awhile
jean hands him twenty dollars
rockets hands him two dime bags
as if thinking better he hands the bill back to jean
do one for me and its free
jean re pockets his money
he gestures to rockets as if to say fine its a deal
he and benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the window as before
this time its good
they lean back into it slumping down into the couch
nearby rene sits on a couch with three street kids artists who weve seen at milos opening
they sit on their knees looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth
artist looks through the window with a pair of binoculars
he points down towards the street trying to get renes attention
check this out rene
rene lunges towards the window
the stereo blares curtis blows survival singing along the name of the game is survival you learn it in jail upon your arrival
another artist a young black man runs up and tries to turn down the volume
rene grabs his crotch
this isnt even my apartment
oh man you a fine nigga
you know that
cut it out man
and dont be callin me that shit
benny is now alone on the couch
he nods out
noticing him oh my there goes the neighborhood
whos house is this anyway
artist is still mad at rene
to artist thats what i like about you straight boys
youre so sensitive
resumes singing the name of the game is survival survival
only the strong survive rene
come here man
i gotta go pee
rene weaves across the room
suddenly he stops cold
hes staring at jeans painting
he doesnt move
to himself who did this
beat louder who did this
i dont know
i told you this isnt my apartment
i know who did that
thats jean michels
hes right here man
he turns to look for jean
fuck man whered he go
benny looks around ineffectually and shrugs
to himself its fucking amazing
motherfuckers got to put a crown on it
yelling from the window rene man check this out
hes kinda cute
rene looks to him and back at the painting
he takes one last look
he stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from artist
we look through the binoculars pov at a guy coming down the street
hes wearing all black cowboy boots and sunglasses
poor thing has a little dick
how do you know
just look at him
rene hands the binoculars to him little silver thingies on his cowboy boots
honey i dont think so
he looks around the room again as if looking for jean
whoa check it out
rene grabs binoculars
jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces rene watches in awe
jean moving a bit slowly signs his tag with the copyright sign
he walks off
thats the same guy who did this painting
i know that
dont let him get away
he hands the binoculars to artist and runs towards the door
we watch as rene looks frantically for jean but cant spot him
finally he sees jeans hair do bobbing up and down a block away

insert a huge poster reads jean pounds a nail into one of his pieces nailing it directly onto the wall

jean finishes pounding the last piece into the wall
camera pulls back to reveal several of jeans paintings found objects with paint on them

she walks off
thats annina nosei

to jean you slut
how do you know bruno bischofberger
to gina hes only the biggest art dealer in europe
i had lunch with him once
jean and gina lay in bed
which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on
a little upset i hadnt thought about it
in perfect hawaiian oahu lanai niihau kahoolawee staten island would be ok
jean cant sleep
he stares at the ceiling
do you wanna marry me
quietly jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen
he paints on an old window
he draws figures of three people sitting at a table obviously a family
he crosses out one person and paints a dog under the table
he crosses everything out
he mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again
again he crosses everything out
jean continues to work
hes wearing pajamas and a bathrobe
gina enters waking up
she looks at the painting
kind of a family portrait
jean moves to add something
she stops him
it looks done
you mean babies with you
whats wrong with me
youre your own baby
jean paints out the image
theres a knock at the door
who is it
jean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom
gina goes to the door unlocks the chain and looks out
through the crack hello
she opens the door
is jean michel here
closed in the bathroom jean smiles while eavesdropping
im here to see some work
annina starts noticing all the work around her
gina hands her a stack of drawings
these are great
how much for these five
you should talk to him about this
annina contains her excitement
continuing to stare at the work um
do rene and jean have a contract together
we see jean in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror with a birds nest on his head
im interested in showing jeans work
i really think you should talk to him about this
jean pops out of the bathroom
how about right now
she opens the door
unnoticed gina starts for the bedroom
calling back be ready in a minute
as jean exits with annina
jean waits in a taxi in front of bennys apartment
honk the horn again will you please
the driver obliges
the back of the cab is loaded with all his belongings
boxes piled with junk
bags of new painting supplies
benny emerges from his building and jumps into the cab
annoyed youre late
to cabby one fourteen prince
the cab pulls out
jean lights a joint
and smokes it furiously
he doesnt pass it to benny
whats the rush john henry
i aint john henry
whats your fuckin problem anyway
benny holds out his hand for the joint
inhaling i dont really have any problems
what do you have
whats your fuckin problem
you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me
like as in uppity nigger
he snaps his finger for the joint back
thats not how i meant it
beat for all you know you might just be a flash in the pan
you can never tell
hey fuck you
i deserve this shit
youre just jealous cause it aint happening to you
the cab stops for a red light
benny gets out
he doesnt say a word
jean doesnt look at him
the cab sails off
it stops in front of the gallery
from outside we see annina conversing on the phone
she looks up and opens the door for him
off screen we hear jean walking down the stairs
ive got to find the switch
annina flips on a light
here it is
jean looks around him
hes in a large empty cement floored room lit by fluorescent lights
jean bends over beginning several canvases
he pours paint on them kind of like photographs weve seen of jackson pollock
we hear miles davis flamenco sketches
grandmaster flashs white lines fills the room
the walls are covered with half finished unstretched canvases
two or three more lie on the floor
he works like a maniac buzzing back and forth from one painting to another adding figures crossing out words all the while smoking and eating cookies
the crumbs fall onto the paintings
he walks on them
every so often he refers to a book of davinci drawings
torn pages litter the floor beneath the book
we hear someone thumping down the stairs
a puppy follows him
he dumps a huge load of paint supplies art books and carryout ribs
the puppy sniffs around happily licking at jean and walking over the paintings wagging his tail
he stops the tape player and inserts some persian music
jean empties some foil wrapped bags of coke
he cuts a line of coke on a foil plate
rene starts reading from a poem hes evidently written rd night i called him boy he sed dont call me boy well then dont call me boss that was the
end for us and ive been seeing him for years
in kangaroo court i want to be able to say i never kept a slave
but he tricked me in to tying him up and busting his face
hell jump up at my trial yelling he wupped me gud
jean warms the plate til the coke crackles and then chases the dragon sucking the smoke through a straw
he offers it to rene who refuses
he lights and hands rene the joint
rene takes a hit
jean takes it back
jean starts to work again
the puppy runs around chasing after him getting in his way running across the paintings
jean laughs playing tag
the puppy gets a hold of jeans sleeve
it unravels about ten feet
while jeans playing rene spots a painting with the words famous negro athletes
thats one looks famous already
without hearing him jean walks towards the painting and with a swipe paints out what rene is pointing to
you are a willful boy
howm i sposed to write about you if you keep changing everything
the phone rings
jean ignores it
rene gets it uh huhh
to jean its benny
he wants to know why youre not at band practice
to rene i forgot about that
he sets his brush down
rene hold the phone against his leg
fuck band practice
if youre gonna be a painter youre gonna have to break a few hearts you dont wanna be like tony bennett
what do you mean
singing on stage and painting in your spare time
i didnt know tony bennett painted
my point exactly
jean picks up the phone
all he hears is a dial tone
so keep painting
beat if youre so smart why are you here with me in this basement
i want the scoop
i write it down
when i speak no one believes me
but when i write it down people know its true
beat theres never been a black painter in art history thats been considered really important you know
so shut up and keep painting
touched what time is it
jean regards a near finished painting
he writes on it
he crosses it out and re writes it rene
rene looks pleased
that ones for you
ill take it tonight
after the show
jean continues painting
rene slumps down onto the floor happy a parasite content to have a host impressed with jeans limitless energy
rene closes his eyes
jean is bent over his work
he looks to see a pair of legs
they belong to albert milo
hey its the big a
renes been telling me about your work
milo takes his time looking at the paintings
jean continues to work never wanting to appear impressed by anyone
he walks on top of the paintings
is this finished yet
i dont know
whens your show
how was yours
i havent decided yet
beat rene you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow
i wanna make a painting of you
how about now
rene shrugs to jean
he prepares to leave
see you at your opening
albert and rene begin to ascend the stairs
jean continues painting
the dog leaves with rene and albert
ohhh albert milo what a pleasure to meet you
jeans brush stops
this is rene ricard
jean paints over the words rene
we hear footsteps coming down the stairs
the woman continues were tom and cynthia kruger nice to have met you
we see anninas legs coming down the stairs
a man wearing a pin striped suit and gold rimmed glasses
the woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl
tom and cynthia kruger
we see that jean continues to paint looking down
this is jean michel basquiat
beat youve seen the samo graffiti everywhere
this is the true voice of the gutter
as she speaks jean squirms
he grabs a banana from a fruit bowl
without peeling it he takes a big bite
everyone looks uncomfortable
annina starts showing them the paintings
weve seen the graffiti
i work on wall street
and ive heard wonderful things about the paintings
everybodys talking about you
he looks up at them eating the banana
heres a very good example of his recent work thats not spoken for yet
beat hes got to work in a basement
hes got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window hed jump right through it
most of these are reserved already
after this week this work will not be available
to his wife i dont know
this ones nice but i dont know if i could live with it
that green is so
he kruger looks up to see two kids enter young black artists one of whom we saw with rene at the loft party
they walk right into the middle of the room completely oblivious to the presence of annina and the krugers
enthusiastically yo man youre a damn lucky nigger selling this shit
you like it
yeah i do
the krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to jean
im fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way
yes well they are more meaningful in their absence no
to jean joking what does it mean
jean paints the words rene back into a painting
they ignore the kid
i like this one but that green
suddenly we see legs coming down the stairs
everyone looks at her
ywant me to make it a nice shit brown
gina hadnt expected to find herself in the middle of this scene
this is gina
annina nods to her
gina nods to the group
theyre something like dubuffets
gina tries to connect with jean
to her husband and annina i cant make up my mind
i like this one
if it were just another color
get a fucking decorator
if you buy one youll have to change your whole lives maybe even sell your kids
to annina these paintings arent even done yet
he sets his brush down
as he leaves i think well take the green one
gina left standing in the middle of this
close on mcdonalds counterman
ill take three big macs two chocolate shakes two orders of fries and an apple pie
you want three big macs two chocolate shakes two orders of fries and an apple pie
a line begins forming behind jean
ill take six no seven chocolate shakes an order of fries a big mac and two apple pies
you only want one big mac
the people in line are beginning to get impatient
and make it three apple pies
jean leans on a fire hydrant eating a big mac
a pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face
he catches it
a bombshell blonde arrives with her hand outstretched to retrieve it
how can i ever thank you
with a smile id like to squeeze your titties
he offers her a big mac
no id like the scarf
have a mac
i dont eat junk food
i didnt know
ill take you to the best restaurant in town
beat youll miss a great meal and ill keep the scarf anyway
whats your name
youre a fast mover
ill just call you big pink
a man sleeping on the ground with a beehive of paper bags on his head and three overcoats sticks out into the sidewalk
jean leaves the mcdonalds bag near his head as he walks down the street with the girl
jean enters the apartment
a present i picked up for you
gina holds the scarf up and looks at it
as she holds it up he puts it around her neck and kisses her
tenderly you look like an angel
we read the words someone the big red haired dealer we met earlier walks in front of us
camera pulls back to reveal a crowd in a gallery
it is literally filled with people
again all this takes place in silence
we begin to hear peggy lees is that all there is
it colors the motion of the crowd
jean walks down the street
hes got on a new set of clothes and he listens to a walkman
we hear miles davis flamenco sketches
we move down prince st
and take a left on west broadway
we approach a huge crowd
we get closer and closer until we are immersed in it
the crowd realizes jeans amongst them
people start approaching him
someone removes the headphones
the din of the crowd replaces the music
amongst the normal crowd chatter we hear friends calling out jean
annina beckons to him
beyond her he sees albert andy and bruno
hes being escorted or maybe just pushed its hard to tell
each step of the way hes pounced upon by individuals weve never met
the room is wall to wall with people
people are swept along in currents
wildly enthusiastic jean man
lets make a record
slyly intimately you finally did it
pointing to jean sneering hes so fulla shit
how much is he getting for these
jean walks up to andy warhol
andy man thanks for coming
id like to paint your jacket
he polaroids jean your show looks great
quite a turnout
you look great
you drink red wine with fish
you can do anything
make paintings in the basement of your gallery
first time ive heard of that
they are approached by mary boone a short woman in high heels and an armani suit
jean michel this is mary boone
shes got the great new gallery
yeah i met her already
shaking jeans hand you should be pleased
its a great show
im having a dinner later at mr
chows for albert
you should come
in the background we see annina watching
youll like it
everyonell be there
annina walks over to jean with a couple
jean your parents are here
thanks for coming
rene appears out of the crowd
continuing to jeans father you must be very proud
how does it feel to have a genius in the family
jean notices benny across the room
he slows down and waves
jean sees gina across the room wearing the scarf
just beyond her he sees big pink approaching
there must be ten people between them
to rene ill be right back
he moves towards her
suddenly directly in front of him are the krugers
we love our painting
the green one
we got a couch to match
shes only kidding
looking past the krugers jean looks for gina
he sees her
his path is blocked
he presses forward looking for gina getting caught in the crowd
jean strains to keep an eye on gina and big pink
benny arrives at jeans side holding a bottle of jack daniels and a shot glass
jean brushes past him
not now ok
benny is left standing next to andy holding the bottle
jean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd then runs smack into rockets his drug dealer
jean michel my man
should we step into my office
nearby benny sees this meeting and walks off disgusted thinking this is why jean gave him the brush off
im cool now
jean looks off and sees big pink fingering the scarf saying something to gina
gina slaps her in the face
jean tries to get around the dealer
gina turns to leave
she catches jeans eye
she walks out
i was just trying to give you a gift
the dealer palms something to jean
i gotta go
jean steps away from rockets but is trapped in the crowd
rockets looks after him with disappointment
rene arrives with andy bruno and a photographer
edging his way in this guy wants a picture
they shrug and crowd in jean andy and rene
the photographer gets them to squeeze closer and closer
of the painters please
theres not enough room
rene accidentally gets pushed out of frame
albert milo arrives with his parents jack and esther milo
they are a nice jewish couple in their s
he said of the painters
get in the picture
albert crowds in
the photographer snaps a picture and the flash blinds everyone momentarily
hey jean id like you to meet my wife
and my parents
mom dad this is jean michel basquiat
jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette
he offers it to albert who takes a hit
frowning at her son dont do that
beat hello jean
are your parents here
inhaling my dads here with his wife
my mom couldnt make it
he offers the joint to alberts mother
waving it away no thanks
to jean id like to do a show with you
pointing to rene painting im especially interested in that one
id like to buy it for myself
jean spots the very word on the painting rene and freezes for a second
i wasnt gonna sell this one
he looks around the room for rene but doesnt see him
bruno remains smiling waiting for an answer
you shouldnt have put it in the show
this is the one i absolutely have to have
i really love it
jean wants out
he feels compromised
do you think i could borrow your limousine
ill get it back to you in an hour
just have him bring you to dinner at mr
well be there
jean makes his way through the crowd as we see images of the crowd and fragments of paintings
as he nears the door he feels his arm pulled
hissing you fucking little whore
you sold my painting
im gonna tell you something brother when youre climbing up the ladder of success dont kick out the rungs
believe that shit
ill make you another one
he pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing
rene rene shushes him
he hisses loudly like a cat
speaking to himself what is it about art anyway
he turns around and surveys the room once more
we see the crowd in slow motion
everyones eyes are shut
that we give it so much importance
artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using ones sheer self as the medium
the money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual
the camera rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows jean as he makes his way toward the street
we begin to dissolve into a montage of stills of artists the picture a mothers son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even
in the most wretched
and this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip off
but you could never explain to someone who uses gods gift to enslave that you have used gods gift to be free
jean enters a waiting limo
it pulls away from the curb
rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night lit twinkling city
the driver is the young rasta we saw earlier outside ballatos driving bruno and andy
jean slumps in the back seat
the driver cant help staring in the rearview mirror
you did it
you made it
im a painter too
would you check out my studio some time
id be glad to
the limo pulls over
quickly jean gets out of the limo
he leaves the door open
the driver watches as jean talks to two drug dealers
jean jumps back into the limo
the driver pulls away
in the rearview mirror he sees jean separate a bag from a bundle of ten
he rips it open and snorts directly from it
he lays his head back and takes a deep breath
calm relieved whats your name man
they call me steve but i prefer shenge
nice to meet you shenge
want a job
an elegant chinese restaurant on the upper east side
the dining room is split level with a mezzanine reserved for celebrities and special friends of the owner
at the podium the maitred approaches
from behind the maitred on the mezzanine we see bruno waving to jean
in the dining room on the lower level sit annina and rene
nearby at another smaller table are seated david mcdermott and peter mcgough two artists dressed in victorian attire
annina beckons him
rene looks away from him and talks to a waiter
jean waves to annina and continues towards brunos table
seated at a large table are andy bruno albert milo his wife and parents henry geldzahler melina portos a young heiress and francesco and alba clemente and mary boone
dinners already served
at the large table everyone watches as milo makes a portrait of francesco in a beautiful leatherbound book
it belongs to mr
chow who is nearby at the bar
he motions to mr
chow to set a chair for jean between mary boone and himself
jean everyone loved your show
as jean is seated andy and jack milo resume conversation nixon lives in saddle river new york
saddle rivers in new jersey
saddle river new york
its in new jersey
i think its in new jersey
its in new york
oh i didnt know that
close up jean smiles at andys diplomacy
albert finishes drawing his portrait its francesco with his arm around a headless torso
to francesco you finish it
he pushes the book across the table
francesco begins to draw
to jean i hear your show was sold out already
theres a very important collector whos interested in some of your works
bring him over sometime
i have some other stuff to show him
annina watches from the other table as jean talks to mary
francesco finishes his drawing
albert takes the book and passes it to jean
go on take it
jean takes it
chow watches his book change hands
jean takes a bowl of moo shoo pork in front of him and dumps it onto the book
then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head
suddenly theres a shrill familiar voice
id like a glass of your best champagne please
reading this is an enormously important season in new york and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years
we are no longer collecting art were buying individuals
oh shut up rene
everythings over your head andy
beat to jean thanks for not inviting me he leans over everyone and helps himself to some spears of asparagus
esther milo watching
you cant buy advertising like this
this is the most glamorous dinner youll have here this fall
how about some of that imitation crab
im not paying for the drawing with crab
its a present to my friends
its my birthday
jean finishes his drawing a big beautiful head that fills the screen
rene grabs it from him
he holds it up for everyone to see
isnt he great
he rips the page from the book
he owes me one
everyones face drops
chow grabs his book
he motions to a couple waiters youre too much rene
get this guy out of here
i havent eaten yet
the waiters grab renes arms
hands off me you faggots
ive kept diana vreeland waiting too long anyway
that was a nice drawing too jean
maybe you should do another one
exhausted some other time
spontaneously david mcdermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings paris je taime
as he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto he glides over glasses and plates executing a leap to another table in mid song
the restaurant staff and other dinner guests watch agape
as david dances annina walks over to the table greeting people and saying goodnight
to jean its great that people are interested but if anyones going to buy anything ill handle it for you
everything goes through the gallery even if they come to your studio
jean leans back in his chair taking in this splendid new world
he pulls out a joint lights up inhales with pleasure closes his eyes and smiles
had twenty three one man shows been in forty three group shows from zurich to tokyo
note the following scene is shot in documentary style
had over fifty articles written about you switched galleries how many times
djd in the hottest clubs jean looks out the window yawns and rubs his eyes
he now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head
he wears a wrinkled wesleyan college t shirt paint splattered jeans and no shoes just out of bed it would seem
an interviewer a balding brit with all the humor of a bank clerk tries to buddy up with jean on camera
one of the youngest artists ever to be included in the whitney biennial also produced a rap record
its said youre quite the ladies man even dated madonna for a couple months
takes a breath all at the ripe old age of
one might ask is there anything left for jean michel basquiat to do
jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of jeans paintings
jean stares at the interviewer incredulous
what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning
nervous laugh i hate this
turn that off
jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom
shenge the former limo driver now working as jeans assistant assembles stretchers
a camera crew waits in the room
were running a little late
he signals to the crew that hes beginning
to crew ready
he points to some scribbled words on the canvas
decipher this for us
what do they
theyre just words
yes i understand but where do you take them from
do you ask miles where he got that note from
where do you take your words from
pointing to a detail what are they
smiling mischievously leeches
a long list of leeches
looking at some frames shenges working on it looks good like that
beat you seem to be a primal expressionist
you mean like an ape
he grabs a huge double mouthful of french fries and washes them down with champagne
chewing spilling a primate
well you said that
beat looks at notes youve got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci dont you
oh thats a leonardos greatest hits painting
you like it
yes but as a black painter i use a lot of colors not only black
im not black
no im haitian puerto rican
the buzzer sounds
he signals for steve not to answer the door
lets talk about that
your father is from haiti isnt he
growing weary yup
and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home
we dont hang them at home yknow just in the streets
how do you respond to being called hmmm
peruses some notes yes the pickaninny of the art world
smiles hurt stunned who said that
why thats from time magazine
no he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world
he said the eddie murphy
is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution
jean walks off camera like he just received a punch in the stomach
the filming of the interview becomes increasingly erratic
open something up here
you come from a nice middle class respectable home
your father is an accountant
why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in tompkins square
jean walks back into frame
or rather do you think youre being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto
are those the only two possibilities
cramming a french fry into his mouth you wanna french fry
one last thing
is there any anger in you
any anger in your work
should there be
tell me about it
what are you angry about
jean drifts off
i dont know
i dont remember
jean and andy browse through the aisles
jean piles things into his cart
jean approaches the specialty counter
andy continues with the cart
to counterman can i have some caviar please
the counterman selects a miniscule plastic spoon of caviar and begins to put it into a tiny glass jar
id like to taste it first
reluctantly the counterman gives him a taste with a look like whats a person who looks like you doing buying caviar
jean tastes the caviar and hands him back the spoon
is that the best quality you have
yeah its the best one
ill take the whole tin
its three thousand dollars
ill take it
wipes nose with sleeve
andy gimme three thousand dollars
beat just the caviar ill get the rest
he hands two one hundred dollar bills for the other items to the counterman who checks them carefully
you check everyones bills or just mine
a cheap pharmacy gift shop window
jean and andy look in on two yellow furry stuffed ducks which are part of a larger display
when i was little my brother and i used to have two ducks as pets
we called them the rodriguez brothers
they walk into a beauty salon
jean and andy recline on the beauticians armchairs
three beauticians busy themselves with the two of them simultaneously giving them pedicures and manicures
jean sets down a magazine
i wish theyd quit writing this shit about me
at least theyre interested
everybodys paying top dollar for scraps of paper refrigerator doors anything with a samo tag on it
beat the other day i just wanted a pack of cigarettes so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks

they work really well
lets leave this town and go someplace
lets go to the carnegie museum
they have the worlds most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas

jean sees the back of a girl
she looks a lot like gina
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina
do you still love her
i really blew it
i still think about her
well have you asked her to come back
jean shakes his head no sorry that he didnt
a medium sized dining room with dark wood paneling and tastefully appointed furnishings
jean and gina enter
gina looks considerably more conservative than previously more like a student
jeans dressed well but looks even more careworn than usual
his hair is tied back with a necktie
he has a couple sores on his face
his skin looks a little puffy
the maitred smiles at jean and bows mr
basquiat what a pleasure to see you again
hey george whats up
a huge table with nine white executives
waiters clear their lunch settings
as they spot jean and gina entering they gawk and snicker
george leads them to their table
as they take their seats jean notices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives table
they try to ignore it
jean seems self conscious about the sores on his face
so are you really friends with andy
he seems like such a weirdo
hes out of town and he calls me every day
whats weird about him
dont you think hes using you
why does everybody say that
hes the only person i know who doesnt need to use me
would you like to see the wine list
chateau latour please
george disappears again
are you ready
i start columbia next fall
of course theres like a year of pre med stuff but whatever
im really excited
beat and rene gave me a job as his secretary
his poems are getting published
how is he
pretty much the same
jeans eyebrows go up
i hate that asshole
beat thanks for coming
i guess i just wanted to find out how youre referring to an extra loud snicker from execs whats that about
george arrives and pours a sip for jean to taste
george moves off
two or three of the executives break out laughing
jean puts the glass down and looks at them
the other table is clearly making fun of him
that is amazing
what year is it
george hurries over
im sorry mr
see that table over there
id like to pay their bill
gina looks at jean confused
yeah just put their bill on my tab
he moves off towards the executives
george whispers to the head executive and nods towards jean
the executives spread the words amongst themselves
continuing baby i think about you a lot

a young executive obviously the loser takes a deep breath and heads towards them
on behalf of my friends id like to apologize

the executive reaches to shake jeans hand
jean puts a hundred dollar bill in his hand
whats this for
jean turns back to gina
the executive leaves them
you dont have to be sorry
theres no one to blame
jean youre a real artist
i thought i was one
you made me realize i wasnt
whats his name
rather than face a disappointment i have to go to the bathroom
close on jean looking in the mirror
he looks at himself
he starts to pick at his face
jean and albert milo sit on a banquette a huge white painting of jeans with a dragons head hangs on one wall to their left
on the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads mostly black
lots of people mill about a huge room
a girl another gina look alike walks through the crowd
jeans eyes follow her momentarily
re the paintings what do you think
i like the one with the dragons heads a lot
but the black ones filled up with too many heads
beat id take some of them out
beat i think youre painting too fast
i wouldnt put in so many heads
let it breathe a bit
its always how you would do it
this is my version
its your version
you should come over to the studio sometime
why so you could humiliate me
no i wanted to make a painting of you
jean rides his bicycle through the park
hes looking up at the birds flying in the trees
we see the statue in the middle of the park but we have no idea where we are until we see the mays dept
the birds circle in flocks never lighting on the trees
jean presses a buzzer
he carries his bike on his shoulder
jean enters a broad high ceilinged studio
paintings lie on the floor
andys back is turned to him
as jean gets closer he sees that andys assistant frank is peeing on canvas covered with copper pigment
we hear the sound of the piss
frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand
a little more to the right frank
you got a little more
jean notices a bunch of andys wigs on a desk
whats with the wigs
im going to send them to my friends for christmas presents
you think those are good presents
who wants an old wig
jean makes a grimace
he walks up to the painting franks peeing on
i wanted to make a few more of these
franks been drinking this mexican beer
it makes a good green
how come youre not peeing on them yourself
i dont like beer
looking down at the painting if you ever want me to shit on em just ask
you could finger paint
jean and andy collaborate on a large canvas
andy outlines a mobil oil winged horse
jean paints it out
to the side he paints a penguin with a hat
that was my favorite part
we can do better
it needed more white
andy watches as jean lights a joint and continues working on his penguin
jean you make me feel worthless
youre so famous
andy paints an amoco logo next to the penguin
i dont even have any friends anymore besides you
and everyone says warhol
that death warmed over person on drugs
hes just using you
you shouldnt take it so seriously jean
thats why you cant stop taking drugs
you always think people dont like you
everyone likes you
people are only interested in you because youre famous not because they know a fuckin thing about your work
jean paints out part of andys logo
in europe people are saying youre gonna die from drugs
they think they can cash in on your death
when i was poor everybody doubted i could make it
when i got rich everyone said yeah but hell never keep it up
now everyone says hes killing himself
so i clean up and then they say look
his arts dead
i dont take drugs anyway
im healthy now
jean obliterates andys logo
if you say so
you sleep until p
you call at four in the morning
you never show up anywhere on time if you show up
youre painting out everything i do
andy paints back in part of the horse
jean adds some letters on top of andys logo
i cant even see whats good anymore
jean michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white
andy steps back and squints as he examines jeans work
yeah i see what you mean about the white
jean quits painting
after the show we should take a nice long vacation
maybe go to hawaii
thats what im gonna do
im going to give up painting and start playing music again
i wanna sing
that would be a pity because youre a real painter
heres the poster for the show
he presents them with a yellow poster of jean and andy facing each other with boxing gloves
shenge hands andy a box
andy opens the box
inside is a football helmet with jeans dreadlocks glued to the outside
close up andy in mirror wearing helmet
the screen is filled with the cover of the new york times magazine
jean is featured on the cover without his dreadlocks
as shenge opens the door a crowd of people spill out
they pour into the loft
the studio is crowded with people
many of them we recognize from earlier scenes in mudd club jeans opening etc
on the wall there is a portrait of jean by andy
the background is a piss painting
inside jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a bunch of people around him girls mostly
twenty five copies of the times magazine lay stacked on the floor
crouching on one knee jean signs a copy for a brunette
looking up name
a brunette walks up name
andys assistant frank arrives with christine a model
this is really great
what a nice place
jean is taken with christine
have you met christine
i dont think so
hes thrown off his rhythm
would you sign one of those for me
toxic seen with rene at loft party earlier spots jean and steps in
jean this is ramellzee
you know why rammellzees here dont you
im here for an interrogation
youve been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why
all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions
as in ordnance
are your letters armed
what is the prime directive of graffiti culture
do you know black man
jean likes rammellzee enough to be patient
toxic grins and rolls his eyes to jean
jean watches christine as they go on
to ram re jean man i was up on him years ago on the irt
youre selling and ending the culture
not one bit of information
only to get the money and growl with the power man
that aint ignorant thats just stupid
beat to christine can i get you a bowl of gumbo
rammellzee yells after him this interrogation is not over
jean escorts christine to the kitchen
bruno and andy stand in the crowd
nearby are two women
hes just a pressmonger
thats all these people do
you know i love jeans early work
its really got something
but this collaboration with andy maybe they thought it was a joke
i mean whose work is it
jeans or andys
walking by rene responds to this his early work
hes only twenty six
rene walks over to jean
thanks again for not inviting me
im only here on business
rene heads back out into the party
jean eats gumbo while christine thumbs through the times magazine
rene responds to something andys been telling him in a low voice
loudly youre asking me
after the way you treated me
this is the first time ive heard from either of you in months
i had to crash this party
you treated me like a suede biscuit
rene dont play that
i cant get him off drugs
i dont even talk to him any more
to bruno whats a suede biscuit
christinelooks up from her magazine
amused hey whats this
it says right here youre andys
jean walks away
he passes through the crowd making his way to the door
drugged upset jean leaves the party
he opens a limo door and looks back at his house
the party continues
the limo drives off
we hold on jeans building
the limo floats through the streets
jean stares out the window
the limo pulls over
jean disappears around the corner
three kids in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars
we see that theyre removing one of jeans samo pieces from a wall
we read jean arrives behind them
mind your own fuckin business
recognizing his work thats mine
that aint yours man
some asshole named samo did this
thats what i heard
he aint dead yet
hes gonna kill himself
thats why all those art fags in soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in
hardly any of this shit left
the panel is almost pried free without a scratch
this ones damn nice
i say we hang onto it if hes almost dead
jean shoves his way in front with a magic marker and adds a couple words now it reads there you go
now its worth more
the kids are outraged thinking jeans ruined their find
they jump on him
they beat the shit out of him
jean lies curled up on the ground trying to talk
whats he saying
bending close he says hes samo
kid whacks him in the back once more for good measure
it is flat dead gray
ominous and waiting
washed in sunlight a large painting leans against the wall the words haitian baseball factories scrawled through its center
jean lays down watching tv
he looks older now more worn
his face is slightly swollen
his complexion is discolored
shenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint
he circles a large primitive figure of a black man drawn with magic marker in the center
he is careful to leave the figure intact
paint it out
maybe just his arms
shenge paints out the arms put some cerulean blue there
jean points to the lower corner
shenge picks up the phone which has been ringing for some time
its andy again
still not here
in this corner
not looking yeah
shenge changes the brush and dips it in the can
you want me to put it here
use your fucking instinct
shenge shrugs and starts to spread the blue
jean looks at his work
dont try to make art
just paint like a housepainter
a womans shout can be heard through the open window
shenge looks out
its maria portos
what should we do
why dont you try letting her in steve i mean shenge
she wont buy anything if she sees me working on it
if you show too much respect for people with money they dont have respect for you
maria a raven haired sharp featured beauty in a chanel suit jacket blue jeans and pearls walks into the room
shes with ellen younger a millionaire fake hippie from texas
maria carries a bag with clogs in it a present for jean
she takes them out
showing him the clogs these reminded me of you the clogs
i found them in amsterdam
jean doesnt get up from the floor
how are you
you remember ellen
looking around what are you working on
basquiat points at the painting
how much is something like that
jean raises his hand and pumps five fingers three times in the air
ellen makes a snotty face
to shenge how bout some blue in the corner
shenge gives jean a stupefied look
whats wrong with you today
shenge is embarrassed by jeans remark in the company of the two women
dont look at me like that
it hurts my feelings
unsure shenge picks up the brush and paints one of the corners
maria browses through a stack of paintings leaning against the wall
i love these
i just cant even care anymore
compare this to a mountain or a tree
whore yall trying to kid
thats what i think
i was just in the himalayas and like ok is this important
i mean compared to the rain forest or something
these are just narcissistic jokes
to jean who are you selling these through now
jean gets to his feet
he dips a long thin brush into black paint and nonchalantly crosses out the half figure that shenge is carefully surrounding with blue
well thats better
to maria you can buy direct from me
look at these silkscreens
andy warhol junior
its like not even handmade anymore
shes not even worth a response
jean looks around numb
jean enters the gallery
he looks like hes been painting
mary looks up from her desk surprised to see jean
crawling from the wreckage
i need a dealer
you have a bunch of them dont you
albert milo walks in from another room
to mary itll never fit
itll be ok
you better take a look
whys your door so small
the ceilings are sixteen feet and your doors the size of a mouse hole
why are your paintings so big
just go home
ill get it in
to jean you doing anything right now
lets get out of here
see ya in an hour
to mary so what do you think
bruno spoke to me already
we could talk about it
ill be at your studio thursday three oclock
albert shows jean through a series of large rooms filled with enormous paintings
it looks like the cairo museum
they pause before a painting
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan
i painted it after joseph beuys died
a rebirth painting
i felt like he couldve painted it or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me
the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid career so they could start over as someone else
do you ever get sick of it
the whole thing painting
its one of the few times i feel good
i used to have to go to work and cook every day
that i got sick of
what about the shit they write
youre asking me this because of the lapdog remark
i read that
the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly
thats your enemy not your audience
your audience hasnt even been born yet
its a lie that art is popular
the only thing popular about it is that its written about in newspapers
im surprised when anybody comes to my openings
therere about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting and andys one of them
i havent felt like talking to him since that thing came out
as long as ive known andy hes never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs
hes painted my picture weve eaten dinner in god knows how many places together
but he doesnt care about me
he cares about you
youre the only person he cares about
hes your friend
fuck that article
you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese
milos daughter stella calls out from over the balcony
papa the tvs broken
will you fix it please
ill be right up
jean looks at some paintings
stella comes downstairs
to jean hi
ive seen you before
i like your paintings a lot
your hair was different
you like your dads paintings
some of them
he draws her
see you later
thanks he walks to the door leaving the drawing on the floor
he just left
albert opens the door to the stairwell looking for jean
he hears the sound of urinating
he leans over the stairwell
he sees jean michel taking a piss on the landing
he shuts the door quietly
jean walks out of the gift shop seen earlier next to beauticians jean walks through the middle of the intersection
he carries two yellow furry toy ducks under his arm
seeing bruno at the wheel of a black mercedes stopped at a light jean clowns around like a street vendor who wants to wash his window
bruno doesnt notice him
its me jean
whats the matter
no snow in switzerland this year
i didnt see you
what do you mean
you havent heard
the light changes
bruno pulls across the street because of the traffic
jean drops one of the ducks in the street and walks off
the duck lying in the street
the out for ribs sign hangs outside jeans door
mary sits in her limo trying to call jean
the curtains are drawn
music plays birds by neil young its over
jean watches a video tape with the sound muted
the screen fills with andys face
we see a series of quick scenes from his life
jean and the remaining duck are lit by the tv
held in jeans hand
its stalled in mid stroke
he writes with a magic marker on the heel of two wooden clogs the word titanic theres a loud banging at the door
when it stops the pencil tip resumes its long voyage across the page
music up tom waits tom trauberts blues jean buzzes the doorbell
hes wearing the clogs
the intercom comes on
who is it
jean recognizes bennys voice
gina and benny look out the window into the street
jeans a block away
jean gets out of a cab
he walks up to the entrance
the doors are locked
he rattles them
inside an old janitor keeps mopping
jean pounds harder rattles the doors more
hey come here
just for a second
open the door
the janitor gets nervous
he returns a moment later with a large security guard
the guard unlocks the door hoping to settle jean down
my mothers inside
come back tomorrow
visiting hours are over
beat dont cause any trouble
im not here to visit
i wanna take her home
the guard gently ushers jean out through the door
dont cause any trouble
he locks the door and walks off with the janitor
jean walks around drifting stoned
he looks up at the skyline
waves crash silently over a surfer
jean has been passed out on a sidewalk
close on bennys face
he leans over jean and helps him up
nice to see you
benny looks at jeans eyes
jean stretches kicking life back into his limbs
you guys getting along
benny looks at him guiltily
i guess it was a long time ago
come on lets get out of here
jean and benny zoom along in a battered old army jeep
now revived jean stands up waving at people miming general patton
we hear the music of summer of siam
youre gonna fall out
lets get some drugs
like health food
im taking care of my health
a mountain of homeopathic medicine and health food on the counter
benny helps the clerk load it into a box
you starting a hospital
jean approaches and dumps some more stuff onto the counter
hes chewing something
just ring it up
i dont need a bag
to benny try this tabouli its great
tabouli spills onto jeans shirt
jean and benny walk along
bennys arms are full with boxes
jean walks in front eating yogurt
hes wearing his titanic clogs
benny tries to keep up
my mom told me this
or was it a dream
a crude stone jail almost medieval fairy tale like
a thick wooden plank suspended by chains for a bench
a candle on the wall
a small crowned prince the boy seen in the dream in intro
looks longingly out the window at rolling green hills
terraced hillsides cedar trees cottages smoke wafting up from chimneys
the prince smashes the window
he hits his head on the bars gripping them tightly
the villagers cease their activities as they listen to the sound
looking up they smile as if warmed to their souls by some unearthly and intangible substance
they look heavenwards
camera follows their collective gaze skywards
we shoot up up into the sky
there was this little prince with a magic crown
an evil warlock kidnapped him locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice
there was a window made of bars
the prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him
the crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard
you could hear the ringing for miles
it was so beautiful that people wanted to grab the air
they never found the prince
he never got out of the room
but the sound he made filled everything up with beauty
its definitely time to get out of here
we rush down down through the sky
buildings come up at us
were over soho
were back on the ground
benny and jean continue walking
we see jean from behind
hes looking up
benny stops to readjust his parcels
jean continues down the street talking louder
lets go to ireland
well stop in every bar and have a drink
