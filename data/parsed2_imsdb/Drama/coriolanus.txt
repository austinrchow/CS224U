written by william shakespeare screenplay by john logan the blade of a knife
pulled from its sheath intricate tribal etchings on the blade catching the light
the blade being pulled across a sharpening stone
swoosh swoosh swoosh
a well practiced hand
a muscular tattooed arm
the blade held up
the glow of a tv in the darkened room is the only illumination
we see images on the tv global and urban strife slums barricades poverty starvation demonstrations repression refugee camps barbed wire prisons riot police tear gas violence
then the images settle to now breaking news food riots in rome
images of a protest march
a crowd filling the streets
soldiers moving into position
we see placards dogs must eat meat was made for mouths
the man sharpening the knife watches the images
his eyes are cold
then he stops
frozen in mid stroke
something on the tv suddenly rivets him
his eyes no longer cold
the tv shows one of the soldiers a high ranking officer
we will come to know this is a man as caius martius coriolanus
tullus aufidius the man sharpening the knife gazes at the image on the screen
he leans forward
emerging from the darkness
we see his face
he is a handsome and imposing figure magnetic in his personality
charismatic yes but also neurotic and edgy
uncomfortable in his own skin
some demons there
he watches the face of caius martius on the tv screen
then he puts the point of his knife against the screen
against caius martius heart
holds it there presses the point against the screen muscles knotting in his forearm as if he could thrust the knife through the screen and into the heart of caius
his nemesis his dark angel
sharp cut to we move with an intense woman down the street
she is nervous
checks she is not being followed
she is tamora an extreme figure on the political landscape
to the roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist to her supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat
as she moves we take in rome
it might be mexico city
or el salvador
this rome is a modern place
it is our world right now immediately recognizable to us
elements of classical architecture loom over decay
monolithic modernism and brave public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising billboards neon shopping plazas and drab super highways
splendor and squalor sit side by side
it is a volatile dangerous world
william shakespeares rome
she comes to a graffiti covered apartment building
a secret political meeting in a police state
cigarette smoke hangs in the air
men and women gathered hushed and urgent tones
a cell meeting of the political opposition the resistance
a tv shows the food marches elsewhere in the city
the gathering storm
cassius is a leading proletariat organizer
before we proceed any further hear me speak you are all resolved rather to die than to famish
the others agree
they are not wild eyed radicals
they are normal people from all walks of life
you and me
first you know caius martius is chief enemy to the people
a voice from the back of the room let us kill him
the others turn
tamora just entering pulls off her coat joins the others and well have corn at our own price
is it a verdict
some are unsure
she is too extreme for some
we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery our sufferance is a gain to them
let us revenge this with our sticks ere we become rakes
i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
a woman a young mother protests will you proceed especially against caius martius
against him first
a college professor speaks up consider you what services he has done for his country
very well and could be content to give
him good report for it but that he pays himself with being proud
nay but speak not maliciously
she has over played her hand
pretends to back down i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end
a snarky smile he did it to please his mother
some laugh at her gossip
then the tv image switches to a breaking news update from the roman senate
an august press room
a senator is moving to a podium to make a statement
he is senator menenius is a seasoned and wily politician
silver hair perfectly tailored suit
he is known as a folksy man of the people
it is a role he plays to perfection
soft who comes here
worthy senator menenius one that hath always loved the people
hes one honest enough would all the rest were so
why masters my good friends mine honest neighbors will you undo yourselves
i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as strike at the heavens with your staves
as against the roman state
speaking to the tv suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain the others shush her
alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you the helms of the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies
cassius mutes the tv
we see senator menenius continuing with his speech his attempt to calm the dangerous situation
care for us
they never cared for us yet
if the wars eat us not up they will and thats all the love they bear us
the others are growing increasingly restive shifting why stay we prating here
no more talking on it
to the capitol
tamora cassius and the others are now in the midst of the protest march
the crowd has become a mob with a life and will of its own
the crowd surges forward they round a corner and suddenly stop for a formidable sight awaits them rows of black uniforms
full riot gear with plexiglass shields and dangerous truncheons
a few soldiers on horses as well
the crowd starts and shifts nervously unsure how to proceed
should they launch themselves against this monolithic military force
a long tense beat
one of the horsemen trots forward
he rides a beautiful white horse
it is caius martius
soon to be given the honorary title coriolanus
he is intense and patrician
a man of steel
he wears a crisp military uniform
from his position on the horse martius looks over the rioters
his gaze is ice
a long beat
then he dismounts
he slowly walks to the unruly mob
with no hesitation unarmed
he stops before them
and speaks with absolute disdain
whats the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs
we have ever your good word
he that will give good words to thee will beneath abhorring
the crowd is hushed
taking in his every word
we note a tv news crew has moved into position and is filming eagerly
some in the crowd film with cell phone cameras
we intercut some of these perspectives
what would you have you curs
he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you where foxes geese
he walks along the front of the crowd
some are frightened by the great martius
some are even awed
others glare at him with loathing
who deserves greatness deserves your hate
with every minute you do change your mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland
he continues along the crowd his cold eyes taking in face whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under
the gods keep you in awe which would feed on one another
he stops and glares at the mob with seething anger
he climbs back onto his horse
stares down at them
go get you home you fragments
a tense beat
the riot police shift nervously
the crowd is unsure
the tv news crew films everything
cassius looks around
he sees the police ready with tear gas
he sees old men women and children in his crowd
he doesnt want this to explode
he exchanges a few whispers works with tamora
word is passed and the crowd begins to disperse
some run off in a panic
others walk away
the danger has passed
senator menenius who has been watching from nearby gestures for martius to join him
he is an old family friend of martius as well as his mentor and chief political advisor
menenius is relieved bloodshed has been avoided
these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly
they are dissolved
senator menenius watches the crowd
i would they were abed
i would they were in tiber
they move off
we see the tv image of martius railing at the people from go get you home you fragments
tullus aufidius is leaning in
watching so closely
from his pov the pixilated close up of martius face on the screen
he runs his knife blade back and forth
turns it in the light the reflection of martius face distorting as he rotates the blade
then aufidius leans back again
back into the shadows
romes military headquarters
a high security building like the pentagon
martius is seated with several military officers and aides
also with him is titus
he younger than martius an old friend and comrade in arms
like martius he has seen a lot of battle
cominius an older general enters
he is an experienced commander of men also used to dealing with the necessary politics of civilian oversight
west point bearing
cominius returns the salute
the news is the volsces are in arms
an aide presses a remote
grainy video images play on a monitor volscian soldiers jeeps tanks
one section shows a quick image of the rebel leader a striking man called tullus aufidius riding past in a jeep
they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to it
i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he
you have fought together
he is a lion that i am proud to hunt
martius takes the remote control
stops the video
rewinds to the unclear image of aufidius
titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
lead you on
martius rewinds and plays the image of aufidius again rewinds and plays it again almost obsessively
we push in on the video image of aufidius
aufidius appears to be staring right back at martius
and this takes us to
the same face
aufidius who is the leader of the rebel volscian forces stands deep in thought
the volsces are an insurgent force challenging the monolithic might of rome rebels that suggest to us latin american revolutionaries or hamas fighters or chechnian separatists
they are a dangerous guerilla force
we are in the volsce war room in an old apartment building
officers and some civilian politicians
the room is filled with military maps weapons surveillance photos
so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our and know how we proceed
is it not yours
tis not four days gone since i heard thence
we never yet made doubt but rome was to answer us
and it is rumored martius your old enemy leads in their preparation
he tosses a glossy magazine on the desk a picture of martius on the cover
aufidius eyes spark at the image of martius
he picks up the magazine and carefully tears off the cover picture of martius looking at the picture deeply
he continues with a strange and grim fire if we and caius martius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever till one can do no more
by the elements if ever again i meet him beard to beard hes mine or i am his
a beautiful butterfly
catching the light perfectly almost iridescent
it floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the great city
classical architectural lines
this fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away from the urban blight of rome
in the immaculate front gardens young martius martius son is playing
the boy is about ten
there is something grim and lonely about him without charm
young martius chases after the butterfly trying to catch it
the butterfly flits away
young martius leaps after it
again he misses
finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly
in his rage he tears it to pieces brutally shredding it
we realize he is being observed
virgilia martius wife stands at the window
disturbed by the sight of her son ripping apart the butterfly
she sees young martius stop and look at the tiny bit of blood on his fingers
young martius is unmoved
he glances up
locks eyes with his mother
she turns away
virgilia was well chosen for her role as wife to one of romes most aristocratic men
she is beautiful and graceful but like diana thrown into lions den of the windsor family woefully out of her depth
we feel an inner fragility to her
the room is spacious and elegantly appointed
a lovely roman statue in one corner
this is a place of wealth order and control
a fine flat screen tv flickers with images of war
we see helicopters zooming over desert landscape imbedded war correspondents tanks combat romans
volumnia martius mother stands and watches the tv
she is an imposing woman handsome and tall impeccably dressed
adamantine in her strength
virgilia moves from the window
sits on a sofa
she watches the tv news footage of the war upset by the images
a frozen silence
i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort
if my son were my husband i should more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most
she moves across the room to fetch a cigarette
she moves always with stately grace
she walks past a series of photographs
they tell the story of martius life the happy baby the stern dead father the rigid young military cadet the formal wedding the restrained and unsmiling adult
in the photos we sense a transformation innocent boy to experienced severe looking soldier
volumnia is present in most of the pictures
when yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb i considering how honor would become such a person was pleased to let him seek danger
where he was like to find fame
she lights her cigarette
to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak
but had he died in the business madam how then
then his good report should have been my son
she rivets virgilia had i a dozen sons i had rather have eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
a maid enters
she speaks to volumnia the true mistress of the house not to virgilia
madam senator menenius is come to visit you
tell menenius we are fit to bid him welcome
the maid goes
beseech you give me leave to retire myself
indeed you shall not
she turns off the tv and goes to a bar to mix drinks
she mixes the drinks aggressively strangely inspired by the discussion of war methinks i hear hither your husbands methinks i see him stamp thus and call
come on you cowards
you were got in fear though you were born in rome
his bloody then wiping forth he goes
his bloody brow
jupiter no blood
away you fool
it more becomes a man than gold his trophy
heavens bless my lord from fell auf idius
hell beat aufidius head below his knee and tread upon his neck
senator menenius enters he is comfortable in this house and an old ally of volumnias
my ladies both good day to you
volumnia hands him one of the drinks she has been mixing a perfect martini
she knows how he takes his drink
she is not above flirting with him when it suits her ends
how do you both
and how does your little son
i thank you sir well good
he had rather play with swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster
on my word the fathers son
he and volumnia laugh
menenius has sensed virgilias tension
tries to cheer her come i must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon
no good sir i will not out of doors
not out of doors
she shall she shall
indeed no by your patience
ill not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars
fie you confine yourself most unreasonably
i cannot go hither
you would be another penelope yet they say all the yarn she spun in ulysses absence did but fill ithaca full of moths
no good sir pardon me indeed i will not forth
go with me and ill tell you excellent news of your husband
good sir there can be none yet
there came news from him last night
volumnia pounces moving in indeed
your lord and titus lartius are set down before the volscian city of corioles
they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars this is true on mine honor and so i pray go out with us
give me excuse good sir
i will obey you in everything hereafter
let her alone
as she is now she will but disease our better mirth
she takes menenius arm and pulls him out eager for more news of her son
virgilia sits for a beat
then she presses a button on the remote control
the tv goes on again
more news reports of the war
we see images of the volscian town of corioles
a breaking news scroll runs across the bottom of the screen the battle for corioles virgilia watches the war footage her eyes haunted
hard cut to blam
a series of explosions jolt us
corioles is a small urban center
smoke billows up from areas of the city
the steady crack and rattle of gunfire
the occasional thud of explosions
we see urban street to street fighting
the images are startling in their familiarity this could be basra or belfast
the battle is photographed in a gritty exposure
color is drained out blood is a darker red like oil
soldiers are dark forms moving through shadows and smoke
martius and titus leading a platoon of around twenty roman soldiers run into view and take cover
bullets zip and snap around them
the roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body armor tricked out with all the latest tech gear
the volscians being a poor guerilla force wear thrown together uniforms that look almost tribal
martius calls over the incessant din of battle to titus and
they fear us not but issue forth their city
sniper bullets slam into a wall near him
he coughs away the smoke and debris
this only makes him more angry they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath
he that retires ill take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge
martius leaps up and races on
the others follow in military order
the roman soldiers move along the street it is chaotic explosions smoke and sniper fire they duck into doorways and behind abandoned cars returning fire as best they can martius
leads firing stead bursts from his machine gun it is slow and bloody going finally the romans turn a corner and are stopped by a roadblock a burning bus that fills the entire street the volsces use this roadblock to ambush the roman soldiers we see glimpses of volscian soldiers darting for position firing from rooftops and from inside shops aufidius runs into a blasted hotel room
some of his soldiers with him
he goes to the window
scans the street below
sees martius and the others trapped at the bus
he gestures to an aide for in the face of the crossfire the roman soldiers start martius refuses to yield pushing and shoving his men toward the burning bus screaming
in fury over the noise
you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men
pluto and all hurt behind
backs red and faces with flight and agued fear
mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven ill leave an explosion dirt and brick shards slash across martius face blood this only pushes his fury to white
rage look to it
he leaves his soldiers behind moves alone to the burning bus and fights his way through the martius is in his own world now
he doesnt even realize he is alone
he has become a sort of killing machine
a shark moving through the ocean
ruthless and efficient
we become the warrior
from martius pov we move through disorienting curtains of smoke
continue down the street
firing a heavy machine gun
volscian soldiers contort and die torn to pieces by the bullets
the heavy machine gun is empty we drop it and use a sidearm firing strategic shots
volscian soldiers dart up fire and die
we keep moving steadily forward
shadowy shapes moving nearby we fire
the fortunes of war
strange surreal images
we smash into a house
an old man crouches terrified in a corner
he reaches forward
he is offering us water
an act of kindness amid the carnage
we move on
panicked civilians scattering in terror
volscian soldiers rush us attacking we slam them aside
we duck down roll under a car emerge and fire
more volscians die
we continue forward
then the pistol is empty we drop it and pull a machete like knife
still moving relentlessly forward
slashing and killing
hand to hand now
aufidius and his aides are racing down an alley trying to get to martius roman fire stops them they return fire as they divert down another alley trying for a
better strategic position running flat out titus and the soldiers are still pinned down at the burning bus
two soldiers race back to titus to report they dive for cover
what is become of martius
slain sir doubtless
he is himself alone to answer all the city
thou art lost martius
titus has no time to mourn
he looks over the hopeless situation
scanning the rooftops windows and shops
then he stops he sees something past the burning bus through the smoke and flames
he glimpses a ghostly figure
whos yonder that does appear as he were flayed
he has the stamp of martius
it is indeed martius
a shocking sight
drenched head to toe in blood
his face splattered with gore
his eyes wild
lost in something like rapture
come i too late
come i too late
ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own
martius laughs wildly and embraces titus who comes away splattered with blood let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i wooed in as merry as when our
nuptial day was done
suddenly a deafening explosion and rpg exploding from nearby
bullets shatter windows
the volscians are attacking again
the romans instantly begin diving for cover and taking up
martius scans the location
sees the attack is coming from an old hilton hotel
now pockmarked with bullets and artillery shells
most of the windows shattered
this is the volscian stronghold
the last stand
he sees flashes of volscian soldiers moving on the roof and balconies and snipers firing from windows
there is an open plaza littered with bodies and debris in front of the hotel
martius stops scanning with his binoculars sees aufidius moving in the hotel directing the battle there is the man of my souls hate piercing our romans
worthy sir thou bleeds
thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight
sir praise me not
my work hath yet not warmed me
the blood i drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me
to aufidius thus i will appear and fight
he turns to some soldiers imploring them to join him
his bloody visage and intensity are strangely inspiring his if any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this wherein you see me smeared if any
fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his countrys dearer than let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition the soldiers are pumped up like marines straining for
zigzagging across the plaza toward the hotel titus and the others provide covering fire martius zigzags with his men across the dangerously exposed they return fire at the hotel as
best they can but the barrage from the volscians is murderous roman soldiers contort and fall blood spraying bullets snap and ricochet everywhere around them but still they keep up a steady pace reloading and firing as then martius is hit but still he keeps on the front of the hotel is closer now martius and his soldiers race to the hotel and crash into the martius and his soldiers battle the volscian defenders in the it is the weird and incongruous nature of modern urban warfare soldiers fighting to the death among hotel couches and tatty corporate artwork it is brutal martius and his soldiers cut a bloody swath across the hotel another huge explosion rocks the hotel like a seismic blast an ugly s chandelier falls
martius and his men move into a stairwell martius and his men race up the stairway volscians are firing down at them bullets ricochet crazily in the confined stairway refracting
from concrete walls and twisting metal railing sending up sparks and clouds of dust then martius slows to a stop
aufidius is on the stairway above
glaring down at him
a long beat as they lock eyes
both panting for breath in the heat of the combat
ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
we hate alike
then martius does something astounding
he holds out his arms to his sides and drops his weapons
they clatter down
aufidius does the same
the roman and volscian soldiers watch
none daring to interfere
martius and aufidius continue to glare at each other dropping weapons disarming martius climbing up the stairs aufidius coming down moving closer and closer at an instant they slam together
fighting without weapons grappling brutally
tearing at each other
it is a bloody terrible graceless struggle
they crash and slam awkwardly in the claustrophobic stairwell
smashing into the walls
falling from level to another explosion rocks the hotel part of the roof collapses concrete slams down a cloud of smoke dust and debris obscures everything martius is tossed violently
to the ground in the action aufidius is pulled away by several of his men
they drag him to safety
roman soldiers fire after them
the sound is deafening in the confined garage
but aufidius and his comrades disappear into a cloud of dust
martius glares after him
wipes blood from his eyes
the hotel lobby has been turned into a hastily assembled emergency triage station
the moaning and screaming of the injured are constant
roman medics attend to the wounded administering ivs arranging evacuations performing battlefield surgery
martius sits dried blood covering his face looking over his injured and dying soldiers as a medic stitches up a wound in his arm
titus is with him
general cominius enters with several attending officers going to congratulate martius
if i should tell thee over this thy days work thou would not believe thy deeds
martius is barely listening
his attention is on a young soldier across the room
the young soldier is injured pale and thirsty
but ill report it where senators shall mingle tears with
where great patricians shall attend and shrug in the end admire and say we thank the our rome hath such a soldier
pray now no more
my mother when she does praise me grieves me
i have done as you have done thats what i can induced as you have been thats for my country
martius continues to look at the poor dying soldier
rome must know the value of her own
it were a worse than a theft to hide your doings
i have some wounds upon me and they to hear themselves remembered
the surgeon finishes stitching martius arm
starts to clean another wound
should they not well might they fester against too modest are you
impatient martius rises painfully and slowly
he takes his canteen and crosses to the young soldier
gives his canteen to the boy
the young soldier drinks
his deep sad eyes gaze up at martius
martius watches as
the young soldier dies
the light goes from his eyes
his head hangs awkwardly
his boyish face is leaden
martius suddenly finds himself exhausted
morally and physically spent
i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall whether i blush or no howbeit thank you
martius stares at the dead soldier
aufidius and some of his volscian soldiers bloody and filthy are on foot
they are moving through the outskirts of corioles leaving the city
exhausted after the long and failed battle
fires burn from blasted shops and homes
the romans have clearly laid waste to this part of the city
there is a minivan stopped ahead of them
bullets holes everywhere
they walk to it
aufidius looks in
a dead family
father mother kids in the back
bloody toys on the floor of the minivan
aufidius gazes at the bodies
his face hardens
he whispers to himself five times martius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and would do so i think should we as often as we
he becomes aware some of his men are looking at him disturbed at his fervor
i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword ill stab him some way or wrath or craft may get him
hes the devil
bolder though not so subtle
aufidius continues with prayer like intensity my valor poisoned with him shall fly out of itself
nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to martius
in the shattered glass of the minivan window aufidius suddenly sees himself
he studies his own face nurturing his dark thoughts
where i find him were it at home upon my brothers guard even there will i wash my fierce hand in his heart
back in rome we are at a comfortable restaurant bar near the senate where politicians gather to eat drink gossip and conspire
the business of state is conducted over steak and martinis
comfortable red leather booths
two tribunes senators chosen to speak for the people are having lunch
brutus is a large man in a rumpled grey suit a sweating bear with a taste for bare knuckle politics
sicinius is smaller and vulpine crafty and cold
both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people and the press for their personal ends
with them sits cassius the political agitator we met before
the tv over the bar shows images of martius victory parading roman troops volscian prisoners flags adoring crowds triumphant slogans mission accomplished
was ever man so proud as is this martius
he has no equal
when we were chosen tribunes for the marked you his lip and eyes
nay but his taunts
they see senator menenius approaching
sicinius nods to cassius who quickly goes
menenius stops by on his way out
he is jolly knowing the victory will assure his proteges political future the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
good or bad
not according to the prayer of the people for they love not martius
nature teaches beasts to know their friends
you blame martius for being proud
we do it not alone sir
subtly the polite chit chat is turning more serious and pointed menenius growing sharper
the gloves are coming off
i know you can do very little alone you talk of pride that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey
of your good selves
that you could
what then sir
why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome
the saturnine sicinius response seems almost a threat menenius you are known well enough too
i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning
what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath
come sir come we know you well enough
you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious
a tense beat
they are formidable adversaries
good een to your worships
more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you
the tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd and exit
the roman senate is constructed with classical symmetry and clean square lines
probably the most striking and beautiful building in rome
volumnia virgilia and menenius are hurrying down a corridor excited
all are well dressed for an important public event
honorable menenius my boy martius approaches
for the love of juno lets go
is he not wounded
he was wont to come home wounded
no no no
he is wounded
i thank the gods for it
so do i too if it be not too much
brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him
has he disciplined aufidius soundly
titus lartius says they fought together but aufidius got off
in truth theres wondrous things spoke of him
gods grant them true
an exhalation of scorn true
ill be sworn they are true
where is he wounded
volumnia and menenius now gleefully add up her sons wounds like accountants or campaign managers
in the shoulder and in the left arm
there will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts in the body
one in the neck and two in the thigh theres nine that i know
he had before this last expedition twenty five wounds upon him
now its twenty seven
every gash was an enemys grave
we focus on volumnias face as she thinks about her son
he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
death that dark spirit in his nervy arm which being advanced declines and then men die
they hurry to the stop of a grand staircase where there are people waiting
they join cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a majestic stairway
an honor guard of roman soldiers in dress uniforms are waiting
roman flags flutter
all very ceremonial
martius enters below
the honor guard snaps to attention
martius hereafter called coriolanus slowly begins to cross to the steps
we see that walking is very difficult for him
his wounds are severe and every movement is agony
he has paid a steep price for his victory
photographers flash photos and a tv crew film the ceremony
coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up
he takes a breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs each step a challenge
volumnia looks down on him
unmoved by his pain
virgilia is distraught
as coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps general cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and addresses the press
be it known as to us to all the world that caius wears this wars garland and from this time for what he did before corioles call him with all
the applause and clamor of the host caius martius coriolanus
bear the addition nobly ever
the soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant caius martius coriolanus
coriolanus has reached the podium
an awkward beat
cominius gestures for him to speak into the microphones
he tersely does so no more of this it does offend my heart
pray now no more
an awkward silence
cominius elegantly tries to covers the look sir your mother
you have i know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity
he kneels to her slowly with great difficulty she lets him
nay my good soldier up
he slowly rises my gentle martius worthy caius and by deed achieving honor newly named what is it
coriolanus must i call thee
she laughs coquettishly thoroughly upstaging her son
then almost an afterthought
but thy wife
coriolanus greets virgilia with the clumsy and stiff formality that marks their marriage
my gracious silence hail
an awkwardly tender kiss
he notes her tears
would thou have laughed had i come coffined home that weeps to see me triumph
ay my dear such eyes the widows in corioles wear and mothers that lack sons
now the gods crown thee
greets him warmly and live you yet
i know not where to turn
and welcome general
and youre welcome all
a hundred thousand welcomes
coriolanus is surrounded by well wishers and political admirers
volumnia and menenius usher him along
we see the image from tv the noble warrior returned home
the future golden
and then the hard reality
coriolanus body is a battleground of scars
some are livid and red fresh and still oozing blood
others are pale and blue discolored and dead
his body is something monstrous
he is leaning against a sink stripped naked
his muscular if shattered body exposed
volumnia sits and dresses her sons wounds
as she always has done
as she always will
it is a disturbing intimate image
the good senators must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honors
he shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his wounds
i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy
only theres one thing wanting which i doubt our rome will cast upon thee
he catches her eye in the mirror very firm know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs
they stop when virgilia enters
she stops in the doorway
it is embarrassing for her as if she has interrupted two lovers
a long moment
she looks to her husband
they stare back
there is no way she can compete with their intimacy
surrendering she silently goes
virgilia wanders a long hallway past a fine collection of antique roman weaponry
she seems lost
she stops and opens a door glances into her sons bedroom young martius is asleep
her eyes move across his room
the military toys
the little cadet uniform carefully hung
the polished boots waiting
all stern and joyless
not like a childs room at all
virgilia closes the door and continues down the long hallway disappearing into darkness
brutus and sicinius sit heads together focused
he cannot temperately transport his honors but will lose those he hath won
i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would appear in the marketplace nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking
it was his word
brutus and sicinius continue as they hurry to the senate so it must fall out with him or our authorities at an end
we must suggest to the people in what he still hath held them
they enter the senate chamber
brutus and sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath
thus stood for his country
the interior of the grand senate is an airy sweeping chamber that suggests the israeli knesset or u
again classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats facing a central dais
an imposing piece of outdated modern art suggesting the might of rome looms over the chamber like a bird of prey
network tv cameras purr quietly from a corner
menenius cominius coriolanus and several other politicos are seating at a central table on the dais facing the rows of senators
menenius is standing at a podium speaking into a microphone therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found
successes to report a little of that worthy work performed by caius martius coriolanus
speak good cominius
general cominius rises and moves to the podium
but then coriolanus abruptly stands nay keep your place
never shame to hear what you have nobly done
your honors pardon
i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them
pray now sit down
i had rather have one scratch my head in when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered
coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway
the door shuts after him
nods to cominius
cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech from a teleprompter
this all has the rehearsed quality of a campaign nomination speech
the deeds of coriolanus should not be uttered feebly
it is held that valor is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver
alone he the mortal gate of the city and struck corioles like a planet from face to foot he was a thing of blood
brutus and sicinius exchange a glance bored by the political boilerplate
meanwhile coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond the chamber
green industrial walls
ugly fluorescent lights above
he leans against a wall alone with his thoughts
cominius voice can be heard droning inside
then coriolanus glances up
a custodian is pushing a garbage can down the long corridor
he stops when he sees coriolanus
coriolanus cool uncompromising stare makes the custodian uneasy
he turns around and goes back
his face strangely vacant
he flexes his wounded arm
he hears cominius finish
a good round of applause
he hears his name being cheered coriolanus
coriolanus closes his eyes steels himself and then re enters the chamber
menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his acceptance speech
the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul
menenius steps back
coriolanus stares at the senators
at the tv cameras
he leans awkwardly into the podium microphone i do owe them still my life and services
for an acceptance speech rather terse
menenius jumps in to salvage the moment it then remains that you do speak to the people
i do beseech you let me overleap that custom for i cannot for my wounds sake to give their suffrage
please you that i may pass this doing
from the senate floor sicinius jumps on this sir the people must have their voices
the senators led by brutus clamor their agreement
tradition must be obeyed
calming to coriolanus pray you go fit you to the custom
it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might be taken from the people
menenius quickly turns off coriolanus microphone
mark you that
to brag unto them thus i did and thus
show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only
menenius sees coriolanus is getting angry this could be disastrous
he elegantly gestures for cominius to escort coriolanus out immediately as he addresses the senators and tv cameras to our noble consul wish we all joy and honor
the applause is taken up by the senators
some cheering as well for the hero of rome the two tribunes however are already whispering maliciously to other senators
menenius seems pleased with the general response
so far so good
volumnia is pleased as well
she sits watching the events unfold on tv
the sound of the cheering fades as we go to
the limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward the roman marketplace
coriolanus sits with menenius
coriolanus is both angry and embarrassed
he is wearing a sharp business suit
have you not known the worthiest men have done it
custom calls me to it
what custom wills in all things should we do
what must i say
look sir my wounds
i got them in my countrys service
o me the gods
you must not speak like that
you must to think upon you think upon me
i would they would forget me
youll mar all
the limo stops
they are at the marketplace
the moment has come
menenius takes a breath
urges calm pray you speak to them i pray you in wholesome manner
bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean
he leaves the car
the commercial heart of rome
a large town square since antiquity used as a marketplace
but now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses and knock off watches
paltry fruit stands alongside shabby souvenir stalls
advertising billboards surround and pollute the square sony
mcdonalds obscuring any classical architecture that might have survived
tamora and cassius the political activists are in the crowd
they watch closely
coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace
he stands feeling ridiculous and not at all humble
he looks around
waiting for something to happen
the customers and shopkeepers just look back at him
some are curious
some are amused
some hostile and most indifferent
but no one approaches
then coriolanus understands
he must g to them beg for votes
he prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various stalls weaving in and out
trying to maintain his dignity
he sees the citizens from before and goes to them
we glimpse brutus and sicinius amongst the crowd
you know the cause sir of my standing here
we do sir
tell us what hath brought you to it
mine own desert
your own desert
ay but not mine own desire
how not your own desire
no it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging
you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you
well then i pray your price of the consulship
the price is to ask it kindly
kindly sir i pray let me have it
i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir
what say you
you shall have it worthy sir
a match sir
theres in all two worthy voices begged
i have your alms
business done so he thinks coriolanus crisply moves on
cassius is not convinced
but this is something odd
coriolanus continues on
he sees a large jamaican woman with her children carrying plastic grocery bags talking to a shopkeeper
he goes to them pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul
you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly
you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love therefore beseech you i may be consul
we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily
you have received many wounds for your country
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them
i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther
the gods give you joy sir heartily
coriolanus is warming to the task its easier than he thought
he moves to a central open area and declares your voices
for your voices i have watched for your voices for your voices of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice i have seen and heard of
a crowd is gathering
we note brutus and sicinius in the crowd
menenius too has moved in
for your voices have done many things some less some more
indeed i would be consul
he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice
therefore let him be consul
the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people
the citizens applaud and give their support amen amen
god save thee noble consul
menenius with brutus and sicinius goes to him you have stood your limitation and the endue you with the peoples voice
is this done
the custom of request you have discharged
the people do admit you and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation
at the senate
ill keep you company
will you along
we stay here for the people
coriolanus and menenius go relieved the trial is over
brutus and sicinius however have work to do
this has not gone as they wanted
they are urgent how now my masters
have you chose this man
he has our voices sir
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
to my poor unworthy notice he mocked us when he begged our voices
he flouted us downright
no it is his kind of speech he did not mock us
he should have showed us his marks of merit wounds received fors country
why so he did i am sure
no one saw them
inciting the crowd was not this mockery
brutus presses hard when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties
did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you that his contempt shall not be bruising when he hath power
cassius and tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing growing alarm and resistance to coriolanus hes not confirmed we may deny him yet
and will deny him
ill have five hundred voices of that sound
i twice five hundred and their friends
the crowd roars approval
a frightening animal sound
let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election
enforce his pride and his old hate unto you
and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol
we will so
we will so
all repent in their election
cassius and tamora lead the crowd
it is a terrifying spectacle of sudden mob rage only a razor thin edge to violence
brutus and sicinius watch satisfied like robespierre and saint just looking over the bloody guillotine
coriolanus dressed again in his familiar uniform emerges from an antechamber with his comrade titus
menenius general cominius and several pro coriolanus senators follow them
they stride down the corridor
tullus aufidius then has assembled a new army
he has my lord
saw you aufidius
he is retired to antium
spoke he of me
he did my lord
how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he your person most
at antium lives he
i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully
they hear the growing rumble of a crowd
they continue on and turn a corner to
the central lobby of the senate is an open airy space
through the glass doors at the front of the lobby an unruly crowd can be seen gathering
sicinius and brutus are waiting to intercept them
behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues of the common mouth
pass no further
what is that
it will be dangerous to go on
what makes this change
hath he not passed the nobles and the commons
coriolanus steps closer to brutus
the mob sees him through the glass doors
the tension immediately increases
have i had childrens voices
tribunes give way
the people are incensed against him
glancing to the growing are these your herd
be calm be calm
the people cry you mocked them and of late called them time pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
but this was known before
you show too much of that for which the people stir
if you will to where you are bound you must inquire your way
the crowd outside is growing restless sensing and responding to the building tension
the police try to hold them back keeping them away from the doors
the crowd presses in
we see cassius and tamora at the forefront urging the crowd on
lets be calm the people are abused set on not now not now not in this heat sir coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits the others follow coriolanus
launches himself into the crowd with blistering my nobler friends i crave their pardons
for the mutable rank scented crowd let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves
i say again in soothing them we nourish against our the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us
well no more
no more words we beseech you the mob has surrounded them all by now
the police are getting nervous eyes darting uneasily from the unruly crowd to the volatile men
this all has the potential of sparking to violence
we note a tv news crew moving into position covering the action
others film with cell phone cameras
we intercut some of this footage
to coriolanus provoking you speak of the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity
it were well we let the people know it
were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove it would be my mind
it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further
hear you this triton of the minnows
mark his absolute shall
why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice
ill give my reasons more worthier than their voices
menenius tries to pull him away coriolanus shakes free and continues the attack by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul to know when two authorities are
up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other
the crowd roars angrily coriolanus spins on them thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope
the locks of the senate and the crows to peck the eagles
enough with over measure
calls to the mob he has spoken like a traitor and shall as traitors do
at the word traitor coriolanus loses all reason he is thou wretch despite overwhelm thee
this is a consul
hence old goat
coriolanus grabs sicinius roughly and flings him aside at this the crowd roars in outrage the tv crews hustle menenius pulls coriolanus off
on both sides more respect
calling to the crowd heres he that would take from you all your power
the crowd reacts angrily surging forward against the restraint of the police
we see grim riot police marching into position
the crowd is not intimidated they are spoiling for a fight
the tribunes provoke the crowd even more escalating and building the fever you are at point to lose your liberties
martius would have all from you martius whom late you have named for consul
what is the city but the people
the people are the city
we do here pronounce upon the part of the people martius is worthy of present death
a huge roar from the mob
panic and violence building
fast guards seize him
no ill die here
lay hands upon him
to the crowd at his cue the civil violence threatened from the opening moments of this story finally explodes
with cassius and tamora in the forefront the crowd attacks riot police march in slamming ahead with riot shields and the mob fights back with anything at hand some are
armed with clubs and knives others snatch up garbage cans and newspaper vending machines throwing them smashing windows battling the police kicking and punching and screaming it is civil disobedience
but it is also drunken thug violence
terrifying in its intensity menenius gets titus and cominius to hustle coriolanus away go get you to your house
be gone away
all will be naught else come sir along with us they hurry coriolanus away the riot police outnumbered start firing tear gas into the tv news crew filming chaotic flurried
violence shaky tv images cell phone video choking acrid gas it is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order breaks down
rome is bloody
menenius and the tribunes are gathered in a darkened office for some high stakes politicking
tamora her face bloody from the riot is with them
so too some supporters on either side
as i do know the consuls worthiness so can i name his faults consul
the consul coriolanus
it is decreed he dies tonight
hes a disease that must be cut away
hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome thats worth his death
killing our enemies
he sees that his words are having some effect he presses the the blood he hath lost he dropped it for his country
some in the room murmur agreement
well hear no more consider this he has been bred in the since he could draw a sword and is ill in graceful language give me leave ill go to
him and undertake to bring where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril
noble tribunes it is the humane way
the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning
sicinius is about to retort when brutus stops him
brutus assents assuming the voice of reason be you then as the peoples officer
menenius and coriolanus supporters are relieved
if you bring not martius well proceed in our first way
ill bring him to you
he goes quickly
brutus turns to sicinius and tamora and begins to quietly explain his plan
coriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor in and out of shafts of light seething to titus let them pull all about mine ears death on the wheel or at
wild horses heels yet will i still be thus to them
i muse my mother does not approve me further
he slams through a door to the living room
and stomps to confront his mother who is currently conspiring with menenius and a few senators
to volumnia angrily i talk of you
why did you wish me milder
would you false to my nature
rather say i play the man i am
she is equally tough with him not giving an inch snapping sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out
you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so
let them hang
av and burn too
her outraged fury matches his
come come you have been too rough something too rough
you must return and mend it
coriolanus turns away
pray be counseled
i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of to better vantage
well said noble woman
what must i do
return to the tribunes
well what then
repent what you have spoke
i cannot do it to the gods
must i then do it to them
you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble
upset walking away why force you this
she pursues him because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but
with such words that are but your tongue though but bastards and of no allowance to your bosoms truth
she moves closer to him
her voice lower
a sort of seduction
i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake i should do so in honor
she is very close now
she touches him gently like a lover
i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you
a long beat
all are silent watching her spin her web
i prithee now my son go and say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in has not the soft way in asking their good loves but thou
wilt thyself forsooth hereafter theirs
this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
prithee now go and be ruled
laughing to him although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower
a genuinely sweet moment between them
cominius enters with several other political supporters
sir it is fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence
alls in anger
only fair speech
i think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit
he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it
with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear
well i will do it
but he is still agitated
volumnia shares a concerned glance with menenius
away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit
a beggars tongue make motion through my lips and my armed knees who bowed but in my stirrup bend like that hath charity received
the thought of begging is too much he rejects it breaking i will not do it
lest i cease to honor mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness
volumnia snarls at him exasperated building to a thunder that dwarfs his at thy choice then
to beg of thee it is my more dishonor than thou of them
come all to ruin
let thy mother rather feel thy pride than thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at with as biq heart as thou
do as you like
the words echo
it is as if he has been slapped
his resolve vanishes
pray be content
mother i am going chide me no more
he awaits her approval
she will not yet grant it
look i am going
commend me to my wife
ill return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do in the way of flattery further
she graciously bows to him
do your will
then she kisses him
and she goes
like a queen
then a shocking hard cut to a crowded tv studio
the audience stands are filling up
on the stage the set for a chat show
translight of a city skyline behind the set
two standing microphones
at the side of the set sicinius and brutus are conspiring with the two citizen activists cassius and tamora in this point charge him home that he tyrannical power
if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people
have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll
i have its ready
when the people hear me say it shall be in the right and strength of the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if
i say fine cry fine
if death cry death
we shall inform them
cassius and tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the crowd as best they can
they mix with the audience in the stands
a gloomy but resolved coriolanus walks with cominius and menenius between the tiers of audience on the way to the set
to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet
the word is mildly
pray you let us go
let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honor
ay but mildly
well mildly be it then
coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the stands and head toward the set
tv news crews are waiting
blinding lights snap on
the crowd on seeing coriolanus lets out a roar
deafening and savage
we see cassius and tamora moving through the crowd instigating convincing imploring
coriolanus ignores it all
imperious to the end
brutus and sicinius wait on the set
whispers to sicinius put him to choler straight
coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage
coriolanus glares at the tribunes
the tv crews take up position
menenius gestures for coriolanus to step to the microphone whispering to him
calmly i do beseech you
coriolanus steps to the microphone
brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down
we see bits of this scene through the monitors on the tv cameras
when the crowd is silent coriolanus begins to make a the honored gods but his voice echoes badly with reverb
menenius adjusts the microphone
coriolanus begins again quickly and by rote the honored gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of supplied with worthy men
plant love among us
throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war
a noble wish
his boilerplate speech over coriolanus turns to sicinius who is at the other standing microphone shall i be charged no further than this present
must all determine here
i do demand if you submit you to the peoples voices
i am content
volumnia watches the proceedings closely on tv
she is pleased with her sons performance so far
menenius ever the peoples friend steps to the microphone lo citizens he says he is content
the warlike service he has done upon the wounds his body bears which like graves in the holy churchyard
uncomfortable with this scratches with briers scars to move laughter only
aufidius sits with several of his officers leaning forward watching the drama unfold on tv
consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier
do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier
coriolanus cuts in his impatience getting the better of him what is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice i am so dishonored that the very hour
you take it off again
we charge you that you have contrived to from rome all seasoned office and to yourself into a power tyrannical
the coup de grace for which you are a traitor to the people
coriolanus responds a cobra striking how
the fires in the lowest hell fold in the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
mark you this people
the crowd responds egged on by cassius and tamora
a murmur of voices a chant growing traitor traitor traitor
brutus cleverly plays the reasonable voice knowing his words will further rile coriolanus but since he hath served well for rome what do you prate of service
i talk of that that know it
ill know no further
let them pronounce death exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word
volumnia watches alarmed now
she knows this rage will prove to be disastrous for her son
sicinius seizes the moment to destroy coriolanus barking into the microphone in the name of the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant
banish him our city
in the peoples name i say it shall be so
well rehearsed by cassius and tamora many in the crowd respond with a fierce cry it shall be so
it shall be so
let him away
it shall be so
it shall be so
it shall be so
it shall be so
cassius and tamora keep the crowd at a fever pitch they keep chanting and railing a building seismic rumble hear me my masters and my common friends
no more hearing
let me speak
the crowds fury is building it is all about to erupt
theres no more to be said but he is as enemy to the people and his country
it shall be so
it shall be so
it shall be so
his rage is volcanic he slams the standing microphone away his dragons roar silences the entire studio a collective intake of breath the crowd is stunned whose breath i hate
as reek of the rotten fens whose loves i as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air
each word an attack the crowd is silent
no one dares to even breathe
at the villa volumnia watches frozen breathless
in the apartment aufidius stands riveted
here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumor shake your hearts
your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair
have the power to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows
the tv cameras hum
the crowd is silent
menenius and the others watch in amazement
coriolanus slowly takes one last long look at the people of rome
despising for you the city thus i turn my back
he turns and slowly walks toward one of the tunnels leading from the studio
the crowd follows every step with their eyes
there is a world elsewhere
and he goes down the tunnel
disappearing from view
a silent beat
then a chilling cry of absolutely jacobin bloodlust from the the peoples enemy is gone
the crowd screams their approval
the savage cry echoes around the studio
the echoing roar takes us to
the outskirts of rome are an urban wasteland
overgrown vacant lots
collapsing advertising billboards
there is a lonely gas station in the distance its neon sign glowing a lurid green in the gray dawn light
we are at a roman checkpoint on the highway into the city
a guardhouse and barrier
some barbed wire barricades
several cars pull up to the checkpoint
two roman security suvs
menenius familiar limousine
and volumnias enormous bentley
security guards climb out of their vehicle light cigarettes and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint
menenius titus and cominius climb from menenius limousine
meanwhile inside the bentley coriolanus is comforting his wife and mother come leave your tears
a brief farewell
with many heads butts me away
volumnia has tears in her eyes as well
coriolanus is surprisingly unsentimental and tough with her nay mother where is your ancient courage
now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish
nay mother i shall be loved when i am lacked
she nods to him she has regained her composure
only then do they climb from the car
coriolanus takes his leave bid me farewell
cominius droop not adieu
ill do well yet
he goes to menenius who is genuinely distraught
for all his political machinations he truly cares for coriolanus
coriolanus is moved to see menenius so emotional
thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger mans and venomous to thine eyes
if i could shake off but seven years id go with thee every foot
then coriolanus knows it is time to go
he picks up a traveling bag and slings it over his shoulder
looks back at his friends and family
a certain darkness creeps into his expression
an ominous resolve
you shall hear from me still
he turns and looks to the distance
miles and miles of wasteland and desolation
i go alone like to a lonely dragon
he strides off
the soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier
coriolanus walks under it
and begins walking down the long highway away from rome
the only sound is the cold lonely moan of the wind
we fade to
we see his long odyssey
it is a grueling physical journey and also something of a spiritual challenge
he is solitary and without comfort vulnerable to the elements and also to the demons of his own psyche
we see him as
he walks along the barren highway
trash piled along the road
a car zooms past
he is lost in dust
blazing heat like a furnace as he trudges over desert terrain
burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance
isolated within himself as he walks past the detritus of war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery shells skeletons bleached in the sun
his clothes are dusty and dirty now
he wraps a scarf around his head like a burnoose
only his eyes visible now
a gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes him
the boy looks at him intently as he passes
we get a sense of him moving into different terrain up into a mountain range climbing
he is almost a romantic figure now
wrapped in a cloak against the wildness of nature the chiaroscuro flashes of light illuminating his haunted eyes
we end at
like a statue
all his life in his blazing eyes
he is staring at a small town in the distance
we see a sign antium
his destination since he began
the home of his nemesis the hated aufidius
he begins to walk to the town
meanwhile back in rome brutus and sicinius are having lunch at their usual hangout
they see volumnia entering the restaurant pulling virgilia after her
she heads toward the tribunes
volumnias eyes have the grim intensity of a predator
she looks strangely wild
here comes his mother
prepares to go lets not meet her
they say shes mad
volumnia stalks up to them youre well met
the hoarded plague of requite your love
the tribunes try to leave she wont let them will you be gone
you shall stay too
i would i had the to say so to my husband
are you mad
ay fool is that a shame
note but this hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for than thou hast spoken words
trying to escape blessed heavens
volumnia is creating a scene
heads are turning
she continues her attack on sicinius but is distracted and more noble blows than ever thou wise words and for romes good
ill tell thee what nay but thou shalt stay too i would were in arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand
hed make an end of thy posterity
bastards and all
menenius has entered the bar seeing the trouble he goes to them tries to calm volumnia come come peace
pray let us go
he tries to leave the bar
volumnia stops him for final attack something like a curse in its power now pray sir get you gone
you have done a brave deed
ere you go
this ladys husband here this do you see
whom you have banished does exceed you all
well well well leave you
why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits
i would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses
menenius gently restrains volumnia and the tribunes finally escape the bar
volumnia takes a breath controls herself
could i meet em but once a day it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it
you have told them home and by my troth you have cause
youll sup with me
she turns to him
a cold and killing fire in her eyes
angers my meat
i sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding
she takes virgilias hand and drags her out
once proud volumnia reduced to this
antium is an old volscian city gone to seed
it is latin in flavor something like havana
there is life to the place a certain humid vitality
someone is singing in a bar
old men are playing dominos on a patio
flickering tv and radio babel from terraced apartment buildings
coriolanus his face still shrouded in the burnoose like a hamas soldier moves through the streets
he takes in the life of the town as he walks
studying the faces of the volscians around him
coriolanus sees a heavily guarded apartment building at the end of the street
jeeps and soldiers
coriolanus approaches with stealth moving in and out of shadows along the street ducking into doorways and alleys taking advantage of the darkness
steps into the shadows
for he sees
walking with a few of his officers
aufidius is beloved in antium
he has an easy manner with the people
he stops and chats
laughs with them
he dances for a moment with a little girl
coriolanus watches from the shadows his expression complex
there is real envy
aufidius has such a comfortable way with the common people hes natural unaffected
aufidius jokes with the little girls parents for a moment and then moves on
coriolanus watches aufidius and his men go into an apartment building
he scans the building with the eye of a special forces soldier
he sees that the soldiers guarding the building are bored it is perfunctory work
two young women perhaps hookers move past the front of the building flirting with the soldiers
the soldiers call and whistle to them delighted
coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows behind the soldiers and sneak into the building
coriolanus moves again with stealth heading toward what is clearly the center of the action a noisy room on the second floor
the doorway is guarded by two serious guards
these are not the bored soldiers out front these are grim and intense warriors
coriolanus considers his course
takes a breath
he is like ice now
a steady stride he walks right up to the guards before they can even respond he punches one hard in the throat the guard recoils gasping for air simultaneously coriolanus
slams his other hand violently over the entire face of the second guard grabbing his face firmly and shoving him back into the door so hard that the door slams aside and coriolanus shoves the guard into aufidius is having dinner with some of his men their wives and some children the soldiers bolt up upsetting the table smashing dishes pulling guns alarmed as coriolanus powers in still holding the second guard by he flings the guard aside aufidius and his men all pointing weapons at coriolanus are stunned
a long beat
coriolanus face is still masked by the burnoose
only his cold eyes are visible
whence comes thou
what wouldst thou
coriolanus does not respond
aufidius is growing uneasy
his men are tense ready to open fire at any second
whats thy name
a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine
the other guard from outside and several other soldiers rush in
weapons drawn surrounding coriolanus
he doesnt move a muscle
aufidius intrigued by the strangers courage waves his men off
say whats thy name
thou has a grim appearance
whats thy name
knowst thou me yet
i know thee not thy name
finally coriolanus removes his burnoose
his face is exposed
the volscians are stunned
my name is caius martius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the great hurt and mischief thereto witness my surname coriolanus
the volscians look to aufidius very nervous unsure how to proceed
aufidius just stares back at coriolanus staggered
only that name remains
aufidius doesnt understand
coriolanus explains the cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by the voice of slaves to
whooped out of rome
now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of mistake me not to save my life for if i had feared death of all the men in
the i would have avoided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here
coriolanus dares to take a step toward aufidius the volscians react
guns are raised fingers tight on triggers an instant from opening fire coriolanus carefully holds out his arms
aufidius nods to his men
they hold their fire
coriolanus slowly crosses the room toward aufidius
step by step
their eyes are locked
nothing else in the world exists
i will fight against my cankered country with the of all the under fiends
but if thou dares not this then i present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
coriolanus stops right in front of aufidius and slowly carefully undoes his collar
exposing his naked throat
bending back his head
ready for execution
which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do
a long beat
aufidius stares at coriolanus
the volscians watch eyes wide too tense to do anything now
aufidius just continues to stare at coriolanus
coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes
this tiny human response sparks something in aufidius
o martius martius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy
he offers his hand
coriolanus takes it
aufidius continues to hold him by the hand rather intensely speaking low let me twine mine arms about that body
he embraces coriolanus
aufidius men finally relax
weapons are lowered
relieved glances exchanged
some of the volscians though are clearly suspicious of coriolanus
they watch aufidius and coriolanus concerned
aufidius still cant quite believe his ancient enemy is now his newest ally
i loved the maid i married never man sighed truer breath
but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold
coriolanus glances to him perhaps a little disturbed or embarrassed by the intensity of aufidius words
aufidius steps away from him gestures for coriolanus to sit
why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
or lose mine arm for it
thou hast beat twelve several times and i have nightly dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
aufidius continues quietly almost whispering worthy martius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banished we would muster from twelve to seventy and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood overbear it
coriolanus sits naked
he has finally washed off the layers of dirt from his journey
an old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head
aufidius is standing in the doorway to the room
his eyes move over coriolanus body adding up the scars and wounds
then aufidius goes to the old woman
takes the razor from her
aufidius continues to shave coriolanus head himself
it is a deeply personal act even intimate yet aufidius employs the same methodical rhythms as when he was sharpening his knife at the opening of the story
the volscian military command center
maps recon photos and radio equipment
stacks of grenade launchers and arms
aufidius captains and aides wait alongside some bedraggled volsce politicians in ill fitting suits
aufidius ushers coriolanus in
come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands
coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians you bless me gods
then aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a pool table
rome and her territories
strategic markers denote roman forces and volscian forces
therefore most absolute sir if thou the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission
the volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked
aufidius is giving coriolanus command of half his forces
and set down as best thou art experienced since thou thy countrys strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them
in parts remote to fright them ere destroy
aufidius looks at coriolanus hard
there it is
the gauntlet is thrown down
coriolanus will have to completely betray rome expose her military weaknesses tell her secrets
for all his neurotic intensity aufidius is a shrewd man
coriolanus nods and turns to the battle map moving various markers around to show romes defensive positions
aufidius watches him with machiavellian calm
several weeks later back in rome politics go on as usual
menenius is passing the tribunes table
they josh with him is this menenius
tis he tis he
he is grown most kind of late
hail to you both
is not much missed but with his friends
alls well and might have been much he could have temporized
where is he hear you
nay i hear nothing
his mother and his hear nothing from him
caius martius was a worthy officer in the war but insolent overcome with pride ambitious past all thinking i think not so
and rome sits safe and still without him
they are distracted when people begin talking loudly alarmed at the bar
they hush each other and watch the tv over the bar
something has happened
on the tv a special report
a scroll across the bottom of the screen reads the volscians on the march
reports the volsces with two several are entered in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before them
the whole bar is growing quiet now
all watching the tv which shows grainy indistinct images like cell phone pictures of troops and tanks
tis aufidius who hearing of our martius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world
come what talk you of martius
it cannot be the volsces dare break with us
the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senate house
some news is that turns their countenances
he listens to his ear piece for a second yes the first report is seconded and more more fearful is delivered
the tv picture switches to a flustered tv reporter outside the senate
a lot of nervous activity behind him
it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not know that martius has ioined with aufidius there is an audible gasp in the bar quickly silenced
and hushed so all can hear the tv he leads a power against rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing
something close to terror on the faces of the politicos
menenius without a word goes
he does not want to believe this is possible
virgilia lies on her bed
on the tv an imbedded war correspondent is giving an update intercut with shaky and unclear images of the volscian army on the move a fearful army led by caius
martius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already overborne their way consumed with fire what lay before them
volumnia sits almost frozen smoking watching the tv
her emotions are deep and dark
her son to her the model of all roman virtues has betrayed his country
martius has joined with the volscians he is their god
he leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies
close up on volumnias face
she gives away practically nothing
she takes a slow drag on her cigarette
urban industrial wasteland
old factories and abandoned warehouses
the volscians have set up camp here
on the decaying fringes of the city
we see military hardware
soldiers are cleaning weapons cooking meals sleeping playing video games
an incongruous sight
an old barber chair floats past
moving across the blue sky
carried overhead by a group of volscian soldiers
but there is something different about these volscian soldiers
they have altered their uniforms into something pagan and primitive
all have shaved heads
many have face tattoos or wear striking war paint
it is like something from lord of the flies
they set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory
this shattered and abandoned factory is coriolanus domain
it is decorated with human skulls
the camp barber a fat man in a greasy butchers apron begins to strop his razor
hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved
they are coriolanus acolytes
there is no sign of coriolanus himself
aufidius and his lieutenant stand on the fringes disturbed by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around coriolanus
do they still fly to coriolanus
i do not know what witchcrafts in him your soldiers use him as the grace before meat their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are darkened in this action sir
he bears himself more proud even to my person than i thought he when first i did embrace him
they turn and walk to the building where aufidius is sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome
i think hell be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes by sovereignty of nature
aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters with his lieutenant
a shattered building
old graffiti on the walls
aufidius sits on his cot deep in thought
he pulls a folded bit of paper from his pocket
carefully and lovingly unfolds it
he has been carrying this paper for months
we realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture of coriolanus that aufidius tore out earlier
he gazes at the picture his fingers smoothing the paper tracing the contours of coriolanus face
whether twas pride whether defect of judgement or whether nature not to be other than one thing made him feared so hated and so banished
a beat as he studies the picture
his lieutenant watches him closely disturbed by aufidius obsession with coriolanus
so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time
he brings the picture closer whispering now one fire drives out one fire one nail rights by rights founder strengths by strengths do fail and when caius rome is thine
thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine
rome is at war now so the room is busy and tense
maps and video footage chart the enemys progress
soldiers confer urgently outside the door
menenius stands with the two tribunes brutus and sicinius
with them are several senators and generals
menenius snaps angrily no ill not go
go you that banished him
a mile before his tent fall down and the way into his mercy
they stop when titus enters with general cominius
titus is dusty has just come from somewhere
he is pale
menenius and the others crowd around him waiting for his report
titus sits takes a moment to pull himself together and then reports with the grim severity of a death sentence he would not seem to know me
i urged our old acquaintance and the that we have bled together
coriolanus he would not answer to forbade all names
a long beat
they wait for him to go on
titus searches for the words to continue
he was a kind of nothing
a difficult beat titleless
till he had forged himself a name in the of burning rome
he has no more to say his head drops
menenius begins to leave the room
the tribunes stop him leading him to a secluded corner if you refuse your aid would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can
make might stop our countryman
no ill not meddle
pray you go to him
what should i do
brutus stops him with real emotion only make trial what your love can do for rome towards martius
well and say that martius return me as titus is returned unheard what then
yet your good will must have that thanks from rome
menenius thinks about it
you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way
menenius despite all still a patriot at heart decides
ill undertake it i think hell hear me
the tribunes are relieved
cominius nods and escorts menenius out
brutus and sicinius return to titus
hell never hear him
i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as it would burn rome
the roman checkpoint on the desolate highway
a formidable military presence here now soldiers heavy weapons tanks
volscian troops and a jeep can be seen down the highway
we see menenius limousine pull up
he and general cominius climb out
menenius is out of place in his trim business suit a politician among soldiers
menenius steels himself then passes through the roman checkpoint
he walks down the highway toward the distant volscian troops
menenius is blindfolded roughly pulled by two volscian soldiers
we hear some of the soldiers hooting at him
we stay close on menenius blindfolded face sharing his feeling of disorientation and suspense
the volscians drag him into the abandoned factory
finally his guards stop him and pull off his blindfold coriolanus
he is no longer roman
he is not volscian
he is as titus said a kind of nothing
he sits in the barber chair
his head is completely shaved
his face is marked with martial face painting
these striking totemic markings also cover his scarred body
he is primitive
like a dragon
the angel of death
his young warrior acolytes similarly shaved and painted are gathered around him his personal bodyguard and cult
a long beat as menenius stares at his friend stunned at the pagan metamorphosis
coriolanus just gazes back at him
menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches with the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend menenius does
he steps forward to hug coriolanus
two of the acolytes stop him
he can approach no further
menenius accepts this
he is completely confident he will be able to manipulate his protege
he always has in the past
thou art preparing fire for us
look thee heres water to quench it
i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee
to pardon rome
a long beat
menenius waits for an answer
wife mother child i know not
are servanted to others
menenius cant believe this cold response therefore be gone
his frigid eyes slice into menenius another word menenius i will not hear thee speak
menenius stares at him shaken to the core
the guards pull menenius away
coriolanus doesnt even glance at him
back at the roman checkpoint menenius strides toward his limousine
he has been deeply shaken by his interaction with the transformed coriolanus
general cominius follows urgently menenius doesnt stop this martius is grown from man to dragon
he has wings hes more than a creeping thing
he stops at his limo
he turns back to cominius
we see the pain in menenius eyes
there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger
he climbs into his limo
shuts the door
the limousine drives off sending up a cloud of dust that swirls around cominius
menenius sits in the back of his limo as it speeds back to rome
the rejection by coriolanus has wounded him
also he is plagued by guilt
he helped create this monster
he pushed coriolanus into politics
and now coriolanus has lost his soul even his humanity and rome is to be put to the sword
all his fault
this preys on him
menenius limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad tracks
weeds springing up
battered advertising posters
an old chain link fence
menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks
he sits on the railroad tracks
pulls out a little pocket knife and in the roman fashion efficiently slits his wrists
he stares out over the hideous landscape
blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes
from afar we see him sitting on the railroad tracks alone and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland like a samuel beckett character
he slumps over
menenius is dead
the red glow of dusk is shining through the cracked and dusty windows
coriolanus still in the barber chair broods silently
aufidius sits nearby watching him
the visit from menenius is troubling coriolanus
my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how i have borne this business
aufidius is curiously formal in his response the estrangement he feels toward coriolanus growing only their ends you have respected stopped your ears the general suit of rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such that thought them sure of you
this last old man whom with a cracked heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father
shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their attention
volumnia virgilia and young martius stride past the soldiers and mountains of military hardware
volumnia leads pulling the others by the hand
some of the soldiers whistle
others laugh and make lascivious noises
many just watch with grim dislike
volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles and cruel taunts
her head is high back straight eagle eye forward
she was never more a roman patrician
she is magnificent
coriolanus stands as volumnia virgilia and young martius are led into the factory
he tries to register nothing assuming a sort of glacial calm
volumnia and the others stop taking in coriolanus savage new demeanor and appearance taking in the acolytes and pagan totems
volumnia just stands peering sternly at her son
as if daring him not to crumble before her
aufidius watches everything closely
it is virgilia finally who bravely approaches my lord and husband he stop her almost a warning with these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so
best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans
she shows great courage
stepping forward and kissing him deeply
a long kiss
a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge
it is a perverse response
in his monomaniacal imagination his wifes kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on rome
he finally moves to volumnia simply cant resist her orbital pull
you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted
sink my knee in the earth
he kneels before her
it is done with a sense of duty and protocol not affection
stand up blest
then with no softer cushion than the i kneel before thee
she quickly and dramatically kneels before him
it is a coup de theatre and a masterpiece of manipulation
what is this
your knees to me
to your corrected son
thou art my warrior i hope to frame thee
she indicates young martius this is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself
to his son the god of soldiers inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou may prove to shame invulnerable
volumnia pulls young martius down your knee sir
she pulls virgilia down even he your wife and myself are suitors to you
all three kneel before coriolanus
a pitiable sight
but he has no pity
he turns sits in the barber chair
i beseech you peace
or if youd ask remember this do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or again with romes mechanics
tell me not wherein i seem unnatural
desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons
volumnia stands assuming again a position of strength
no more no more
you have said you will not grant us anything for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail
in our request the may hang upon your hardness
therefore hear us
aufidius and you volsces mark for hear naught from rome in private
coldly to her your request
should we be silent and not speak our and state of bodies would reveal what we have led since thy exile
think with how more unfortunate than all living are we come hither since that thy sight make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and
shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father his countrys bowels out
coriolanus face is a study in aloof neutrality
yet he is listening intensely and volumnias words are affecting
she fights back emotion
it is impossible to tell if this real or feigned
for myself son i propose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine
if i cannot rather to show a noble grace thou shalt march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world
ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep living to time
young martius stands as well and approaches his father challenging and warlike you shall not tread on me
ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight
coriolanus stares at him the intensity of the boys aggression is disturbing
i have sat too long
he rises and turns as if to go nay go not from us thus
her command stops him
she appeals quickly getting to the point of her argument if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you
serve you might as poisonous of your honor
no our suit is that you reconcile them so the
may say this mercy we have showed the romans this we received and each in either give the all hail to thee and cry be for making up this peace
coriolanus does not respond
speak to me son
still he does not respond
his emotions are roiling
still she is soft and vulnerable
why dost not speak
but softness is not a note she plays naturally
she knows it
her natural aggressiveness comes out anger and outrage gradually boiling to the surface thinks thou it honorable for a noble man still to remember wrongs
daughter speak you
he cares not for your weeping
speak thou boy
perhaps thy childishness will move him than can our reasons
theres no man in more bound to his mother yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks
she is assaulting him now on the attack thou hast never in thy life showed thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen has clucked thee to the wars
and safely loaded with honor
say my requests unjust and spurn me back and the gods will
plague thee that thou restrains from me the duty to a mothers part belongs
coriolanus can take no more turns and begins to walk away volumnia reacts like lightning grabbing virgilia and young martius and dragging them to the dirt with her down
let us shame him with our knees
she claws at the dirt like hecuba keening a shocking explosion of raw emotion almost an incantation down
this is the last
so we will home to rome and die among our neighbors
this boy that cannot tell what he would but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship does reason our petition with more than thou hast to deny it
she remains kneeling panting for air
coriolanus looks at her
his noble mother
clawing in the dirt like an animal
her face wet with tears
she looks back up at him
she senses she has failed
come let us go
she rises slowly her age showing
her spirit broken
or seeming so
she stares at coriolanus as she rips off the roman eagle medal she wears and flings it to the ground
the blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icy this fellow had a volscian to his
mother his wife is in corioles and his child
like him by chance yet give us our dispatch
i am hushed until our city be afire and then ill speak a little
she turns and begins to go
we see finally coriolanus crack
like a great building crumbling
like fissures cutting across marble
emotion floods into him
he lunges forward and grabs her hand
time stands still
he doesnt speak
o mother mother
what have you done
he falls to his knees clutching her hand
behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural they laugh at
he buries his head in her like a lost child o my mother mother
you have won a happy victory for rome but for your son believe it believe it
most dangerously you have with him he looks up at her if not most mortal to him
she looks down at him
his meaning his foreshadowing is clear she has saved rome but he knows he is doomed
rome will live
he will die
this is the price for her victory today
she is willing to pay that price
so is he
a moment between them
he accepts his destiny
but let it come
he stands regains his composure
he slowly walks to aufidius
he leans close speaking intimately aufidius though i cannot make true wars ill frame convenient peace
now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have a mother less
or granted less
i was moved withal
i dare be sworn you were
and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion
but good sir what peace youll make advise me
we study aufidius face
he gives away nothing
coriolanus turns back to volumnia
looks at her
she is victorious
the crimson sky looms over her ominously
and we go to
a solemn peace treaty signing ceremony
coriolanus represents the volscians
cominius represents the romans
they sit side by side at desks signing the treaty
volumnia and virgilia gorgeously dressed are present
so too brutus and sicinius
the press films everything
it has the stiff formality of a white house ceremony
cominius concludes signing a merrier day did never yet greet rome no not the expulsion of the tarquins
we have all great cause to give great thanks
he looks to volumnia
behold our patroness the life of rome
she is erect and exalted
the life of rome personified
she ignores her son
coriolanus will not look at her
a rundown truck stop in an industrial wasteland
garish buzzing neon
filthy wheelers refueling
music droning from a radio
aufidius his lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting outside the dusty diner
the men with aufidius are thugs and killers the most brutal volsces he could find
we note a couple of coriolanus acolytes among them
they have turned with great venom on their hero
they are like a mafia hit squad waiting for coriolanus to return with the peace treaty
aufidius is deep in thought
his lieutenant breaks the silence how is it with our general
as with a man by his own charity slain
our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst twixt you theres difference but the
fall of either makes the survivor heir of all
i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction
he continues more to himself than them almost convincing himself
i raised him and i pawned mine honor for his truth who being so heightened he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends
at the last i seemed his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary
so he did my lord
the army marveled at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we for no less spoil than glory aufidius works himself into an intense neurotic
rage there was it
for which my sinews shall be stretched upon him
at a few drops of womens rheum which as cheap as lies he sold the blood and of our great action therefore shall he die and ill renew me in
therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second
say no more
in the distance they can see a roman military truck approaching
clouds of dust billow up
they exchange a look
this is what they have been waiting for
they stand stretch and prepare
the truck stops across the highway from them and coriolanus gets out
he holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather portfolio
he is unarmed
he sees aufidius and the thugs
waiting for him
like a death squad
coriolanus looks at them
he knows exactly whats going to happen
he is ready
he nods and the truck drives off
coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop like a gunslinger walking down main street
there is something new to coriolanus here
a sort of acceptance
he knows his time is past
aufidius and the thugs go to meet him
the thugs spread out a bit strategically getting ready to strike
coriolanus experienced eyes miss none of this
they meet in the parking lot
i am returned your soldier no more infected with my countrys love than when i parted hence but still under your great command
he hands the treaty portfolio to aufidius we have made peace with no less honor to the volscians than shame to the romans
handing the treaty to read it not but tell the traitor in the highest he hath abused your powers
coriolanus is ready for aufidius ploy
he is amused at the obvious attempt to anger him traitor
ay traitor martius
ay martius caius martius
dost thou ill grace thee with that robbery thy coriolanus
he spins to the others making the case against coriolanus with cutting bitterness he has betrayed your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome i
say your city to his wife and breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel of the war but at his nurses he whined and roared away your victory
coriolanus tries to contain his anger hearst thou mars
name not the god thou boy of tears
measureless liar thou has made my heart too great for what contains it
coriolanus eyes miss nothing a volscian thug shifting a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into his coat for a weapon
some of the volscian thugs are clearly nervous
coriolanus is ready
he prepares himself mentally to die
he is acutely controlled cut me to pieces volsces
men and lads stain all your edges on me
it is a dare
if you have writ your annals true tis that like an eagle in a dovecote i fluttered your volscians in corioles
his gaze burns into aufidius alone i did it boy
let him die for it
at this command his men move aufidius steps back as the volscian thugs attack with knives machetes and tire irons coriolanus fights bravely disarming two grabbing their weapons killing them
fighting back slashing and cutting his way through the killers closer and closer to aufidius who just watches blood spattering and spraying but the thugs overpower coriolanus there are just too many
they stab him slicing with knives battering with chains and clubs finally emptying pistols him into him it is graceless and brutal carnage
but still he comes on
body riddled with bullets and cut to bits
he refuses to fall
like something immortal
an obscene demon of blood
finally the thugs move away
coriolanus still stands
his face is a swollen mask of blood and gore
blood flows from his body pooling around his feet spreading across the parking lot
aufidius steps forward
what is left of coriolanus glares at him through blood
aufidius slowly pulls his knife
the same knife he was sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story
it has finally found its purpose
coriolanus looks at him
then slowly coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast
he locks eyes with aufidius
aufidius steps to him
takes his neck
pulls him onto the knife
driving it into him
cradling his head like a lover
they stand like this
then coriolanus falls
take him up
no one moves
abrupt cut to
coriolanus body is awkwardly tossed into the back of an open truck
like a sack of potatoes
a crowd of volscians are gathered around the back of the truck
they have come to see coriolanus body
we watch their faces
a range of grim emotion
one raises a cell phone
takes a photo
more phone cameras come out
recording the moment
on the tv the footage from the cell phone video
coriolanus body in the back of the trunk
looking at her son
his body sprawled ungainly in death
no ritual or ceremony
snap to black
