b if window
href b b shawshank redemption by frank darabont based upon the story rita hayworth and shawshank redemption by stephen king a dark empty room
the door bursts open
a man and woman enter drunk and giggling horny as hell
no sooner is the door shut than theyre all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouths locked together
he gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over instead
hell with it
hes got more urgent things to do like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts
she arches moaning fumbling with his fly
he slams her against the wall ripping her skirt
we hear fabric tear
he enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall
she cries out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensations running through her
he carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him
they fall onto the bed
camera pulls back exiting through the window traveling smoothly outside
to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the lovers cries spilling into the night
and we drift down a wooded path the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls
and we begin to hear faint music in the woods tinny and incongruous and still we keep pulling back until
a car is revealed
parked in a clearing
andy dufresne mid s wire rim glasses three piece suit
under normal circumstances a respectable solid citizen hardly dangerous perhaps even meek
but these circumstances are far from normal
he is disheveled unshaven and very drunk
a cigarette smolders in his mouth
his eyes flinty and hard are riveted to the bungalow up the path
he can hear them fucking from here
he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back
the radio plays softly painfully romantic taunting him you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful
to be what you seem
he opens the glove compartment pulls out an object wrapped in a rag
he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully revealing a
oily black evil
he grabs a box of bullets
spills them everywhere all over the seats and floor
he picks bullets off his lap loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim
six in the chamber
his gaze goes back to the bungalow
he shuts off the radio
abrupt silence except for the distant lovers moans
he takes another shot of bourbon courage then opens the door and steps from the car
his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel
loose bullets scatter to the ground
the bourbon bottle drops and shatters
he starts up the path unsteady on his feet
the closer he gets the louder the lovemaking becomes
louder and more frenzied
the lovers are reaching a climax their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts
andy lurches to a stop listening
the woman cries out in orgasm
the sound slams into andys brain like an icepick
he shuts his eyes tightly wishing the sound would stop
it finally does dying away like a siren until all thats left is the shallow gasping and panting of post coitus
we hear languorous laughter moans of satisfaction
thats sooo good
youre the best
the best i ever had
andy just stands and listens devastated
he doesnt look like much of a killer now hes just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods tears streaming down his face a loaded gun
held loosely at his side
a pathetic figure really
the jury listens like a gallery of mannequins on display pale faced and stupefied
dufresne describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered
is on the witness stand hands folded suit and tie pressed hair meticulously combed
he speaks in soft measured tones it was very bitter
she said she was glad i knew that she hated all the sneaking around
she said she wanted a divorce in reno
what was your response
i told her i would not grant one
refers to his notes ill see you in hell before i see you in reno
those were the words you used mr
dufresne according to the testimony of your neighbors
if they say so
i really dont remember
i was upset
what happened after you and your wife argued
she packed a bag and went to stay with mr
the golf pro at the falmouth hills country club
the man you had recently discovered was her lover
andy nods did you follow her
i went to a few bars first
later i decided to drive to mr
quentins home and confront them
they werent there
so i parked my car in the turnout
with what intention
im not sure
i was confused
i think mostly i wanted to scare them
you had a gun with you
when they arrived you went up to the house and murdered them
i was sobering up
i realized she wasnt worth it
i decided to let her have her quickie divorce
quickie divorce indeed
caliber divorce wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots isnt that what you mean
and then you shot her lover
i did not
i got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off
along the way i stopped and threw my gun into the royal river
i feel ive been very clear on this point
yes you have
where i get hazy though is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed riddled with
does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence mr
dufresne or is it just me
im sorry mr
dufresne i dont think the jury heard that
strike me as a fantastic coincidence
on that sir we are in accord
you claim you threw your gun into the royal river before the murders took place
thats rather convenient
its the truth
you recall lt
he and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found
so no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims
thats also rather convenient isnt it mr
faint bitter smile since i am innocent of this crime sir i find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found
holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation ladies and gentlemen youve heard all the evidence you know all the facts
we have the accused at the scene of the crime
we have foot prints
bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints
a broken bourbon bottle likewise with fingerprints
most of all we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each others arms
they had sinned
but was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence
he gestures to andy sitting quietly with his attorney
i suspect mr
dufresnes answer to that would be yes
i further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of september st this year of our lord by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into
and while you think about that think about this
he picks up a revolver spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune
a revolver holds six bullets not eight
i submit to you this was not a hot blooded crime of passion
that could at least be understood if not condoned
no this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold blooded nature
four bullets per victim
not six shots fired but eight
that means he fired the gun empty
and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again
an extra bullet per lover
right in the head
a few jurors shiver im done talking
you people are all decent god fearing christian folk
you know what to do
camera tracks down a long table moving from one juror to the next
these decent god fearing christians are chowing down on a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn
we find the foreman at the head of the table sorting votes
andy stands before the dias
the judge peers down framed by a carved frieze of blind lady justice on the wall
you strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man mr
it chills my blood just to look at you
by the power vested in me by the state of maine i hereby order you to serve two life sentences back to back one for each of your victims
so be it
he raps his gavel as we slides open with an enormous clang
a stark room waits beyond
camera pushes through
seven humorless men sit side by side at a long table
an empty chair faces them
we are now in red enters removes his cap and waits by the chair
red sits tries not to slouch
the chair is uncomfortable
we see by your file youve served twenty years of a life sentence
you feel youve been rehabilitated
ive learned my lesson
i can honestly say im a changed man
im no longer a danger to society
thats the gods honest truth
no doubt about it
the men just stare at him
one stifles a yawn
a big rubber stamp slams down rejected in red ink
high stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire set off at intervals by looming guard towers
over a hundred cons are in the yard
playing catch shooting craps jawing at each other making deals
red emerges into fading daylight slouches low key through the activity worn cap on his head exchanging hellos and doing minor business
hes an important man here
theres a con like me in every prison in america i guess
im the guy who can get it for you
cigarettes a bag of reefer if youre partial a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kids high school graduation
damn near anything within reason
he slips somebody a pack of smokes smooth sleight of hand
yes sir im a regular sears roebuck
two short siren blasts issue from the main tower drawing everybodys attention to the loading dock
the outer gate swings open
revealing a gray prison bus outside
so when andy dufresne came to me in and asked me to smuggle rita hayworth into the prison for him i told him no problem
and it wasnt
fresh fish today
red is joined by heywood skeet floyd jigger ernie snooze
most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer but red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably
andy sits in back wearing steel collar and chains
andy came to shawshank prison in early for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin
the bus lurches forward rumbles through the gates
andy gazes around swallowed by prison walls
on the outside hed been vice president of a large portland bank
good work for a man as young as he was when you consider how conservative banks were back then
guards approach the bus with carbines
the door jerks open
the new fish disembark chained together single file blinking sourly at their surroundings
andy stumbles against the man in front of him almost drags him down
byron hadley captain of the guard slams his baton into andys back
andy goes to his knees gasping in pain
jeers and shouts from the spectators
on your feet before i fuck you up so bad you never walk again
there they are boys
the human charm bracelet
never seen such a sorry lookin heap of maggot shit in my life
comin from you heywood you being so pretty and all
takin bets today red

pope shit in the woods
smokes or coin bettors choice

hell be the first
ill take that action
other hands go up
red jots the names
youre out some smokes son
take my word
youre so smart you call it
i say that chubby fat ass
fifth from the front
put me down for a quarter deck
thats five cigarettes on fat ass
more hands go up
andy and the others are paraded along forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts
the old timers are shaking the fence trying to make the newcomers shit their pants
some of the new fish shout back but mostly they look terrified
i must admit i didnt think much of andy first time i laid eyes on him
he mighta been important on the outside but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays
looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over
that was my first impression of the man
what say red
little fella on the end
i stake half a pack
cmon boys whos gonna prove me wrong
hands go up floyd skeet joe heywood
four brave souls ten smokes apiece
thats it gentlemen this windows closed
red pockets his notepad
a voice comes over the p
speakers voice amplified return to your cellblocks for evening count
the new fish are marched in
guards unlock the shackles
the chains drop away rattling to the stone floor
warden samuel norton strolls forth a colorless man in a gray suit and a church pin in his lapel
he looks like he could piss ice water
he appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes
this is mr
hadley captain of the guard
i am mr
norton the warden
you are sinners and scum thats why they sent you to me
rule number one no blaspheming
ill not have the lords name taken in vain in my prison
the other rules youll figure out as you go along
when do we eat
cued by nortons glance hadley steps up to the con and screams right in his face hadley rams the tip of his club into the cons belly
the man falls to his knees gasping and clutching himself
hadley takes his place at nortons side again
softly any other questions
there are none i believe in two things
discipline and the bible
here youll receive both
holds up a bible put your faith in the lord
your ass belongs to me
welcome to shawshank
off with them clothes
and i didnt say take all day doing it did i
the men shed their clothes
within seconds all stand naked
first man into the shower
hadley shoves the first con into a steel cage open at the front
two guards open up with a fire hose
the con is slammed against the back of the cage sputtering and hollering
seconds later the water is cut and the con yanked out
delouse that piece of shit
next man in
the con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him
gasping and coughing blinking powder from his eyes he gets shoved to a trustees cage
the trustee slides a short stack of items through the slot prison clothes and a bible
all the men are processed quickly a blast of water powder clothes and a bible
a naked con steps before a doctor and gets a cursory exam
a penlight is shined in his eyes ears nose and throat
the con does
a guard with a penlight in his teeth spreads his cheeks peers up his ass and nods
andy is next up
he gets the same treatment
camera tracks the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden chairs clothes on their laps bibles open
maketh me to lie down in green pastures
he leadeth me beside the still waters
he restoreth my soul
three tiers to a side concrete and steel gray and imposing
andy and the others are marched in still naked carrying their clothes and bibles
the cons in their cells greet them with taunts jeers and laughter
one by one the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a clang of steel
the first nights the toughest no doubt about it
they march you in naked as the day youre born fresh from a bible reading skin burning and half blind from that delousing shit they throw on you
red watches from his cell arms slung over the crossbars cigarette dangling from his fingers
and when they put you in that cell when those bars slam home thats when you know its for real
old life blown away in the blink of an eye
a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead
nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it
red listens to the clanging below
he watches andy and a few others being brought up to the nd tier
most new fish come close to madness the first night
somebody always breaks down crying
happens every time
the only question is whos it gonna be
andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier
its as good a thing to bet on as any i guess
i had my money on andy dufresne
the bars slam home
andy is alone in his cell clutching his clothes
he gazes around at his new surroundings taking it in
he slowly begins to dress himself
a malignant stone growth on the maine landscape
the moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky
the headlight of a passing train cuts through the night
red lies on his bunk below us tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again
he pauses listening
footsteps approach below unhurried echoing hollowly on stone
a cellblock guard strolls into frame
thats lights out
good night ladies
the lights bump off in sequence
the guard exits footsteps echoing away
camera cranes up the tiers toward reds cell
i remember my first night
seems a long time ago now
red looms from the darkness leans on the bars
from somewhere below comes faint ghastly tittering
voices drift through the cellblock taunting fishee fishee fisheeee
youre gonna like it here new fish
a whooole lot
make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies
you takin this down new fish
gonna be a quiz later
somebody laughs sshhh
keep it down
the screwsll hear
fishee fishee fisheeee
the boys always go fishin with first timers
and they dont quit till they reel someone in
the voices keep on sly and creepy in the dark
thru thru g
while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells
one man paces like a caged animal
another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody
a third is weeping silently
a fourth is dry heaving into the toilet
red waits at the bars
he cranes his head peers down toward andys cell
not a peep
oh faaaat ass
talk to me boy
i know youre in there
i can hear you breathin
now dont you listen to these nitwits hear
fat ass is crying trying not to hyperventilate
this aint such a bad place
ill introduce you around make you feel right at home
i know some big ol bull queers whod love to make your acquaintance
especially that big white mushy butt of yours
and thats it
fat ass lets out a loud wail of despair the place goes nuts
fat ass throws himself screaming against the bars
the entire block starts chanting fresh fish
i had your mother
she wasnt that great
the lights bump on
guards pour in led by hadley himself
what the christ is this happy shit
he took the lords name in vain
im tellin the warden
to the unseen wit youll be tellin him with my baton up your ass
hadley arrives at fat ass cell bellowing through the bars whats your malfunction you fat fuckin barrel of monkey spunk
i aint gonna count to three
not even to one
now shut the fuck up fore i sing you a lullabye
fat ass keeps blubbering and wailing
total freak out
hadley draws his baton gestures to his men
a guard unlocks the cell
hadley pulls fat ass out and starts beating him with the baton brutally raining blows
fat ass falls tries to crawl
the place goes dead silent
all we hear now is the dull thwack thwack thwack of the baton
fat ass passes out
hadley gets in a few more licks and finally stops
get this tub of shit down to the infirmary
peers around if i hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night by god and sonny jesus youll all visit the infirmary
every last motherfucker here
the guards wrestle fat ass onto a stretcher and carry him off
footsteps echo away
red stares through the bars at the main floor below eyes riveted to the small puddle of blood where fat ass went down
his first night in the joint andy dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes
he never made a sound
the master locks are thrown ka thump
the cons step from their cells lining the tiers
the guards holler their head counts to the head bull who jots on a clipboard
red peers at andy checking him out
andy stands in line collar buttoned hair combed
andy goes through the breakfast line gets a scoop of glop on his tray
we pan andy through the noise and confusion
and discover bogs diamond and rooster macbride watching andy go by
bogs sizes andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye mutters something to rooster
andy finds a table occupied by red and his regulars chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting
ignoring their stares he picks up his spoon and pauses seeing something in his food
he carefully fishes it out with his fingers
its a squirming maggot
andy grimaces unsure what to do with it
brooks hatlen is sitting closest to andy
at age hes a senior citizen a long standing resident
you gonna eat that
hadnt planned on it
andy passes the maggot to brooks
brooks examines it rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar
andy is riveted with apprehension
nice and ripe
andy cant bear to watch
brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket
andy breathes a sigh of relief
jake says thanks
fell out of his nest over by the plate shop
im lookin after him till hes old enough to fly
andy nods proceeds to eat
oh christ here he comes
its a fine mornin
you know why its fine
heywood plops his tray down sits
the men start pulling out cigarettes and handing them down
thats right send em all down
i wanna see em lined up in a row pretty as a chorus line
an impressive pile forms
heywood bends down and inhales deeply smelling the aroma
smell my ass
terrible shame your horse comin in last and all
hell i sure do love that horse of mine
i believe i owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when i see him
give him somea your cigarettes instead cheap bastard
say tyrell you pull infirmary duty this week
hows that winnin horse of mine anyway
the men fall silent hadley busted his head pretty good
doc already went home for the night
poor bastard lay there till this morning
he shakes his head turns back to his food
the silence mounts
heywood glances around
men resume eating
softly what was his name
whatd you say
i was wondering if anyone knew his name
what the fuck you care new fish
resumes eating doesnt matter what his fuckin name was
a deafening noise of industrial washers and presses
andy works the laundry line
a nightmarish job
hes new at it
bob the con foreman elbows him aside and shows him how its done
shower heads mounted in bare concrete
andy showers with a dozen or more men
no modesty here
at least the water is good and hot soothing his tortured muscles
bogs looms from the billowing steam smiling checking andy up and down
rooster and pete appear from the sides
youre some sweet punk
you been broke in yet
andy tries to step past them
he gets shoved around nothing serious just some slap and tickle
jackals sizing up prey
hard to get
i like that
andy breaks free flushed and shaking
he hurries off leaving the three sisters laughing
andy lies staring at the darkness unable to sleep
red plays catch with heywood and jigger lazily tossing a baseball around
red notices andy off to the side
andy takes this as a cue to amble over
heywood and jigger pause watching
offers his hand hello
im andy dufresne
red glances at the hand ignores it
the game continues
the wife killin banker
how do you know that
i keep my ear to the ground
whyd you do it
i didnt since you ask
hell youll fit right in then
off andys look everyones innocent in here dont you know that
what are you in for boy
didnt do it
lawyer fucked me
red gives andy a look
what else have you heard
people say youre a cold fish
they say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary
what do you think
aint made up my mind yet
heywood nudges jigger
he winds up and throws the ball hard right at andys head
andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye whirls and catches it
he sends the ball right back zinging it into heywoods hands
heywood drops the ball and grimaces wringing his stung hands
i understand youre a man who knows how to get things
im known to locate certain things from time to time
they seem to fall into my hands
maybe its cause im irish
i wonder if you could get me a rock hammer
what is it and why
you make your customers motives a part of your business
if you wanted a toothbrush i wouldnt ask questions
id just quote a price
a toothbrush see is a non lethal sort of object
a rock hammer is about eight or nine inches long
looks like a miniature pickaxe with a small sharp pick on one end and a blunt hammerhead on the other
its for rocks
andy squats motions red to join him
andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands
he finds a pebble and rubs it clean
it has a nice milky glow
he tosses it to red
theres some graded limestone from when they cut this place out of the hill
im a rockhound
at least i was in my old life
id like to be again on a limited scale
yeah that or maybe plant your toy in somebodys skull
i have no enemies here
red flicks his gaze past andy
bogs is watching them
word gets around
the sisters have taken a real shine to you yes they have
tell me something
would it help if i explained to them im not homosexual
neither are they
you have to be human first
they dont qualify
off andys look bull queers take by force thats all they want or understand
id grow eyes in the back of my head if i were you
thanks for the advice
that comes free
but you understand my concern
if theres trouble i doubt a rock hammer will do me any good
then i guess you wanna escape
tunnel under the wall maybe
andy laughs politely i miss the joke
whats so funny
youll know when you see the rock hammer
whats this item usually go for
seven dollars in any rock and gem shop
my standard mark ups twenty percent but were talkin about a special object
risk goes up price goes up
call it ten bucks even
ten it is
ill see what i can do
rises slapping dust but its a waste of money
folks who run this place love surprise inspections
they turn a blind eye to some things but not a gadget like that
theyll find it and youll lose it
mention my name well never do business again
not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum
thank you mr
the names red
pleasure doing business with you
andy strolls off
red watches him go
i could see why some of the boys took him for snobby
he had a quiet way about him a walk and a talk that just wasnt normal around here
like a man in a park without a care or worry
like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place
resumes playing catch yes i think it would be fair to say i liked andy from the start
red gets his breakfast and heads for a table
andy falls in step slips him a tightly folded square of paper
lying on his bunk red unfolds the square
a ten dollar bill
he was a man who adapted fast
under watchful supervision cons are off loading bags of dirty laundry from an eliot nursing home truck
years later i found out hed brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars
a certain bag hits the ground
the truck driver shoots a look at a black con leonard then ambles over to a guard to shoot the shit
leonard loads the bag onto a cart
bags are being unloaded
we find leonard working the line
when they check you into this hotel one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works just to make sure youre not carrying anything
but a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there
leonard slips a small paper wrapped package out of the laundry bag hides it under his apron and keeps sorting
l int prison laundry exchange day red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out
thats how andy joined our happy little shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person
leonard catches reds eye turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets
he hands it across to red and more than clean laundry changes hands
two packs of cigarettes slide out of reds hand into leonards
red slips the package out of his sheets carefully checks to make sure nobodys coming then rips it open
he pulls out the rock hammer
its just as andy described
red laughs softly
andy was right
i finally got the joke
it would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these
brooks hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell
the rolling library
he finds red waiting for him
red slips the rock hammer wrapped in a towel through the bars and onto the cart
next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage
brooks nods never missing a beat
he rolls his cart to andys cell mutters through the bars middle shelf wrapped in a towel
andys hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear
the hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes
brooks turns his cart around and goes back
he pauses sorting his books long enough for red to snag the slip of paper
brooks continues on scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket
red unfolds the slip of paper
penciled neatly on it is a single word thanks
we are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line
andy is doing his job getting good at it
he leaves the line weaving his way through the laundry room and into a dark tangled maze of rooms and corridors boilers and furnaces sump pumps old washing machines pallets
of cleaning supplies and detergents you name it
andy hefts a cardboard drum of hexlite off the stack turns around and finds bogs diamond in the aisle
blocking his way
rooster looms from the shadows to his right pete verness on the left
a frozen beat
andy slams the hexlite to the floor rips off the top and scoops out a double handful
you get this in your eyes it blinds you
andy backs up holding them at bay trying to maneuver through the maze
the sisters keep coming tense and guarded eyes riveted and gauging his every move trying to outflank him
andy trips on some old gaint sugglies
thats all it takes
theyre on him in an instant kicking and stomping
andy gets yanked to his feet
bogs applies a chokehold from behind
they propel him across the room and slam him against an old four pocket machine bending him over it
rooster jams a rag into andys mouth and secures it with a steel pipe like a horse bit
andy kicks and struggles but rooster and pete have his arms firmly pinned
bogs whispers in andys ear thats it fight
better that way
andy starts screaming muffled by the rag
camera pulls back slowly widening
the big washex blocks our view
all we see is andys screaming face and the men holding him down
and camera drifts from the room leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind
moving up empty corridors past concrete walls and steel pipes
i wish i could tell you that andy fought the good fight and the sisters let him be
i wish i could tell you that but prison is no fairy tale world
we emerge into the prison laundry past a guard widening for a final view of the line
the giant steel mangler is slapping down in brutal rhythm
the sound is deafening
he never said who did it
but we all knew
prison montage through shaping his rocks after lights out
things went on like that for a while
prison life consists of routine and then more routine
every so often andy would show up with fresh bruises
the sisters kept at him
sometimes he was able to fight them off
wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors
he always fought thats what i remember
he fought because he knew if he didnt fight it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time
the rake connects snapping off over somebodys skull
they beat the hell out of him
half the time it landed him in the infirmary
a stone closet
no bed sink or lights
just a toilet with no seat
andy sits on bare concrete bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door
the other half it landed him in solitary
warden nortons grain drain vacation
bread water and all the privacy you could want
andy is working the line
and thats how it went for andy
that was his routine
i do believe those first two years were the worst for him
and i also believe if things had gone on that way this place would have got the best of him
but then in the spring of the powers that be decided that
warden norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn the roof of the license plate factory needs resurfacing
i need a dozen volunteers for a weeks work
were gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here
red glances around at his friends
andy also catches his eye
it was outdoor detail and may is one damn fine month to be workin outdoors
cons shuffle past dropping slips of paper into a bucket
more than a hundred men volunteered for the job
red saunters to a guard named tim youngblood mutters discreetly in his ear
youngblood is pulling names and reading them off
red exchanges grins with andy and the others
wouldnt you know it
me and some fellas i know were among the names called
red slips youngblood six packs of cigarettes
only cost us a pack of smokes per man
i made my usual twenty percent of course
a tar cooker bubbles and smokes
two cons dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle
the rope goes taught
camera follows the bucket of tar up the side of the building to where it is relayed to the work detail
the men are dipping big padd brushes and spreading the tar
anglz over to byron hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from texas and he says byron hadley
i say yeah
he says sorry to inform you but your brother just died
sorry to hear that
he was an asshole
run off years ago family aint heard of him since
figured him for dead anyway
so this lawyer prick says your brother died a rich man
oil wells and shit close to a million bucks
jesus its frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get
a million bucks

thats what he left me
holy shit thats great
like winnin a lottery
off hadleys shitty look aint it

maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with
then what happens

repairs and maintenance
goddamn kids pesterin you to take em for a ride
and drive it if theyre old enough
thats right wanting to drive it wanting to learn on it fchrissake
then at the end of the year if you figured the tax wrong they make you pay out of your own pocket
uncle sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till its purple
always get the short end
thats a fact
spits over the side some brother
the prisoners keep spreading tar eyes on their work
what terrible fuckin luck
imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars
some folks got it awful bad
red glances over and is shocked to see andy standing up listening to the guards talk
hey you nuts
keep your eyes on your pail
andy tosses his padd in the bucket and strolls toward hadley
whats he doing
gettin himself killed
god damn it
just keep spreadin tar
the guards stiffen at andys approach
youngbloods hand goes to his holster
the tower guards click clack their rifle bolts
hadley turns stupefied to find andy there
do you trust your wife
youre gonna look funnier suckin my dick with no fuckin teeth
what i mean is do you think shed go behind your back
try to hamstring you
step aside mert
this fuckers havin hisself an accident
hadley grabs andys collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof
the cons furiously keep spreading tar
oh god hes gonna do it hes gonna throw him off the roof
oh shit oh fuck oh jesus
because if you do trust her theres no reason in the world you cant keep every cent of that money
hadley abruptly jerks andy to a stop right at the edge
in fact andys past the edge beyond his balance shoetips scraping the roof
the only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is hadleys grip on the front of his shirt
you better start making sense
if you want to keep that money all of it just give it to your wife
see the irs allows you a one time only gift to your spouse
its good up to sixty thousand dollars
naw that aint right
irs cant touch one cent
the cons are pausing work stunned by this business discussion
youre the smart banker what shot his wife
why should i believe a smart banker like you
sos i can wind up in here with you
its perfectly legal
go ask the irs theyll say the same thing
actually i feel silly telling you all this
im sure you would have investigated the matter yourself
i dont need no smart wife killin banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat
of course not
but you will need somebody to set up the tax free gift and thatll cost you
a lawyer for example
ambulance chaaing highway robbing cocksuckers
or come to think of it i suppose i could set it up for you
that would save you some money
ill write down the forms you need you can pick them up and ill prepare them for your signature
nearly free of charge
off hadleys look id only ask three beers apiece for my co workers if that seems fair
guffawing co workers
thats rich aint it
hadley freezes him with a look
andy presses on i think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds
thats only my opinion
the convicts stand gaping all pretense of work gone
they look like theyve been pole axed
hadley shoots them a look
what are you jimmies starin at
back to work goddamn it
as before an object is hauled up the side of the building by rope only this time its a cooler of beer and ice
and thats how it came to pass that on the second to last day of the job the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of
the cons are taking the sun and drinking beer
wound up sitting in a row at ten oclock in the morning drinking icy cold black label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at shawshank
drink up boys
while its cold
the colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous
red knocks back another sip enjoying the bitter cold on his tongue and the warm sun on face
we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men
we coulda been tarring the roof of one of our own houses
we were the lords of all creation
he glances over to andy squatting apart from the others
as for andy he spent that break hunkered in the shade a strange little smile on his face watching us drink his beer
approaches with a beer heres a cold one andy
i gave up drinking
heywood drifts back to others giving them a look
you could argue hed done it to curry favor with the guards
or maybe make a few friends among us cons
me i think he did it just to feel normal again
if only for a short while
andy and red play checkers
red makes his move
now theres a game of kings
and totally fuckin inexplicable
hate that game
maybe youll let me teach you someday
ive been thinking of getting a board together
you come to the right place
im the man who can get things
we might do business on a board
but the pieces id like to carve those myself
one side done in quartz
the opposing side in limestone
thatd take you years
years ive got
what i dont have are the rocks
pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim
hows that rock hammer workin out anyway
scratch your name on your wall yet
smiles not yet
i suppose i should
i guess were gettin to be friends aint we
i suppose we are
i ask a question
whyd you do it
im innocent remember
just like everybody else here
red takes this as a gentle rebuff keeps playing
what are you in for red
same as you
the only guilty man in shawshank
andy lies in his bunk after lights out polishing a fragment of quartz by the light of the moon
he pauses glancing at all the names scratched in the wall
he rises makes sure the coast is clear and starts scratching his name into the cement with his rock hammer adding to the record
fills the screen in glorious and scratchy black white suffering a bad case of dts
while a convict audience hoots and catcalls talking back to the screen
we find red slouched in a folding chair watching the movie
andy enters backlit by the flickering glare of the projector and takes a seat next to him
heres the good part
bugs come out of the walls to get his ass
ive seen it three times this month already
ray milland starts screaming
the entire audience screams with him high pitched and hysterical
can we talk business
what do you want
can you get her
take a few weeks
dont have her stuffed down my pants this very moment sorry to say
what are you so nervous about
shes just a woman
andy nods embarrassed
he gets up and hurries out
red grins turns back to the movie
andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks
two dark figures loom in the corridor blocking his path
rooster and pete
andy turns back and runs right into bogs
instant bear hug
the sisters are on him like a flash
they kick a door open and drag him into where they confront the startled projectionist an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals
take a walk
i have to change reels
i said fuck off
terrified the old man darts past and out the door
pete slams and locks it
bogs shoves andy to the center of the room
ive seen it three times this month already
ray milland starts screaming
the entire audience screams witt him high pitched and hysterical
can we talk business
what do you want
can you get her
take a few weeks
dont have her stuffed down my pants this very moment sorry to say
what are you so nervous about
shes just a woman
andy nods embarrassed
he gets up and hurries out
red grins turns back to the movie
andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks
two dark figures loom in the corridor blocking his path
rooster and pete
andy turns back and runs right into bogs
instant bear hug
the sisters are on him like a flash
they kick a door open and drag him into where they confront the startled projectionist an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals
take a walk
i have to change reels
i said fuck off
terrified the old man darts past and out the door
pete slams and locks it
bogs shoves andy to the center of the room
aint you gonna scream
andy sighs cocks his head at the projector
theyd never hear me over that
lets get this over with
seemingly resigned andy turns around leans on the rewind bench and curls his fingers around a full
foot reel of mm film
rooster licks his lips pushes past the others
andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc smashing it into roosters face and bouncing him off the wall
he broke my nose
andy fights like hell but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees
bogs steps to andy pulls out an awl with a vicious eight inch spike gives him a good long look at it
now im gonna open my fly and youre gonna swallow what i give you to swallow
and when you d mine you gonna swallow roosters
you done broke his nose so he ought to have somethin to show for it
anything you put in my mouth youre going to lose
you dont understand
you do that ill put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear
but you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down
faint smile in fact i understand the bite reflex is so strong the victims jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar
the sisters consider this carefully
the film runs out of the projector flapping on the reel
the screen goes white
you little fuck
andy gets a bootheel in the face
the sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on
in the theater the convicts are chanting and clapping for the movie to come back on
bogs didnt put anything in andys mouth and neither did his friends
what they did do is beat him within an inch of his life
andy lies wrapped in bandages
andy spent a month in traction
bogs spent a week in the hole
bogs sits on bare concrete
the steel door slides open
times up bogs
bogs comes up the stairs smoking a cigarette
not many cons around the place is virtually deserted
a voice echoes dimly over the p
system return to your cellblocks for evening count
bogs enters his cell
dark in here
he fumbles for the light cord yanks it
the sudden light reveals captain hadley six inches from his face waiting for him
mert steps in behind bogs
before bogs can even open his mouth to say what the fuck hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus
bogs doubles over gagging his wind out
ernie comes slowly around the corner rolling a steel mop cart loaded with supplies
red is darning a sock in his open cell
he pauses frowning hearing strange thumping sounds
what the hell is that
its hadley and mert methodically and brutally pulping bogs with their batons and kicking the shit out of him for good measure
he feebly tries to ward them off
puzzled red steps from his cell following the sound
it dawns on him that its coming from above
he moves to the railing and leans out craning around to look up just as bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing directly toward us eyes bugging out screaming
as he falls
jumps back as bogs plummets past missing him by inches arms swimming and trying to grab the railing but missing that too screaming aaaaalll the way down and impacting on
ernies gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers
the cart is squashed flat shooting out from under bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink kicking up sparks for thirty yards
ernie is left gaping in shock at bogs and all the bogs related wreckage at his feet
red is stunned
he very tentatively leans out and looks up
above him hadley and mert lean on the rd tier railing
hadley tilts the cap back on his head shakes his head
poor fella musta tripped
a tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of hadleys shoe and splashes across reds upturned cheek
he wipes it off then looks down at bogs
cons and guards are racing to the scene
two things never happened again after that
the sisters never laid a finger on andy again
bogs wheelchair bound and wearing a neck brace is loaded onto an ambulance for transport
behind the fence stand red and his friends watching
and bogs never walked again
they transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate
to my knowledge he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw
im thinkin andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary
sounds good to us
figure we owe him for the beer
man likes to play chess
lets get him some rocks
a hundred cons at work
hoes rise and fall in long waves
guards patrol on horseback
heywood turns up a rocky chunk quickly shoves it down his pants
he maneuvers to red and the others pulls out the chunk and shows it to them
that aint quartz
what are you fuckin geologist
hes right it aint
what the hell is it then
no horse shit
cackling the men go back to work
heywood stares at the rock
he crumbles it in his hands
despite a few hitches the boys came through in fine style
a huge detergent box is filled with rocks hidden in the shadows behind a boiler furnace
and by the week andy was due back we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture
angle shifts to red as he plops a bag of laundry on the floor
leonard and bob toss a few more down
red starts pulling out contraband giving them their commissions
also got a big shipment in that week
cigarettes chewing gum shoelaces playing cards with naked ladies on em you name it
pulls a cardboard tube and of course the most important item
andy limping a bit returns from the infirmary
red watches from his cell as andy is brought up and locked away
andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk
the lights go off
andy opens the tube and pulls out a large rolled poster
he lets it uncurl to the floor
a small scrap of paper flutters out landing at his feet
the poster is the famous rita hayworth pin up one hand behind her head eyes half closed sulky lips parted
andy picks up the scrap of paper
it reads no charge
alone in the dark andy smiles
the buzzer sounds the cells slam open
cons step from their cells
andy catches reds eye nods his thanks
as the men shuffle down to breakfast red glances into andys cell and sees rita in her new place of honor on andys wall
sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face
ernie is mopping the floor
he glances back and sees warden norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a dozen guards
still mopping ernie mutters to the nearest cell heads up
theyre tossin cells
word travels fast from cell to cell
cons scramble to tidy up and hide things
norton enters nods to his men
the guards pair off in all directions making their choices at random
what kinda contraband you hiding in there boy
cells are opened occupants displaced items scattered mattresses overturned
whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor
mostly harmless stuff
a guard pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress shoots a nasty look at the con responsible
make sure he takes his bible
too goddamn dark to read down there
add another week for blasphemy
the man is taken away
nortons gaze goes up
lets try the second tier
norton arrives makes a thin show of picking a cell at random
he motions at andy on his bunk reading his bible
the door is unlocked
norton enters trailed by his men
norton gives a curt nod
hadley and trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search
norton keeps his eyes on andy looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink
he takes the bible out of andys hand
im pleased to see you reading this
any favorite passages
watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh
ive always liked that one
strolls the cell but i prefer i am the light of the world
he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
i hear youre good with numbers
a man should have a skill
you wanna explain this
andy glances over
hadley is holding up a rock blanket a polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt
its called a rock blanket
its for shaping and polishing rocks
little hobby of mine
hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill turns to norton
looks pretty clean
some contraband here nothing to get in a twist over
norton nods strolls to the poster of rita
i cant say i approve of this
turns to andy but i suppose exceptions can always be made
norton exits the guards follow
the cell door is slammed and locked
norton pauses turns back
i almost forgot
he reaches through the bars and returns the bible to andy
id hate to deprive you of this
salvation lies within
norton and his men walk away
tossin cells was just an excuse
truth is norton wanted to size andy up
andy is working the line
hadley enters and confers briefly with bob
bob nods crosses to andy taps him
andy turns removes an earplug
bob shouts over the machine noise andy is led in
norton is at his desk doing paperwork
andys eyes go to a framed needle point sampler on the wall behind him that reads his judgment cometh and that right soon
my wife made that in church group
its very pretty sir
you like working in the laundry
perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education
a series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing cabinets desks paint supplies etc
he hears a flutter of wings
an adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and struts back and forth checking him out
brooks hatlen pokes his head out of the back room
thought i heard you out here
ive been reassigned to you
i know they told me
aint that a kick in the ass
come on in ill give you the dime tour
brooks leads andy into the bleakest back room of all
rough plank shelves are lined with books
brooks private domain
here she is the shawshank prison library
along this side we got the national geographics
that side the readers digest condensed books
bottom shelf there some louis lamours and erle stanley gardners
every night i pile the cart and make my rounds
i write down the names on this clipboard here
well thats it
easy peasy japanesey
something about this doesnt make any sense
how long have you been librarian
yuh over years
in all that time have you ever had an assistant
never needed one
not much to it is there
so why now
be nice to have some compny down here for a change
another guard a huge fellow named dekins
thats the one
dekins approaches andy ominously
andy stands his ground waiting for whatever comes next
finally im dekins
i been uh thinkin bout maybe settin up some kinda trust fund for my kids educations
andy covers his surprise
glances at brooks
why dont we have a seat and talk it over
pull down onea them desks there
andy and dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the floor
they find chairs and settle in
brooks returns with a tablet of paper and a pen slides them before andy
what did you have in mind
a weekly draw on your pay
i figured just stick it in the bank but captain hadley said check with you first
he was right
you dont want your money in a bank
whats that gonna earn you
two and a half three percent a year
we can do a lot better than that
wets his pen so tell me mr
where do you want to send your kids
he didnt say that
god is my witness
and dekins he just blinks for a second then laughs his ass off
afterward he actually shook andys hand
shook his fuckin hand
just about shit myself
all andy needed was a suit and tie a jiggly little hula girl on his desk he woulda been mister dufresne if you please
makin yourself some friends andy
i wouldnt say friends
im a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning
thats a wonderful pet to have
got you out of the laundry didnt it
maybe it can do more than that
off their looks how about expanding the library
get some new books in there
how you spect to do that mr
dufresne if you please
ask the warden for funds
laughter all around
andy blinks at them
son ive had six wardens through here during my tenure and i have learned one great immutable truth of the universe aint one of em been born whose asshole dont
pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds
dollying norton and andy up the hall not a dime
my budgets stretched thin as it is
perhaps i could write to the state senate and request funds directly from them
far as them republican boys in augusta are concerned theres only three ways to spend the taxpayers hard earned when it come to prisons
still id like to try with your permission
ill send a letter a week
they cant ignore me forever
they sure can but you write your letters if it makes you happy
ill even mail em for you hows that
andy is on his bunk writing a letter
so andy started writing a letter a week just like he said
andy pops his head in
the guard shakes his head
and just like norton said andy got no answers
but still he kept on
andy is doing taxes
mert entwhistle is seated across from him
other off duty guards are waiting their turn
the following april andy did tax returns for half the guards at shawshank
tax time again
even more guards are waiting
year after that he did them all
including the wardens
a batter in a noresby marauders baseball uniform whacks the ball high into left field and races for first
year after that they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season
the batter sits across from andy
the line winds out the door
the guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their w s
moresby prison issued you that gun but you actually had to pay for it
damn right and the holster too
see thats all deductible
you get to write that off
yes sir andy was a regular h r block
in fact he got so busy at tax time he was allowed a staff
angle shifts to reveal red and brooks doing filing chores
say red could you hand me a stack of those s
got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year and that was fine by me
andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack
and still he kept sending those letters
andys in his bunk polishing a four inch length of quartz
its a beautifully crafted chess piece in the shape of a horses head poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone
he puts the knight on a chess board by his bed adding it to four pieces already there a king a queen and two bishops
he turns to rita
moonlight casts bars across her face
floyd runs into the yard scared and winded
he finds andy and red on the bleachers
floyd rushes in with andy and red at his heels
they find jigger and snooze trying to calm brooks who has heywood in a chokehold and a knife to his throat
heywood is terrified
cmon brooksie why dont you just calm the fuck down okay
goddamn miserable puke eatin sons of whores
he kicks a table over
tax files explode through the air
what the hells going on
you tell me man
one second he was fine then out came the knife
i better get the guards
well handle this
aint that right brooks
just settle down and well talk about it okay
nothing left to talk about
its all talked out
nothing left now but to cut his fuckin throat
whats heywood done to you
thats what they want
its the price i gotta pay
andy steps forward rivets brooks with a gaze
softly brooks youre not going to hurt heywood we all know that
even heywood knows it right heywood
nods terrified sure
i know that
ask anyone theyll tell you
brooks hatlen is a reasonable man
cuing nods all around yeah thats right
thats what everybody says
youre not fooling anybody so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people
but its the only way theyll let me stay
brooks bursts into tears
the storm is over
heywood staggers free gasping for air
andy takes the knife passes it to red
brooks dissolves into andys arms with great heaving sobs
take it easy
youll be all right
what about me
crazy old fool
goddamn near slit my throat
youve had worse from shaving
whatd you do to set him off
just came in to say fare thee well
off their looks aint you heard
his parole came through
red and andy exchange a surprised look
andy wants to understand
red just motions to let it be for now
he puts his arm around brooks who sobs inconsolably
softly aint that bad old hoss
wont be long till youre squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling em lies
i just dont understand what happened in there thats all
old mans crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse is what
aint nothing wrong with brooksie
hes just institutionalized thats all
institutionalized my ass
mans been here fifty years
this place is all he knows
in here hes an important man an educated man
out there hes nothing but a used up old con with arthritis in both hands
couldnt even get a library card if he applied
you see what im saying
red i do believe youre talking out of your ass
believe what you want
these walls are funny
first you hate em then you get used to em
after long enough you get so you depend on em
i could never get that way
softly say that when you been inside as long as brooks has
they send you here for life and thats just what they take
part that counts anyway
the sun rises over gray stone
angle on rita poster
sexy as ever
the rising sun sends fingers of rosy light creeping across her face
brooks stands on a chair poised at the bars of a window cradling jake in his hands
i cant take care of you no more
you go on now
he tosses jake through the bars
the crow flaps away
two short siren blasts herald the opening of the gate
it swings hugely open revealing brooks standing in his cheap suit carrying a cheap bag wearing a cheap hat
brooks walks out tears streaming down his face
he looks back
red andy and others stand at the inner fence seeing him off
the massive gate closes wiping them from view
brooks is riding the bus clutching the seat before him gripped by terror of speed and motion
i cant believe how fast things move on the outside
brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his parents
people and traffic a blur
i saw an automobile once when i was young
now theyre everywhere
brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk
he glances up as a prop driven airliner streaks in low overhead
the world went and got itself in a big damn hurry
he arrives at the brewster
it aint much to look at
a woman leads brooks up the stairs toward the top floor
he has trouble climbing so many stairs
no music in your room after eight p
no guests after nine
no cooking except on the hotplate
people even talk faster
the room is small old dingy
heavy wooden beams cross the ceiling
an arched window affords a view of congress street
traffic noise drifts in
brooks sets his bag down
he doesnt quite know what to do
he just stands there like a man waiting for a bus
the parole board got me into this halfway house called the brewster and a job bagging groceries at the foodway
jangling with people and noise
brooks is bagging groceries
registers are humming kids are shrieking
make sure he double bags
last time your man didnt double bag and the bottom near came out
you double bag like the lady says understand
yes sir double bag surely will
its hard work
i try to keep up but my hands hurt most of the time
i dont think the store manager likes me very much
brooks sits alone on a bench feeding pigeons
sometimes after work i go to the park and feed the birds
i keep thinking jake might show up and say hello but he never does
i hope wherever he is hes doing okay and making new friends
brooks wakes up
somewhere in the night a loud argument is taking place
i have trouble sleeping at night
the bed is too big
i have bad dreams like im falling
i wake up scared
sometimes it takes me a while to remember where i am
maybe i should get me a gun and rob the foodway so theyd send me home
i could shoot the manager while i was at it sort of like a bonus
brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag
undershirts socks etc
but i guess im too old for that sort of nonsense anymore
brooks is dressed in his suit
he finishes knotting his tie puts his hat on his head
the letter lies on the desk stampe and ready for mailing
his bag is by the door
i dont like it here
im tired of being afraid all the time
ive decided not to stay
he takes one last look around
only one thing left to do
he steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room pulls out s pocketknife and glances up at the ceiling beam
he steps up onto the chair
it wobbles queasily
now facing the beam he carves a message into the wood brooks hatlen was here
he smiles with a sort of inner peace
i doubt theyll kick up any fuss
not for an old crook like me
his weight shifts on the wobbly chair and it goes out from under him
his feet remain where they are kicking feebly in mid air
his hat falls to the floor
brooks has hanged himself
he swings gently facing the open window
traffic noise floats up from below
andy reads the letter to red and the others p
tell heywood im sorry i put a knife to his throat
no hard feelings
a long silence
andy folds the letter puts it away
softly he shoulda died in here goddamn it
andy is sorting books on the cart
he replaces a stack on the shelf and pauses noticing a line of ants crawling up the wood
he glances up
the ants disappear over the top
he pulls a chair over and stands on it peers cautiously over
red steps in with an armload of files
andy gingerly reaches in grabs a black feathered wing and pulls out a dead crow
softly is that jake
red is making something at his bench sanding and planing
it never would have occurred to us if not for andy
it was his idea
we all agreed it was the right thing to do
low hilly terrain all around
a hundred cons are at work in the fields
guards patrol with carbines keeping a sharp eye
we find andy red and the boys working with picks and shovels
they glance over to the pickup truck
hadleys chewing the fat with mert and youngblood
a whistle blows
the work stops
cons head for the pickup truck where water is dispensed with dipper and pail
red and the boys look to andy
nows the time
the group moves off through the confusion using it as cover
they head up the slope of a nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot
the guards havent noticed
jigger and floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth quickly ripping out a hole
red reaches into his jacket and pulls out a beautiful wooden box carefully stained and varnished
he shows it around to nods of approval
thats real pretty red
shovel man in
watch the dirt
heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole
youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope
what the fuck
follows his gaze works his rifle bolt suddenly other cons start breaking away in groups dozens of them heading toward the slope
the guards look around
what am i talkin to myself
andy pulls a towel wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it
andy lays him in the box followed by brooks letter
red places the casket in the hole
a moment of silence
andy gives red with an encouraging nod
brooks was a sinner
jake was just a crow
neither was much to look at
both got institutionalized
see what you can do for em
muttered amens all around
the boys shovel dirt onto the small grave and tamp it down
rapid dolly with hadley
hes striding pissed off a man on e mission
he straight arms a door and emerges onto the wall overlooking the exercise yard
he leans on the railing scans the yard sees andy chatting with red
what the fuck did you do
andy looks up your ass wardens office now
andy shoots a worried look at red then heads off
dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor
wiley the duty guard picks through them
hadley enters trailed by andy
what is all this
you tell me fuck stick
theyre addressed to you every damn one
wiley thrusts an envelope at andy
andy just stares at it
well take it
andy takes the envelope pulls out a letter reads dear mr
in response to your repeated inquiries the state senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project
stunned examines check this is two hundred dollars
hadley glares at him
the grin vanishes
in addition the library district has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries
we trust this will fill your needs
we now consider the matter closed
please stop sending us letters
yours truly the state comptrollers office
andy gazes around at the boxes
the riches of the world lay at his feet
his eyes mist with emotion at the sight
i want all this cleared out before the warden gets back i shit you not
andy touches the boxes like a love struck man touching a beautiful woman
good for you andy
only took six years
beat from now on i send two letters a week instead of one
laughs shakes his head i believe youre crazy enough
you better get this stuff downstairs like the captain said
im gonna go pinch a loaf
when i get back this is all gone right
wiley disappears into the toilet jughead comix in hand
alone now andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food
he doesnt know where to turn first
he gets giddy ripping boxes open and pulling out books touching them smelling them
he rips open another box
this one contains an old phonograph player industrial gray and green the words portland public school district stenciled on the side
the box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums
andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them
used nat king coles bing crosbys etc
he comes across a certain album mozarts le nozze de figaro
he pulls it from the stack gazing upon it as a man transfixed
it is a thing of beauty
it is the grail
wiley sits in one of the stalls jughead comic on his knees
andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards desk sweeping things onto the floor in his haste
he plugs the machine in
a red light warms up
the platter starts spinning
he slides the mozart album from its sleeve lays it on the platter and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut
the needle hisses in the groove
and the music begins lilting and gorgeous
andy sinks into wileys chair overcome by its beauty
it is deutino che soave zeffiretto a duet sung by susanna and the contessa
wiley pauses reading puzzled
he thinks he hears music
you hear that
andy shoots a look at the bathroom
go for broke
he lunges to his feet and barricades the front door then the bathroom
he returns to the desk and positions the p
he works up his courage then flicks all the toggles to on
a squeal of feedback echoes briefly
and the mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison
wiley lunges to his feet pants tangling around his ankles
cons all over the prison stop whatever theyre doing freezing in mid step to listen gazing up at the speakers
the numbing routine of prison life itself
all grinds thru just stands in place listening to the music hypnotized
andy is reclined in the chair transported arms fluidly conducting the music
ecstasy and rapture
shawshank no longer exists
it has been banished from the mind of men
camera tracks along groups of men all riveted
i have no idea to this day what them two italian ladies were singin about
truth is i dont want to know
some things are best left unsaid
i like to think they were singin about something so beautiful it cant be expressed in words and makes your heart ache because of it
camera brings us to red
i tell you those voices soared
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream
it was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away
and for the briefest of moments every last man at shawshank felt free
fast dolly with norton striding up the hallway with hadley
it pissed the warden off something terrible
norton and hadley break the door in
andy looks up with a sublime smile
we hear wiley pounding on the bathroom door low angle slow push in on the massive rust streaked steel door
god this is a terrible place to be
andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt
andy doesnt seem to mind
his arms sweep to the music still playing in his head
we hear a faint echo of the soaring duet
couldnt play somethin good huh
they broke the door down before i could take requests
was it worth two weeks in the hole
easiest time i ever did
no such thing as easy time in the hole
a week seems like a year
i had mr
mozart to keep me company
hardly felt the time at all
oh they let you tote that record player down there huh
i coulda swore they confiscated that stuff
taps his heart his head the music was here
thats the one thing they cant confiscate not ever
thats the beauty of it
havent you ever felt that way about music red
played a mean harmonica as a younger man
lost my taste for it
didnt make much sense on the inside
heres where it makes most sense
we need it so we dont forget
that there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone
that theres a small place inside of us they can never lock away and that place is called hope
hope is a dangerous thing
drive a man insane
its got no place here
better get used to the idea
softly like brooks did
slides open with an enormous clang
a stark room beyond
camera pushes through
seven humorless men sit at a long table
an empty chair faces them
we are again in red enters ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole hearing
he removes his cap and sits
man l it says here youve served thirty years of a life sentence
you feel youve been rehabilitated
yes sir without a doubt
i can say im a changed man
no danger to society thats the gods honest truth
a big rubber stamp slams down rejected
red emerges into fading daylight
andys waiting for him
same old same old
when you say it like that
you wonder where it went
i wonder where ten years went
red nods solemn
they settle in on the bleachers
andy pulls a small box from his sweater hands it to red
inside the box on a thin layer of cotton is a shiny new harmonica bright aluminum and circus red
had to go through one of your competitors
hope you dont mind
wanted it to be a surprise
its very pretty andy
you gonna play something
red considers it shakes his head
softly not today
men line the tiers as the evening count is completed
the convicts step into their cells
the master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut ka thump
andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk
the note reads a new girl for your year anniversary
from your pal
marilyn monroes face fills the screen
slow pull back reveals the new poster the famous shot from the seven year itch on the subway grate with skirt billowing up
andy sits gazing at her as lights out commences
and we find red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock
adding up the months weeks days
he regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a martian artifact
he considers trying it out even holds it briefly to his lips almost embarrassed but puts it back in its box untested
and there the harmonica will stay
we hold in blackness as thumping sounds grow louder
andy was as good as his word
he kept writing to the state senate
two letters a week instead of one
and the blackness disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes revealing a work crew with picks and sledgehammers faces obscured outlaw style with kerchiefs against the dust
behind them are guards overseeing the work
andy yanks his kerchief down grinning in exhilaration
red and the others follow suit
they step through the hole in the wall exploring what used to be a sealed off storage room
in the folks up augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldnt buy him off with just a dollar check
appropriations committee voted an annual payment of dollars just to shut him up
tracking the construction
walls have been knocked down
men are painting plastering hammering
lots of shelves going up
red is head carpenter
we find him discussing plans with andy
those checks came once a year like clockwork
red and the boys are opening boxes pulling out books
youd be amazed how far andy could stretch it
he made deals with book clubs charity groups
he bought remaindered books by the pound
i got here an auto repair manual and a book on soap carving
trade skills and hobbies those go under educational
stack right behind you
the count of monte crisco
cristo you dumbshit
by alexandree dumb ass
you boysll like that one
its about a prison break
floyd tries to take the book
heywood yanks it back
i saw it first
red shoots andy a look
maybe that should go under educational too
red is making a sign carefully routing letters into a long plank of wood
it turns out to be the varnished wood sign over the archway brooks hatlen memorial library
tilt down to reveal the library in all its completed glory shelves lined with books tables and chairs even a few potted plants
heywood is wearing headphones listening to hank williams on the record player
by the year kennedy was shot andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in new england
flashbulbs pop as norton addresses members of the press that was also the year warden norton instituted his famous inside out program
you may remember reading about it
it made all the papers and got his picture in life magazine
a genuine progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation
our inmates properly supervised will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service
cutting pulpwood repairing bridges and causeways digging storm drains
angle to red and the boys listening from behind the fence
these men can learn the value of an honest days labor while providing a valuable service to the community and at a bare minimum of expense to mr
sounds like road gangin you ask me
nobody asked you
a road gang is grading a culvert with picks
theres dust and the smell of sweat in the air
guards patrol with sniper rifles a pushy woman reporter in an ugly hat bustles up the grade trailed by a photographer
were gonna take your picture now
give us a break lady
dont you know who i am
im from life magazine
i was told id get some co operation out here
you want me to report you to your warden
is that what you want
sighs no maam
thats more like it
now i want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces
grab hold of your tools and show em to me
she turns motioning her photographer up the grade
heywood glances around at the other men
you heard the lady
heywood unzips his pants reaches inside
the others do likewise
the woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly
her legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade
were showin our tools and grinnin like fools
take the damn picture
heywood sits alone in the dark
none of the inmates were invited to express their views
a road gang is pulling stumps bogged down in mud
course norton failed to mention to the press that bare minimum of expense is a fairly loose term
there are a hundred different ways to skim off the top
men materials you name it
and oh my lord how the money rolled in
norton strolls into view with ned grimes at his heels
this keeps up youre gonna put me out of business
with this pool of slave labor you got you can underbid any contractor in town
ned were providing a valuable community service
thats fine for the papers but i got a family to feed
the state dont pay my salary
sam we go back a long way
i need this new highway contract
i dont get it i go under
thats a fact
hands him a box now you just have somea this fine pie my missus baked specially for you and you think about that
norton opens the box
alongside the pie is an envelope
he runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains
in the background a winch cable snaps and whips through the air damn near severing a mans leg
he goes down screaming in mud and blood pinned by a fallen tree stump
men rush over to help him
norton barely takes notice
ned i wouldnt worry too much over this contract
seems to me ive already got my boys committed elsewhere
you be sure and thank maisie for this fine pie
angle on maisies pie
several pieces gone
and behind every shady deal behind every dollar earned
tilt up to andy at the desk munching thoughtfully as he totals up figures on an adding machine
there was andy keeping the books
andy finishes preparing two bank deposits
norton hovers near the desk keeping a watchful eye
two deposits casco bank and new england first
night drop like always
norton pockets the envelopes
andy crosses to the wall safe and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside
norton locks the safe swings his wifes framed sampler back into place
he cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner
get my stuff down tlaundry
two suits for dry clean and a bag of whatnot
tell em if they over starch my shirts again theyre gonna hear about it from me
adjusts his tie how do i look
big charity to do up portland way
governors gonna be there
indicates pie want the rest of that
woman cant bake worth shit
andy trudges down the corridor with nortons laundry the pie box under his arm
tilt up from pie to find red munching away as he helps andy sort books on the shelves
got his fingers in a lot of pies from what i hear
what you hear isnt half of it
hes got scams you havent dreamed of
kickbacks on his kickbacks
theres a river of dirty money flowing through this place
money like that can be a problem
sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from
thats where i come in
i channel it funnel it filter it
stocks securities tax free municipals
i send that money out into the big world
and when it comes back
its clean as a virgins whistle
by the time norton retires i will have made him a millionaire
they ever catch on hes gonna wind up wearing a number himself
smiles i thought you had more faith in me than that
im sure youre good but all that paper leaves a trail
anybody gets too curious fbi irs whatever that trails gonna lead to somebody
sure it will
but not to me and certainly not to the warden
the silent silent partner
hes the guilty one your honor
the man with the bank accounts
thats where the filtering process starts
they trace it back all theyre gonna find is him
yeah okay but who the hell is he
second cousin to harvey the rabbit
off reds look i conjured him out of thin air
he doesnt exist
except on paper
you cant just make a person up
sure you can if you know how the system works and where the cracks are
its amazing what you can accomplish by mail
stevens has a birth certificate social security card drivers license
they ever track those accounts theyll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination
did i say you were good
on the outside i was an honest man
straight as an arrow
i had to come to prison to be a crook
does it ever bother you
i dont run the scams red i just process the profits
thats a fine line maybe
but ive also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas
why do you think the warden lets me do all that
to keep you happy and doing the laundry
money instead of sheets
i work cheap
thats the trade off
two siren blasts draw their attention to the main gate
it swings open revealing a prison bus waiting outside
among those on board is tommy williams a damn good looking kid in his mid s
the bus rumbles through the gate
the new fish disembark chained together single file
the old timers holler and shake the fence
a deafening gauntlet
tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering covered with delousing powder greeted by taunts and jeers
the bars slam with a steel clang
tommy and his new cellmate take in their new surroundings
aint this for shit
dollying tommy as he struts along combing his ducktail cigarette behind his ear
we definitely need the coasters or del vikings on the soundtrack here
maybe jerry lee lewis
tommy williams came to shawshank in on a two year stretch for b e
cops caught him sneakin tv sets out the back door of a jc penney
a shrieking buzzsaw slices ten foot lengths of wood
red runs the machine while some other old timers feed the wood
young punk mr
rock n roll cocky as hell
tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it its a ball busting job but the kids a blur
slapping his gloves cmon there old boys
movin like molasses
makin me look bad
the old guys just grin and shake their heads
we liked him immediately
tommy regales the old boys with his exploits so im backin out the door right
had the tv like this
mimes his grip big ol thing
couldnt see shit
suddenly heres this voice freeze kid
hands in the air
well i just stand there holdin on to that tv so the voice says you hear what i said boy
and i say yes sir i sure did
but if i drop this fuckin thing you got me on destruction of property too
the whole table falls about laughing
poker game in progress
tommy andy red and the boys
you did a stretch in cashman too
that was an easy ride let me tell you
work programs weekend furloughs
not like here
sounds like you done time all over new england
been in and out since i was
name the place chances are i been there
perhaps its time you considered a new profession
the game stalls what i mean is you dont seem to be a very good thief
maybe you should try something else
what the hell you know about it capone
what are you in for
wry glance to red everyones innocent in here
dont you know that
the tension breaks
camera travels the room
cons are waiting their turn or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield
as it turns out tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl
tommys at the end of the row phone to his ear
other side of the glass is beth near tears fussing with a baby on her lap
said we can stay with them but joeys gettin out of the service next month and they barely got enough room as it is
plus they got poppa workin double shifts and the baby cries half the night
i just dont know where were gonna go
push in on tommys face as he listens
maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy
tommy enters the strut gone from his step
a little scared
he finds andy filing library cards
whatever it was something lit a fire under that boys ass
im thinkin maybe i should try for high school equivalency
hear you helped some fellas with that
i dont waste time on losers tommy
tight i aint no goddamn loser
thats a good start
if we do this we do it all the way
one hundred percent
nothing half assed
tommy thinks about it nods
thing is see
leans in mutters i dont read all that good
youve come to the right place then
we find andy giving an impassioned reading and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore
andy slaps the book shut immensely pleased with himself
so this raven just sits there and wont go away
beat why dont that fella get hisself a gauge and dust the fucker
tommy tries to read as andy looks on the cat sh the cat shh
glances up the cat shat on the welcome mat
andy shakes his head
andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard
so andy took tommy under his wing
started walking him through his abcs
track the table to tommy and andy
discussing a book
tommy took to it pretty well too
boy found brains he never knew he had
the cat sh shh shimmied up the tree and crept st stel stealthily out on the limb
tommy intent on a paperback mouthing the words
behind him wood is piling up on the conveyor belt
after a while you couldnt pry those books out of hands
ass in gear son
youre putting us behind
tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over
tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard
andy steps in shows him how to reconstruct it
before long andy started him on his course requirements
he really liked the kid that was part of it
gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap
but that wasnt the only reason
tight angle on chessboard
most of the pieces complete
pan to andy lying in his bunk carefully polishing
prison time is slow time
sometimes it feels like stop time
so you do what you can to keep going
and we keep going past andy in a slow pan of the cell
outside the window bars we hear another train passing in the night
some fellas collect stamps
others build matchstick houses
andy built a library
now he needed a new project
tommy was it
it was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks
the same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall
still panning past a chair a sweater on a hook
and finally to the place of honor on the wall
in prison a manll do most anything to keep his mind occupied
where the latest poster turns out to be racquel welch ins fur bikini
one million years b
slow push in by
right about the time tommy was getting ready to take his exams
it was lovely racquel
tommys taking the big test
andys monitoring the time
deep silence save for tommys pencil scribbling
a few old timers are browsing the shelves sneaking looks their way
tommy tries to ignore them
andy clears his throat
tommy puts his pencil down well
its for shit
gets up in disgust wasted a whole fuckin year of my time with this bullshit
may not be as bad as you think
i didnt get a fuckin thing right
might as well be in chinese
well see how the score comes out
ill tell you how the goddamn score comes out
tommy grabs the test wads it slam dunks it into the trash
theres your goddamn score
storms out goddamn cats crawlin up trees times is fuck this place fuck it
tommy is gone
red and others stare
andy gets up pulls the test from the trash smoothes it out on the desk
tommy and red sipping cokes
i feel bad
i let him down
thats crap son
hes proud of you
proud as a hen
off tommys look we been friends a long time
i know him as good as anybody
smart fella aint he
smart as they come
used to be a banker on the outside
whats he in for anyway
the hell you say
you wouldnt think lookin at him
caught his wife in bed with some golf pro
greased em both
cmon boy back to work
red turns back
tommys coke has slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor
the kids gone white as a sheet
bare whisper oh my god
tommy sits before andy and red bout four years ago i was in thomaston on a to stretch
stole a car
dumbfuck thing to do
beat few months left to go i get a new cellmate in
big twitchy fucker
kind of roomie you pray you dont get know what im sayin
to for armed burglary
said he done hundreds of jobs
hard to believe high strung as he was
cut a loud fart hed go three feet in the air
talked all the time too thats the other thing
never shut up
places hed been jobs he pulled women he fucked
even people he killed
people that gave him shit thats how he put it
one night like a joke i say yeah
whod you kill
so he says
i got me this job one time bussin tables at a country club
so i could case all the big rich pricks that come in
i pick out this guy go in one night and do his place
he wakes up and gives me shit
so i killed him
him and the tasty bitch he was with
starts laughing thats the best part
shes fuckin this prick see this golf pro but shes married to some other guy
some hotshot banker
hes the one they pinned it on
they got him down maine somewhere doin time for the crime
aint that choice
he throws his head back and roars with laughter
tommy has finished his story
red is stunned
but andy looks like hes been smacked with a two by four
andy says nothing
walks stiffly away
doesnt look back
i have to say thats the most amazing story i ever heard
what amazes me most is you were taken in by it
its obvious this fellow williams is impressed with you
he hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up
hes young not terribly bright
not surprising he didnt know what a state hed put you in
i think hes telling the truth
lets say for a moment blatch does exist
you think hed just fall to his knees and cry yes i did it
by all means please add a life term to my sentence
it wouldnt matter
with tommys testimony i can get a new trial
thats assuming blatch is even still there
chances are excellent hed be released by now
theyd have his last known address
names of relatives
norton shakes his head well its a chance
how can you be so obtuse
what did you call me
is it deliberate
the country club will have his old time cards
w s with his name on them
rises dufresne if you want to indulge this fantasy thats your business
dont make it mine
this meetings over
look if its the squeeze dont worry
id never say what goes on in here
id be just as indictable as you for laundering the money
dont you ever mention money to me again you sorry son of a bitch
not in this office not anywhere
slaps intercom get in here
i was just trying to rest your mind at ease thats all
as guards enter solitary
andy gets dragged away kicking and screaming whats the matter with you
its my chance to get out dont you see that
its my life
dont you understand its my life
men crowd around as names are called out
red and the boys are parked on the bleachers
a month in the hole
longest damn stretch i ever heard of
its my fault
you didnt pull the trigger and you didnt convict him
you saying andys innocent
i mean for real innocent
red nods sweet jesus
how longs he been in here
going on nineteen years
tommy raises his hand
the envelope gets tossed to him
he stares at it
red peers over his shoulder
board of education
the son of a bitch mailed it
looks that way
you gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt
thumb up my butt sounds better
he gets hemmed in by the older men
red snatches the letter
cmon just throw it away
will you please
just throw it away
red rips it open scans the letter
tommy makes his way through the chaos finds beth and the baby waiting behind the thick plexi shield
he sits doesnt pick up the phone
just stares at beth
she doesnt know what to make of it
he presses a piece of paper against the glass
a high school diploma
her face lights up blinking back tears
low angle on steel door
somewhere behind it unseen is andy a rat scurries along the wall
footsteps approach slowly
andy listens in darkness
the footsteps pause outside his door
the slot opens
an elderly guard peers in
c plus average
thought youd like to know
the slot closes
the footsteps recede
we find tommy on evening work detail mopping the floors with bucket and pail
mert entwhistle comes into view
warden wants to talk
a steel door rattles open
mert leads tommy outside to a gate unlocks it
tommy looks around
thats what the man said
mert swings the gate open sends tommy through turns and heads back inside
tommy proceeds out across a loading dock access for the shops and mills
some vehicles parked
the place is deserted
he stops sensing a presence
norton steps into the light
tommy weve got a situation here
i think you can appreciate that
yes sir i sure can
i tell you son this really came along and knocked my wind out
its got me up nights thats the truth
norton pulls a pack of cigarettes offers tommy a smoke
tommy takes one
norton lights both cigarettes pockets his lighter
the right decision
sometimes its hard to figure out what that is
tommy nods think hard tommy
if im gonna move on this there cant be the least little shred of doubt
i have to know if you what you told dufresne was the truth
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury
having placed your hand on the good book and taken an oath before almighty god himself
just gimme that chance
thats what i thought
norton drops his cigarette
crushes it out with the toe of his shoe
glances up toward the plate shop roof as a rifle scope pops up into frame jumping tommys image into startling magnification framed in the crosshairs
rapid fires a carbine blam
his face lit up by the muzzle flashes
gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire
he smacks the ground in a twitching thrashing heap
eyes wide and staring
surprise still stamped on his face
norton turns strolls into darkness
guards approach andys cell
the door is unlocked
andy emerges slowly blinking painfully at the light
andy is marched along
convicts stop to stare
andy is led in
the door is closed
alone with norton
softly terrible thing
man that young less than a year to go trying to escape
broke captain hadleys heart to shoot him truly it did
it stops right now
get h r block to declare your income
norton lunges to his feet eyes sparkling with rage
tight or you will do the hardest time there is
no more protection from the guards
ill pull you out of that one bunk hilton and put you in norton cont
with the biggest bull queer i can find
youll think you got fucked by a train
and the library
sealed off brick by brick
well have us a little book barbecue in the yard
theyll see the flames for miles
well dance around it like wild indians
do you understand me
are you catching my drift
slow push in on andys face
his beaten expression says it all
red finds andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles
red waits for some acknowledgment
andy doesnt even look up
red hunkers down and joins him
nothing is said for the longest time
and then softly my wife used to say im a hard man to know
like a closed book
complained about it all the time
pause she was beautiful
i loved her
but i guess i couldnt show it enough
softly i killed her red
andy finally glances to red seeking a reaction
i didnt pull the trigger
but i drove her away
thats why she died
because of me the way i am
that dont make you a murderer
bad husband maybe
andy smiles faintly in spite of himself
red gives his shoulder a squeeze
feel bad about it if you want
but you didnt pull the trigger
someone else did and i wound up here
bad luck i guess
it floats around
has to land on somebody
say a storm comes through
some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain
the house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat
it was my turn thats all
i was in the path of the tornado
softly i just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has
glances to him think youll ever get out of here
when i got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs
tell you where id go
little place right on the pacific
you know what the mexicans say about the pacific
they say it has no memory
thats where id like to finish out my life red
a warm place with no memory
open a little hotel right on the beach
buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new
take my guests out charter fishing
beat you know a place like that id need a man who can get things
red stares at andy laughs
i couldnt hack it on the outside
been in here too long
im an institutional man now
like old brooks hatlen was
you underestimate yourself
in here im the guy who can get it for you
out there all you need are yellow pages
i wouldnt know where to begin
derisive snort pacific ocean
like to scare me to death somethin that big
i didnt shoot my wife and i didnt shoot her lover and whatever mistakes i made ive paid for and then some
that hotel and that boat
i dont think its too much to want
to look at the stars just after sunset
touch the sand
wade in the water
goddamn it andy stop
dont do that to yourself
talking shitty pipedreams
mexicos down there and youre in here and thats the way it is
its down there and im in here
i guess it comes down to a simple choice really
get busy living or get busy dying
red snaps a look
what the hell does that mean
andy rises and walks away
red lunges to his feet
turns back red if you ever get out of here do me a favor
theres this big hayfield up near buxton
you know where buxton is
nods lots of hayfields there
one in particular
got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end
like something out of a robert frost poem
its where i asked my andy cont
wife to marry me
wed gone for a picnic
we made love under that tree
i asked and she said yes
beat promise me red
if you ever get out find that spot
in the base of that wall youll find a rock that has no earthly business in a maine hayfield
a piece of black volcanic glass
youll find something buried under it i want you to have
whats buried there
youll just have to pry up that rock and see
andy turns and walks away
i tell you the man was talkin crazy
im worried i truly am
we ought to keep an eye on him
thats fine during the day
but at night hes got that cell all to himself
andy come down to the loading dock today
asked me for a length of rope
six foot long
you gave it to him
sure i did
i mean why wouldnt i
remember brooks hatlen
how the hell was i spose to know
andyd never do that
they all look to red
every mans got a breaking point
voice over p
report to your cellblocks for evening count
boom down to red and the boys
convicts drift past them
where the hell is he
probably still up in the wardens
via bullhorn christ
what do we do
nothing we can do
lets pull him aside tomorrow all of us
have a word with him
aint that right red
andys working away
norton pokes his head in
i wanna get home
just about done sir
we follow norton to his wifes sampler
he swings it aside works the combination dial opens the wall safe
andy moves up shoves in the black ledger and files
norton shuts the safe
three deposits tonight
andy hands him the envelopes
norton heads for the door
get my stuff down tlaundry
and shine my shoes
i want em lookin like mirrors
pauses at door nice havin you back andy
place just wasnt the same without you
andy turns to the laundry
he opens the shoebox
nice pair of dress shoes inside
he sighs glances down at the old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet
andy is diligently shining nortons shoes
andy trudges down the hallway laundry slung over his shoulder andy nods to the guard
the guard buzzes him through
red hears andy coming moves to the bars
he watches andy come up to the second tier and pause before his cell
open number twelve
andy gazes directly at red
a beat of eye contact
red shakes his head
dont do it
andy smiles eerily calm
and enters his cell
the door closes
we hold on reds face
andy is polishing a chess piece
the lights bump off
he finishes polishing holds up the piece to admire
he sets it down with the others and we realize its the final glance for the board
a full set
he gazes up at racquel and smiles
pulls a six foot length of rope from under his pillow
lets it uncoil to the floor
red sits in the dark a bundle of nerves trying to hold himself still
he feels like he might scream or shake to pieces
the seconds tick by each an eternity
i have had some long nights in stir
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts time can draw out like a blade
a flash of lightning outside his window sends harsh barred shadows jittering across the cell
a storm breaking
that was the longest night of my life
the master lock is thrown
the cons emerge from their cells and the headcount begins
red looks back to see if andys in line
suddenly the count stalls man missing on tier two
the head bull haig checks his list dufresne
get your ass out here boy
youre holding up the show
no answer dont make me come down there now
ill thump your skull for you
still no answer
glaring haig stalks down the tier clipboard in hand
his men fall in behind
dufresne dammit youre putting me behind
you better be sick or dead in there i shit you not
they arrive at bars
their faces go slack
softly oh my holy god
reveals the cell is empty
everything neat and tidy
even the bunk is stowed
they wrench the door open and rush in tossing the cell in a panic as if andy might be lurking under the kleenex or the toothpaste
camera rockets in on haig as he spins toward us bellowing at the top of his lungs norton is kicking back with the morning paper
he notices ha dingy his shoes are
he glances at the shoebox on the desk
kicks his shoes off opens the box and gulls out andys o grimy work shoes
he stares blankly
what the fuck indeed
an alarm starts blaring throughout the prison
he looks up
norton and hadley stride across the grounds alarm blaring
i want every man on that cellblock questioned
start with that friend of his
red watches as norton storms up with an entourage of guards
reds eyes widen
guards yank him from his cell
norton steps to the center of the room working himself up into a fine rage what do you mean he just wasnt here
dont say that to me haig
dont say that to me again
i can see that haig
you think im blind
is that what youre saying
am i blind haig
norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at hadley
what about you
tell me what this is
last nights count
you see dufresnes name
i sure do
right there see
he was in his cell at lights out
stands to reason hed still be here this morning
i want him found
not tomorrow not after breakfast
haig scurries out gathering men
norton spins to red
i see you two all the time youre thick as thieves you are
he musta said something
no sir he didnt
norton spreads his arms evangelist style spins slowly around
its a miracle
man up and vanished like a fart in the wind
nothin left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall
lets ask her
maybe she knows
what say there fuzzy britches
feel like talking
why should you be different
red exchanges looks with the guards
even theyre nervous
norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill
he hurls them at the wall one at a time shattering them punctuating his words its a conspiracy
smash thats what this is
smash its one big damn conspiracy
smash and everyones in on it
smash including her
he sends the last rock whizzing right at racquel
it takes a moment for this to sink in
all eyes go to her
the rock went through her
theres a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be
you could hear a pin drop
norton reaches up sinks his finger into the hole
he keeps pushing
and his entire hand disappears into the wall
as norton rips the poster from before our eyes
stunned faces peer in
camera pulls slowly back
to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall
rory tremont a guard barely out of his teens tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest
hes getting instructions from six different people at once
they got this skinny kid named rory tremont to go in the hole
he wasnt much in the brains department but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job
they slap a flashlight in his hands he was willing to go
rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly
probably thought hed win a bronze star or something
dark as midnight
concrete walls rise on both sides
if you imagine them as two huge slices of bread the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the
rorys appears shining his flashlight down the shaft
somewhere a rat squeaks
it was his third day on the job
theres a space here between the walls bout three feet across
smells pretty damn bad
i dont care what it smells like
go on boy
we got a hold of you
looking none too happy about it rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft
he gets lowered shining his light smothered by darkness
not having a good time
smells gettin worse
never mind i said
just keep going
smells pretty damn bad warden
in fact it smells just like shit
his feet touch the ground or what he assumed was the ground
in fact its just what it smells like
he sinks in past his ankles
he slips and sits heavily in it
oh god thats what it is its shit
oh my god its shit
pull me out fore i blow my groceries oh shit its shit oh my gawwwwwwd
red and others listen to violent barfing from below
and then came the unmistakable sound of rory tremont losing his last few meals
the whole cellblock heard it
i mean it echoed
thats it for red
he starts laughing
laughing hell hes bellowing laughter laughing so hard he has to hold himself laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks
the look of rage on nortons face makes him laugh all the harder
low angle on steel door
i laughed myself right into solitary
two week stretch
its shit its shit oh my god its shit
he starts laughing all over again fit to split
andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole
now i knew what he meant
charming rural road
suddenly state police cruisers rocket up the road with sirens and lights
in andy dufresne escaped from shawshank prison
shawshank is half a mile distant
we track along a muddy creel as state troopers and prison guards scour the brush
a troopee fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick
all they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of soap and an old rock hammer damn near worn down to the nub
trooper g pulls the rock hammer from the weeds
swish pan to a police photographer
his flashbulb glare produces of the hapless cops posing with andys reeking uniform and the worn rock hammer
push in on the hammer
i remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it
andy did it in less than twenty
once again we see andy using the rock hammer to scratch his name into the cement
suddenly a palm sized chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor
he stares down at it
andy lies in the dark studying the chunk of concrete in his hands
considering the possibilities
wrestling with hope
andy loved geology
i imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature
an ice age here a million years of mountain building there plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia
andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk
carefully runs his fingertip over it
geology is the study of pressure and time
thats all it takes really
pressure and time
rita is now on the wall hanging down over andys back
that and a big damn poster
track in to reveal andy scraping patiently at the concrete
like i said
in prison a manll do most anything to keep his mind occupied
he hears footsteps approaching
he smoothes the poster down and dives into bed
a guard strolls by a moment later shining his flashlight into the cell
andy strolls along whistling softly hands in both pockets
tilt down to his pantleg
concrete grit trickles out
it turns out andys favorite hobby was totin his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time
a guard strolls the tier shining his flashlight into the cells
he pauses at andys bars playing the beam over the sleeping form huddled under the blankets
p reverse angle from ins de andys cell we see what the guard doesnt instead of andys head under the blanket its a wadded up pillow
the flashlight plays across the cell pinning marilyn monroe in a circle of light
the light illuminates her face through the paper
widen to reveal andy lying in his tunnel holding his breath
the light clicks off
the footsteps move on
he gets back to work
while the rest of us slept andy spent years workin the nightshift
booming slowly up the shaft
rats scurry the pipes
suddenly r piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets down the shaft as the rock hammer pushes through
the pick withdraws replaced by andys peering eye
a series of dissolves through takes us through the widening of the hole
first as big as a tea cup
then a saucer
then a dinner plate
probably took him most of a year just to get his head through
andy finally gets his head through scraping his ears
hes got a penlight clenched in his teeth
he peers down into the shaft
at the very bottom maybe feet down a big ceramic pipe runs the length of the cellblock
beneath its coat of grime and dust the word sewer is stenciled
angle looking straight down
below us tommy williams lies facedown at nortons feet
blood is spreading fanning out oa the pavement
norton turns strolls out of frame
i guess after tommy was killed andy decided hed been here just about long enough
again we see andy working
norton pokes his head in
i wanna get home
just about done sir
norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial his back turned
this time though we stay on andy he pulls up his sweater yanks out a large black book and a stack of files lays them on the desk
he then grabs the real ledger and files jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down
he picks up the bogus stack crosses to norton and shoves everything in
norton exits his office and strolls off whistling
push in on the open door
we see andy at the guards desk pulling nortons dress shoes from their box
andy did like he was told
buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine
andy sorts through nortons three suits
he pauses checking the gray pinstripe
the guard buzzes andy through
andy walks toward us
the guard simply didnt notice
neither did i
i mean seriously how often do you really look at a mans shoes
tilt down as he passes by
yep hes wearing nortons shoes
the lights go out
andy places the last chess piece
gazes up at racquel
pulls the rope from under his pillow
he stands and unbuttons his prison shirt revealing nortons gray pinstripe suit underneath
a flash of lightning floods the cell throwing wild shadows
the storm rages
andy naked carefully slips nortons folded suit into a large industrial zip lock bag
next to go in are the shoes chess pieces already in a smaller bag black ledger en files
last but not least a bar of soap wrapped in a towel
andy again wearing prison clothes inches down the tunnel
andy squeezes through the hole head first emerges to the waist he reaches for the opposite wall manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers
suddenly a huge rat darts for his hand
andy yanks away and almost plummets head first down the shaft
he dangles wildly upside down for a moment arms windmilling then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall
the rat scurries off pissed
andy snags the conduit again
he contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft
we now see the purpose for the rope the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack he kicks his legs across the shaft gets his
wit his back against one wall and feet against the other he starts down the shaft
using pipes for handholds
flinching as rats dart this way and that scurrying in the shadows
he drops the last few feet to the bottom
he approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it
pulls out the rock hammer and says a quick silent prayer
raises the rock hammer high and swings it down with all his might
once twice third time lucky
an enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket propelled the mount st
helens of shit
andy is instantly coated black
he turns away and heaves his guts out
the shit keeps coming
andy peers down through the hole playing his penlight aroun the inside diameter is no more than two feet
coated with crud
it seems to go on for miles
no turning back
he wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling plastic bag dragging behind
andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit smelling foulness i cant even imagine
or maybe i just dont want to
rain is falling in solid sheets
shawshank is half a mile distant
boom down to reveal the creek
and push in toward the mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it
five hundred yards
the length of five football fields
just shy of half a mile
fingers appear thrusting through the heavy gauge wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe
andys face looms from the darkness peering out at freedom
he wrenches the mesh loose pushes himself out and plunges head first into the creek
he comes up sputtering for breath
the water is waist deep
he wades upstream ripping his clothes from his body
he gets his shirt off spins it through the air over his head flings the shirt away
he raises his arms to the sky turning slowly feeling the rain washing him clean
a flash of lightning arcs from horizon to horizon
once again we see stunned faces as camera pulls back
the next morning right about the time racquel was spilling her little secret
the door opens
spit shined shoes enter
dolly the shoes to the counter
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the casco bank of portland
until that moment he didnt exist except on paper
may i help you
tilt up to andy
smiling in nortons gray pinstripe suit
my name is peter stevens
ive come to close out some accounts
the teller is cutting a cashiers check while the manager carefully examines mr
stevens various i
he had all the proper i
drivers license birth certificate social security card
the signature was a spot on match
i must say im sorry to be losing your business
i hope youll enjoy living abroad
im sure i will
heres your cashiers check sir
will there be anything else
would you add this to your outgoing mail
he hands her a package stamped and addressed
gives them a pleasant smile
turns and strolls from the bank
stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the portland area that morning
all told he blew town with better than thousand dollars of warden nortons money
severance pay for nineteen years
a man in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk
he finds andys package rips it open
pulls out the black ledger and files
scans a cover letter
he dashes to his door and yanks it open revealing the words on the glass portland daily bugle editor in chief
get your butts in here
norton walks slowly toward his office
the morning paper in his hand
he goes wordlessly past the duty guard into his office
shuts the door
lays the paper on his desk
the headline reads corruption and murder at shawshank
below that the sub headline d
norton looks up as sirens swell in the distance
for the second time state police cruisers go rocketing up the road with sirens and lights
norton opens his safe and pulls out the ledger its andys bible
the title page is inscribed by hand dear warden
you were right
salvation lay within
norton flips to the center of the book and finds the pages hollowed out in the shape of a rock hammer
police cruisers everywhere
a media circus
reporters jostle for position
a colorless district attorney steps forward into closeup flanked by a contingent of s
angle shifts to reveal captain hadley
you have the right to remain silent
if you give up that right anything you say will be used against you in court
troopers move in cuffing hadleys hands behind his back
hadley says nothing
his face scrunches up
he begins to cry
i wasnt there to see it but i hear byron hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away
hadley sobs all the way to the car
snaps a gaze up toward nortons window motions his men to follow
norton is staring out the window as they approach the building
he goes to his desk opens a drawer
inside lies a revolver and a box of shells
norton had no intention of goin that quietly
marches along amidst a phalanx of troopers
norton sits blankly at his desk revolver before him
the doorknob rattles a voice is heard samuel norton
we have a warrant for your arrest
the pounding starts
norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr desk
he starts sorting them to see which ones he likes
troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to nortons door as he fumbles nervously with a huge key ring
im not sure which one it is
he starts trying keys in the lock
and as the keys go sliding in one after another
so do the bullets
norton is riveted to the door
for every key he loads another bullet
methodical and grim
he gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home
the door bursts open
men muscle in
troopers dive in all directions as norton raises the gun and jams it under his chin
his head snaps back as the wall goes red
his swivel chair does a slow half turn and creaks to a final stop
troopers rise slowly gazing in horror
i like to think the last thing that went through his head
other than that bullet
was to wonder how the hell andy dufresne ever got the best of him
push slowly to the wall to reveal mrs
nortons framed sampler trickling blood and brains
and we get our final bible lesson for today his judgment cometh and that right soon
red hears his name
they pass him a postcard
not long after the warden deprived us of his company i got a postcard in the mail
it was blank
but the postmark said mcnary texas
red sits with an atlas tracing his finger down the page
right on the border
thats where andy crossed
shuts the book when i picture him heading south in his own car with the top down it makes me laugh all over again
a red convertible rips along with andy at the wheel cigar jutting from his grin warm wind fluttering his tie
andy dufresne who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side
andy dufresne headed for the pacific
heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about andy
those of us who knew him best talk about him often
i swear the stuff he pulled
it always makes us laugh
a wild burst of laughter
push in on red
sometimes it makes me sad though andy being gone
i have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged thats all
their feathers are just too bright
convicts hoe the fields
guards patrol on horseback
and when they fly away the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice
but still the place you live is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone
a distant rumble of thunder
red pauses gazes off
storm clouds coming in backlit by the sun
a light drizzle begins
i guess i just miss my friend
red is sleeping
he wakes with a start
but there are times i curse him for the dreams he left behind
he senses a presence looks over his shoulder
theres a rita hayworth poster on his wall
he gets out of bed
rita just keeps smiling inscrutable
as red watches a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster shining from the tunnel
the poster rips free charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell
red staggers back against the glare
a whirlwind kicks up whipping everything into the air
the hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner papers book toiletries bedding if it aint nailed down it gets sucked down the hole toward the light
red fights it but the suction drags him closer and closer
and camera rockets into the hole getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed the roar of air mixing with his drawn out scream closer and closer to the
and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach
the pacific ocean before us
beautiful beyond description
all we hear now are the gentle sound of waves
dreams where i am lost in a warm place with no memory
a lone figure stands at waters edge
camera keeps moving coming up behind him and tracking around to reveal red
an ocean so big it strikes me dumb
waves so quiet they strike me deaf
sunshine so bright it strikes me blind
it is a place that is blue beyond reason
bluer than can possibly exist
bluer than my mind can possibly grasp
nothing for a million miles but beach sky and water
red is a tiny speck at waters edge
just another grain of sand
i am terrified
there is no way home
red wakes from the nightmare
he gets out of bed
moves to the barred window of his cell
peers up at the stars
i know youre in that place
look at the stars for me just after sunset
touch the sand
wade in the water
and feel free
slides open with an enormous clang
a stark room beyond
camera pushes through
six men and one woman sit at a long table
an empty chair faces them
we are again in red enters sits
years older than when we first saw him
your file says youve served forty years of a life sentence
you feel youve been rehabilitated
red doesnt answer
just stares off
seconds tick by
the parole board exchanges glances
somebody clears his throat
shall i repeat the question
i heard you
lets see now
you know come to think of it i have no idea what that means
well it means youre ready to rejoin society as a i know what you think it means
me i think its a made up word a poli ticians word
a word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job
what do you really want to know
am i sorry for what i did
man g well
not a day goes by i dont feel regret and not because im in here or because you think i should
i look back on myself the way i was
stupid kid who did that terrible crime
wish i could talk sense to him
tell him how things are
but i cant
that kids long gone this old man is all thats left and i have to live with that
thats a bullshit word so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there sonny and stop wasting my damn time
truth is i dont give a shit
the parole board just stares
red sits drumming his fingers
a big rubber stamp slams down and lifts away to reveal the word approved in red ink
two short siren blasts herald the opening of the main gate
it swings hugely open revealing red standing in his cheap suit carrying a cheap bag wearing a cheap hat
he walks out still looking stunned
red rides the bus clutching the seat before him gripped by terror of speed and motion
red arrives at the brewster three stories high and even less to look at than it used to be
a black woman leads red up the stairs toward the top floor
small old dingy
an arched window with a view of congress street
traffic noise floats up
red enters and pauses staring up at the ceiling beam
carved into the wood are the words brooks hatlen was here
jangling with people and noise
we find red bagging groceries
registers are humming kids are shrieking
red calls to the store manager sir
restroom break sir
motions him over you dont need to ask me every time you go take a piss
l int employee restroom day red steps to the urinal stares at himself in the wall mirror
thirty years ive been asking permission to piss
i cant squeeze a drop without say so
a strange east indian guitar whine begins
george harrisons within you without you
which carries through as red walks
people and traffic
he keeps looking at the women
an alien species
women too thats the other thing
i forgot they were half the human race
theres women everywhere every shape and size
i find myself semi hard most of the time cursing myself for a dirty old man
two young women stroll by in cut offs and t shirts
not a brassiere to be seen nipples poking out at the world
jeezus pleeze us
back in my day a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing
red finds the park filled with hippies
heres the source of the music a radio
a hippie girl gyrates to the beatles stoned in her own world
theyre calling this the summer of love
summer of loonies you ask me
red sits across from his parole officer
is filling out his report
you staying out of the bars red
that i am
how you doing otherwise
things got different out here
tell me about it
young punks protesting the war
even my own kid
oughtta bust his fuckin skull
guess the world moved on
one points a toy gun at red pumping the trigger
red focuses on the gun listening to it clickety clack
sparky wheel grinding
the kids get swept off by mom
red starts bagging the next customer
slow push in on red
surrounded by motion and noise
feeling like the eye of a hurricane
people everywhere whipping around him like a gale
it gets distorted and weird slow and thick pressing in on him from all sides
the noise level intensifies
the hollering of children deepens and distends into low eerie howls
hes in the grip of a major anxiety attack
tries to shake himself out of it
fumbles the final items into the bag
trying not to panic
trying not to run
he makes his way through the store
he bumps into a ladys cart mumbles an apology keeps going
breaks into a trot
down the aisle cut to the left through the door into the back rooms faster and faster running now slamming through a door marked employees only into where he slams
the door and leans heavily against it shutting everything out breathing heavily
he goes to the sink splashes his face tries to calm down
he can still hear them out there
they wont go away
he glances around the restroom
not small enough
he enters a stall
locks the door
puts the toilet lid down and sits on the john
he can actually reach out and touch the walls now
almost small enough
he draws his feet up so he cant be seen if somebody walks in
hell just sit here for a while
until he calms down
red is walking home
there is a harsh truth to face
no way im gonna make it on the outside
he pauses at a pawnshop window
an array of handguns
all i do anymore is think of ways to break my parole
the shopkeeper appears at the glass locking the door and flipping the sign closed
red lies smoking in bed
unable to sleep
terrible thing to live in fear
brooks hatlen knew it
knew it all too well
all i want is to be back where things make sense
where i wont have to be afraid all the time
he glances up at the ceiling beam
brooks hatlen was here
only one thing stops me
a promise i made to andy
a pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to a stop
red hops off the back waves his thanks
the truck drives on
red starts walking
pan to a roadside sign buxton
high white clouds in a blazing blue sky
the trees fiery with autumn color
red walks the fields and back roads cheap compass in hand
looking for a certain hayfield
the day turning late
red finds himself staring at a distant field
theres a long rock wall like something out o f a robert frost poem
big oak tree
red checks his compass
he crosses a dirt road into the field
red walks the long rock wall nearing the tree
a squirrel scolds him from a low branch scurries up higher
red studies the base of the wall
nothing unusual here
just a bunch of rocks set in stone
turns to go
something catches his eye
he walks back squats peering closer
wets a fingertip and rubs a stone
a layer of dust comes off
he tries to get the rock out anticipation growing
it wont come its too smooth
he pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free
it tumbles at his feet leaving a ragged hole
red leans down and solves the mystery at last staring at the object buried under the rock
its an envelope wrapped in plastic
written on it is a single word red
red pulls the envelope out and rises
he just stares at it for a while almost afraid to open it
but open it he does
inside is a smaller envelope and a letter
red begins to read dear red
if youre reading this youve gotten out
and if youve come this far maybe youre willing to come a little further
you remember the name of the town dont you
i could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels
ill keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready
beat remember red
hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies
i will be hoping that this letter finds you and finds you well
by now tears are spilling silently down reds cheeks
he opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty dollar bills
twenty of them
a thousand dollars
red is dressed in his suit
he finishes knotting his tie puts his hat on
his bag is by the door
he takes one last look around
only one thing left to do
he pulls a wooden chair to the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam
get busy living or get busy dying
that is goddamn right
he steps up on the chair
it wobbles under his weight
the door opens
red exits with his bag and heads down the stairs leaving the door open
camera pushes through booming up to the ceiling beam which reads brooks hatlen was here
a new message has been carved alongside the old so was red
tracking shot reveals a long line of people at the counter
for the second time in my life i am guilty of committing a crime
camera brings us to red next in line bag by his feet
i doubt theyll toss up any roadblocks for that
not for an old crook like me
steps up mcnary texas
a gorgeous new england landscape whizzes by fields and trees a blur of motion
angle shifts to reveal a greyhound sceni cruiser barreling up the road pulling abreast of us
camera travels from window to window passing faces
we finally come to red gazing out at the passing landscape
i find i am so excited i can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head
i think it is the excitement only a free man can feel a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain
roars past camera dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon
i hope i can make it across the border
i hope to see my friend and shake his hand
i hope the pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams
beat i hope
a distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck thats been left to rot in the sun
theres someone out there
a man is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by hand face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask
red appears b
a distant figure walking out across the sand wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag
the man on the boat pauses
turns slowly around
red arrives with a smile as wide as the horizon
the other man raises his goggles and pulls down his mask
andy of course
you look like a man who knows how to get things
im known to locate certain things from time to time
red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander
