b if window
href b b by ted tally based on the novel by thomas harris a womans face backs into shot her head resting against grimy wallpaper
she is tense sweaty wide eyed with concentration
this is clarice starling mid s trim very pretty
she wears kevlar body armor over a navy windbreaker khaki pants
her thick hair is piled under a navy baseball cap
a revolver clutched in her right hand hovers by her ear
she raises a speedloader in her left hand locks it into her cylinder twists and reloads
a guest room door with a small wired pack attached to its knob
suddenly wish a sharp crack
the knob explodes and the door bursts open
as she runs around a corner through a cloud of smoke
she shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside gun at the ready in both hands
clarices pov moving as she first sees sitting on the edge of a bed a female hostage
black late s gagged hands behind her back
she sees a startled male suspect white mid s standing by a window with a rifle in his hands
he is turning towards her
clarice drops into a combat crouch gun extended and shouts
all natural sound suspended as the suspect faces her with a strange pleading expression
the rifle is rising in his hands but oddly enough it is held across his chest not pointing
then another puzzling detail registers
are taped to his gun away from the trigger he couldnt use it even if he tried
suddenly we hear a metallic click which registers with unnatural amplification as clarice reacts drops to the floor rolling sideways and pulls a revolver out from behind her back still
in slow motion raising it in her untied hands
she fires repeatedly flames leaping from the muzzle the sound is an echoing roar in these close quarters but clarice has come up on one knee beside an armchair and
is already firing back herself two quick shots which send pitching over the bed backwards to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke
clarice rushes to her clamping one knee down on her gun hand still keeping her covered in case of movement
hold for a few beats
then we hear the shrill blast of a whistle from somewhere off screen as normal action and sound are restored
okay people good exercise
clarice relaxes lowering her gun
the lights brighten
we see that were in some sort of auditorium with the hotel room and its corridor built as a training set
john brigham walks onto this set thumbing a stopwatch
mid s ex marine
his t shirts lettering says firearms instructor fbi academy
starlings reaction time was excellent
critique in five
a class of about forty young fbi trainees of both sexes begins to rise from their seats mingling and chatting
clarice nods amiably to the suspect then gives her hostage a hand up
its ardelia mapp her roommate
her broad clever face breaks into a big smile as they both remove ear plugs
clarices voice has just a soft trace of southern accent
damn clarice howd you make me
indicating her gun never cock
grins i love it when you talk dirty
as brigham joins them clarice cant resist a star pupils little smile of pride
he frowns good naturedly
whatre you laughin at junior g man
she got off four rounds to your two
he takes out a steel coiled grip flexer drops it onto her palm
continuing one hundred reps each hand every day
now tidy up the section chief wants to see you
he nods a direction then moves off
clarice with her smile finally fading looks out into the auditorium
sits on the top step of the aisle looking down at her
he is strongly built
he rises impassively exits through the back door
he carries a think manila envelope under one arm
ardelia who is helping clarice unbuckle her bullet proof vest follows her worried gaze
whatd i do
just remember to call him god
crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range as clarice joins him
he looks tired haunted
between master and student we sense a subtle muted tug of sexuality
starling clarice m
good morning mr
your instructors tell me youre doing well
top quarter of the class
i hope so
they havent posted anything
a jobs come up and i thought about you
not really a job more of an interesting errand
walk me to my car starling
they begin to cross the academy grounds
a group of trainees jogs by in matching sweats following a p
were trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody for a psychobehavioral profile
could be a big help in unsolved cases
most of them have been happy to talk to us
they have a compulsion to boast these people
do you spook easily starling
you see the one we want most refuses to cooperate
i want you to go after him again today in the asylum
whos the subject
the psychiatrist dr
clarice stops walking goes very still
crawford doesnt respond except to study her face
im glad for the chance sir but why me
youre qualified and available
and frankly i cant spare a real agent right now
he walks on again at a faster clip
she hurried to keep up
i dont expect him to talk to you but i have to be able to say we tried
lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist and he knows all the dodges
hands her the manila envelope dossier on him copy of our questionnaire special id for you
if he wont talk then i want straight reporting
hows he look hows his cell look whats he writing
the director himself will see your report over your own signature if i decide its good enough
i want that by wednesday and keep this to yourself
theyre reached his car
his driver stamps on a cigarette climbs in behind the wheel
burroughs his assistant says something into a walkie talkie then opens the back door
but crawford pulls her aside a hand on her shoulder
his intensity is scary
i want your full attention starling
are you listening to me
be very careful with hannibal lecter
chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him
do not deviate from them for any reason
you tell him nothing personal starling
believe me you dont want hannibal lecter inside your head
just do your job but never forget what he is
a bit unnerved and what is that sir
oh hes a monster
a pure psychopath
close on an id card held in a male hand
clarices photo official looking graphics
it calls her a federal investigator
its so rare to capture one alive
from a research point of view dr
lecter is our most prized asset
frederick chilton looks up from her card
a smarmy little peacock behind a vast desk hes conceived an instant hopeless letch for clarice
he smiles stroking her card with his beloved gold pen
you know we get a lot of detectives here but i must say i cant ever remember one so attractive
now wearing a more feminine skirt suit
hair neatly coiled elegant shoulder bag briefcase
he has rudely left her standing
will you be in baltimore overnight
because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide
clarice tries unsuccessfully to hide her distaste for him
im sure its a great town dr
chilton but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon
pause sourly i see
beat lets make this quick then
clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate clangs shut behind her the bolt shooting home
chilton walks ahead of her
lecter carved up nine people that were sure of and cooked his favorite bits
weve tried to study him of course but hes much too sophisticated for the standard tests
and my does he hate us
thinks im his nemesis
crawfords very clever isnt he
how do you mean dr
a pretty young woman to turn him on
i dont believe lecters ever seen a woman in eight years
and oh are you ever his taste so to speak
i graduated magna from uva doctor
its not a charm school
then you should be able to remember the rules
a darker even grimmer area
heavy grids over the lights
distant slammings and faint hoarse shouts
they walk briskly
do not reach through the bars do not touch the bars
you pass him nothing but soft paper no pens or pencils
no staples or paperclips in his paper
use the sliding food carrier no exceptions
do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you
do you understand me
im going to show you why we insist on such precautions
on the afternoon of july he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary
his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg
when the nurse bent over him he did this to her
he hands clarice a small dog eared photo
looking at it she is stopped in her tracks
this pleases chilton
the doctors managed to re set her jaw more or less and save one of her eyes
his pulse never got over eighty five even when he ate her tongue
pauses he smiles i keep him in here
he turns pushes a button
a steel door buzzes slowly open and barney a big impassive orderly awaits them in an anteroom
on its walls restraints mouthpieces mace tranquilizer guns
quickly blocking him dr
chilton if lecter feels youre his enemy as youve said then maybe ill have more luck by myself
what do you think
annoyed you might have suggested that in my office and saved me the time
but then i wouldve missed the pleasure of your company
she holds out the photo
he grabs it jaw twitching
when shes finished bring her out
he turns on his heel goes
barney smiles reassuringly
hi im barney
he told you dont get near the bars
shaking his hand clarice starling
yes he did
past the others its the last cell
stay to the middle
i put out a chair for you
sensing her tension he indicates a nearby security monitor
youll do fine
clarice nods gratefully
she looks down the long corridor takes a deep breath walks into it
he watches her go
moving shot with clarice as her footsteps echo
high to her right surveillance cameras
on her left cells
some are padded with narrow observation slits others are normal barred
shadowy occupants pacing muttering
suddenly a dark figure in the next to last cell hurtles towards her his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses
i c can sssmell your cunt
clarice flinches momentarily but then walks on
is coming slowly into view
behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net
sparse bolted down furniture many softcover books and papers
on the walls extraordinarily detailed skillful drawings mostly european cityscapes in charcoal or crayon
clarice stops at a polite distance from his bars clears her throat
my name is clarice starling
may i talk with you
hannibal lecter is lounging on his bunk in white pajamas reading an italian vogue
he turns considers her
a face so long out of the sun it seems almost leached except for the glittering eyes and the wet red mouth
he rises smoothly crossing to stand before her the gracious host
his voice is cultured soft
as clarice comes a measured distance closer
doctor we have a hard problem in psychological profiling
i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire
we being the behavioral science unit at quantico
youre one of jack crawfords i expect
i am yes
may i see your credentials
clarice is surprised but fishes her id card from her bag holds it up for his inspection
he smiles soothingly
she complies each time trying to hide her fear
lecters nostrils lift as he gently like an animal tests the air
then he smiles glancing at her card
continuing that expires in one week
youre not real fbi are you
im still in training at the academy
jack crawford sent a trainee to me
were talking about psychology doctor not the bureau
can you decide for yourself whether or not im qualified
thats rather slippery of you officer starling
she sits in the folding metal desk chair
he waits politely till shes settled then sits down himself faces her happily
what did miggs say to you
she is puzzled multiple miggs in the next cell
he hissed at you
what did he say
he said i can smell your cunt
i myself cannot
you use evyan skin cream and sometimes you wear lair du temps but not today
you brought your best bag though didnt you
its much better than your shoes
maybe theyll catch up
i have no doubt of it
shifting uncomfortably did you do those drawings doctor
thats the duomo seen from the belvedere
do you know florence
all that detail just from memory
memory officer starling is what i have instead of view
a pause then clarice takes the questionnaire from her case
lecter if youd please consider no no no
you were doing fine youd been courteous and receptive to courtesy youd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs and now this ham handed segue into your questionnaire
it wont do
its stupid and boring
im only asking you to look at this doctor
either you will or you wont
jack crawford must be very busy indeed if hes recruiting help from the student body
busy hunting that new one buffalo bill
such a naughty boy
did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him
no i came because we need how many women has he used our bill
but doctor thats an active case im not involved
if do you know why hes called buffalo bill
the newspapers wont say
ill tell you if youll look at this form
he considers then nods it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide
this one likes to skin his humps
witless and misleading
why do you think he takes their skins officer starling
thrill me with your wisdom
it excites him
most serial killers keep some sort of trophies
you ate yours
a tense beat then a smile from him at this small boldness
send that through
she rolls him the questionnaire in his sliding food tray
he rises glances at it turning a page or two disdainfully
oh officer starling
do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool
i only hoped that your knowledge suddenly he whips the tray back at her with a metallic clang that makes her start
his voice remains a pleasant purr
youre sooo ambitious arent you
you know what you look like to me with your good bag and your cheap shoes
you look like a rube
a well scrubbed hustling rube with a little taste
good nutrition has given you some length of bone but youre not more than one generation from poor white trash are you officer starling
that accent youre trying so desperately to shed pure west virginia
what was your father dear
was he a coal miner
did he stink of the lamp
and oh how quickly the boys found you
all those tedious sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars while you could only dream of getting out
getting anywhere yes
getting all the way to the his every word has struck her like a tiny precise dart
but she squares her jaw and wont give ground
you see a lot dr
but are you strong enough to point that high powered perception at yourself
how about it
look at yourself and write down the truth
she slams the tray back at him or maybe youre afraid to
youre a tough one arent you
and youd hate to think you were common
my wouldnt that sting
well youre far from common officer starling
all you have is the fear of it
beat now please excuse me
and the questionnaire
a census taker once tried to test me
i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti
fly back to school little starling
he steps backwards then returns to his cot becoming as still and remote as a statue
frustrated clarice hesitates then finally shoulders her bag and goes leaving the questionnaire in his tray
but after just a few steps as she passes she sees that creature at his bars again hissing at her
i b bit my wrist so i c can diiiieeee
s ee how it bleeeeeeeeds
the dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her and is spattered on the face and neck not with blood but with pale droplets of semen
she gives a little cry touching her fingers to the wetness
stunned near tears she forces herself to straighten up and walk on fumbling for a tissue
from behind her dr
lecter calls out very agitated
clarice slows stops
she shudders but makes the very difficult choice to turn walk back stand again in front of whos shivering with rage
for an instant his face opens and we catch a glimpse into hell itself
then hes composed again
i would not have had that happen to you
discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me
then please do this test for me
but i will make you happy
ill give you a chance for what you love most clarice starling
whats that dr
advancement of course
beat go to split city
see miss mofet an old patient of mine
m o f e t
a smile i dont think miggs could manage again so soon even if he is crazy do you
the grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as clarice rushes out the front doors
she is badly shaken almost stumbling as she rubs at her face
she looks around for and finally with some relief spots an old pinto parked nearby
this image begins to blur
her face fighting tears as the camera begins to whirl around her almost dizzily
she is seeing in her minds eye a screen door banging open on a wooden porch and a year old girl the young clarice rushing outside down the front steps
and running joyfully across her front yard to a car late s vintage parked in the dirt road
a man clarices father is just climbing out
hes tall handsome and has a marshals badge pinned on his dark suit
he grins seeing her and spreads his arms wide as
rushes into them and he sweeps her up in a hug spinning her around the camera spinning with them and capturing both their laughing faces before we abruptly return to
alone in the parking lot sagging against her car
her face is buried in her arms she shoulders shaking
sound upcut a steady rapid series of gunshots as we clarice in a combat stance and wearing a sound muffling headset is squeezing off round after round at the silhouette
of a man approaching along a track
her shots tightly grouped are all finding the center chest
the target stops quite close to her still swaying
clarice stares at it deftly working her speedloader
then she puts a final emphatic shot right through the figures close on a microfilm monitor a grainy newsphoto of dr
lecter scrawling past with an accompanying story new horrors in cannibal trial dated
clarice is punching keys on the terminal
other trainees study at nearby tables
she pauses jotting a note on her pad as ardelia comes by carrying an armful of books
phone call clarice
as clarice rises grabbing her notebook and follows ardelia past high metal bookstacks
you missed fourth amendment law
unlawful seizure real juicy stuff
where were you all afternoon
pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face
ardelia stares at her figures its a put on laughs
wish i had time for a social life
clarice grins as ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting on the check out desk then moves on
clarice picks it up
on phone mr
crawford in a cardigan sits in a wing chair in the book lined study of his suburban home
he turns the pages of clarices memo as they talk
his tone is sharp
ive read your interim memo on lecter
you sure youve left nothing out
its all there sir practically verbatim
every word starling
a bit heatedly right down to the kleenex i used
he is silent sir why
is something wrong
he mentioned a name at the very end
any followup on her
i spent all evening on the mainframe
lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories prior to capture
no record of anyone named mofet
but split city sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce
i tracked it down in the librarys catalogue of national yellow pages
glancing at her notes its a mini storage facility outside baltimore where lecter had his practice
she pauses expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness
why arent you there right now
sir thats a field job
its outside the scope of my assignment
and ive got a test tomorrow on do you recall my instructions to you starling
what were they
to complete and file my report by wednesday
but sir then do that starling
do just exactly that
sir what is it
theres something youre not telling me
beat miggs has been murdered
startled upset murdered
the orderly heard lecter whispering to him all afternoon and miggs crying
they found him at bed check
hed swallowed his own tongue
chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit and hes trying to blame it on you
i told the little prick your conduct was flawless
im here sir i just i dont know how to feel about it
you dont have to feel any way about it
lecter did it to amuse himself
why not what can they do
take away his books for awhile and no jello
a bit softer i know it got ugly today
but this is your report starling take it as far as you can
on your own time outside of class
now carry on
as we hear the loud click of crawford hanging up
she stares at her receiver stung by his abruptness
well god damn it
you old creep
creepo son of a bitch
let miggs squirt you and see how you like it
she slams her receiver into its cradle
as he flips aside her memo then rises wearily
he leaves his study flicking off the lamp and pads away in his slippers
a private nurse in white stands marking a clipboard chart as crawford enters his tidy bedroom
ill take over patricia
you get some rest
the nurse nods hands him the chart and goes
he glances at it then sets it aside
he crosses to who lies in an elevated hospital bed
nearby are an oxygen tank and mask floral arrangements
her breathing is shallow very labored
crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a long moment tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into place then bends over to kiss her forehead
sound upcut thunder and rain
an orange neon sign streaked with rain identifies out location
it looms over a hurricane fence topped with barbed wire
inside row on row of garage sized cinderblock sheds
unit was leased for ten years
pre paid in full
the contract is in the name of miss hester mofet
clarice kneeling before a closed roll up metal door takes a flash photo of its sealed padlock
everett yow a fat ish chinaman holds an umbrella over them both
he looks unhappy
so no ones been in here since
she opens the padlock using a fat ring of tagged keys then sets aside both keys and lock
not to my knowledge
privacy is a great concern to my customers
but if you say this is an fbi matter
i wont disturb anything mr
yow i promise
be gone before you know it
slinging her camera over a shoulder she tugs at the handle but the door wont budge
another tug harder no good
yow stoops to help puffing hard but its firmly stuck
we could return tomorrow with my son
or perhaps some workmen
clarice crosses to her pinto which faces the shed reaches in to turn on her headlights
yow blinks in the sudden brightness
then she opens her truck rummaging inside and returns with a bumper jack a flashlight and a rubber floor mat
would you hold these please
she gives him her flashlight and camera drops the mat on the ground then sets the bumper jack in place under the center of the door
she pumps on the jack handle as the door squeals slowly up but it wont go higher than about inches despite all her exertions
she spreads out the rubber mat on the cement takes the flashlight from mr
yow then lies on the mat
clarice backlit peers under the door
she reaches in makes a sweep with her flashlight
we catch shadowy outlines boxes then the flattened tires of a car
sound of rain on the tin roof and other noises too small rustlings
yows chubby face appears down beside clarices
it smells like mice
i think i hear them too dont you
clarice turns onto her back starts squirming under the door
youre going in there
clarice pulls her head back out again reaching to take her camera from him
she hands him a card trying to appear nonchalant
yow if this door should fall down ha ha
or anything else would you be kind enough to call this number
its our baltimore field office
they know youre here with me
do you understand
might i suggest tucking your pants into your socks
to prevent mouse intrusion
beat good idea
clarice squirms on her back through the narrow opening
as she squeezes all the way in she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door
she curses softly shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis theres a small streak of blood
okay miss starling
she shines her light around
in its narrow beam we see spiderwebs everywhere
high stacks of cardboard boxes
a few dusty pieces of furniture
the big car oddly long and tall covered with a tarp
suddenly theres a scurrying of loud musical notes
clarice turns scared her beam capturing
an old upright piano
youre playing a piano miss starling
that wasnt me
clarice crawls a bit further
theres hardly room to stand but she finally manages to wriggle upright clawing away cobwebs next to the car
holding her light under one arm she takes several flash photos of the sheds interior ending with the car
then slinging her camera over the shoulder she folds back the tarp resting it on the roof
the resulting clouds of dust make her cough
is an antique beauty a packard
its very dusty despite the tarp
curtains close off the back passenger compartment but theres a narrow gap in them
more mousy rustlings
peers in through the gap aiming her flashlight
as the thin flashlight beam picks out the broad back seat
as open album of lacy old fashioned valentines
a crumpled lap rug on the floor
and then a pair of womens shiny high heeled pumps
above these the hem of a fancy satin evening gown and a pair of pale stockinged legs
clarice recoils alarmed then steadies herself
it looks like somebody is sitting in this car
maybe you better come out now miss starling
just wait for me
under the breath maybe in about two seconds
she leans down with her camera takes a flash through the gap then tries the door handle
so is the front door
she looks around aiming her light and locates a tangle of coat hangers sticking out of a carton of bric a brac
she pulls out one of these straightens it quickly bends the tip into a hook
as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch pulling up
a satisfying click
clarice opens the door it hits stacked boxes and wont open far then very cautiously leans inside aiming her flashlight
revealing more of the evening gown
a pair of hands in white elbow length gloves one rests on the lap the other atop a large beaded drawstring evening bag
thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts
and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin
no face or head
sighs with relief
she takes a couple more flashes then very carefully lifts out the valentine album holding it by the corners and setting it atop the car
then she eases herself inside onto the back seat as the springs squeak loudly
one gloved hand slides off the lap brushing clarices thigh
clarice starts a bit then pokes at the gloved arm hard
she peels back a bit of glove revealing the white synthetic elbow
she smiles shaking her head at her own jumpiness as she reaches over the mannequins lap to loosen the evening bags drawstring
a severed human head stares back at her as the beaded material slides away
clarice lurches back gasping loudly and several long heart pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely
the head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol in a laboratory specimen jar
it is a mans head but grotesquely transformed by the addition of heavy makeup earrings and a sodden wig into a womans face
over the years the makeup has smeared badly and the pupils have gone almost milky white
staring at this terrible thing is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control
she murmurs to herself
well toto were not in kansas anymore
a loud clap of thunder as a flash of lightning illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum
moving angle on clarice as she climbs from her car runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance where a guard admits her
on a noiseless tv screen an evangelist rants waving his arms
behind him a swaying choir in gaudy robes
its an anagram isnt it doctor
pan to clarice with her wet hair plastered flat sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this tv which has been stationed so that dr
lecter cannot avoid seeing it
the rest of me
miss the rest of me
meaning you rented that place
hes lost in shadows we cant see him
he doesnt respond
clarice and the darkened call as she tries again
you put those things in there
paid for it in advance ten years ago
the food carrier suddenly swishes out of the cell making her jump up
in its tray is a clean folded white towel
she hesitates then crosses takes this
she sits again rubbing her wet hair
when he finally speaks hes on the floor too a deeper hunching darkness in the shadows occasionally striped by the flickering tv light
your bleeding has stopped
how did she stops herself its nothing
why dont you ask me about buffalo bill
surprised a beat why
do you know something about him
i might if i saw the case file
you could get that for me
why dont you tell me about miss mofet
you wanted me to find him
or do i have to wait for the lab
sighs his real name is benjamin raspail
a former patient of mine whose romantic attachments ran to shall we say the exotic
i didnt kill him merely tucked him away
very much as i found him in that ridiculous car in his own garage after hes missed three appointments
youd have him under missing person which in poor raspails case could hardly be more true
if you didnt kill him then who did
who can say
best thing for him really
his therapy was going nowhere
wouldnt it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find
and have them clomping about in my life
oh dear no
at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own
beat how did you feel when you saw him clarice
may i call you clarice
scared at first
because you werent wasting my time
do you have something you use when you need to get up your courage
scenes from your early life
i dont know
next time ill have to check
jack crawford is helping your career isnt he
apparently he likes you
and you like him too
i never thought about it
your first lie to me clarice
tell me do you think crawford wants you sexually
true hes much older but do you think he visualizes
that doesnt interest me doctor
and its the sort of thing miggs would ask
beat surely the odd confluence of events hasnt escaped you clarice
crawford dangles you before me
then i give you a bit of help
do you think its because i like to look at you and imagine how good you would taste
i dont know
or doesnt this all begin to suggest to you a kind of
theres something crawford can give me and i want to trade for it
i even wrote to him offering my help
but he hates me so he wont deal directly
lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell
as his lights rise we see that the cells been stripped bare
gone are his books drawings mattress even his toilet seat
she stands too startled
they face each other
punishment you see
just like that gospel program
when you leave theyll turn the volume way up
chilton does enjoy his petty torments
who killed raspail doctor
you know dont you
ive been in this room for eight years clarice
i know they will never ever let me out while im alive
what i want is a view
i want a window where i can see a tree or even water
i want to be in a federal institution away from chilton and i want a view
ill give good value for it
crawford could do that for me but he wont
you persuade him
almost a whisper who killed your patient
oh a very naughty boy
someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet
incredulous bill killed him all those years ago
lecter only smiles enigmatically
who is he stalking right now clarice
i wonder dont you
how many more young women will have to die before you trade with me
as clarice stares at him unsure how to respond catherine martin takes a long toke from a bong pipe
she is a tall big boned rather fleshy girl with long brown fair
her head is on the lap of her boyfriend cody theyre sprawled on a couch in the den of her well furnished apartment
the tv in on with low sound
this stuffs givin me the munchies
wheres that bag of popcorn
left the groceries in the car
he starts to rise but she pushes him back
s okay ill go
she rises goes out the front door
catherine straightens with her bag of groceries shutting her cars back door
she sees a short distance away standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck
his right forearm is in a cast and sling he is struggling unsuccessfully to hoist an armchair into the truck
parked nearby other cars rvs a boat on a trailer
a thin breast high fog fills the lot arc lights make yellow pools
catherine hesitates then crosses towards the man
help you with that
his voice is odd strained very soft
a fog lamp set on end on the ground distorts his features from below
we cant get a good glimpse of his face but his body is plump above average height hes in his mid s
she sets down the bag then together they easily lift the chair into the truck
lets slide it up you mind
he climbs inside the truck ducking under a small hand winch and grabs the chair
she hesitates again but climbs in after him together they slide the chair forward behind the seats
are you about a size
suddenly in the shadowy dark he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast
she moans slumps unconscious sliding off the armchair to lie on her stomach
he pulls off his cast and sling tosses them aside then hops out of the truck grabs his lamp climbs back inside and pulls the door shut
he bends over her face with the lamp
we hear her shallow breathing
he peels back the collar of her blouse reading the size tag
he carefully slits her blouse up the back with a pair of bandage scissors peeling apart the two halves
theres no bra strap
he strokes her bare skin delicately very happily
low angle close on catherines grocery bag as her blouse is tossed out beside it
sound of the trucks motor starting
the truck backs up one rear wheel knocking over the bag partly squashing it
then is drives away taillights shrinking as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag
close on a large video screen where a blurry image gradually sharpens resolving into two separate pieces of fabric
electron microscopy reveals fiber signatures that are nearly as distinct as fingerprints
clarice sits at a long table with other trainees
ardelia is beside her
other tables and students in the background
each trainee has his own microscope
clarice is tired but straightens hearing both of these blouses were worn by victims of buffalo bill
they were found in two different states and four months apart
he always slits them up the back like a funeral suit
successively closer views of the cut fabric edges until we are seeing individual threads big as tree limbs
the cuts match
the bunching you see this compression is characteristic of scissor cuts rather than a single blade
and as you see bill always uses the same pair
as john brigham the gunnery instructor sticks his head in
are you in here
clarice and brigham walk briskly down the hall passing other trainees
he carries a small canvas bag
get your field gear take stuff for overnight
youre goin with crawford
some fishermen in west virginia found an unidentified girls body
its a buffalo bill type situation
been in the water about a week and jack needs somebody that can print a floater
think you can handle it
thinking quickly ill need the big fingerprint kit
and the one to one polaroid the cu with film packs and batteries
brigham steers as they pass hangars parked planes an airstrip
clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend bag
jacks pretty tough on you isnt he
hes got a lot on his mind besides buffalo bill
his wife bella is real sick
im tellin you about it now cause he may never
clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient rather dilapidated beechcraft
its door is open the twin props and beacons already turning
brigham turns to her holding out his small canvas bag
youre goin in the field so you gotta have full kit
take this its my own
clarice opens the bag stares at the big blue gun nestled in its shoulder holster
she looks up at him touched
wear it dont ever leave it in your purse
dry fire it whenever you get the chance
and do your exercises
listen i hope you never need a thing ive taught you
but youve got something
jack sees it i do too
if you ever need to you can shoot
she nods climbs out
then she looks back in at him
theyre both moved by this rite of passage but a little embarrassed
bless you starling
clarices pov out the planes window at the landscape far below
wisps of cloud a quilt of farms
clarice turns from the window looks at a think folder in her lap
the cover reads case file buffalo bill
clarice is moody distracted
she hesitates then opens the file begins to scan
police forms some handwritten
typed lab reports we catch words phrases autopsy protocols histamine analysis
grainy enlargements of bullet slugs showing matched grooves
and then a stack of victim photos
the first one taken from a good distance away shows a nude female body face down on a pebbly riverbank surrounded by bits of litter
clarice hesitates again then flips this photo to look at the next
it makes her flinch just slightly
quickly she turns through several more photographs trying hard to concentrate
he keeps them alive for three days
shows crawford standing over her swaying with the planes motion
behind him the open cockpit door the pilots back
crawford sits removing sunglasses
he rubs his eyes
why we dont yet know
theres no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death
all the mutilation you see there is post mortem
a beat he glances at her im hot are you hot
bobby its too damned hot back here
the pilot adjusts a valve
crawford turns to her again
then he shoots them skins them usually just the torsos and dumps them
each body in a different river in a different state downstream from an interstate highway
the water leaves us no fingerprints fibers dna fluids no trace evidence at all
thats fredrica bimmel the first one
shows a pretty plump cheeked brunette in her high school graduation cap and gown
she smiles at us with touching optimism
a big girl like all the rest
her corpse was the only one he took the trouble to weight down so actually she was the third girl found
after her he got lazy
as clarice stares at the girls face moved
crawford pulls a map from the file spreads it out
it shows the central and eastern u
with widely spaced hand drawn markings
blue square for belvedere ohio where the bimmel girl was abducted
blue triangle where her body was found down here in missouri
same marks for the other four girls in different colors
this new one today
washed up here
he marks with a flair pen elk river in west virginia about six miles below u
theres no correlation at all between where theyre kidnapped and where theyre found
he shakes his head what if what if you trace the heaviest traffic routes backwards from the dump sites
do they converge at all
good idea but he thought of it too
weve run simulations using different vectors and the best dates we can assign
you put it all in the computer and smoke comes out
no this one is different
this one has seen us coming
crawford steers following a highway patrol car along a winding mountain road
clarice has the file open on her lap
he glances at her inscrutable behind his sunglasses
talk about him starling
tell me what you see
choosing her words carefully hes a white male
serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group
and hes not a drifter hes got his own house somewhere
not an apartment
what he does with them takes privacy
hes in his s or s hes got real physical strength but combined with an older mans self control
hes cautious precise never impulsive
this wont end in suicide like they often do
hes got a real taste for it now
and hes getting better at his work
a beat impressed maybe youve got a knack for this
i guess were about to find out
quietly evenly like i have a knack for dr
he studies her a few moments measuring her anger
lets have it
you havent said a word today about that garage
or what i found there
what should i say
you did fine work
well wait on the lab
you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this
but you werent up front with me
you sent me in to him naked
beat are you finished
he starts this buzzing in me in my head
he makes me feel violated
you used me mr
a shadow of regret passes over his face but he answers sternly
maybe theres a connection maybe not
lying and breathing are the same thing to lecter
if id sent you in there with something to hide from him hed have known it instantly
hed never have trusted you
she starts to answer then is silent
he is right
by now the two cars are entering a tidy little town tree lined streets wooden houses one story shops mountains in the background
they slow turn
number three i didnt bring you along today just because you can do first rate forensics
if lecter is becoming part of this case youve got the most current read on him
and number four you dont have to like me or the way i do things
but you do have to keep a cool head
because from here on out youll know everything i do
are we straight on that
clarice nods silently its as close to an apology as shes likely to get
she stares out the windshield
the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb next to other police cars facing a big white frame house
its sign reads potter funeral home
two troopers climb from the car
crawford parks too then kills the engine
he turns to her removing his sunglasses gestures to the case file
softly you think about him long enough you get a feel for him
then if youre lucky out of all the stuff you know one little part of it tugs at you tries to get your attention
you let me know when that happens starling
live right behind your eyes today
dont try to impose any patterns on this guy
just stay open and let him show you
one of the troopers impassive in his sunglasses and hat peers in through crawfords window
crawford nods to him then turns back to clarice
schools out starling
sound of organ music as clarice carrying her fingerprint kit mounts some steps to the sidewalk
she stops seeing in their somber best filing into the mortuary for a service
the music shall we gather at the river
is issuing from the open double doors
several of the mourners glance over at her curiously
staring back at the mourners hearing the music as a sense memory is triggered in her
as we approach down the aisle of a country chapel an open wooden coffin
sad country faces turn looking at us from the flanking pews
organ hymn is shall we gather
in her best dress is reluctantly approaching the casket
her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons
on the looming coffin
closer and closer
until finally she can see lying inside it
her dead father arms folded his marshals badge still pinned to his lapel
as the grownup clarice turns towards the impatient crawford
like her he carries a large case
were around back
a young deputy several state troopers and a sheriff are all waiting as crawford and clarice enter
the dim cluttered corridor doubles as storage space theres a treadle sewing machine a soft drink machine a tricycle
the music is closer
crawford shakes hands with the sheriff
jack crawford fbi
this is officer starling
we appreciate your phoning us
grim unsociable i didnt call you
that was somebody from the state attorneys office
for you do a thing else im gon find out if this girls local
it could just be somethin that outside elements has dumped on us
he casts a sidelong unhappy glance at clarice
well sir thats where we can help
if i dont even know you mister
now well extend you ever courtesy just soon as we can but for right now sheriff this ah this type of sex crime has some aspects id rather discuss just
between the two of us
know what i mean
he indicates clarice with his eyes
the sheriff hesitates nods then lets crawford guide him into a small office closing the door behind them
muffled words from there
burning at this slight is left alone with the troopers who peek at her with shy curiosity
she pulls her blazer a bit tighter self conscious about her bulging shoulder holster
as after a few more moments the sheriff and crawford emerge
the sheriff still not very happy addresses his deputy
oscar run fetch dr
akin from the chapel
and tell lamar to come on when hes done playin that music
crawford in one corner of the room has set up a litton policefax fingerprint transmitter
sound of many mens low voices in background
he is on the phone and has to speak loudly
i need a six way linkup
chicago detroit cleveland st
louis atlanta and dallas
can you hear me
he looks around frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere
is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves
she raises her voice turning up her natural accent by several notches
you officers and gentlemen
listen here a minute please
theres things i need to do for her
as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies and troopers
they gradually fall silent looking at her
yall brought her this far and i know her folks would thank you if they could
now please go on out and let me take care of her
go on now
the men look at one another a little bashfully then begin to to file out whispering among themselves
as they go a bright green body bag is revealed tightly zipped lying on a porcelain embalming table
it is almost the only modern object in this victorian room with its glass paned cabinets and faded wallpaper decorated with cabbage roses
as he looks at clarice with a new degree of respect
men brush by him till finally only two are left dr
akin a family g
and lamar a lean whiskey reddened mortician
sound of the door closing
lamar dabs around his nostrils with vicks vaporub
on phone were starting
tell everybody to stand by for fingerprint transmission
at a side counter has turned back to her open fingerprint kit
she is lifting out a camera when she hears the zipper of the body bag being slowly opened behind her
one gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts involuntarily to the sudden smell
she blinks at her reflection in the cabinet glass then steels herself to turn look at the corpse
pause softly bill
she steadies herself by raising her camera takes a flash photo
akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girls arms
a piece of fishing line with multiple hooks is still snagged around it dangling
crawford leans in for a closer look
shell have to go to the state pathologist at claxton when youre done
crawford nods i better get on back for the rest of that service
lamarll help you
shaken lord almighty
he leaves and clarice leans into shot taking another photo
what do you see starling
well shes not local
her ears are pierced three times each and shes wearing green glitter nail polish
looks like town to me
on the calf of one of the girls legs as clarice trails the inside of her bare wrist along the skin
she waxed her legs i think
a big girl just like the others but she was careful about her appearance
as lamar joins them for a closer look
two of the fingernails are broken off and theres dirt or grit under the others
she tried to claw her way through something
ill scrape out samples after ive printed her
she takes another flash then quickly reloads film
them fishhooks are set too close together
no wonder the franklin boys was scared to say they found her
think they were runnin a trotline
crawford and lamar both look at her curiously
to crawford its a fish and game violation
theres a big fine
are you from around here
they do it lots of places
get photos of her teeth
then well fax her fingerprints to washington try to trace her through missing persons
staring blue eyes short reddish hair
clarice sets the polaroid with its special attachments against the face while lamar gently retracts the lips
each time the camera flashes theres a bright glow inside the cheeks
as clarice examines a developing print
shes got something in her throat
she hands the print to crawford he and lamar look at it as she searches in her kit
when a body comes out of the water alots of times theres like leaves and things in the mouth
clarice holds up a pair of forceps
she glances at crawford who nods
she bends over partially out of shot and after a few moments reappears holding up a small brown cylindrical object
she turns this in the air as they all stare
what is it some kind of seed pod
nawsir thats a bug cocoon
but how come that to get way down in there
less somebody shoved it in
clarice and crawford exchange a glance
shell be easier to print if we turn her over
lamar will you give me a hand
yessir i will
clarice takes a jar from her kit carefully drops the cocoon inside
sound of the mens heavy efforts as they turn over the body off screen
she seals the jar staring into it at the cocoon
starling what do you make of these
she turns to look
low on the corpses back over the shoulders two neat triangular patches of skin are missing
as clarice looks at crawford
i dont know
i didnt see those on any of the other girls
they werent there
get close ups
clarice raises her camera leans in for another flash
clarice sits outside with her head on her knees drained
she looks up wanly as lamar appears offers her a can of coke
thanks im not thirsty
no hold it under your chin there and on your temples
coldll make you feel better
it does me
she smiles touched and takes the can
when lamar sees crawford coming outside he tactfully departs
crawford sits beside her theres a brief silence
she soothes herself with the can
when i told that sheriff we shouldnt talk in front of a woman that really burned you didnt it
she is silent that was just smoke starling i had to get rid of him
you did well in there
it matters mr
other cops know who you are
they look at you to see how to act
beat point taken
she looks at him a moment then offers the can
he opens it
when we get back i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian see if they can identify it
maybe its got some limited range or it only breeds at certain times of year
you found it starling you deserve the credit
im wondering if hes done that before placed a cocoon or an insect
it would be easy to miss in an autopsy especially with a floater
can we check back on that
shakes his head the other girls are in the ground
exhumations are upsetting for the families
ill do it if i have to but then have the lab check raspails head
he looks at her dr
lecters patient have them probe his soft palette tissues
theyll find another cocoon
you seem pretty sure of that
raspail was killed by the same man whos killing these girls
and lecter knows him
maybe even treated him
you think so too dont you
or youd never have sent me to that asylum
he looks at her for a moment then sips again
before we caught him lecter had a big psychiatric practice in baltimore
but he traveled all over the country teaching consulting
christ even testifying in murder trials
who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose just for the fun of it
a shadowy male figure looks down at us leaning over the edge of a deep hole
he holds a little white poodle in his arms stroking it
this is mr
gumb aka buffalo bill
softly rub the cream on your skin
rub it in gooood
looks up at him
she is standing on the cement bottom of the pit or oubliette about feet below floor level
the pit is bare except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket from which a thin string rises up to the basement
shes soaking wet in an orange jumpsuit and holds a squeeze bottle of skin lotion
she struggles to sound calm
my family will pay cash
whatever ransom youre askin for they rub it in
or youll get the hose again
the little dog squirms in his arms barking excitedly
yes it will precious wont it
it will get the hose
as catherine kneels turning slightly away from him
under her breath oh god
she unzips her jumpsuit part way then squeezes some of the lotion onto a palm
she reaches inside her suit rubs it on
mister if you let me go i wont press charges i promise
youve only had me here a couple days and no
just one day
is that all
see see my mom is a real important woman
well i guess you already know that
shell pay you no questions asked
whatever cause you represent iran palestine shell see that a sudden blinding glare of light silences her
she looks up shielding her eyes
a floodlamp is descending attached to a small basket
put the bottle in the basket
no funny business or youll be sorry
as the basket stops and she steadies it
but as she slips the bottle in she sees something o
just at the fringe of the light
she hesitates looks closer
then begins to scream hysterically again and again
her outflung hand hits the lamp and in its swaying glare we see high on the concrete walls all around her dried now brownish left by many pairs of frenzied
clarice is at her desk exercising her right hand with the grip flexer while simultaneously studying a thick law book
ardelia sticks her head in the door excited
you better come see this
close on a tv screen filled with a photo of catherine martin
was listed at first simply as a missing person but is now believed to have been kidnapped by the serial killer known only as buffalo bill
the photo disappears replaced by the tv anchor himself
memphis police sources indicate that the missing girls blouse has been identified sliced up the back in what has become a kind of grim calling card
young catherine martin as weve said is the only daughter of u
senator ruth martin looks at ardelia surprised
other trainees are drifting into the rec room some whispering among themselves
clarice stares back at the tv intently
the republican junior senator from tennessee
and while her kidnapping is not at this point considered to be politically motivated nevertheless it has stirred the government to its highest levels the president himself being said to
be and i quote intensely concerned
just moments ago senator martin made this dramatic personal plea
fills the screen in a halo of lens flare as she speaks to a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her georgetown home
a tall woman late s with a strong taut face
im speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter
her name is catherine
you have the power to let catherine go unharmed
shes very gentle and kind talk to her and youll see
her name is catherine
clarice is moved by what she sees
other trainees are all around her
whispers boy is that smart
why does she keep repeating the name
somebodys coaching her
theyre trying to make him see catherine as a person not just an object
you have a chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful as well as strong
please i beg you release my catherine
as we see night telephoto a taped off section of catherines parking lot
technicians with instruments are kneeling by the crushed grocery bag
in memphis the investigation continued throughout the night as state and local authorities were joined at the kidnap scene by agents of the fbi
as jack crawford is seen striding towards the front door of catherines apartment followed by burroughs and other agents
one of them moves quickly towards the camera waving it back
as the other trainees send up a brief ironic cheer
but ardelia turns sympathetically towards the troubled clarice
i dont know whether to say im sorry or congratulations
you just went prime time
the massive victorian building looms over constitution avenue
clarice quickly mounts the steps carrying a small plastic box
i dont think he knew that shes a senators child
shes a big girl starling like all the rest
were going on the theory she was randomly targeted by size
clarice now accompanied by a museum guard walks through an eerie landscape of dinosaur bones crouching skeletons with blank eye sockets gaping fangs
by now bills had her for hours
that leaves us just more before he kills her
but maybe just maybe starling we caught a real break this time thanks to you
beat we found another bug in raspails head
close on an live enormous rhinoceros beetle as it weaves its clumsy way among the men on a chessboard before finally stepping off the edge onto a lettuce leaf
you lured him with produce
shows two entomologists both ish hunched over the board
roden is a pudgy redhead pilcher is lean quite handsome
its still my turn
if the beetle moves one of your men does that count
they look up delighted to see clarice in the doorway
both men are hopelessly smitten by her
of course it counts
how do you play
grins officer starling
moving angle as clarice and the two men go briskly down a hall lined with mounted insects in all shapes and sizes
roden peers at clarices new cocoon in its box
where the hell did this one come from
its practically mush
you really dont want to know
your west virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble but i finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy studying the skin
im the one who found his perforating proboscis
are you wearing a gun right now
clarice nods ooh cool
can i see it
just ignore him
hes not a ph
very close magnification on the sliced cocoon as roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis
the whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it
the wings are just like wet tissue paper
are hunched over a formica table peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays
clarice watches curiously
of their two specimens pilchers moth is in much better condition a big brown creature its wings outspread on towel paper
without looking up what do you do when youre not detecting officer starling
i try to be a student dr
ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer
the amusing house wine
smiles not lately
but maybe someday
he looks up at her shyly
a little moment passes between them before roden straightens exultant
points with his dental probe west virginia
officer starling meet mister acherontia styx
he moves aside for clarice to get a closer look at pilchers specimen
she leans forward intently
the wide furry brown back of the moth
and there right between the wing bases wonderful and terrible to see is natures perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull
better known to his friends as the deaths head moth
the latin name comes from two rivers in hell
your man he drops these girls into rivers every time
didnt i read that
as she looks up at him awed excited almost trembling
and theres no way no natural way these couldve wound up in the bodies
shakes his head they live in malaysia
in this country theyd have to be specially raised from imported eggs
pause then softly dr
as the two men stare at her puzzled we hear a sound upcut the wail of police sirens and
an awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an intersection while normal traffic is held back by highway patrol cruisers
the lead cars turn off hit the entrance ramp to the freeway sirens going tires squealing red flashers
on a speeding surveillance van with long antennas and a small satellite dish near the head of the motorcade
maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs starting with u
the van is crammed with an impressive array of hi tech equipment all clicking and humming
burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone while another agent works a computer
maybe we can locate some of raspails old lovers
sit in swivel seats at the rear by a big window
clarice cant resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention
but for catherine martin it all comes down to you and lecter
youre the one he talks to
hes already offered to help
what would happen if we just showed our cards asked him for bill
he offered to help starling not to snitch
that wouldnt give him enough chance to show off
remember lecter looks mainly for fun
never forget fun
but if he knew we have so little time if we act too anxious hell make us wait
hell let the senator keep hoping day after day until catherine finally washes up
thatd be the most fun of all
i think he means it this time
i think hell deal
what would it take
transfer to a new prison
with a view of trees he said or even water
can we swing that
shakes his head state to federal jurisdiction
we can do it eventually but well never get all the clearances in time
can you convince him a deals already in place
youll back me up with some paperwork
he nods then ill try
but wouldnt this have more weight coming from the senator herself
hesitates she doesnt know what were up to
and we cant afford to let her find out
clarice looks at him surprised
shes the mother starling
she cant possibly comprehend what lecter is
shed make the mistake of pleading with him
hed feast on her pain till the last second of that girls life
chilton approaches walking briskly down a corridor in the administration wing
he looks quite agitated
we cant trust frederick chilton either
hes greedy and ambitious
if he knew about lecters link to bill hes go straight to the newspapers
chilton falls into step beside clarice who has her briefcase
he points his gold pen at her accusingly
what youre doing miss starling is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me
for the third time
chilton i told you this is just routine follow up on the raspail case
hes my patient
i have rights
grabs her arm stopping her im not just some turnkey miss starling
i shouldnt even be here this afternoon
i had a ticket to holiday on ice
she stares at him with pity and distaste till he lets go
im acting on instruction dr
handing him a card this is the u
now please either discuss this with him or let me do my job
she walks away leaving him speechless with frustration and hostility
he clicks his pen watching her go
lecter sits at his table languidly sketching with charcoal on butcher paper
he uses his own hand and forearm as a model
his other drawings books and bedding have been restored
wouldnt you say clarice that for a united states senator youre an odd choice of messenger
clarice sitting again at the desk chair is taking papers from her briefcase
i was your choice dr
you chose to speak to me
would you prefer someone else now
or perhaps you dont think you can help us
that is both impudent and untrue
tell me how did you feel when you viewed our billys latest effort
beat he smiles or should i say his next to latest
by the book hes a sadist
lifes too slippery for books clarice
typhoid and swans came from the same god
beat tell me miss west virginia was she a large girl
big through the hips
they all were
and what else
she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat
that hasnt been made public yet
we dont know what is means
was it a butterfly
pause staring at him a moth
how did you predict that
im waiting for your offer clarice
clarice looks down at her papers taking a moment to collect her thoughts
she looks up at him again evenly
if you help us find buffalo bill in time to save catherine martin the senator promises you a transfer to the v
hospital at oneida park new york with a view of the woods nearby
maximum security still applies but youd have reasonable access to books
he is silent
she rises moves closer carrying papers
best of all though one week a year youd get to leave the hospital and go here
points to a map plum island
every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour
under swat team surveillance of course
his face remains neutral
she puts the papers in his food tray
copy of the buffalo bill case file copy of senator martins terms
her offer is final and non negotiable
if catherine dies she slides his tray through you get nothing
a measured beat before he rises smoothly crosses and looks down at the papers without touching them
plum island animal disease research center
thats just part of the island
it has a very nice beach
terns nest there
if i help you clarice it will be turns with us too
quid pro quo
i tell you things you tell me things
not about this case though about yourself
yes or no
she is silent yes or no clarice
catherine is waiting
tick tock tick tock
she looks at him
they are standing uncomfortably close
whats your worst memory of childhood
she hesitates quicker than that
im not interested in your worst invention
the death of my father
dont lie or ill know
clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes
she looks past him hesitating again
he was a town marshal
one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore
they shot him
he was strong he lasted almost a month
my mother died when i was very young so my father had become the whole world to me
after he left me i had nobody
i was ten years old
youre very frank clarice
i think it would be quite something to know you in private life
quid pro quo doctor
the significance of the moth is change
caterpillar into cocoon into beauty
billy wants to change too clarice
but theres the problem of his size you see
even if he were a woman hed have to be a big one
lecter theres no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence
transsexuals are very passive
youre so close to the way youre going to catch him do you realize that
tell me why
after your fathers death you were orphaned
what happened next
clarice drops her gaze i dont imagine the answers on those second rate shoes clarice
i went to live with my mothers cousin and her husband in montana
they had a ranch
a cattle ranch
horses and sheep
how long did you live there
why so briefly
i ran away
did the rancher fuck you
did he try to
quid pro quo doctor
billys not a real transsexual but he thinks he is
he tries to be
hes tried to be a lot of things i expect
you said i was very close to the way wed catch him
there are three major centers for transsexual surgery johns hopkins the university of minnesota and columbus medical center
i wouldnt be surprised if billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been rejected
on what basis would they reject him
the personality inventories would trip him up
rorschach wechsler house tree person
he wouldnt test like a real transsexual
how would he test
lecter snarls loudly stretching
clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles turning his movement into an elaborate yawn
he gathers the papers from his tray
thats enough i think
oh and clarice next time you will tell me why you ran away
shall i summarize
shaken yes doctor
very close on a cocoon split along its back as a living deaths head moth wriggles torturously free
trembling and damp the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade
you should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers
we see a big wire cage holding several of the moths
they crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs wings pumping lazily
in the distant background the incongruous sound of show music
check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records
at about knee level as we leave the cage and begin to travel through this eerie dimly lit warren of a cellar
as we go occasionally turning corners or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages various objects loom briefly into view overhead a stainless steel work table
a big sink
jars of chemicals
neat racks of gleaming knives
among those who tried to conceal their past look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence
possibly youll find a childhood incarceration
then go to their personality tests
we pass a row of female mannequins some nude some wearing colorful leather jackets designer knockoffs in various stages of completion
then a huge maroon armoire in chinese lacquer its double doors are slightly ajar
the jaunty background
music is growing even louder fats waller singing bye bye baby
and now we hear something else too the rapid clicking of a sewing machine
study their drawings especially
billys house drawings will show no happy future
no baby carriage out in the yard
no pets no toys no flowers no sun
we turn another corner and there is mr
as we approach his wide back is to us hes hunched over an old fashioned sewing machine humming cheerfully and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see
a female wig rests near him on a head form
he wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono and pumps the treadle with his bare feet
his females will be more crudely sketched than him males but hell compensate by adding exaggerated adornments
jewelry big breasts
and his tree drawings oh his trees will be frightful
next to mr
gumb is an antique phonograph source of the music
his little dog precious perches by his plump ankles
as we pass mr
gumb precious scurries away from him panting happily and we follow the little dog down another corridor the music starting to fade behind us
billy hates his own identity he always has and he thinks that makes him a transsexual
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage
he wants to be reborn clarice
he will be reborn
at the end of this final corridor the cellar widens into a low ceilinged chamber with two additional doorways and in the center of this is the gaping circle of
precious sniffs her way over to the edge excited tail wagging than barks happily as we hear a hoarse ghostly moan from below
moving angle close on dr
lecters slippered feet which rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck
rising along his tilted form we see that his ankles are linked by steel restraints
his legs waist upper torso and arms are bound by heavy canvas webbing
beneath the webbing is a strait jacket
and over his face is a hockey mask
bad news hannibal
shows that dr
lecter on the handtruck is being pushed down his corridor by barney and back into his open cell
gourmet magazine has rejected your recipe for braised kidneys
chilton lounges on dr
lecters cot casually reading his large stack of private correspondence and making notations with his gold pen on a little pad
another orderly mops the floor
perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind
to barney stand him by the toilet
then leave us
barney props the hand truck into position then both orderlies go
chilton finishes another letter sighs happily
such a lot of correspondence
i can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail
but first things first
tossing letters onto the cot he rises crosses out into the corridor and bends to remove a small tape recorder from underneath clarices desk
he waggles it triumphantly at dr
i thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in miggs death so i bugged you
not a word to me in all these years hannibal
then crawford sends his bit of fluff over here and you just turn to jelly
its too pathetic
as chilton back in the cell leans tauntingly close to the front of dr
you still think youre going to walk on some beach and see the birdies
i dont think so hannibal
i called senator ruth martin and she never heard of any deal with you
she never heard of clarice starling either
they scammed you hannibal
close on dr
lecters glittering eyes behind their slits
when crawford gets through milking you hes giving you to baltimore homicide for the raspail murder
and theyre preparing some special surprises for you right now in my electroshock room
first looking at chiltons moving lips
then lowering to his soft white inviting throat
the starling bitch wants you to rot here in this little box till your teeth fall out and youre soiling diapers
youve seen the old ones hannibal
they weep when their stewed peaches get cold
thatll be you too
unless you trade with me
as he sits chummily on the table
there never was a deal with senator martin but there is now
ive been on the phone for hours hannibal on your behalf
heres what you get if you identify buffalo bill and the girl is found in time senator martin will have you transferred to brushy mountain state prison in tennessee
as they shift restlessly away from chilton then suddenly lock onto something
they widen with interest
the governor has already agreed
you get books a view of the woods and plenty of exercise time
on the cot carelessly left there lying half hidden under the letters and the rumpled sheet
is chiltons gold pen
and best of all youd be out of jack crawfords reach forever
the senator will verify these terms on the phone and guarantee them in writing
as he stares a moment longer at the pen then shifts his eyes towards chilton
we can almost hear his brain clicking
in exchange i get your full cooperation in publishing a professional account of this my successful interviews with you
you publish nothing
and i get exclusive access to any material from catherine martin
do you accept my demands
pause answer me hannibal
lecter is silent
chilton sticks his face into shot almost intimately close to the mask
he is agitated
youll answer me now or by god youll answer to baltimore homicide
who is buffalo bill
pause then softly ill tell the senator herself
but only in tennessee
moving angle as the very impatient crawford clutching a folder strides down a hall beside dr
danielson early s severe in a lab coat
nurses doctors glance as they pass
im not having a witch hunt here mr
our patients are decent non violent people with a real problem
danielson the man we want was never your patient
it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence
please doctor time is eating us up
just show me the ones youve turned away
danielson enters a cramped stainless steel nurses gallery with crawford following and pours himself a cup of coffee
adamantly examination and interview materials are confidential
weve never violated an applicants trust and we never will
you want to see a violation
this is a violation
he takes a black white photo from his folder slaps it down in front of danielson
from our angle we cant see it clearly
her name is kimberly jane emberg she was just idd
i met her on a slab in west virginia
and sometime tomorrow or tomorrow night hes going to do the same thing to catherine martin
thats a childish bullying stunt mr
i was a battlefield surgeon so you can put away your picture
burroughs sticks his head in looking for crawford
snaps in a minute
burroughs hurriedly retreats
crawford strains for patience
search your own records if you prefer
you can do it a lot faster than us anyway
if we find buffalo bill through your information ill suppress it
nobody has to know this hospital cooperated
i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret mr
truth will out
and then what
will you give johns hopkins a new identity
put a big pair of sunglasses on this building and a funny nose
oh thats clever dr
you like the truth
right in his face enraged he kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off
we dont want him to do that anymore
if you dont help me just as fast as you can then the justice department is going to ask publicly for a court order well ask twice a day just
in time for the morning and evening news
and each one of our press conferences will focus on dr
danielson over at johns hopkins and how were still hoping for his cooperation
and every time theres any news on the case when catherine martin floats when the next one floats and the next one why well just issue another press release about
good ol dr
danielson over at johns hopkins complete with all his humorous fucking remarks
pause stiffly it may be that i could confer with my colleagues on this
and get back to you
would you doctor
that would be so kind
crawford is on the scrambler phone
burroughs watches silently
on phone stunned transferred
hayden burke the fbi director swivels in his big chair
lean late s very distinguished
his desk is flanked by flags
on phone already airborne for memphis
senator martins meeting him at the airport
uneasily jack did you make some sort of promise to lecter in the senators name
listening to the answer he looks uncomfortably across his desk at paul krendler the deputy attorney general very tanned modish haircut
krendler is irritable impatient
on phone were going to have to talk about this jack
the senators mad as hell
paul krendlers over here from justice shes asking him to take charge in memphis
i know that
but youre still in command of the task force and lecters plane can still be ordered back
its your call jack but i want it now
burroughs starts to make an objection but crawford stills him with a hand motion
he is taut frustrated
into phone let him land
clarice opens her door stares out at crawford
shes just slipping on her blazer over her shoulder holster
chilton has killed her hasnt he
that slimy little bastard
we were so close with lecter and now her last chance is gone
lets get some coffee and talk
moving angle on clarice and crawford as they walk along a sidewalk sipping from paper cups
the surveillance van trails them slowly radios crackling
are you in trouble over this mr
can senator martin do something to you
if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv id still have to retire in two years
its not a consideration
but you are
beat youve done enough
if i keep you out of school any longer youll be recycled
cost you six months at least
i can guarantee you readmission here but thats about it
he stops looks at her nows your chance starling
go back to class
leave bill to me
if you didnt want me chasing him you shouldnt have taken me to that funeral home
he looks at her steadily then nods
they walk on
lecter is still the key i know he is
whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before
or just as worthless
but i want you in memphis close to him
maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin hell talk to you again
theres a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip
she smiles at this acknowledgment he never thought shes quit
i lied to lecter
ill need some kind of peace offering
can i get the drawings from his cell
meantime try to get a feel for catherine martin
her apartment her friends
how he mightve stalked her
im going to the other two clinics minnesota and ohio
he crumples his cup tosses it nows the hardest part starling
use your anger dont let it keep you from thinking
just keep your eyes on catherine
weve got less than hours
can those cops down there handle dr
grimly theyll use their best men
but they better be paying attention
close on dr
behind his mask the alert searching eyes
two sturdy well armed veteran prison guards are checking dr
lecters restraints with clever careful fingers
welcome to memphis dr
im officer boyle this is officer pembry
we aim to treat you just as nice as you treat us
act like a gentlemen youll get three hots and a cot
but we aint pussy footin with you buddy ruff
you get cute try to bite somebody
well tie your asshole in a knot
oh yes officer pembry
i certainly do
the officers turn away boyle signing a clipboarded form
under his breath shit hes just an ol broke dick
wont be no trouble as all if he dont flip out
as we see that were in a vast dusty hangar
parked to one side an ems ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers a dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there
prentiss is pacing impatiently casting anxious glances towards the open hanger doorway
if youll please sign right here sir well have us a legal transfer
chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold pen its gone
he searches other pockets with growing unhappiness
here they come
glide smoothly into the hangar stop
secret service agents pour out of the lead car form a cordon
a driver opens the rear door of the second car and krendler steps out followed by the senators assistant with a briefcase followed as last by the senator herself
barely glancing around she strides towards lecter
as she stops struck by the bizarre spectacle of his restraints
the others instinctively keep a distance but chilton with theatrical relish unstraps and removes dr
senator martin meet dr
they stare at one another for a long moment the senator tense almost haggard the madman with his unearthly poise
lecter ive brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights
youll want to read it before i sign
he assistant unsnaps his briefcase reaches for the form
i wont waste your time and catherines time bargaining for petty privileges
clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already
i only pray they havent doomed the poor girl
let me help you now and ill trust you when its all over
you have my word
krendler raises a pad poised to take notes
buffalo bills real name is william rubin
i met him just once
he was referred to me in april or may by my patient benjamin raspail
they were lovers but raspail had become very frightened
apparently rubin had murdered a transient and done things with the skin
he thought if i could cure billy then billyd be safe from the police and hes be safe from billy
obviously he was wrong
we need his address a physical descr did you nurse catherine
pause startled what
did you breast feed her
he flicks his tongue obscenely
you son of a the senator stills him with a hand
she is trembling
toughened your nipples didnt it
a beat then rapidly bored six foot one strongly built about pounds
hair brown eyes pale blue
hed be about now
he said he lived in philadelphia but may have lied
thats really all i can remember senator but if i think of any more ill let you know
to the others lets go with it
they start towards the car but he calls out stopping her
you cant trust jack crawford or clarice starling
its such a game with these people
theyre determined to get the arrest for themselves
the collar i think they say
thank you doctor
ill keep it in mind
oh and senator
love you suit
close on scraps of food peas chicken bones lying on the cement floor of the pit near the foil tray of a tv dinner
muttering feisty close enough to fuck is close enough to fight
is hunched over in concentration
the plastic toilet bucket is on her lap and she has yanked down its cotton string
get my legs round your neck you goddamn creep ill send you home to jesus
are tying a chicken bone to the buckets handle where it meets the string
the other end of the string is tied to her wrist
gathers the coiled string in one hand and swings the bucket by its handle calculating this distance up to the basement floor
time for a treat
she hurls the bucket upwards
the bucket sails out bounces loudly then falls back inside
who is elsewhere in the basement worrying a toy
she cocks an ear making a low growl then sets off to investigate
catherine swings the bucket again trying another cast
two feet beyond the pits edge rolls a bit stops
then pauses staring curiously towards
the enticing chicken bone six feet away
it twitches as catherine tugs on the string edging the bucket back towards the pit
precious with her tail wagging barks greedy but suspicious
staring upwards pulls again even so gently at the string
cmon boy nice yummy bone
cmon you little shit
edges reluctantly closer
then suddenly rushes in seizing the bone in her teeth
she tries to run away with it but catherine is pulling her towards the hole working her like a hooked fish
her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop
stares desperately unable to see how shes doing
hang on boy
still fights for the bone growling as the bucket rocks precariously on the edge of the pit
a long seesaw battle
until finally when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole she panics and lets go
the bucket flops over the edge
crouches covering her head as the bucket bounces off her
furious barks down at her then trots away in disgust
as she sinks to the cold cement
she slaps aside the foil tray the scraps of food sobbing in utter despair
close on a framed photo of sen
martin and catherine held in clarices cotton gloved hands
powdered fingerprints on the glass
clarice glances up from the photo smiles disarmingly at a young state trooper sitting in catherines easy chair
he smiles back at her then relaxes returns to his newspaper
he also wears gloves
clarice closes the refrigerator door glances around
a big reel to reel tape recorder has been set up on the breakfast counter attached to catherines phone
two new red phones are hooked up as well
clarice slides open the medicine cabinets mirror looks inside
she reaches in pokes carefully amongst the lotions
a ceiling hatch bangs open sending up dust clouds
clarice lit from underneath pokes her head through looking around
flat on her back clarice wriggles out from under catherines bed
she sits up brushing dust from her face and hair
close on an open multi tiered jewelry box resting atop a bureau as clarices fingers pick through costume jewelry
clarice closes the box and is just turning away when a figure suddenly looms into shot giving her a bad start she cries out softly
senator martin is revealed staring at her suspiciously
who are you please
i thought the police were through in here
im clarice starling senator
softly very angry clarice starling
calls out paul
would you come in here please
krendler enters from the hallway looks at clarice
miss starling you may know the deputy attorney general mr
paul this is the trainee that jack crawford sent to lecter
she lied to him pretending to have my authority and thus jeopardized this entire investigation
now she has the further gall to invade my daughters privacy again without permission
if her little games have killed my baby
overcome she hurries from the room
krendler shuts the door behind her points sternly at clarice
youre out of line starling and youre off this case
back to quantico
crawford instructed me your instructions are what im giving you now
jack crawford answers to the director and the director answers to me
my god crawfords losing it
he shouldnt even be on this with his wife sick as she is
how the hell did you get in here anyway
he gave you what
some kind of special id
lets have it
stubbornly i need the id to fly with my gun
the gun belongs in quantico
turn in the id as soon as you get back
the gun too
be on the next plane starling theres one in minutes
clarice burning starts for the door then turns back
lecter trusts me
or at least he used to
if i could just lecter has already named buffalo bill
clarice reacts surprised
krendler takes a folded computer sheet from his pocket shoves it at her
she takes it reads
he gave us a perfectly good description and were on it now so we wont be needing your little novelty act any longer or his either
hes under close guard at the courthouse pending a prison transfer
the next plane officer
sir doesnt this william rubin strike you as i dont know kind of vague
krendler moves in very close to her pale with anger
do you need a police escort starling
or do you think you can find the airport by yourself
i can find it by myself
the old courthouse is a massive gothic stronghold with an armada of police cruisers parked at the curb
clarice climbs from her rented car slamming the door angrily
holding a rolled up pile of papers dr
lecters drawings she starts determinedly up the steps
a nearby commotion makes her pause
frederick chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini cams is preening grandly
clarice carefully avoiding his gaze slips up the steps and inside
tate a memphis policeman is studying clarices id
he looks up at her from his command desk a bit doubtfully
are you with mr
i just left him
access to lecter is strictly limited
weve been getting death threats
hesitates again log in and check your weapon
he picks up a phone murmurs into it
as he does so clarice glances around this main ground floor lobby
the building looks like an armed fort
cops with shotguns guard the front door both ends of the hall the foot of the stairs the single elevator
more of them are coming and going
shoot we havent had this kinda security since the president came through town
clarice and officer murray a young patrolman ride up in an old fashioned creaking metal cage elevator
he is excited
every cop in tennessee wants a look at this guy
sit true what theyre sayin hes some kinda vampire
beat i dont have a name for what he is
pembry at a desk by the door looks up from examining the unrolled pile of dr
you know the rules maam
yes officer pembry
ive questioned him before
he waves her on her way but retains the drawings for now
as she crosses the big spare white octagonal room
a massive temporary iron cage has been installed officer boyle sits facing its barred door
he rises nods moving away to allow her privacy
a cot and a small table each bolted to the floor and a flimsy paper screen hiding a toilet
lecter sits at the table his back to her studying the buffalo bill case file
he now wears a green prison jumpsuit
a small cassette player is chained to the steel table
without turning good afternoon clarice
she stops at a striped police barricade before his bars
i thought you might want your drawings back
just until you get your view
how very thoughtful
or did crawford send you here for one last wheedle before youre both booted off the case
nobody sent me
i came on my own
he spins in his swivel chair stops neatly
a coy smile
people will say were in love
beat pity you tried to fool me isnt it
pity for poor catherine
he spins again in his chair playfully
as she circles the cage trying to keep his face in sight
lecter you find out everything
you couldnt have talked with this william rubin even once and come out knowing so little about him
you made him up didnt you
youre hardly in a position to accuse me of lying
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore or starting to
tell me the rest now
ive studied the case file have you
everything you need to find him is right in these pages
whatever his name is
then tell me how
first principles clarice
read marcus aurelius
of each particular thing ask what is it in itself what is its nature
what does he do this man you seek
he kills w sharply as he stops no
close angle two shot as he rises pained by her ignorance and crosses to the bars
what is the first and principal thing he does what need does he serve by killing
anger social resentment sexual frus no he covets
thats his nature
and how do we begin to covet clarice
do we seek out things to covet
make an effort to answer
we just no
we begin by coveting what we see every day
dont you feel eyes moving over your body clarice
i hardly see how you couldnt
and dont your eyes move over the things you want
all right then tell me how no
its your turn to tell me clarice
you dont have any more vacations to sell on anthrax island
why did you run away from that ranch
lecter when theres time ill we dont reckon time the same way clarice
this is all the time youll ever have
later listen ill ill listen now
after your fathers murder you were orphaned
you were ten years old
you went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in montana
and one morning i just ran away
she turns from him
he presses closer gripping the bars
not just clarice
what set you off
you started what time
then something woke you
did you dream
what was it
the year old clarice sits up abruptly in her bed frightened
she is in a montana ranch house it almost dawn
strange fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls
a window partly fogged by the cold eerie brightness outside
i heard a strange sound
what was it
crosses to the window in her nightgown rubs the glass
i didnt know
i went to look
shadowy men ranch hands are moving in and out of a nearby barn carrying mysterious bundles
the mens breath is steaming
a refrigerated truck idles nearby its engine adding more steam
a strange almost surrealistic scene
some kind of screaming
like a childs voice
is terrified she covers her ears
what did you do
got dressed without turning on the light
i went downstairs
in her winter coat slips noiselessly towards the open barn door
she ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand who passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind
he goes into the barn and she edges after him reluctantly
i crept up to the barn
i was so scared to look inside but i had to
as the open doorway looms closer
bright lights inside straw bales the edges of stalls then moving figures
and what did you see clarice
is held down on a table by two ranch hands
the lambs were screaming
a third cowboy stretches out the lambs neck raises a bloody knife
just as hes about to slice its throat staring into the distance shaken still trembling from the childs shock
we see dr
lecter over her shoulder studying her intently
they were slaughtering the spring lambs
they were screaming
so you ran away
first i tried to free them
i opened the gate of their pen but they wouldnt run
they just stood there confused
they wouldnt run
but you could
i took one lamb
and i ran away as fast as i could
a vast montana plain and crossing this a tiny figure the little clarice holding a lamb in her arms
where were you going
i dont know
i had no food or water
it was very cold
i thought if i can even save just one
but he got so heavy
the tiny figure stops and after a few moments sinks to the ground hunched over in dispair
i didnt get more than a few miles before the sheriffs car found me
the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman
i never saw the ranch again
but what became of your lamb
no response clarice
as the adult clarice turns staring into his feverish eyes
she shakes her head unwilling or unable to say more
you still wake up sometimes dont you
wake up in the dark with the lambs screaming
do you think if you saved catherine you could make them stop
do you think if catherine lives you wont wake up in the dark ever again to the screaming of the lambs
i dont know
i dont know
a pause then oddly at peace thank you clarice
a whisper tell me his name dr
i believe you know each other
as clarice turns startled and the fuming chilton seizes her elbow
pembry and boyle are beside him looking grim
sorry maa m weve got orders to have you put on a place
clarice struggles pulling free of them for a moment
will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming
moving closer to the bars yes
ill tell you
he smiles then why not take your case file
i wont be needing it anymore
he holds out the file arm extended between the bars
she hesitates then reaches to take it
as the exchange is made his index finger touches her hand and lingers there just for a moment
widen crackling at this touch like sparks in a cave
good bye clarice
hugging the case file to her chest stares back at him as the men crowd in on her pushing her away
lecter head cocked in a smile slowly recedes
moving angle mr
gumbs pov as he pushes a rolling rack of completed leather garments each wrapped in plastic down as aisle
sound of many sewing machines all clattering at once as he passes row on row of work tables
the seamstresses mostly black or hispanic glance up as he passes then quickly avert their eyes his presence disturbing them in some nameless way
a thin foreman in a flowery shirt sees him approaching
he rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully as the rack rolls to a stop
punctual as always
and what have you brought us today
he seizes one of the dangling jackets pulling up the plastic wrapper
he examines it stroking the sleeve
you know i always say youre the leonardo of leather
a harsh whisper oil
youre leaving oil on the skin
the foreman quickly releases the jacket
youll be wanting your mr
gumbs hand reaches into shot snatching an envelope from him
the foreman is watching him walk away as a seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments
the foreman is vaguely troubled but shakes it off
he strokes the jacket again admiringly
to seamstress i wish we had a dozen like him
sound upcut glenn gould playing bachs goldberg variations
clarice in a line of other passengers is moving slowly towards a departure ramp
through a huge plate glass window we can see her plane
she glances back over her shoulder at a pair of uniformed cops brawny and impassive their arms folded waiting to make sure she board the flight
clarice sighs turning wearily back towards the jetway
the bach continues as we
close on a steaming rather elegant dinner tray being carried by pembry as he approaches dr
shouts ready when you are doc
the bach is issuing from the cassette player
beside it on the table the pile of dr
the top one is an accurate sensitive portrait from memory of clarice
beyond the table we see lecters shadowy form seated behind the paper screen
he calls out from there
just another minute please
pembry grunts sets the tray down
boyle joins him handing him a riot baton and a mace cannister which pembry fastens to belt clips
boyle is similarly armed and carries a ring of keys
sumbitch demanded lamb chops for dinner extra rare
laughs what you reckon hell want for breakfast some fuckin thing from the zoo
lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet swaying slightly eyes closed lost in the music tongue working in his cheek
suddenly like magic a little shiny piece of metal protrudes from his lips
he plucks it out opens his eyes
he is holding the pocket clip from prentices disassembled pen a straight thin strip of metal with a circular collar at one end a square edge at the other
lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge then braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim
he pushes down hard using both hands for leverage
after a moment he smiles holding up the result and twirling it before his eyes
the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers
pembry and boyle turn as the toilet flushes and dr
lecter reappears looking jaunty
okay doc grab some floor
same drill as lunchtime
lecter sits on the floor legs straight then wriggles backwards
he stretches his arms behind him hands and wrists through the bars with two bars between them and clasps his hands
im ready when you are officer pembry
pembry comes around the cell to squat behind dr
he tugs his hands farther out rather roughly handcuffs his wrists
he shakes the cuffs making sure of them then nods to boyle
as boyle picks up the dinner tray and pembry crosses around
pembry takes the keys from boyle unlocks the cell door and pushes it inward
boyle goes inside with the tray
watches as boyle approaches the table above five feet from him
boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear off some of the mess of drawings
the music plays on
lecters hands outside the bars as the makeshift key held between the tips of his right index and middle fingers searches for the keyhole of the cuffs
and finds it
as he finishes clearing the drawings then turns back towards dr
lecter stooping to pick up the tray
is just inches from the tray when dr
lecters hand darts into shot snapping a handcuff onto his wrist
looks up astonished to find himself right in the grinning face of dr
lecter who just as quickly rolls sideways and snaps around the bolted leg of the table
and suddenly all natural sound and motion are suspended as the music soars much louder each separate note of it now echoing distinctly and we see
pembry starting into the cell reaching for his riot baton
lecter smashing against the cell door driving it into pembry pinning him across the chest against the door frame
boyle on one knee on the floor digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key
pembrys hand mashed against his body by the door as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist
pembrys eyes widening in horror as he stares at
lecters bared teeth flashing towards him
lecter gripping pembrys face in his jaws shaking it like a dog shakes a rat
boyle finding his key but in his terror dropping it
lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed pembrys belt spraying him in his bloody face then clubbing him to his knees
boyle mouth open in a silent scream finding his key again unlocking the handcuff but then as he starts to rise seeing
lecter standing over him with the riot baton raised high he swings it viciously down again and again and again
then normal sound and motion are restored as we go to the cassette player and the portrait of clarice both now flecked with blood
in addition to the bach we now hear soft panting close by and whimpering sobs in the background
eyes closed lost in a favorite passage of the music
his bloody fingers drift airily with the notes as his breathing slows to normal
he opens his eyes sighs contentedly looks down
by the sprawled legs of boyle lie various objects that spilled from his pants pocket coins a comb a big pocketknife
picks up the pocketknife examines it happily
about a four inch blade
he becomes aware of the whimpering off screen turns
as he crawls with torturous slowness towards the command desk and the phone
he is crying but frantically determined
above the desk hanging from pegs are his and boyles holstered revolvers
the bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards then indicates a stop there at the top floor
at his command desk as he stares at the indicator
another cop jacobs sits on the desks edge flipping through a magazine many more cops can be seen beyond them idling in the lobby
what is this shit
did somebody go up to five
jacobs shakes his head call pembry ask him what a gunshot and then moments later two more quick ones echo down the nearby stairwell
tate jumps to his feet grabs a radio mike as the other cops stir confused and noisy
into mike cp shots fired on five
repeat shots fires on five
outside posts look sharp weve got a
ho ly shit
has begun to descend
down to then past
as he reacts
the other cops behind him are now in a full uproar shouting pulling out guns
to the others shut up
guard mount double up on your outside posts
bobby get the vests
rainey howard cover that fucking elevator if it comes all the way to it stopped
has indeed frozen at
tate lifts the microphone again
into mike seal off a ten block radius
get me the swat team and an ambulance double quick
were going up
high angle on sgt
tate as he leads a five man squad all in bulletproof vests up the stone stairs
they move fast but carefully covering each other from landing to landing with drawn revolvers shotguns
the distant back music makes a ghostly echo in here
a thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator door
we cant see inside
the music sounds closer
approaches very cautiously gun aimed
the other cops behind him fan out silently to set up angles of fire checking the various office doors all locked as they creep up
as he reaches the side of the elevator hesitates then spins to point his gun inside
he backs away
shouts at ceiling pembry
angle on the door from inside its lettering reversed on the frosted glass
the bach is very loud
after a moment the door is shouldered open hard enough for the glass to shatter tate following his gun inside moving low then other cops appearing behind him in the
they all freeze staring in utter horror
is a brief snapshot from hell
the two uniformed bodies one sprawled on its back near the door the other still in the cell have been savaged by a knife
blood and gore everywhere
the faces are unrecognizable
struggles for control as the other cops move grimly around him into the room
he pulls his walkie talkie from his belt
into mike command post
two offi a beat clears his throat two officers down
prisoner is missing
repeat lecter is missing
hes stripped the bed might be making a rope check all windows
where the fuck is my ambulance
a cop angrily punches off the music
jacobs kneels with his fingers on boyles neck
boyle is dead sarge
his guns gone
a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist
murray the young patrolman brings his ear reluctantly close to the gory face
a bloody bubble appears there the wreckage groans very softly
this ones alive
tate crosses kneels to see for himself
murray looks green
take ahold of him where he can feel your hands son
talk to him
whats his name sarge
its pembry now talk to him god dammit
into radio looking around boyles dead pembrys read bad
lecter is missing and armed he took boyles gun
the other cop checking the cylinder of pembrys gun holds up one finger to tate
into radio pembry got off one round theres a chance lecter was hit
we heard a total of three shots fired so hes got four left
hes got a knife too
various angles on a floodlit scene of barely controlled pandemonium
flashing red lights men shouting commands sirens in the distance
swat members in full gear leap from a black van
swarm up the steps
ems orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance
cops kneel for cover behind cars aiming guns and rifles up at the windows
a trio of ems orderlies work fast over the body already strapped on its gurney
they bandage a big plastic airway into place over the butchered face checking for a pulse at the neck
young murray crouches sickened gripping a bloody fist
youre just fine pembry lookin good buddy youre gonna make it
one orderly massages the heart
another is popping a plasma bag ready to insert the needle when the body starts convulsing
downstairs lets go
quickly the gurney is elevated wheeled out of the room with cops rushing forward to open the doors help push swat men are running by in the hall automatic rifles
at the ready
tate riding down with jacobs has his radio out
into mike ten four lieutenant
im on the elevator bringing it down
pembry and boyle are both cleared top three floors secured main stairwell secured
hes somewhere on a spot of blood falls on his cheek
he and jacobs stare at each other
another spot hits his shoulder
they look up
blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch
tate motions for silence as both men draw their guns
into mike uh were pretty sure hes somewhere on two sir
thats all for now over
the elevator doors open and tate and jacobs hurry out stepping quickly to the side
tate reaches back in and locks the elevator into position with its doors open
other cops are rushing up to them curious as tate frantically pushes them aside gesturing for silence
whispers hes on the roof of the elevator
two swat officers peterson and kubell turn a key unlocking and opening this floors elevator doorway
the shaft is dark
lying prone they inch up to the edge peterson extends a mirror on a long pole out into the shaft
is a distant figure in a green prison jumpsuit lying on his stomach atop the elevator
a shiny revolver is near one hand
whispers into a radio as kubell carefully tips an assault rifle with a flashlight taped to its barrel over the edge
i see him
theres a weapon by his hand
hes not moving
can you get the drop
we got the drop
then take him out
peterson nods to kubell who switches on the flashlight as peterson shouts down the shaft
put your hands on your head
the green figure shows no movement
as peterson mutters to kubell
put one in his leg
the figure below as kubells gunshot roars echoing hugely in the shaft and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg
the figure doesnt stir
staring down the shaft raises his mike again
okay johnny hold your fire
a small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway from both sides
tate crouches next to the swat commander
into radio mike were coming into the car were opening the hatch
watch his hands
any fire will come from us
the swat commander hands his radio to another cop then looks at tate
a long tense moment
then he waves a signal
as we follow a picked team of four swat cops in full body armor rushing into the elevator car
two men move to the corners aim assault rifles at the ceiling
a third man sets a stepladder in place and the fourth man armed with a big colt hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch
the service hatch as the hinged cover drops open and a body tumbles through dangling head first until its caught at the waist
we see the back of the head
shoulders through the swat cops for a closer look
he turns towards the swat commander astonished
in the rear chamber a young ems attendant is braced against the vehicles sway
behind him the stretchered form of his patient and through a curtained opening the driver
sound of the siren
into radio mike hes comatose but his vital signs are good
behind him in slightly blurred focus the bloody figure sits slowly upright
his convulsions have stopped but hes got so much loose skin on his face its hard to tell if suddenly he stops becoming aware of a strange hissing
he turns puzzled
in lecters fist flashes high in the air
moving angle on the ems ambulance as it races along normally its siren blazing the heavy flow of traffic parting to make way for it
then suddenly it begins to weave erratically changing lanes before drifting dangerously to a full stop almost side ways
cars swerve to avoid hitting it honking angrily
on the stopped ambulance
after a long still moment the wind shield wipes come on incongruously then stop
then the siren is shut off and the flashers
the ambulance starts rolling again at first jerkingly then with increasing speed
we follow it for several more moments until is passes and we linger on
that reads memphis international airport miles
lecters face is slowly revealed as he wipes across it with a fistful of gauze tossing it aside
moving angle rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie over waving grasses
a long passage
before we come at last to the girl clarice sitting with her lamb hunched in despair
she rises her face tear stained and turns from us
holding the lamb she starts back the way she came
moving angle very rapid down this road
coming at last to a stopped highway patrol car
clarice with her lamb is standing in the cars headlights
she starts wearily towards the sheriff
crane angle sweeping rapidly down into the barnyard towards the arriving highway patrol car as it stops
rushing to the little girl as she steps from the car holding the lamb
the dark figure of the rancher enters frame
as he roughly takes the lamb from her we hold on a closeup of her face stunned blank
she exits frame
moving angle clarices pov as she walks towards the open barn doorway
it looms closer
the rancher is revealed a shadowy figure pinning the lamb on the killing table
his knife hand sweeps up high then holds
he turns to camera his face breaking into the light and it is the face of dr
he smiles his terrible smile at the young clarice
moving angle coming in very close on the adult clarices face shocked devastated as she stands alone by the dangling receiver
close on a shower head as water suddenly blasts out
clarice moves into shot as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively almost desperately unable to get clean
they found the ambulance
clarice is hunched on her cot in a bathrobe her hair wet
the buffalo bill case file a thick bundle rests by her feet
ardelia hovers anxiously nearby
in the parking garage at memphis airport
the crew was dead
he killed a tourist too
got his clothes cash
by now he could be anywhere
clarice looks up
her eyes are red rimmed with exhaustion and something close to despair
she reads ardelias thought
he wont come after me
bitterly it would be rude
and he wouldnt get to ask any more questions
ardelia sits beside her touches her arm
clarice you did the best anybody could have for catherine martin
you stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried
its not your fault it ended this way
the worst part the thing thats making me crazy is that bill is right in front of me
only i cant see him
touching the case file lecter said everything i need to catch him is right here in these pages
lecter said a lot of things
shakes her head hes here ardelia
ardelia stares back at her
sound upcut the low throb of a washing machine
clarice has spread out the case file across two washing machines
ardelia cross legged on a dryer studies another pile of forms
nearby is their laundry basket detergent box
surprised hey is this lecters handwriting
she holds up the map with its location markings for the kidnapping and body dump sites
clarice takes it looks
with newly inked words in dr
lecters precise elegant hand
clarice doesnt this random scattering of sites seem overdone to you
doesnt it seem desperately random like the elaborations of a bad liar
as clarice looks up at ardelia puzzled but excited
what does he mean
not random at all maybe
like theres some pattern here
but there is no pattern
theres no connection at all among these places or the computers wouldve nailed it
theyre even found in random order
well except for the one girl
beat what girl
the one that was weighted down
where is she
they search among the inserts
clarice finds the graduation photo
fredrica bimmel from belvedere ohio
the first girl taken but the third body found
cause she didnt drift
he weighted her down
he didnt weight the others
clarice moves on fire unable to keep still
the first what the hell did lecter say about
first principles he said
what does this guy do he covets
how do we first start to covet
we covet what we see she stops turns
she grabs the photo of fredrica from ardelia stares at it
she looks up trembling
softly hot damn clarice
he knew her
clarice and crawford are seated in front of director burke whos at his desk
another chair is empty because krendler is pacing
all four are nearing their boiling points
maybe he lives in this this belvedere ohio too
maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously
maybe he just meant to
give her a up and talk about the choir
but then starling but then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them
thats what lecter was hinting
the market in lecter hints is way down today okay
ive got two good men dead in memphis and three civilians
ive got who the hells fault is a u
senator whos half out of her head because her daughters going to be murdered today
and all because of your mind games with fucking lecter
if you hadnt interfered hed still be in custody in baltimore
jack you sent in a green recruit with a phony goddamn offer youre just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape
all of you
a long silence as they all struggle to regain composure
crawford who was at the point of striking krendler finally retakes his seat
burke looks sadly at crawford and clarice
very reluctantly starling im afraid i have no choice
youre suspended from the academy
crawford starts to interrupt not another word
to clarice this is pending a reevaluation of your fitness for the service
i promise youll get a fair hearing
youre ordered to take compassionate leave
youll spend the rest of the day briefing the ags office then transfer command of the task force effective by hours
beat im sorry jack
take care of bella
clarice and crawford stare back at him drained
a long and very painful silence
not even krendler looks happy
clarice and crawford walk out slowly stand there a moment not knowing what to say not wanting to face each other
all his victims are women
his obsession is women he lives to hunt women
but not one women is hunting him except me
i can walk in a womans room and know three times as much about her as a man would
beat i have to go to belvedere
you heard them
i dont have that authority anymore
you do until six p
he stares at her sadly
he looks for the first time defeated old beyond his years
ohio is cold ground
picked over ten months ago
our people worked it so did the locals
but not from this angle
not thinking he knew her
youve got to send me
im bureau for years starling
i wont disobey orders not even now
but i just became a private citizen
i can go anywhere i want to
with id and a gun
impersonating a federal agent is a felony
hes going to kill her mr
this morning or maybe at noon but today and belvederes our last chance
im flying there right now unless you stop me
you want my id
here take it
he stares at her a long moment
clarices passion and future
his loyalty to the bureau
pulls out his wallet theres about here
and a hotline code number
theyll patch you through to me wherever i am
she raises her hand to him
she wants to touch him face or his neck but cant
finally she takes his money and card
he watches frightened for both of them as she backs away smiles then turns racing towards the surveillance van
sound upcut the scratchy recording of fats waller singing as we
close on the needle of the victrola on the spinning record as mr
gumbs fingers lift away
music continues in background
calling out preeeeecious
close on the moth cage as mr
gumbs fingers search through the humus and find a plump new cocoon lifting it out
the door of the cage is left open and one or two of the adult moths flutter out
precious come on precious
busy busy day today
close on a clean towel beside the sink
the cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives
mommas gonna be sooo beautiful
close on a stainless steel colt python with a six inch barrel as the cylinder is spun and the hammer gets a practice cock
the metallic click is deep and loud
a note of alarm has entered mr
you come here this minute you little scamp
low angle on mr
gumb wearing the kimono as he walks through his sewing workroom
his back is to us he is looking anxiously under the furniture
he stops straightens
gumb as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber
he stares inside his face in shadows
from the distant bottom of the pit we hear catherines voice
shed down here you sack of shit
gumbs fist flies to his mouth and he sags against the doorframe
a little groan escaped him the dog answers with a series of yips
gumbs dark shape leans cautiously over the edge
precious are you all right
crouched to one side clutching the dog to her chest
gumb the dog squirms frantically barking
get me a telephone
lower it down to me
do it now mister
i dont want to have to hurt this little dog
gumb as with a cry of fury he whips the colt from inside his kimono
the muzzle gleams as he takes aim
catherine yanks the dog up into his line of fire screaming at him
you shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or ill break her fucking neck i swear to god
tucking the dog under one arm she grabs its muzzle twisting the head
the dog whines piteously
back off you son of a bitch
gumb cries out again a terrible inarticulate scream of rage and anguish
but then he slowly lowers his gun
on catherine as she maintains her grip
now get me a live telephone
get a long extension and lower is down here
and you better do it fast too cause i think her legs broken
shes in pain mister she needs a vet
stares down at her a long beat breathing heavily
you think shes in pain
you dont know what pain is
but youre going to find out
and abruptly he vanishes
sound of his footsteps rushing off
begins shaking hands and arms twitching uncontrollably
she hugs the little dog tight to her chest buries her face in its fur sobbing
high angle as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb stops
after a moment clarice climbs out a bit stiffly
double checking this address she glances up from a folded street map to in a row of similarly shabby homes all backing onto a narrow river
a path of boards laid over mud leads back along this house towards the brown water
sound of hammering from there
an awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish water
the birds cooing mixes with the hammering
a tall gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a new coop
approaches him and the man lowers his hammer
he has red rimmed eyes of watery blue
his face is deeply seamed
he stares back at her warily
high angle looking down as mr
bimmel leads clarice up a steep flight of steps
the bannister is worn sags a bit
i dont know nothin new to tell ya
the police been back here so many times already
fredrica went into columbus on the bus to see about a job
she left the interview ok
she never come home
clarice pauses at the landing to look at a framed photo the familiar graduation portrait
others pictures show fredrica as a young girl toddler infant plump and hopeful at each age
her rooms how she left it
just shut the door when youre done
clarices pov moving slowly as she takes in flowery chintz curtains
posters of madonna and blondie
a twin bed with worn stuffed animals on the pillow
a big sewing machine in the corner
turns absorbing nuances
there is loneliness here an echo of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling
a shrill meow and she looks down
is rubbing against her ankles
picks up the cat scratches behind his ears
she glances up
she and the cat stares back at their own reflection
sitting at the desk turns the pages of a high school yearbook
the cat is curled on her lap
kneeling by the old decca record player flips through lps and singles
the cat has wandered off
pulling a string to light up the closet
she is surprised and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe groaning from the rod
a shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing supplies in clear plexiboxes
she flips through the hanging clothes pulls out one dress on its hanger for a closer look
is very big to fit fredrica but beautifully cut
some of the seams still look unfinished
she turns it around sees a blue tissue dressmakers pattern still pinned to the back
as clarice turns looks towards it
she hangs the dress on the closet door knob crosses to sit at the machine
she takes off its dust cover
she runs one hand over the cool metal as a taunting memory forms in her mind
billy wants to change too clarice
but theres the problem of his size you see
she turns looks again at the unfinished dress
suddenly she straightens her attention riveted by something
on the printed pattern down at the lower back of the outlined dress are two bold black triangles
we rush closer to there shapes before jumping back to who stares at them starting to tremble
even if he were a woman hed have to be a big one
those missing triangles of skin on the dead girls back in the funeral home in west virginia
as she jumps to her feet with a fierce joy
clarice paces in an exuberant rush amidst the worn furniture
into phone hes making himself a woman suit mr
crawford out of real women
and he can sew this guy hes really skilled
a dressmaker or a tailor starling thats why theyre all so big because he needs a lot of skin
he keeps them alive to starve them awhile to loosen their skin so that starling we know who he is
and where he is
were on our way now
pause surprised where
crawford sits at a communications console with burroughs in headphones by his side
this forward section of the cabin is crammed with hi tech equipment all lit up and whirring
through a window we see clouds part of the jets wing
into speaker phone calumet city edge of chicago
ill be on the ground in minutes with the hostage rescue team
im back in charge starling
as clarice reacts her happiness for crawford is tinged with disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt
on phone sir thats great news
but how johns hopkins finally came up with a name for us
we fed him into known offenders and he came up cherries
takes a paper from burroughs subjects name is jamie gumb aka john grant
lecters description was accurate he just lied about the name
from the rear of the cabin forward as we slowly pass the twelve man hrt
theyre seated in full gear hardshell armor quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons silencer automatics shotguns stun grenades
this gumbs a real beauty
slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric
where starling he took vocational rehab and learned a useful trade
take a bow
customs had some paper on his alias
they stopped a carton two years ago at lax live caterpillars from surinam
the addressee was john grant
calumet power lights given us two possible residences under that alias
were hitting one chicago swats taking the other
eagerly chicagos only about miles from here
i could be there in no starling there isnt time
and youve still got crucial work to do in ohio
we want him for murder not kidnapping
im counting on you to link him to the bimmel girl before hes indicted
clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment
ill do my best
pause gently starling youve earned back your place in the academy
we never wouldve found him without you and nobodys ever going to forget that
least of all me
thank you sir
switches off feeling bad for her
on the console near him the fax machine starts to chatter
he turns looks
here he comes jack
an emerging sheet as gumbs face is printed out
we see just his hair then the top of his forehead before we
clarice walks slowly across the yard absorbing all this news before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her fist in triumph with a happy yelp
then she sees staring at her in surprise
he sits by his coops smoking
somewhat embarrassed crosses over to him
did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb from calumet city
or john grant
he shakes his head did she know any men that sew
she sewed for everybody
stores ladies whatever
i dont know about men
who was her best friend mr
whod she hang out with
the fbi turbojet is parked its gangway down
crawford burroughs and the hrt squad carrying their bags of weapons clatter rapidly down the metal steps
freaked me out
get your skin peeled off is that a bummer
stacy hubka short perky early s sits nervously at her desk talking to clarice who jots in her notebook
in the background
beyond them bank tellers lines of waiting customers muzak
they said she was just rags like somebody stacy did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb
or john grant
stacy shakes her head do you think she couldve had a friend you didnt know about
she had a guy ida known believe me
sewing was her life she was really great at it
did you ever work with her
oh sure men pam malavesi used to help her do alterations for old mrs
lots of people worked for her she had the business from all these retail stores
but she was like totally old it was moren she could handle
where does mrs
id like to talk to her
she went to florida to retire like two years ago
she dies own there
clarice reacts disappointed at the ending of this trail
beat shyly is that a pretty good job fbi agent
i think so
you get to travel around and stuff
i mean better places then this
sometimes you do
freddie was so happy for me when i got this job
this toaster giveaways and barry manilow on the speakers all day she thought this was really hot shit
what did she know big dummy
suddenly shes fighting tears
clarice reaches to hug her
wide angle on what appears to be at first a calm ordinary neighborhood of working class two and three story houses
but the street is strangely quiet deserted
after a few moments we become aware of movement armed dark clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs to garage corners from parked cars to porches appearing and
close on mr
gumb as he settles a big pair of infra red night vision goggles over his eyes
moths flutter past his face
his mouth is set in a grim line
an hrt cop prone beneath a hedge is joined by a nd hrt cop who throws himself to the grass beside him
they both take aim with their scoped rifles at the front door of a big nearby split level house
close on a fuse box as mr
gumb reaches in flips a switch
the lights go out
sound of a second switch and the cellar is bathed in a green glow
a little boy riding his tricycle in his driveway is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of crouched by his garage armed to the teeth
as the little boy starts to cry the cop pulls him into the shadows covering his mouth
gumb in his kimono and goggles creeps silently through his workrooms knees bent painted toes places ever so delicately the colt held aloft as more moths flutter past him in
the eerie light
a florists van turns the corner comes slowly down the street and stops at the curb in front of the split level
the driver in a gray deliverymans uniform and cap climbs out of the cab walks briskly to the panel door on the street side of the van and slides it
he leans in comes out with a long thin red ribboned floral box starts calmly towards the house
gumbs pov moving angle on the top of the oubliette a glowing green circle in the dark as it draws closer and closer
and then catherine comes into view at the bottom of the pit
she is crouched exhausted staring straight up at him but she cant see him in this infra red darkness
precious is curled into her stomach asleep
the futon is up to catherines waist but theres a clear shot at her head and neck
looking down at her smiles
moving angle on the deliveryman seen from behind as he mounts three steps to the split levels front porch
tucked into the small of his back if a mm
have slipped out of the van and are crouched behind it now with drawn guns watching tensely as settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm reaches
out with his right hand towards the buzzer
slowly savoring the moment mr
gumb aims the big colt which is already cocked using both hands
he is just about to squeeze the trigger when we hear his door buzzer surprisingly loud and close by
he turns startled and sees the extension buzzer mounted high on the wall which is making the hideous grating jangle
it finally stops but not before waking precious who starts frantically barking off screen as raises his gun again spinning back towards where catherine hearing but still not seeing him
quickly yanks the futon over both herself and the dog
instantly the two of them become one squirming indistinguishable mass
bites his lip his aim wavering as he cant decide where to safely place his shot
the maddening buzzer sounds again even more insistently and he cries out with frustration and fury
but as the buzzer continues he reluctantly uncocks his gun looking up angrily towards his front door
the door opens on a chain and clarice peers in smiling
i wonder if you could help me
im looking for mrs
gumb frowns out at clarice
for the first time ever we get a well lit view of his bland pale eyed moon of a face
they dont live here anymore
the deliveryman yanks a lb
sledgehammer from the floral box swings it with all his might against the door knob blowing it through as crawford and burroughs race towards the door guns up
gumb starts to close the door only to have clarice push back against it politely but firmly
she holds up her id
excuse me but i really do need to talk to you
this was mrs
did you know her
beat just briefly
whats the problem officer
a bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot through it exploding on the floor
an instant later a black clad hrt cop dives through the shattered glass rolls across the floor comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed off shotgun
clarice and mr
gumb still eyeing each other through the door crack
im investigating the death of fredrica bimmel
who are you please
gordon did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs
was she a great fat person
i may have seen her im not sure
moving angle as burroughs moves quickly down a hallway and enters the living room where crawford is standing with his gun held down by his side surrounded by several other
burroughs shakes his head nothing here
gumb glances briefly over his shoulder towards his kitchen then turns back to clarice with a smile
lippman had a son maybe he could help you
i have his card somewhere
do you mind stepping inside while i looks for it
which rests on a counter just inside the open kitchen doorway
through this doorway we watch as mr
gumb at the end of his front hall slips the chain
clarice enters closing the door behind her
moving angle towards the front door as frustrated hrt cops file out of the empty house rifles slung across their shoulders
walking across the grass towards the van when all at once he stops in his tracks shaken by a sudden flash of intuition
on his stricken face
clarice pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag glances around the musty looking room
that horrible business i shiver every time i think about it
overstuffed furniture porcelain figurines
one archway onto the front hall another onto a dining alcove and through there the kitchen
gumb is crossing to a rolling desk raising the top
he bends over begins poking through cubby holes
his tone is casual neutral
are they close to catching somebody do you think
i think we may be yes
gumb stiffens almost imperceptibly
his back is to her as he continues opening drawers rustling papers
gordon did you take over this place after mrs
i bought the house from her two years ago
did she leave any records here
tax or business records
maybe a list of employees
as he continues his rummaging
no nothing at all
has the fbi learned something
because the police here dont seem to have the first clue
out of the folds of his kimono crawls a deaths head moth
it creeps slowly to the center of his back raising its wings
do you have his description yet or some fingerprints
unaware is still glancing around the room
for several agonizing moments we think she wont see the moth but then she turns does see it and her eyes freeze
a beat of pure fear
a tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm
no we dont
very carefully she drops her notebook back into her bag lowers the bag to the floor
with her fingertips she brushes back the edge of her blazer loosening its drape
turns back towards her cheerfully holding out a business card
heres that number
keeps her distance
they are about ten feet apart
good thank you
gordon do you have a phone i can use
is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him flutters past his face
he turns looking at it
he looks back at clarice his mouth still open
are unmoving locked on his
stare back at her widen
and they know each other
softly in the kitchen
ill show you
whips her gun out gripping it in both shaking hands
slowly tilts his head to one side smiles at her
tries to force more authority into her voice
gumb youre under arrest
down on the floor hands and legs spread move it
turns then all at once in two quick steps he is gone disappearing into his dining alcove then kitchen
hesitates just a split second to shoot him in the back and then its too late
clarice hurries inside moving low swivelling her gun
the kitchen is empty
to one side a door still shuddering on its hinges
rushes to this pauses then elbows the door aside aiming her gun down brightly lit leading to the cellar
two doors facing the bottom both open
no sign of mr
hates this hates this which door its a trap what to do she is very scared but suddenly hears the distant scream of catherine martin somewhere down there in that
rushes through the doorway and down the stairs
behind her on the kitchen counter theres an empty space the colt python is gone
moving angle with clarice hurrying down the steps
more screams they seem to be coming from the left door
clarice goes that way entering a brick walled passage pipes over head naked bulbs
the lighting though dim is incandescent mr
gumb has switched off his infra red system
clarice comes to a t shaped intersection stops
another scream again to her left and the barking of a dog
follows her gun around the corner looking right
but doors opening off it he could be lurking behind any of them
she looks left
sees an opening onto some kind of chamber
the noises are louder coming from there
moves cautiously towards this chamber
clarice moves in hugging the wall gun swivelling
the open top of the pit
beyond it the other two doorways opening onto this room jesus he could come through either one of them or come up behind her
she moves to the pit looks down very briefly sees catherine screaming hysterical and a little white dog barking
kneels staring up from one door to another she cant cover them all shes totally exposed and whats a dog doing there
fbi catherine youre safe
safe shit hes got a gun
youre all right
where is he
get me out
ill get you out
just be quiet so i can hear
shut that dog up
still swivelling is there a ladder
is there a rope
i dont know

listen to me
i have to find a rope
i have to leave this room just for a minute but nooooo
you fucking bitch dont you leave me down here dont you you shut up
then louder the other officers will be here any minute
youre perfectly safe now
ignoring catherine whose shouts turn to sobs she backs away turns picks one of the other doorways moves into it quickly
clarices pov moving down this passageway towards a new room
pausing at the doorway straining to hear
no sound except catherines crying not in the background and clarices own rapid breathing
then she crouches lower angle bursts forward through the doorframe sidestepping
clarice weaves back and forth half crouched gun out back to the wall
her face glistens with sweat as she takes in
gumbs sewing machine
his swivel chair
the old victrola
big moths are crashing into the light bulbs overhead theyre everywhere
suddenly from just behind her a click and a hum and spins almost shoots before seeing with its thermostat just switching on
gasps for breath fighting for calm
she turns again slashing her free hand at the moths moving quickly on
clarice moves past the mannequins all of them naked now
then quickly past the huge chinese armoire ready to shoot into it
its doors yawn open it is empty except for several padded hangers
she moves on past the big sink with its dripping faucet
the counter with its gleaming knives
the rows of chemical jars
at the end of this room is clarice starts to open it then hesitates
looking around she seizes a wooden chair wedges it under the door know sealing off this section of the cellar
with her back thus defended she turns softly retracing her steps
passing again through the workroom clarice pauses seeing a half curtained door to one side that she had previously skirted
she crosses to the door listens and hears no sound inside takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob
she twists it and as it turns shoves hard and follows her gun inside all in one quick move
an old fashioned bathroom tiled floor sink toilet and a big free standing tub
an opaque shower curtain suspended from an oval ring hides whatever might be inside
centers her gun on the curtain at chest height and yanks it aside with her left hand
no one standing there
something lower down catches her eye
she leans in stares more closely not understanding at first that shes seeing sticking up from the tub which is filled with hard red purple plaster
the hand is dark and shriveled with pink nail polish and a dainty wristwatch
as is reacting with horror to this sight the lights go out to be replaced a split second later by the eerie green glow of mr
gumbs infra red system
clarice cries out turns blindly reaching for the door cant find it free hand clawing desperately into what is for her utter darkness
sound of catherine keening again in the far distance
clarice stumbles goes to her knees rights herself finally clutches the door frame
clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half crouch arms out both hands on the gun extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes
she stops listens
in her raw nerved darkness every sound is unnaturally magnified the hum of the refrigerator
the trickle of water
her own terrified breathing and catherines faraway echoing sobs
moths smack against her face and arms
she eases forward then stops again listens
she eases forward again following her gun and creeps directly in front of and then past who has flattened himself against a wall arms spread like a high priest colt
in one hand
he wears his goggles and kimono and under that draping down over his naked arms like some hideous mantle his terrifying half completed suit of human skins
this is an exquisite moment for him a ritual of supreme exaltation
he smiles at clarice as completely unaware she moves beyond him exposing her back
very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her taking his gun in both hands aiming
the colt python as in slow motion his thumbs cock the hammer the sound registering as a loud metallic click and spins still in slow motion flame already leaping from
her gun muzzle as we see almost at point black range guns roaring hugely one flash from mr
gumb and one two three four flashes from clarice overlapping his and then as the echoes crash deafeningly with normal speed restored as the side of her face hits the
floor and she is gasping stunned by the noise and flames there is blood on her check and an ugly powder burn but she ignores them twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket locking it blindly onto her guns cylinder reloading right in front of her face then rolling onto her stomach aiming her gun upward again blinking her dazzled eyes straining to locate him in the darkness
where is he where
then as the echoes finally fade she hears something else a tortured sucking whistle from perhaps eight feet away
as she crawls forward on her elbows following her gun until it bumps against mr
he is lying on his back chest a bloody mess
she slides her muzzle against his head hard but he doesnt move another shot isnt needed
he stares upwards through his goggles bloody lips working
he tries to speak but cannot
one hand reaches slowly upwards the fingers twitching as if to seize something overhead
then a final ghastly groan his hand drops he is dead
clarice feels for a pulse at his neck making sure
then and only then does she permit herself to roll over collapsing onto her back beside him
down at the two faces intimately close together like lovers on their pillow
then as we pull slowly away we see that her staring eyes and his dead gaze are both locked onto perched on an infra red bulb overhead its wings pumping
sound upcut wailing sirens many excited voices as we
the front porch of the tall victorian house is bathed in a glare of tv lights police and ambulance flashers
cars and vans and even a firetruck choke the street cops reporters ems workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective barricades
the buzz of their voices goes even higher as dazed her face bandaged comes out of the house walking protectively beside catherine who is wheeled on a gurney
they are followed out by uniformed cops then two firemen with an extension ladder
catherine blinking in confusion is still clutching the little dog and refuses to give her up even as shes trundled into an ambulance
clarice sways with exhaustion everyone seems to be shouting at her at once pulling her sleeve
she tries to fight free of them desperate for a familiar face
pulls up stops and crawford climbs out of the back seat
he makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies stopping when he sees clarice
for a long moment crawford choked with pride for her with sorrow for her ordeal with love but unable to find any words
and then he does
your father sees you
and then all at once she is sobbing her knees giving way but he is there to catch her he is hugging her fiercely
hold on them for a long beat
over loudspeaker congratulations
you are now officers of the federal bureau of investigation
the forty members of clarices class resplendent in their best dark suits and dresses rise cheering themselves then turn happily to wave to their audience as applause mounts
beyond them on a gaily tented platform the director stands behind his podium
look at one another solemnly
ardelia holds up both fists in a power shake and clarice taps them with her own
she is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls the thin scar on her cheek almost healed
ardelia turns waving towards the crowd the clarices thoughts are elsewhere
she turns searching among the dignitaries on the platform till she locates who smiles back at her with quiet pride and offers a little salute
grins more happy than weve ever seen her then turns to wave towards the crowd with the others
over the admiring sea of spectators several hundred of them still rising from their folding chairs applauding in celebration of these special young people this perfect sunlit day
sound upcut rock music laughter as we
a loud party is underway food beer dancing as the new grads celebrate ferociously
ardelia weaves her way through the crowded room reaches clarice who is flanked by her special guests pilcher and roden the two ardent scientists
ardelia has to shout at clarice over the din
surprised agent mapp
she nods to pilcher leaves them
roden who is quite happily drunk grabs the startled ardelia around the waist
hel lo gorgeous
lets get down
ardelia looks at pilcher confused
just ignore him
hes not a ph
clarice picks up the dangling pay phone speaks happily
well clarice have the lambs stopped screaming
she freezes stunned by the familiar voice
then she turns waving frantically towards who is just inside the rec room door at the end of the hall lost in conversation with pilcher and roden
ardelia glances at her briefly but misunderstands waves cheerfully back
dont bother with a trace i wont be on long enough
turns back gripping the phone more tightly
where are you dr
very beautiful glittering with countless stars
where i have a view clarice
we see a rolling lawn a curving bay
boats ride at anchor lights shimmering
orion is looking splendid tonight and arcturus the herdsman with his flock
smiles into his mobile phone
he is stretched out on a lounger on a tiled patio languidly paring an orange with a penknife
his appearance is quite altered a beard glasses lighter hair
hes has some cosmetic surgery as well
into phone your lambs are still for now clarice but not forever
youll have to earn it again and again this blessed silence
because its the plight that drives you and the plight will never end
lecter i have no plans to call on you clarice the world being more interesting with you in it
be sure you extend me the same courtesy
you know i cant make that promise
and then softly you looked so very lovely today in your blue suit
as clarice reacts the fill weight of his words sinking in
but only a dial tone comes from the phone
she is still staring at her receiver in shock as we dr
lecter sighs sets his phone down then rises
popping an orange section into his mouth he turns towards the brightly lit house
stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard he walks in through open french doors
in a swivel chair amidst the wreckage of his papers and books is the writhing figure of dr
the extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls dr
lecters own former restraints
his screams are muffled by the tape over his mouth he stares at dr
lecter like a rabbit trapped in headlights
considers him for a genial moment then raises the little pen knife
his eyes are twinkling
shall we begin
