com credits white lettering over a back background
the thunderous sounds of a massive naval barrage are heard
the power is astonishing
it roars through the body blows back the hair and rattles the ears
the roar of naval guns continues but now we see them firing
huge fifteen inch guns
heads directly into a nightmare
massive explosions from german artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the beach
hundreds of german machine guns loaded with tracers pour out a red snowstorm of bullets
june hundreds of landing craft each holding thirty men near the beaches
at the far end of the beach a ninety foot cliff
topped by bunkers
ringed by fortified machine gun nests
a clear line of fire down the entire beach
make their way toward the base of the cliffs
running a gauntlet of explosions
story the lead landing craft plows through the waves
most are eighteen or nineteen years old
trying to block out the fury around them
a huge explosion of fuel fire metal and flesh
the motorman holds his course
shells explode around them
flaming oil burns on the water
cannon fire smashes into the bow
blood and flesh shower the men behind him
the mate takes the controls
his face covered with the remains of the motorman
starts to lose it
begins to shudder and weep
his name is delancey
do their best to stare straight ahead
but the fear infects them
it starts to spread
pushes through the men
puts himself in front of delancey
the figure is captain john miller
by far the oldest man on the craft
relaxed battle hardened powerful ignoring the hell around them
he smiles puts a cigar in his mouth strikes a match on the front of delanceys helmet and lights the cigar
delancey tries to look away but miller grips him by the jaw and forces him to lock eyes
delancey is terrified
delancey captain are we all gonna die
miller hell no two thirds tops
delancey oh jesus
miller i want every one of you to look at the man on your left
now look at the man on your right
feel sorry for those to sons of bitches theyre going to get it youre not going to get a scratch
a few including delancey manage thin smiles
miller releases his grip on delancey who moves his jaw as if to see if its broken
miller pats him on the cheek and moves on to the bow
looks over the gunwale at the hell it quivers in fear
miller glances around sees that none of the men have noticed
he stares at his hand as if it belongs to someone else
it stops shaking
he turns his eyes back to the objective
the six surviving boats alongside
from the landing crafts
arc toward the top of the cliffs
a river of machine gun fire pours into the craft
a dozen men are instantly killed
among them delancey
jumps into the breakers
the germans on the edge of the cliff
rain down machine gun fire and struggle through the surf
firing up as best they can
making for the base of the cliffs
ignores the explosions and bullets
uses hand signals and curt orders
set the grappling hooks
drown out most voices
except the screams of the wounded know what they have to do
start up the ropes
into the teeth of the german defenders
back straps his thompson sub machine gun
starts climbing with the first group
the americans swarm up the ropes
taking turns firing up at the germans
a soft faced boy
grabs him by the back of his collar
roughly yanks him up
nearly choking him
they boy climbs on
an american private is hit
falls taking two others with him
all three land on the rocks below
another way to die
they leave the ropes
free climb scrambling up the rocks
joins half a dozen pinned down men
others bottleneck behind them
miller scans the route and the defenders
sees an open gap
beyond is a protective overhang
with a clear line to the top
thats the route
miller motions to six men huddled near him
take an instant to get ready
then scramble into the gap
do their best to cover them
pour fire up at the germans
no germans are hit
are cut to ribbons by machine gun fire
they fall to the rocks below
sarge mid twenties experienced millers right arm and best friend dives into the rocks next to miller
sarge thats a goddamned shooting gallery captain
its the only way
turns to the next half dozen men
move to the head of the gap
miller moves for a better angle against the machine guns
calls to jackson a tall gangly southern country boy sharp shooter
heavy southern accent you betcha captain
miller signals others where to direct their cover fire
turns to the second six
take deep breaths
head into the gap
jackson nails a pair of germans
miller cuts down two more
sarge gets one
are raked by machine guns
all are turns looking for the next six
his eyes fall on sarge and reiben who is a cynical sharp new yorker
heavy brooklyn accent captain can i put in for a transfer
sure meet me at the top well start the paperwork
moves into place
sarge and miller exchange a look
they both see the madness of what theyre doing
open up on the germans
rolls his eyes takes a breath
scrambles into the gap
the other five right behind
three are hit
potato masher grenades bounce down
the german machine gun swings toward sarge and reiben
miller sees them about to get it
miller steps out into the open
a perfect target
captains bars glinting
trying sees miller standing in the open
too much to pass up
he swings the machine gun away from sarge and reiben toward miller
a row of german bullets approaches miller
hes an instant from death
under the overhang to safety
under the overhang sarge and reiben untangle themselves
ill be goddamned
im not dead
sarge hollers back to miller
miller and his rangers lean out and fire
hit more germans
sarge and reiben run up the path under the overhang
stop near the top
pull pins on grenades
both throw long arcing over the crest perfectly aimed
putt out the two worst machine gun nests
crosses the gap
his men follow
the americans swarm over the top
two dozen germans fire back as they retreat
abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers
the germans are cut down
miller motions to wade a small wide eyed demolition man whos struggling under the weight of half a dozen satchel charges
okay wade your turn
wade captain i love it when you say that
miller sarge reiben and jackson cover wade as he races to the first of three bunkers
dodging bullets from inside
wade tosses a satchel charge into a gun port
a huge muffled explosion rocks the bunker
survey the field
what the hell were you doing
worked didnt it
you tryin to get yourself killed
dont need to the krauts go that covered
sarge shakes his head at miller then he looks over the cliff at the scores of men their shattered burning bodies covering the rocks and the beach below
hes clearly affected
miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded
then he moves on leading his surviving men toward the two remaining german bunkers
the sounds of big guns and machine guns fire surround him
dissolve to the sound of clattering machine gun fire segues to that of clattering typewriters
a huge government building stands in the heart of washington d
a dozen somber military clerks work behind desks quickly and efficiently
no small talk
older than the others sad eyed adds a sheet of paper to a large pile in his out box
an outgoing telegram
it reads we regret to inform you
killed in action
this is the paperwork of death
pulls out a file
finds something troubling
quickly shuffles through some other papers
finds what hes looking for
rises from his desk and hurries out of the office
seen through the glass wall
the clerk speaks to a young lieutenant who is visibly shaken by what he is being told
he motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the office with the clerk on his heels
again seen through a glass wall
the young lieutenant speaks to a young captain who like the lieutenant is clearly bothered by what hes being told
the captain takes the papers from the young lieutenant and strides out
a busy office
aides and secretaries scurry about
the walls and tables are covered with maps of normandy and complex deployment charts
a one armed colonel with a chest full of ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee
he clearly hasnt slept in a long time
the young captain his staff officer walks in
young captain colonel ive got something you should know about
one armed colonel yes
young captain two brothers died in normandy
one at omaha beach the other at utah
last week in guam a third brother was killed in action
all three telegrams went out this morning
their mother in iowa is getting all three telegrams this afternoon
the life drains from the colonel
others in the room hear and freeze
one armed colonel oh jesus
young captain theres more
theres a fourth brother
he parachuted in with the hundred and first airborne the night before the invasion
hes on the front
one armed colonel is he alive
young captain we dont know
the colonel regains his bearings
stands and motions curtly to the captain
one armed colonel come with me
the colonel regains his bearings
stands and motions curtly to the captain
one armed colonel come with me
the colonel strides from the room with the captain on his heels
the aides and secretaries watch them go
a black car drives along a dirt road a cloud of dust rising behind
passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn
a whit farmhouse
a stand of trees
cornfields as far as the eye can see
a tire swing
a bushel basket nailed to the barn over a dirt basketball court
four american flag decals
each one a man in service
her face shows the lines of a life of hard work and mother hood
a good woman
she wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the fields
far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind the black car
she watches the car get closer then sees it turn toward her house
she starts to grow uneasy
as the black car approaches her breath comes hard
she reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post
the car pulls up to the house
she sees three men get out one wearing a clerical collar
the first of her tears come
another busy office filled with aides and secretaries
general george marshall army chief of staff stands next to his conference table reading the ryan brother files
half a dozen subordinates among them the one armed colonel and the young captain wait
general marshall puts down the file
softly goddamn it
one armed colonel all four of them were in the same company in the th infantry but we split them up after the sullivan brothers died on the juneau
any contact with the fourth brother james
one armed colonel no sir
he was dropped about thirty miles inland near ramelle
thats still deep behind german lines
general marshall hardens
well if hes alive were going to send someone to get him the hell out of there
thats just what the generals staff wanted to hear
millers ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of german troops
the americans hug the bottoms of the craters firing back as best they can
big guns thunder in the distance
normandy hours june trailed by a radioman dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge filled crater
he surfaces sees sarge and reiben and reels from a horrific smell
their conversation is repeatedly broken by firing and jesus christ
what the hell are we swimming in
fertilizer captain i think were in a cranberry bog
out of the frying pan into the fucking latrine
look at the bright side the krauts sure as hell dont want to advance and hold this cesspool
miller barks to his radioman
get fire control we need some artillery
radioman trying sir
they all duck
sir what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while were pinned down here
dont worry were the only rangers this side of the continent weve got to be first into caen
dont you know what caens famous for sarge
the german fire diminishes for an instant
miller sarge and reiben immediately rise and pour fire at the german positions
german machine gun fire responds and they duck down again
so you ever heard of employee discounts
my uncle sells shoes gets twenty five percent off everything in the line got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen
just picture some french number been spending all day every day making cream colored shear body negligees with gentle lift silk cups and gathered empire waists what the hell you
think she wears at night
reiben how the hell do you know so much about lingerie
lingerie is my life sir
my mothers got a shop in brooklyn i grew up in it from the time i could crawl we carry caen lingerie its the best there is its all i
been thinking about since the invasion
another pause in the german shelling
reiben rises and blasts his b
r then ducks as the germans return fire
theres a war on good chance theyre not still making lingerie in caen
oh captain theyll always make lingerie its one of the three basic needs of man food shelter silk teddies
miller dream on private
happy to sir
radioman captain ive got command they want you back at h
maybe the wars over
a mortar shell explodes very close
after the debris stops falling sarge and reiben rise spitting out sludge
reiben looks dubiously at miller
i dont think so captain
to radioman stay at it until you get fire control
to sarge keep em down wait for the navy
miller waits for a pause in the mortar barrage then scrambles out of the crater and takes off in a crouch run
intermittent mortars some big german shells and fairly close small arms fire
runs over the broken ground and makes it to the sandbagged h
he stumbles down the make shift stairs
sand and dirt falls with the closest of the explosions which continue through the scene
miller salutes a major
miller company b second rangers
major go on in
miller goes deeper into the h
bunker where he finds a dozen officers with as many aides runners and radiomen
a field map dominates the center of the small space
the men in the room note miller a few nod to him respectfully
hes clearly someone special
colonel sam anderson is in command talking on a field phone
hes about fifty firm and steady the calm at the eye of the storm
he sees miller and motions for him to wait
into field phone i understand your problem but if we dont get those tanks off loaded by were going to have an entire division up at caen with its ass
hanging out of its pants
a lieutenant steps up to miller and hands him a sheet of paper
lieutenant captain heres your company address list
lieutenant for letters to the families of your killed in action
miller hands the list back to the lieutenant
find a chaplain
into field phone alright let me know when
anderson hangs up speaks to an aide
have the second and third regiments hold at st
michel until we get those tanks
aide yes sir
colonel anderson turns to miller
sector four is secured we put out the last three german one fifty fives found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc
a company wehrmacht no artillery we took twenty three prisoners turned them over to intelligence
fourty four twenty one dead
an instant of silence all hear none look
they didnt want to give up those one fifty fives sir
it was a hard assignment thats why you got it
where are your men now
pinned down a mile east of here waiting for some help from the navy guns
im sending simpson to take over for you the division is going to caen youre not coming with us i have something else for you
theres a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred and first near ramelle
i want you to take a squad up there
if hes alive bring him back to the beach for debarkation
take whoever you need youve got your pick of the company
a private sir
hes the last of four brothers the other three were killed in action
this is straight from the chief of staff
spit it out captain
respectfully sir sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesnt make a fucking goddamned bit of sense
the other officers freeze listening without turning
colonel anderson glares at miller
you think just because you hold the congressional medal of honor you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers
miller considers the question then smiles
yes sir more or less
colonel anderson looks as if hes about to bit millers head off then he smiles too
alright ill give you that
the numbers dont make sense sir
his brothers are dead thats too bad but theyre out of the equation
sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away
one private is simply not worth a squad
colonel anderson this one is
hes worth a lot more than that
which is why im sending you youre the best field officer there is
yes and no sir what about morgan
fine officer regular church goer writes poetry he might like a mission like this
beat and hes taller than me
colonel anderson listens with amused tolerance but its time to get back to business
thats enough captain you have your orders
major thomas will fill you in
miller knows when to back off
miller and colonel anderson exchange a private look
good luck john
thank you sir
miller joins major thomas at one of the smaller map tables
colonel anderson watches miller for an instant then notices the other officers in the tent watching
a glare and they go back to work
a massive barrage of fifteen inch shells blasts from the deck of the enormous ship
the big naval shells slam into the german position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field
millers ranger company ducks and covers
the barrage subsides
the rangers rise firing leap frogging from crater to crater advancing against the remaining germans who return small arms fire
crouch runs and dives into a crater with sarge
put on your traveling shoes sarge were heading out
you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission
leading a squad
some private up there lost three brothers got a ticket home
what about the company
jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick
i want reiben on b
r jackson with his sniper rifle beasley demolition
what about talbot
twenty minutes ago
miller damn ill go see if i can find another one
you get reiben jackson and wade meet me at transport
they wait for a lull in the firing then scramble out of the crater and crouch run in opposite directions
just in from the beaches
distant artillery and explosions
vehicles of every sort moving out
tanks half tracks troop trucks
in the middle of the mess a cigar chewing supply sergeant works at a make shift desk made out of crate
he yells at a private
private theyre blocked in
reiben is beside himself pacing muttering
the others are relaxed
strides through the chaos avoiding the passing vehicles
he sees his men and walks toward them
reiben hurries up to miller pleading
please sir you cant take me to ramelle i gotta go to caen sir please i told you they make caen lingerie there its beautiful its the best there is
oh please sir
sorry i need a b
man youre the best
desperate no im not kaback is honest
or what about faulkner
or that little guy with the glasses
trust me youre the best
whimpering but sir
miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides off toward the supply sergeants table
sarge falls in next to miller
you get a translator captain
ive got a line on one
vehicles thundering by
the supply sergeant juggles runners and paperwork
miller steps up to him
sergeant i need a truck
sorry sir fresh out of trucks how bout a ford roadster hard top red with black interior
no white walls sir theres a war on
to the private to miller i cant help you sir
a half track anything
division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen
notices millers shoulder patch how come you guys arent going
miller ignores the question
he spies a jeep
how about that jeep
thats general gavins
his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it ill get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger ill get court marshaled
if you were to take it theyd shoot me
capn does that mean we got to walk all the way up to ramelle
whats at ramelle beside a lot of germans
a paratrooper named ryan
hes going home if hes alive
no three brothers of his were killed in action
command wants him out of there
the supply sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly
i got a couple brothers
miller looks at him noting his reaction coldly
the supply sergeant shifts his eyes toward general gavins jeep
miller and his men drive off fast in general gavins jeep
sarge is at the wheel weaving and bouncing through the bedlam of men and vehicles
miller rides shotgun
reiben jackson and wade are crammed in the back
the supply sergeant watches them go
behind him general gavin pure piss and vinegar strides up trailed by his huge staff
he looks around for his jeep comes up empty
the supply sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns to take his lumps
miller and his men weave through the chaos of the american staging area
weve got to make one stop
miller points the way for sarge
miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly white taut lined tent
a steady stream of roaring vehicles and chattering men move out around them
distant guns rumble
sporadic medium distance explosions boom
miller hops out
he strides into the tent
three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals
theyre breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine
tedious detailed work
one of them is tim upham a thin twenty four year old patrician with gentle thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses
he nervously jumps at the sound of a very distant explosion then he forces himself to concentrate on his work
miller strides in
miller im looking for corporal upham
upham raises his eyes from his map and re focuses
upham sir im upham
i understand you speak french and german
upham yes sir
do you have an accent
upham a slight one in french
my german is clean
it has a touch of the bavarian
good youve been re assigned to me were going to ramelle
upham knows enough geography to know what that means
upham uh sir there are germans up at ramelle
thats my understanding
upham lots of them
do you have a problem with that corporal
upham sir ive never been in combat
i make maps
i need a translator all mine have been killed
upham but sir i havent held a gun since basic training
itll come back to you
get your gear
upham sir may i bring my typewriter
miller looks at him closely not sure if hes joking
upham im writing a book and i
millers expression gives him his answer
upham uh how about a pencil
a small one
miller shoos him off
upham scurries away
miller and his men peel out now with upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep
as they drive off the camera cranes up to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history
the scope of the operation is stunning
the beach is covered with mountains of supplies
a steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes
hundreds of barrage balloons anchored by heavy steel cables hover over the entire scene
off shore a massive mulberry port is under construction workers swarming over it like ants
beyond that thousands of ships and boats of every type and description
the smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon
explosions some distant some close boom and rumble
its an awesome breathtaking sight
miller and his tiny band of men weave their way through the middle of it speeding away from the beach heading inland leaving the bulk of the american army behind
french road day miller and his men drive fast passing american vehicles and infantrymen moving forward
the sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning german vehicles abandoned equipment bodies
miller reads a map
upham cradling a pristine m rifle is all eyes and ears
jackson and wade calmly take in the view
reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep
captain can i ask you a question
where are you planning on putting private ryan sir
miller doesnt raise his eyes from the map
continuing its just that its kind of crowded back here i was wondering if youre expecting to have more room on the way back
miller points out a turn to sarge
sarge makes the turn
miller folds up the map and pockets it
now weve got a straight shot due north to ramelle twenty six miles two villages between here and there st
mere then bernay
well take the jeep as far as we can then go on on foot
we in radio contact with anybody up there
somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundred and firsts radios the night before the drop not one of them works
were going in blind
i usually like surprises
what are we likely to run into
a fucking mess two maybe three kraut divisions no fronts no lines the drops were completely fouled up weve got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place trying to
command says we hold st
mere but north of that its all krauts
even if ryans where hes supposed to be hes more than likely dead
hell of a mission
yep hell of a mission
upham avidly takes in everything
he notices reiben staring at him grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful smile
so uh youre all rangers
reiben jackson and wade look at upham as if he were an insect
upham im upham
pointing at his corporals stripes ignore these please i know all that breaks down in combat
their jaws drop
to wade you want to shoot him or should i
wade its not my turn
hell no last time i shot a corporal capn miller near bit my head off
upham reacts to the metion of millers name
i dont want anybody to shoot him thats an order
he speaks french and his german has a touch of the bavarian
upham sir are you captain john miller
miller sighs he knows whats coming
continuing who won the congressional medal of hon
uphams words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances of millers men
miller himself remains relaxed but stone faced
no one speaks for a few seconds then the moment passes as if it had never happened
captain i gotta tell you the irony of this mission is fucking killing me
yeah how so
i should be on my way to caen sir
its like beethoven the guys one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf
go figure i mean whod he piss off
and here i am the beethoven of ladies foundation garments one step away from caen the center of the known lingerie universe and instead im going to ramelle to save
some fucking private whos probably already dead
theres to be a bright side look for it
sir you know what ramelle is famous for
the rest of the company is going to caen and were going to the goddamned cheese capital of france
there is no bright side
theres always a bright side
im listening sir
well i for one like cheese
wade pipes up cheerfully
wade hell i dont mind going to ramelle as long as theres something up there for me to blow up
well youre a happy idiot
a lieutenant is roadmaster
miller calls to him
hows the road up to st
lieutenant bad sir
therere some eighty eights hiding somewhere knocking the hell out of our traffic
anybody getting through
lieutenant the lucky ones
miller nods to sarge who floors it
they take off spraying gravel behind them
mere road day the jeep barrels down the road fast
the road is pock marked with craters
they pass the wreckage of a pair of american jeeps
sarge swerves around them without slowing
on the side of the road surrounded by the charred bodies of a dozen american troops
its a nightmare vision
upham grows weak at the sight
miller takes note of uphams reaction
the men bounce up and down like stuffed animals doing their best to not be thrown out
hell this is better than coney island
bounces reiben up and slams his back down on his shovel
he hollers in just trying to make room for ryan
reiben shoots miller a smile and shifts his belt moving his shovel from under his bruised ass
see a long straight stretch of road
half a dozen burning obliterated american vehicles
a gauntlet to run
lands right behind them
blows a new crater sweetly sarge
sarge floors it
everyone hangs on
thirty yards ahead of them
directs sarge off the road
theyve got the road zeroed
yanks the wheel driving the jeep off the road
off the shoulder
nearly throwing everyone out
somehow they hang on
the jeep tears along the rutted field
just behind them
not slowing down
trying to avoid the biggest ruts and bumps
close on their side
showers them with debris
sees a cluster of buildings about half a mile ahead
theyve got a hell of a spotter somewhere
the jeeps peppered with shrapnel
they barrel through the smoke
s curves sarge
turns shallow curves without slowing down
tries to avoid it
plows into overturned earth
thrown from the jeep
tumble into the dirt
stay in the jeep but are battered
miller is first to regain his bearings
checks out the jeep
deep in the soft dirt
sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear
the wheels spin
miller throws his shoulder into the jeep
yells to the others
reiben wade jackson upham screw their heads back on
shoulder into the jeep
push for all theyre worth
the wheels still spin
hes the only one who does
captain they got us zeroed
upham is very nervous
thats bracketing right
they all ignore him
i know about bracketing
i read about it
the next one is going to land right on us
beat sarge slams the jeep into reverse
slams it back into forward
a bit more progress
its almost out
knowing the shell is coming any second
upham is beside himself
sweetly oh captain
the jeep rocks back in deeper
instantly take off
away from the jeep
as fast as they can
the men hit the dirt
barely out of the blast perimeter
stunned by the concussion
showered with dirt rock and debris
is first up
sarge and the men struggle to their feet
hear more incoming
miller grabs upham by the collar and pulls him up
running as fast as they can
the eighty eight is big with pauses spaces between
but there must be a dozen mortars firing
the shells are almost constant
the six americans run madly in zig zag patterns through the gauntlet of miller yanks him up
half drags him to the edge of the field
through the bushes and brambles
thirty yards in
the men all stop panting
struggling to catch their breath
check their body parts
they have their weapons most of their gear
reiben looks back through the trees at the jeep which is nothing more than a burning carcass
he shakes his head
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you captain
stands on the edge of the woods almost in a trance
miller far away quickly shifts his eyes and ears from position to position
sarge quickly opens up the map case
the men are dead silent frozen in place
two eighty eights just under two and a half miles that way vector from the jeep through those two trees at the base of the hill
the mortars came from behind that rise there four of them
sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map
miller snaps out of it
wade the radio
wade instantly starts cranking it up
upham is amazed
you can tell all that just by the sound sire
thats not all
there were nine gunners on the eighty eights one had a broken heel on his boot two had bratwurst for supper last night one of them is named fritz the
other hans maybe i dont know its hard to tell
corporal you have just seen one of captain millers many god given talents
if by some miracle you survive you will witness many more of them
sarge finished vectoring
got it sir
we gonna go take care of those eighty eights
thats not what were here for
radio ive got command captain
miller takes the handset from wade and the map from sarge
into radio this is baker charley one fire mark sector three foxtrot quadrant four three by baker three
two eighty eights
tell our boys to come in low from the east in case the krauts have ack ack
a voice on the radio signs off through the static
wade packs up the radio
miller folds up the map
jackson sir wouldnt take us but a minute to put out them eighty eights
hes right captain it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys
tell that to private james ryan
weve got our orders
miller heads off without pausing or looking back
the rest of the men dont like it but they follow
upham trails amazed at miller
miller walks point
his men follow warily
upham falls in alongside reiben
so where are you from
upham smiles lamely and moves on to jackson
so where are you from
you writin a book or somethin
as a matter of fact i am
wade overhears and smiles at upham
im wade thats spelled w a d e im small but wiry with piercing steel gray eyes and a rough hewn but handsome face im from colorado my fathers a
mining engineer dont you take notes
upham shakes his head
since i was nine years old
they got a lot of explosives around mines
me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw
damn we had fun
im from west fork tennessee
my pappys a preacher
him and his two brothers got a ministry the blessed church of the wandering gospel
in west fork
in the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch hudson with a big ole trailer
i dont make jokes about things of or related to the preaching of the holy gospel including the ministerial calling of my family
so they travel around from place to place and preach
we got us a tent forty two feet across eighteen feet at center hundred and ten foldin chairs
circuits eleven towns covers all a hasset county and most a weller county
i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin said ministry
what about the captain
wheres he from
they all shake their heads
millers out of earshot
you figure that out you got yourself one nice prize
over three hundred bucks last i heard
wade companys got a pool five bucks gets you in whoever guesses where the captains from and what he did as a civilian gets it all
the whole kit and caboodle
but everybodys heard of him he won the congressional medal of honor he saved a dozen men
somebody must know where hes from what he did for a living
somebody probably does
why dont you just ask him
the captain prefers not to discuss certain aspects of his life in particular everything up to and including his enlistment in the united states army
ive been with him since anzio
im closer to him that i am to my own brother but i dont even know what state hes from
somewhere in the northeast as near as i can figure
i dont even have a clue what he did for a living as civilian
reiben shakes his head
no ones gonna win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian
they assembled him at o
out of spare body parts from dead g
i know this for a fact
defensively you got somethin against the capn
i think hes the best officer in the whole goddamned army bar none
they all nod in assent no argument there
you got that right
miller walks on ahead unaware of their conversation
upham watches miller with even more curiosity
miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a country cow path
theyre staying close to the cover of the brush
miller walks tall now
captain my feet are most uncomfortable
if id a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to ramelle i never would a volunteered for this here mission
you didnt volunteer jackson
i most likely would have sir had i been given the opportunity
if we find ryan and hes still alive that son of a bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b
back to the beach for me
army life is too dang easy my feet have gone soft
back home we go out squirrel huntin i walk forever and a day and then some dont even raise a blister
you know what a b
nineteen and a half pounds not counting ammo
ammo bandoleers and you think these things are comfortable
they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each thats thirty six pounds right there
ive got three satchel charges six gammon grenades a dozen and a half pineapples and all my regular gear
you dont hear me complaining
thats because as i have pointed out on numerous occasions you are a happy idiot
no i just happen to take the captains advice and look at the bright side of things
how do you do it
its easy it runs in my family take my grandfather for example
oh christ now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again
as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted my grandfather got old as grandfathers tend to do
he needed someone to take care of him
we move around all the time going from one mine to another so we had to put him in a home
nice enough place but kind of depressing
but not for granddad
he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship going to tahiti he had his own cabin first class with room service
it just so happened that the weather was always lousy so he never bothered to go up on deck
happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died
you think he really believed it
fine you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear
reiben you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes
you want unpleasant
just wait i can do much better than this
look at upham you dont hear him complaining
upham feeling bold and a bit naughty decides to give it a shot
well as a matter of fact i was just thinking
the men roll their eyes expecting the worst
continuing that im so fucking tired of this goddamned walking id pay a thousand dollars to see that bastard ryan crawl on his belly over an acre of broken glass
to hear my great aunt martha fart through a field phone
the men are stunned
jesus christ hes a natural
upham are you sure youve never been in combat
upham wiggles with pride
upham positive sir im certain id remember
miller eyes upham respectfully and nods to the men
they walk on
capn my feet are most uncomfortable
miller smiles situation normal
a small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield
heavy small arms fire
grenade and mortar explosions
medium artillery beyond
american soldiers crouch in doorways firing at well placed germans
some french civilians dash across a street
a man and a couple of women one carrying a child
they make it across and disappear into the remains of a building
miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner
sarge and the other men follow in leap frog spread out down the block behind him
miller glances around the corner taking a quick mental picture of a gathering of g
s crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block
they are captain hamill about millers age and his men
as miller ducks back behind the corner a german bullet smashes into the bricks where his head was an instant before
miller motions jackson across first
jackson gathers himself takes off
german bullets blast kicking up the cobblestone behind him
jackson zig zags and makes it to the cover of the far side
that was close
miller nods to upham
upham scared shitless doesnt move
miller speaks to him very gently
zig zag change your pace a couple times youll be alright
he can barely breathe
okay im going to draw fire for you
sternly but if i do you goddamned well better go
miller gathers himself takes a deep breath
close shot millers hand quivers
looks to upham ready
upham nods still terrified
stands motionless presenting himself to the german snipers
he doesnt budge
upham tears across the street very very fast
reiben watches upham run
hey that guy can move
a german bullet whizzes past millers ear
upham gets to the far side
miller ducks back around the corner
reiben and wade dont even react to what miller has just done
sarge is pissed
he shakes his head at miller like an irritated parent
under his breath so only miller can hear damn fool
captain hes fast
glances at sarge speaks to reiben glad of it
on the other side of the street crouches in a doorway with jackson
upham is a bit in shock less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him
dashes across the street
german bullets trail him shattering the cobblestones inches behind him
he makes it across
calls back to sarge
bring em over
upham tries to thank miller
miller ignores him motions to sarge reiben and wade
one at a time
ducks out of the doorway and crouch runs down the block
he passes a out of the line of fire
a dozen dead american soldiers lined up on the ground
the battered bloody bodies only partially covered by ponchos
some badly wounded g
s are being treated next to the dead
blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk
sees the dead and wounded shows no reaction
runs to captain hamill and his men are bunched there out of the line of fire
hes sending off a squad to continue their door to door
captain hamill fundamentals short runs double up at the corners one man close one man wide
the squad takes off
captain hamill sees miller
the two captains glance at the bars on their shoulders then speak familiarly
captain hamill how was the road in
we had a jeep until a few hours ago a nice one it had a cute little flag with a couple of stars on it
captain hamill oh what a shame
one by one millers men join them in the alley
we called in a strike on the eighty eights that took it out but its the kraut spotter that counts wherever the hell that bastard is
captain hamill points across a wide field toward a distant chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty foot steeple
captain hamill thats where your boy is
weve been trying to get him since this morning
he killed two of my men trying to get close enough for a shot
miller eyes the distant steeple
jackson steps up
miller points to the steeple
jackson knows what hes supposed to do
he puts down his m and takes off the long zippered leather sheath strapped to his back
he spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice then calmly and methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very unusual long barrel rifle
miller and his men give him some room
hamill and his men along with upham watch curiously
jackson opens a two foot tripod with a flick of his wrist sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it
then he takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it
he adjusts the eye piece and clicks in the bolt action
upham is fascinated
what is that
jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single over sized shell
thirty ought six norton long barrel with dual groove parallel rifling elevated three glass scope and a single throw hammer
the army gave you that
you must be a hell a shot
not where i come from
jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and fires
calibrates the scope
he re loads
jackson fires again
he wipes the dirt and sweat from his forehead puts his eye to the sight and waits absolutely motionless
that must be four thousand yards
without taking his eye from the scope forty two hundred i figure
you take account of the wind
jackson doesnt dignify that with an answer but he looks back with an expression that clearly says what are you some kind of fucking idiot
reiben puts himself between upham and jackson
put on southern accent dang right he take count of the wind aint yall ever heard a kentucky windage
jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the trigger
reiben how many time i got to tell you im from tennessee
they got squirrels there too right
a tiny smile
he starts taking apart the rifle
a very impressed captain hamill barks to his radioman
captain hamill get a hold of command tell them the st
mere road is open
the radioman cranks up his radio
captain hamill turns to miller
captain hamill how far back is the rest of division
very far theyre not coming this way theyre going to take caen first
captain hamill goddamn it i was afraid of that
were in a lot of trouble up here and its gonna get worse before it gets better
how many men did you bring
five but we not staying were on our way to ramelle
captain hamill shit are you the guys going up to find private ryan
yeah you know about that
captain hamill command radioed wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead
several of captain hamills men among them a gentle faced private prick up their ears at the mention of private ryan
captain hamill were supposed to tell you they intercepted a german transmission after you left
the krauts have two companies on their way to ramelle to take back that bridge theyll be there sometime late tomorrow
captain hamill if ryans alive youd better get him the hell out of there before those krauts show up
how do we get out of here
captain hamill you dont until tonight were hemmed in real tight
after dark you try to slip out to the east
if you tip toe stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens youve got a fair chance of making it up to ramelle by tomorrow night
miller processes the information
captain hamill shakes his head
captain hamill tough huh
captain hamill we sure as hell could use your help here but i understand what youre doing
captain hamill good luck
captain hamill i mean it
get him home
miller is a bit taken aback by captain hamills forceful sincerity
then he shakes it off and motions to his men
lets find someplace to hole up
miller nods to captain hamill then as he moves to the head of the alley miller passes upham
sir im sorry about what happened interrupting it was nothing
but you could have gotten killed and interrupting like i said it was nothing
to the men dont bunch up
he takes off crouch running back down the block
upham watches him go
did you see what he did back there
he stepped right into the open so i could get across
shit that was no big deal
they cant kill him
like hell they cant
wades right its some kind of scientific magnetic thing i cant explain it but ive seen it
we all have hes got nine lives or hes bulletproof or some damn thing
the men are equal parts joking and admiring
sarge is neither
no ones bulletproof
beat cmon stay low
sarge takes off after miller
miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins of a medieval church
miller settled into a comfortable spot in the debris eating his k rations looks very relaxed
captain could you please explain the math of this mission to me
sure what do you want to know
well sir in purely arithmetic terms since when does six equal one
whats the sense in risking six guys to save one
ours is not to reason why
never mind dont worry well pick up this kid high tail it back to division everythingll work out fine
id much rather die in caen than ramelle sir
its a personal thing
reiben theres a fairly good chance youre not going to die at all
easy for you to say sir
beat fucking james ryan id like to wring his fucking neck
jesus reiben think of the poor bastards mother
hey i got a mother
jackson you got a mother
last i knew
wade sarge corporal insect all of us hell ill bet even the captain has a mother
reiben eyes him and reconsiders
well maybe not the captain but the rest of us have mothers
you have orders too
sir i have an opinion on this matter
id love to hear it
seems to me capn this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources
miller go on
well sir by my way a thinkin i am a finely made instrument of warfare
what i mean by that is if you was to put me with this here sniper rifle anywhere up to and includin one mile from adolf hitler with a clear
line of sight wars over
reiben i want you to listen closely to jackson
this is the way to gripe
it seems to me sir that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only and that is to put me
and this here weapon on a rooftop smack dab in the middle of berlin germany
now i aint one to question decisions made up on high sir but it seems to me that saving one private no matter how grievous the losses of his family
is a waste of my god given talent
hell i dont mind this mission sir as long as theres something up at ramelle for
finishing wades sentence for you to blow up yeah yeah we heard that
im just here to keep a bunch of numb nuts including one certain frequently suicidal tempter of fate from getting themselves killed
reiben eyes miller
and what about you captain
miller looks at reiben shocked
reiben whats the matter with you
i dont gripe to you
im a captain
theres a chain of command
griping goes one way up only up never down
you gripe to me i gripe to my superior officers
up get it
i dont gripe to you i dont gripe in front of you
how long you been in the army
im sorry sir i apologize
beat but if you werent a captain or if i were a major what would you say
miller considers his response
in that case i would say this is an excellent mission with an extremely valuable objective worthy of my best efforts
reiben rolls his eyes
miller plays it straight with no obvious sarcasm
continuing in addition as i pointed out earlier i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products when we
arrive there to see if they live up to their excellent reputation
moreover i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and im more than willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men especially you
reiben to help relieve her suffering
the men thoroughly enjoy the performance
sir if you were not a captain i would compliment you now for being an excellent liar
but i am a captain
if i were not a captain i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top notch poker player which
i am having learned at the side of my mother who is by popular acclaim the best poker player in
the men all learn forward expectantly believing theyre about to find out millers home town
continuing my home town which shall remain un named
the men ease back disappointed
any further thoughts on the subject
yes sir as a final note id like to say fuck our orders fuck ramelle fuck the cheese capital of france and while were at it fuck private james ryan
ill make a note of your suggestions but ill leave that last one to you especially if hes already dead
the men wince and laugh
miller checks his watch and gets serious
we move out in two hours try and get some sleep
the men know when to can it
without another word they all settle down into the debris close their eyes and try to follow millers order
upham looks around at these strange men then a simple hard glare from miller makes him follow suit
miller looks at his men then pulls out his map case and his flashlight
he turns it on in the dim glow of the light he studies his maps while his men rest
artillery rumbles in the distance
reiben jackson wade and upham sleep
miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight studying his maps
sarge lies near him awake watching him
sarge notices some unopened envelopes in millers map case and speaks quietly to him
you ever going to open those letters
miller keeps his eyes on the maps
its not normal not reading letters from home
since when have things been normal
you got me
afraid of bad news
miller looks at sarge
a moment passes between the two of them then miller takes refuge in the maps
sarge looks at the men
you think theyll be alright
as long as they can gripe theyll be alright
and what about you
miller considers the question doesnt answer
they guys here arent going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up
command isnt going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell arent going to let them surrender
three for three
if we stayed we could make a difference
youre kidding yourself
you never know
they sit in silence for a moment
i hope this boy ryan is worth it
now youre the one kidding yourself
beat hell of a mission
yup hell of a mission
miller looks at his watch rises and barks at the men
rise and shine boys
grumbling the men get up and start shouldering up their gear
small arms fire echoes through the village
distant artillery booms
miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral toward the outskirts of town
theyre just a small squad but these six heavily armed men in full battle gear are very formidable looking
millers men are getting ready to move out
captain hamill and a few of his men are there to see them off
suddenly then repeated flashes of light
the sky is on fire
the air trembles
a far off rumbling thunder rolls over the countryside like a tidal wave
then the opposite horizon lights up as well
its a massive artillery battle
the magnitude of the fury is incredible strange other worldly
frozen in place
the lights play on their faces
miller looks down and sees his hand quivering
sarge notices says nothing
miller stares at his hand forcing it to stop
their eyes go back to the blazing sky
awe struck makes you feel small doesnt it
it doesnt take this
uphams face shows more fear than awe
i wasnt made for this
bitterly you think the rest of us were
miller instantly regrets his words
he turns to upham and sees that hes really scared
miller get a hold of himself and speaks gently
dont worry upham godll protect you this shits gonna keep him up all night anyway
upham manages a slight smile
miller watches the lights for a moment more then he pretends to shrug it off
lets go this aint what they pay us for
captain hamill is next to snap himself out of it
he points the way
captain hamill along the wall about thirty yards theres a gate on the other side a drainage ditch stay low until you clear the second field then youll hit the
as miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to move out on of captain hamills men the gentle faced private who was so interested in the talk of
private ryan steps up with a couple bandoleers of b
he offers them to reiben
gentle faced private here
reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart ass response when a look at the gentle faced privates vulnerable expression stops the comment dead
gentle faced private my older brother was killed at guadalcanal
these might come in handy
reiben takes the ammo
gently just what i need
miller steps over takes the bandoleers from reiben and hands them back to the gentle faced private
thanks but you may need these more than us or ryan
captain hamill nods to the gentle faced private who takes the ammo back
lets move out
miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness lit intermittently by the distant flashes
captain hamill and his beleaguered men watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope
the final rumbles of the distant artillery fade away
the night is dark
the band of six americans makes their way warily along a french cart path
sarge eases up alongside miller and speaks quietly to him
the others dont overhear
sarge how longs your hand been shaking
a couple of weeks
it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading
is it getting worse
it comes and goes
it stops when i look at it
you may have to find yourself a new line of work this one doesnt seem to agree with you anymore
ill be alright
sarge looks at miller closely evaluating him they walk on
the men are tired but alert
jackson is at point
miller behind him
the others at intervals
sarge brings up the rear
no one speaks they communicate only with hand signals
jackson signals to miller ten twenty thirty men coming
miller signals for the men to get off the path
they ease into the brush
an instant later a pair wary german infantry men appear
reiben grips his b
and looks to miller for permission to open up
miller shakes his head and signals let them go
a moment later an entire platoon of germans rounds the bend
reiben breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi b
the german platoon passes their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden americans
upham is wide eyed with fear
the others are stone faced
miller motions for his men to hold their positions
upham doesnt see the signal
he stands breathing a sigh of relief just as a german whip tail squad appears trailing the platoon by thirty meters protecting their rear
hes standing barely in the shadows nearly exposed
pissed miller prepares to fire
the whip tail squad approaches
then the germans pass miraculously not seeing upham in the shadows
they walk on and disappear
upham is weak kneed amazed that hes still alive
miller shoots a devastating glare at him then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods
upham scurries after miller staying close on his heels
the little band of americans walks along the edge of a field parallel to a cart path
miller notices jackson and wade drifting too close to each other
he snaps his fingers getting their attention and motions curtly for them to open it up a bit
they do so
faint distant artillery
miller checks the map as sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional signs
one of them reads ramelle km
miller puts away the map
checks the horizon
the first glow of dawn is visible
itll be light soon
lets pick it up
the sound of distant guns has been replaced by the chirping of birds
the americans are taking five
miller stands a bit apart from the others looking out at the view
dew shimmers on the long grass
the war is far away
upham walks next to him
they look out at the view together without speaking for a moment
it looks like a renoir
do you know sibelius fourth symphony the normandy
ive been humming it
it seemed appropriate
you know classical music
where are you from captain
whats the pool up to
upham smiles caught
over three hundred
ill tell you what if im still alive when it hits five hundred ill let you know and well split the money
if thats the way you feel why dont we wait until its up to a thousand
i dont expect to live that long
upham looks closely at miller and sees that he means it
five hundred then
miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to feel an overwhelming wave of sadness
then he turns himself back into a commander and barks at upham
lets go private
miller strides away
upham watches him trying to figure him out then he simply follows him
the seven americans walk along a hedgerow lane untouched by war
spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is lined with hedgerows thick rooted masses impenetrable hundred of years old
miller sees smoke ahead
he motions to the men
french farm day a burning house and barn
an old french farmer kneels on the ground weeping next to this slaughtered family two adult women an adult male and a boy no more than ten
his animals a pair of cows and a draft horse and some pigs are dead as well shot to pieces
a dead american paratrooper lies sprawled in the dirt with empty shell casings around his body
miller and his men approach carefully
miller motions to upham who squats down next to the french farmer and speaks gently to him in french
the farmer speaks softly as if in a trance
upham stands and translates
five nights ago he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg
the leg got infected
last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor
the doctor refused to come and when he got back this is what he found
the krauts must have shown up while he was gone
did he see any sign of them
upham gently asks
the farmer answers
no but he heard firing just east less that a kilometer
thank him and tell him were sorry about his loss
miller heads off without glancing back
the men hesitate
sarge jerks his head for them to move out
they do so
upham squats down and speaks softly to the farmer puts his hand on the mans shoulder then rises and follows the others
a beautiful hedgerow lined field of tall grass
the last of the dew and morning mist is just burning off
the six americans walk carefully through the woods to the edge of the field
miller notices something
he silently signals stop crouches and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side
sarge and jackson ease up next to him
jackson points to some trees nearby freshly shattered and pock marked with bullets
wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush
staying low they join wade who has found a trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field
crawl to the edge of the field scan the far hedgerow
the others crawl up behind them
in the shadow by those two trees
my guess too
what is it
a machine gun
miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover of the brush
he stands and takes off his pack
sir ive got an idea lets go around
we cant leave it here
we left them eighty eights
they dont send planes to put out machine guns
beat two flank runners with surpressing fire
im going right whoever goes left has to be fast
upham steels himself and steps forward
sir i ran the in high school
hes fast captain i saw him
miller takes uphams measure
wade laughs with a sneer
twenty four five
shit thats nothing i ran twenty two flat
wade goes left
wade joins miller in peeling off his extra gear
upham is impressed
twenty two flat
wade takes a grenade from uphams chest strap
i would have won the states if some bastard hadnt tripped me in the finals
miller points the others to their firing positions
sarge upham here
jackson reiben ten yards either side
as they take their positions miller and sarge speak quietly out of earshot of the men
rule of thumb captain says you ought to detail this one instead of going yourself
miller looks at the two dead paratroopers
what rule of thumb is that
how about i go right sir
how about you take your position
interrupting how about you shut up and take your position
sarge finds a spot
miller joins wade
miller waits near upham as the other men settle into their firing positions
good luck captain
dont need it im a cat ive got five lives
the men said nine
what do they know
beat i had nine but i feel through the ice when i was seven my brother pulled me out
then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily it was a dud
i figure one on the beaches one on the cliffs and two getting here
that only leaves three
miller sees that the men are in position
he nods to wade
miller and wade take deep breaths
onto opposite sides of the field
nothing happens for a moment
then a squad of germans dug deep blasting the machine gun a big schwarzlose mm a stunningly powerful weapon
four germans in the nest four more outlying riflemen
takes the first fire
he hits the dirt
the bullets scream just over him
the bullets graze the back of his helmet
zero the machine gun
fire fast as they can
their bullets thud ineffectually into the hedgerow
bullets smash into the ground all around miller
fires a long burst from his thompson
pops the clip
slams in another
he rises and runs
almost to the far hedgerow
ten more yards
a deadly row of bullets kick up dirt toward him
makes it to the far side
scrambles up the roots
dives through the brush
on a slight rise
cant hit the dirt
a line of bullets
wade is hit
heavy bullets rip apart his belly
sarge upham and the others are horrified
fire at the nest
struggles through the hedgerow
stumbles onto the path
rolls to his feet running
swings his thompson into firing position
racing toward the nest
sarge and the others pour fire at the nest
tearing along the path
sees a german rifleman
fires a burst
cuts him down
runs over the body without breaking stride
fire from miller
the germans zero sarge
bullets thud all around him
somehow hes not hit
tears through the trees
blasts his thompson
cuts down two more german riflemen
grabs a grenade
pulls the pin
the germans see miller coming
wheel from sarge
throws the grenade veers and dives
the grenade explodes
the four germans in the nest are sarge hollers to the others
rolls to his feet
fire another burst
kills the last of the german riflemen
runs onto the field
see miller running toward wade
they instantly race onto the field
lies in the grass
holding his belly
astonished by the pain
converging on wade
miller points and yells without slowing down
turn toward the perimeter of the field
roots through his medical kit as he runs
dropping and scattering inessentials behind him
not even writhing
too much pain
throw themselves onto the ground next to him
they both tear out sulfa packs
sarge frantically fumbles
ripping one open
reiben and upham repeatedly glance back at wade
pulls wades hands from the wound
pours sulfa powder
about to pour his sulfa
sees the wound
knows its fatal
throws the sulfa aside
quickly pulls out a morphine pack
fumbles with a second sulfa bag
sulfa more sulfa
frozen in agony
looks at miller
sees him preparing the morphine shot
they both know
make it a double
shoves the needle into wades neck
pumps the morphine straight to wades brain
motions impatiently to sarge
more morphine hurry up come on come on
then drops his sulfa
fumbles in his pack
finds the morphine
snatches the morphine from sarge
quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot
hes done this before
on guard glancing back
trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter
gives wade the second shot
feels the effects of the first shot
he sees upham and manages a pained smile
wade locks eyes with miller
looking at him without blame without forgiveness
drifts with the morphine
then wade upham begins to weep
he gently closes wades eyes
his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags
he fumbles and drops it
miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men see
he picks up the dogtag and pockets it
then miller carefully re packs the un used morphine and sulfa rises and picks up his thompson
upham shakes his head
that was no twenty two flat
miller slams a fresh clip into his thompson
lets move out
miller turns and walks away without looking back
the men hesitate then slowly follow him
a narrow footpath arched over by trees almost a tunnel
the five g
s walk spread out
fuck private james ryan fuck him just fuck the goddamned son of a bitch
shut up will you
you shut up this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of
goddamned ryan fuck the little bastard
just shut up ryan didnt kill wade
the hell he didnt
miller motions to them curtly
keep it down
they shut up
miller falls in step to sarge
speaks quietly the men dont hear
weve got to find someplace to hole up for a bit
sarge looks at miller closely
lets just find someplace
miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully
a good hiding place
jackson reiben perimeter
keep your eyes open
im going to re con
miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things but theres something missing
only sarge notices
he watches miller head off into the brush alone
miller walks into a small clearing slows then stops
the life drains from him
he stands there looking at the dirt tilting his head this way and that as if listening for faint distant voices
his face shows a battle raging within as he fights to keep from losing it entirely
behind him sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches
miller senses his presence turns and looks at him if he were a thousand miles away
sarge sits down on a log and waits
what was the name of that kid at anzio the one who got his face burned off
yeah vecchio i couldnt remember his name he was a good kid remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying
you know why im such a good officer
because of my mother
have i ever told you about her
bits and pieces
shes the best poker player you ever saw
my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt
finally my mother gave him an ultimatum either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night
he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down she never lost
she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands
and he bluffs
he had sixteen levels of bullshit
her eyes the tone of her voice her bets her jokes the way she sipped her coffee she was a master
she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game
every saturday night my father would lose two three hundred bucks and shed win it all back and then some
and id stand there glued to her shoulder from the time i was five years old watching every hand every move studying how she did it
beat thats why im such a good officer i can look at a mans face and tell you exactly what hes holding and if its a shit hand i know
just what cards to deal him
and what about your own hand
a pair of deuces
it used to tear me apart when id get one of my men killed but what was i supposed to do
break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do
of course not so i bluffed and after a while i started to fall for my own bluff
it was great it made everything so much easier
sarge is that why your hands been shaking
it could be worse
you know the first thing they teach you at o
lie to your men
not in so many words but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men dont have good morale its not worth a
so if youre scared or empty or half a step from a section eight do you tell your men
of course not
you bluff you lie
and how do you bluff yourself
every time you kill one of your men you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two three ten a hundred others
we lost what thirty one on the cliffs
ill bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns
thats over three hundred men
maybe five hundred
any number you want
it lets you always choose mission over men
except this time the mission is a man
thats the rub
i liked wade
if theyre both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other how do i choose
look at my hand there it goes again
john ive got to tell you i think youre about used up
i think youre right keith
you want me to take over
the question helps miller pull himself back together
he looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again
no but if i get any worse youll have to relieve me
sighs just what i want to do
they share a smile
you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve youre the last one still alive
dont let yourself get killed if you do they might make me give back the medal and then i wont be able to lip off to colonels anymore
ill do my best
they shake their heads at the madness of it all
miller hell of a
ah forget it
miller picks up his thompson and looks around re orienting himself
hes about ninety five percent there
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me
youre welcome john
but thats my personal brand of stupidity i feel kind of proprietary about it if you do it again youre busted
sarge allows himself a slight smile
miller jerks his head for sarge to follow
they head back to the men
the men are all in their private worlds thinking of wade
miller and sarge walk back into the clearing
miller barks at the men
were moving out
i thought you said we had an hour sir
well now im saying were moving out
get off your ass
the men get up
jackson is a bit slow
what the hells the matter with you jackson
sir i aint feeling so chipper on account of wade
no one responds
i said who the hell is wade
the men exchange looks
jackson speaks for them
sir i understand what youre doin but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner
youll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve
there is no wade there was one but he died a long time ago hes been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name you understand
sir i understand
i dont like it but i understand
good now get your goddamned gear
the men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out
sarge and miller exchange a silent look
miller shakes his head to himself amazed that the men still allow this shit to work
he knows they have no choice
miller and his men walk along the road
the men are silent grim
miller checks his map
figures out where they are
folds up the map points the way and they move out
the men are still grim
you know what the best possible thing that could happen is
yep you step on a rusty nail get lockjaw never say another word as long as you live
miller ill bite reiben
ive given this a lot of thought sir
the best thing that could happen is we find ryan and hes dead
well sir consider the possibilities
a ryan is alive
we have to take him back to the beach
knowing you you dont let him carry my gear even though he really should and we all get killed trying to keep him alive
except for the last part that ones not bad
b ryan is dead
hes been blown up by the german equivalent of wade whose name i know you dont want me to mention
theres nothing to find
the biggest piece is the size of a pea
we wander around looking for him until the germans pick us off one after another
i dont like that one
neither do i sir
c and this is the worst one we find ryan and hes wounded
not only does he not carry my gear we have to carry his gear
but we accomplish the mission
but what if he dies on the way back
you see what im saying sir
the best possible situation is hes dead we find his body more or less intact we grab one of his dog tags and high tail it back to the beach
or better yet we head over to caen and catch up with division
has anyone ever told you youre officer material
thats a mystery to me
no one smiles but they trudge a bit less
the sound of heavy firing
miller checks a map in the brush near the crossroads
a sign reads ramelle km
miller folds up the map
looks like were going to beat those kraut companies to ramelle
suddenly miller stops dead
he listens hearing something the others dont hear
he motions for them to freeze they do
the sound grows louder
its an ominous rumble
i dont think so
the rumble turns into the roar of a big german convoy
troop trucks armored personnel carriers a regiment of crack wehrmacht troops
crossing a bridge
miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge
brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert
hurry along the fields on either side of the road trying to keep up with the vehicles
miller and his men catch a glimpse of an approaching german flank squad
they flatten themselves into the mucky water
ready their weapons
prepare to fire
approaches the bridge
see the culvert obscured by brush
move to check it out
is just about to open up on them
sees his flank squad lagging behind and calls to them
hurry after the rest of the convoy
the americans breathe again
i wonder where theyre going
same place we are
jackson at the mouth of the culvert motions that the coast is clear
they head out
a gently sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small cultivated fields bordered by ancient moss covered stone walls
the twos is visible beyond
miller and his men crouch run to the cover of one of the stone walls
miller pulls out his binoculars
theres a large gathering of german troops and vehicles
scans the germans with his binoculars
looks like tea time maybe theyre brits
i sure hope so
what do you think theyre waiting for captain
just then they hear an ominous rumble deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy
the sound gets louder and louder
miller and his men exchange looks
they know that sound they dont like it
appear down the road heading for the german soldiers who greet them enthusiastically
the tanks are tigers huge far bigger than an american sherman
each one sixty two tons with a big mm gun four heavy machine guns and impregnable armor
each one an infantrymans nightmare
there are four of them
puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow low along the wall
the men are happy to do so looking back nervously at the german tanks
the sounds of sporadic small arms fire
the town square is a deserted battlefield littered with burning debris shell casings and bodies german and american and a few french civilians
miller and his men enter the square weapons ready leap frogging from doorway to doorway
miller and sarge crouch run to the cover of some overhanging debris
they listen trying to pinpoint the exact source of the firing
sarge motions his guess
miller nods in agreement
he signals for the men to follow him around not toward the firing
they move on dashing from cover to cover
a dozen american paratroopers on the bridge exchange sporadic fire with a few german snipers hidden in the buildings near the bridgehead
the bridge has clearly been the scene of heavy fighting
craters burning debris and shell casings are everywhere
the bridge is intact only slightly damaged
there are dozens of german bodies along the riverbank on both sides of the bridge
crouch run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge
looks like theyve been having a hell of a party here captain
a young but grizzled voice calls back
miller turns to his men
they all come up empty
to his men cover me
what if our guys open up sir
youre only allowed to shoot at germans thats one of the rules
have it your way captain
miller takes a breath then dashes out into the open toward the bridge
bullets smash into the ground around miller
pour fire at the german positions the paratroopers pour a heavy stream of bullets at the german positions
miller makes it to the bridge and dives over a defensive jumble of crates sandbags and bodies
he finds himself next to sergeant bill forrest who was the young but grizzled voice that called out
with forrest are some very worn out young american paratroopers
miller catches his breath
forrest navy sir twenty one to nineteen
they won on a field goal in overtime
ill keep it in mind
calls to sarge miller and the paratroopers fire cover for millers men as they come in
miller and forrest alternately take and fire
forrest are we glad to see you sir we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty four hours its been six days
things are tough all over
were looking for a private james ryan
is he here
forrest motions to one of the paratroopers
forrest go get ryan
what do you want him for sir
miller doesnt answer
jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them
jackson get a hold of command
jackson cranks up the five thirty five
miller turns to forrest
how many men do you have
they pause to fire covering sarge the last of millers men to leap over the barricade
forrest eleven sir
we started with thirty six
the bridge was easy to take but the krauts have been coming back at us ever since
they must want it intact or wed be long gone
jackson speaks into the radio handset repeating millers hailing i
forrest sir what do you want with ryan
miller doesnt answer he looks past forrest and sees dashing from cover to cover making his way toward them
ryan is an american classic nineteen years old earthy handsome sharp cocky
though hes exhausted unshaven and smeared with dirt and blood hes very alive
his eyes shine his face has a spark
you cant help but love this kid
all watch ryan run toward them
so thats ryan
looks like a flaming asshole to me
their eyes remain glued to ryan as he makes it to the barricade
he salutes miller
im ryan sir
you wanted to see me
miller looks at ryan for a moment amazed that hes finally face to face with him
miller hesitates searching for words
then he speaks gently but clearly
miller private ive got some bad news for you
your brothers have been killed in action
the life instantly drains from ryan
his breath comes hard
somehow he remains upright
ryan all three
miller grabs him and eases him back leaning him against some sandbags
are stunned at the news
they look at ryan theres nothing else they can do
also look at ryan but then one after another they turn away adverting their eyes looking a their own boots the debris on the bridge the sky anything other than
weve been sent to get you out of here
youre going home
ryan weakly waves miller off
miller motions to his men and the paratroopers to move away
they do so giving ryan a little room
forrest three brothers the poor son of a bitch
sergeant were moving out and im taking you and your men with me
forrest but sir our orders are clear were to hold this bridge until were relieved by forward elements of the twenty ninth division
im giving you new orders sergeant
forrest sir you cant do that these orders are from command
im not going to leave you and your men here to get killed
get them together were moving out
a voice from behind them speaks simply clearly firmly
they all turn and see ryan standing there
miller is about to automatically rip ryan a new asshole for contradicting him but he quickly calms himself gently touches ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him
come on private youre going home
ryan jerks away from miller
all eyes are on miller and ryan
miller remains patient
im sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isnt going to help
sir if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up our guys are going to be sitting ducks
this bridge cannot be held
the germans have two companies less than three miles from here
they have tanks
that news clearly affects ryan and the other paratroopers but ryan holds his ground
ryan sir im still not going
miller speaks with restrained but growing anger
private if you want to commit suicide thats your choice but youre going to have to wait until after i get you back to the beach
and youre not going to take these men with you
ryan stands eye to eye with miller
im not leaving sir
miller starts to boil over
the hell you arent youre comin with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way
you hear me private
i hear you sir but im not leaving
miller grabs ryan by the lapels and shakes him
ryan doesnt resist
listen you little son of a bitch youre coming with me or ill
ryan speaks softly
what are you going to do sir shoot me
miller considers it
then reiben speaks up from behind miller
politely uh excuse me captain
miller slowly turns and glares
continuing so what are a few tanks sir
millers more amazed than pissed off
continuing hes right we cant shoot him
well we could but wed get in an enormous amount of trouble
and hes right about the bridge its a hell of a lot more important than he is
miller turns his glare on jackson
continuing seems to me we got us a opportunity here to kill two birds with one stone
command seems to think keepin this boy alive is worth somethin
if we was to do that and hold this bridge good chance wed get us a bucket full of medals
i might even get me one a them big fancy ones like you got sos i could sass any officer in the whole dang army you included
miller does a slow burn
id like to stay too captain
you dont count
i do and personally id rather get the hell out of here but somebodys got to stay and take care of you and these pin head privates of yours
miller looks at forrest and the paratroopers
forrest we werent planning on going anywhere sir
the votes unanimous
millers eyes almost pop out of his head
miller the vote
what the hell are you talking about
we dont vote
this isnt a democracy
this is the army i give orders you follow them
we dont vote
yes sir of course sir i was merely speaking hypothetically
if this was a voting situation then the vote would have been unanimous
but of course its not a voting situation youre the captain and you give the orders sir
youre goddamned right i give the order
listen to me you little pissant pieces of shit i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes is that clear
they all quickly nod
of course sir
all the others yes sir
miller looks from face to face
in that case
beat i vote we stay
thats what they wanted to hear
miller doesnt give them time to enjoy it he immediately starts barking orders
reiben the b
jackson get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle
sarge you and upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank its worthless where it is
forrest i want a full inventory of all your weapons ammo and ordnance
they all hurry off except for ryan who locks eyes with miller for a moment
thank you sir
gruffly gentle yeah yeah
i want you right next to me no matter where i go you understand
alright come with me
miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with ryan at his side
miller and reiben watch as forrest ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory
forrest two machine guns twenty two grenades two gammon grenades six satchel charges twenty six m s eight tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man
reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry
sir can i change my vote
miller sighs worried
jackson perched on the bridgekeepers hut protected by a crescent of sandbags
his eye is at his scope
falls from a window on the edge of town dead
sits beside jackson with a pair of binoculars searching for another target
the german sniper fire has subsided for now
bridge day miller watches as ryan and several other paratroopers dig a series of trenches across the street leading to the bridge
reiben jackson and upham stone faced watch ryan
miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head
he speaks to sarge who holds several satchel charges
sarge see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable
just then they hear the sound of a big gun firing in the distance
they all turn at the sound
eighty eights right
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner
those guns are close
forrest just south of town
the krauts have a two gun emplacement we saw it on the way in
thats how we knew they wanted the bridge intact they didnt blow the crap out of us
lets hope they dont change their mind
upham listens to the eighty eights with particular interest
within sight of the bridge
sarge carefully plants a wire triggered satchel charge at the door of the building
he sets the wire then carefully backs away
reiben and ryan pile sandbags finishing a forward machine gun nest
miller looks around evaluating sarge and upham at his side
what do you think
well if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo we might stand a chance but not against those tanks
what are we going to do
were going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else
lets hope because were sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here
what about our grenades
those are tigers they have six inch armor they dont even notice grenades
would they notice and eighty eight
sure you got one
the germans do
miller is stone faced then he smiles
upham go find jackson he and i are going hunting
upham runs off
sarge shakes his head
out of the mouth of babes
miller jackson and forrest darken their faces with blackening soot
the rest of millers men and several paratroopers including ryan look on
upham is distressed
upham it was my idea sir youve got to let me go
upham youve got to learn the difference between whining and griping
you cant just rely on natural ability youve got to study and practice
there you go again thats whining thats not okay
goddamn it sir
thats better but youve still got a long way to go
talk to reiben hes a natural and works at it hell give you some pointers
leave him to me captain ill have him pissing and moaning with the best of us
see to it
ryan steps up to miller
id like to go sir
no private i want you to stay here keep your head down dont do anything brave or stupid
arent they the same thing sir
reiben i dont know what id do without you
sarge keep ryan close to you and alive
miller checks jackson and forrest
forrest yes sir
you betcha sir
miller forrest and jackson prepare to move out
southern accent yall come back
reiben are you makin fun a the way i talk
heavy southern accent hell no
jackson shoots him a glare then he follows miller and forrest into the darkness
sarge ryan and the other watch them go
a german eighty eight fires sending its big shell into the night
its eight man crew re loads
a slight movement
he crawls to the edge of the emplacement and freezes in the shadows
a moment later hes joined by forrest
a moment after that jackson silently crawls up to them
eyes the emplacement
looks for a weakness
there is none
he motions to forrest and jackson to wait
the three of them settle into the darkness
sarge upham and reiben sit with ryan in the darkness
ryan is lost in thought far away
one after another millers men eye him
private im sorry about your brothers
then with some difficulty he makes the trip from iowa back to france
he turns to sarge
ryan what was the name of the guy who got killed coming up here
huh he died coming up here to keep me alive
i never met him
he didnt know me from adam strange
what was he like
a good man kind of cheerful reiben here used to call him a happy idiot
like hell i did
my brothers would be mighty pissed off at me if they knew i let some guy get killed trying to keep me alive
you didnt let anybody get killed you didnt even know we were coming up here
sure i know but
sighs goddamn it all
the others nod in agreement
they look closely at ryan
two german soldiers on watch
easing through the darkness
closer to one of the sentries
miller sees jackson easing up behind another sentry
miller nods to jackson
they move at the same moment
behind the sentries
slit their throats
forrest removes the wheel blocks
he sees forrest
just as hes about to open up with his sub machine gun miller grabs him from behind stabs him eases the body silently to the ground
join forrest at the eighty eight
together they attach the eighty eights carriage to the germans truck
rounds a corner
opens forrest dives fires back
race over firing
covering them opens up
kills the advancing germans
miller frantically attaches the eighty eight to the truck
forrest cuts down several more germans
giving miller cover
miller leaps into the cab of the truck
jackson and forrest leap into the back
jackson fires into the approaching germans
is shattered by bullets
glass flies everywhere cutting miller on the face and hands
in the back of the truck
spraying the germans with his thompson
the truck drives through the germans
the germans fire at the truck and trailing eighty eight
miller jackson and forrest drive into the night
the germans firing after them
miller jackson and forrest barrel down the road through a gauntlet of germans
as they approach the bridge the other americans fire cover for them
miller drives the truck onto the bridge
the other americans with ryan in the lead leap over the barricade and drag the captured eighty eight onto the bridge
ryan ignores him
they get the eighty eight safely behind the barricade
miller grabs ryan
he sees reiben sarge and upham shrugging clearly not pissed at ryan
dont do that again
i wont need to sir its already here behind the barricade so
miller glares at ryan then strides off
miller and upham carefully dig up a german mine
very gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines
miller and ryan lay a mine into the dirt
they cover it and step back carefully
then they proceed with the next
upham is covering their tracks while jackson is digging the holes in which theyll place the rest of the mines
everything is ready
theres nothing to do now but wait
reiben and jackson sit behind the sandbags
they can see ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away manning the rear machine gun nest with sarge
what do you think
i think im we got that eighty eight
i mean ryan what do you think of him
he aint half bad i guess
theyre quiet for a moment
he aint wade
nope he aint wade
their eyes keep coming back to ryan
crouch runs through the shadows and stops at the bridgekeepers hut
miller points directing reiben to the forward machine gun nest
reiben jumps down and moves forward
miller runs across the bridge and joins sarge and ryan in the rear machine gun nest
miller and sarge exchange a look
then miller slips off to check the others
the americans are ready for battle
we see them in their positions manning the forward machine gun nest
behind the sandbags on top of the bridgekeepers hut
behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward and the rear machine gun nests
manning rear machine gun
at the bridgehead waiting
all eyes turn
dashes across the street
exposed only for an instant
cocks his thompson
settles down behind some sandbags
opens up with the machine gun
at least fifty of them advancing on the bridge
running from cover to cover
a squad pushing a french truck using it as a shield
calmly picking off the attacking germans
make their way down the streets
along the riverbank
through the houses
there are germans firing from all directions
sees reiben and upham being cut off
grabs the b
stands and fires
running out of ammo
see that theres nothing else they can do
time to go
reiben rolls out of the nest carrying the fifty caliber
upham follows carrying the ammo boxes
they run as fast as they can
reiben takes a glancing slug
rolls and gets up
bleeding from the side but not mortal
upham helps him
they make it to the sandbags of the first barricade
the germans are almost on them
with the rear machine gun
drops several germans
they swarm over the first barricade
fires a burst into a germans belly
hits another with the stock of his thompson
firing cover for miller reiben and upham dont see a flanking germans squad easing along the riverbanks
two of the germans lob potato mashers among the paratroopers
the paratroopers see the grenades
no time to react
half a dozen germans break through
miller kills two more with a burst
is jumped on by one
kills the german
struggling with a pair of germans
drops one of the germans on miller with a head shot
cuts open millers face with bits of skull
leaps onto the final german attacking miller
that german raises his rifle on ryan
all see it
simultaneously shoot the german
about to kill ryan
torn apart by bullets from three directions
i got him
like hell you did i got him
he got him
miller slams in a fresh clip
fires an arc
drops four germans
sees an oncoming rush of germans
barks to reiben and upham they retreat firing back as best they can trying to make it to the barricade
sees them in deep trouble
leaves ryan firing the rear machine gun
grabs the b
advances firing cover
miller reiben upham make it to the barricade
sees theyve made it
fires a final burst
races for cover
a trail of bullets right behind him
the other americans fire for all theyre worth
trying to cover sarge
too many germans
continue to fire horrified
cradling the b
stumbling toward cover
desperately trying to cover him
open up with a volley
is almost there
as best they can
right past sarge
its not enough
five feet from the sandbags his back is torn apart by germans fire
he looks down stunned at his chest
amazed to see gaping holes
an instant of surprise more than fear
he looks to miller
takes two more stumbling steps
falls onto the sandbags
dropping the b
over the edge
who killed sarge are killed
the others back off for now
reiben upham jackson ryan fire at the retreating germans
grabs sarge and pulls him over the barricade
sees that hes dead
around the corner
stunned lays sarge down kneeling next to him
watch start to gather
get back to your positions
they follow the order
all except ryan who doesnt move
he cant take his eyes off sarge
he just stares at sarges body
looks at miller sees him growing weak starting to sway
he gently tries to move miller aside
ill take care of sarge
miller looks up at ryan then back at sarges body
miller grows cold making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over wades body
but this time it doesnt work
he cant make it stick
the hard expression disappears
he drifts utterly lost
hes called his own bluff
the distant guns are silent for once
reiben upham jackson ryan and miller have tightened their perimeter
miller is in a trance
the others glance at him nervously
they eat in silence
a last supper
then from out of nowhere miller speaks english teacher addley pennsylvania
slowly millers men turn to him
whatd you say captain
i teach english at addley high school in addley pennsylvania
well ill be goddamned i knew it
like hell you did
captain what about our deal
i changed my mind
i coach the baseball team too
they all sit in silence
you know that cruise ship wades grandfather was on
they all nod except ryan who doesnt know what millers talking about
continuing i wonder if his cabin is still available
thats not where i am
where are you
im in a dressing room with mrs
rachel troubowitz our supers wife
shes an easy forty four double e but ive convinced her shes a thirty eight d and im watching her try and squeeze herself into a side stay silk ribboned
three panel girdle with s helf lift brassiere
smiles shes having a devil of a time getting into that thing
they all share reibens dream for a moment
then jackson smiles
im walking with my hound lucy its about an hour fore sunrise and were out huntin coon
i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey
jackson how many times i got to tell you youre from tennessee
i am but i like imported whiskey
so there i am and i hear the biggest ole coon you ever did hear a rustlin right there in front of me
that ole boy comes right out of the brush i got a clear shot and he knows hes bout to meet his maker

then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a that mash whiskey
i dont know i kind of like wades idea about the cruise ship
ive never been to tahiti
what about you captain
he knows exactly where he is
im in my backyard lying in my hammock with my arm around my wife listening for the sound of breaking glass
say what capn
you see ive got the best house in all of addley
its not the biggest house but its got the best location right next to the junior high baseball field
the garage windows face left field
the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them
the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens
two hundred twenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows
it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far
i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up the ones who are going to give us a shot at the
i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass i know were one step closer to winning it all
dont that get kind of expensive capn
its worth it
to each his own
theyre all silent for a moment
then miller turns to ryan
how about you james
im home playing basketball with my brothers its evenin time were trying to get in a few more points before its too dark to see the ball
thats where i am
they all nod
miller tears off a piece of bread and passes it to ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on
they all eat in silence
a ground fog drifts
a german tiger tank rumbles toward the village
all are awake
at their positions
hears the faint distant rumble of the tank
barely has time to react
sees here they come
fires a burst
fires a burst
more germans drop
lots of them
moving from cover to cover
manning the forward machine gun
way out front
sees that hes going to be cut off
he grabs the hot gun
the barrel burns into his flesh
he ignores the pain and runs back toward the bridge
he dives over the sandbags
barely makes it
trailed by take positions near the bridge
break through the perimeter
ryan shoots one
grapples with the other two
shoots one german
stabs the other
ryan falls back
reiben only gives him a quick look
gets to the machine opens up against the germans who are still coming
fires a long burst
more germans drop
take positions in the building near the bridge
they start working their way to the tops of the nearby buildings
making their way along the riverbanks
ryan feeding the ammo belt
he grabs a pair of ammo boxes
runs toward reiben and ryan
open up on him
bullets trail upham
hes outrunning them
takes half a dozen slugs
stumbles the final few steps to the machine gun nest
falls on the sandbags giving reiben and ryan the ammo
for just a micro second
grabs the ammo
ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the one almost out
cutting down the advancing germans
knows what that means
he hears the immediately grab the machine gun and ammo and race back to the rear nest
then ryan and miller converge at the eighty eight
the first tank appears huge
trailed by two german infantry platoons
on the bridgekeepers hut
picking off german soldiers who follow the tank
a german infantryman spots jackson
hollers into the tanks voice tube
grinds its gears
turning its turret towards the bridgekeepers hut
knows whats coming but he holds his position continuing to pick off german soldiers
see jackson die
a bare moment to react
then they turn their attention back to the eighty eight
frantically turning the aiming cranks
lowering the barrel to point blank
which can fire first
win the race
quickly reload the eighty eight
shoves the final shell into the breech of the eighty eight
pats ryan on the back
grabs a satchel charge
runs down the bridge
right toward the two advancing tanks
races through the debris
trailed by bullets
with the machine gun
keeping most of the german infantry down
ryan jumps behind the second machine gun
helping to cover miller
turning toward the fast approaching miller
ready to blow him to bits
is almost there
he arms the satchel charge
throws the satchel charge under the tank
rolls off the edge of the bridge
lands on the embankment below
miller ryan reiben continue firing
almost out of ammo
miller scrambling up the embankment back onto the bridge hears something over the sounds of firing
ryan and reiben cease firing
now they hear it too
a rumble deeper and more ominous than any theyve heard yet
ryan lots of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation
they know that they are dead men
they settle into their positions and prepare to fire and die
the rumble gets louder and louder
then millers face starts to change
of a smile
then a real smile
an american sherman tank appears from over the rise
then stand there stunned watching tank after tank appear along with scores of heavily armed american soldiers
they keep coming and coming
american tanks with wave after wave of u
infantrymen looking for targets
they find a few among the departing germans
run onto the bridge and start to secure the position
a sergeant and a few of his men look around curiously eyeing miller reiben and ryan battered and bloody standing among the bodies
a major strides up
major report captain
miller company b second rangers thats private richard reiben and thats private james ryan hundred and first airborne
the sergeant and several other soldiers overhear
one of the soldiers speaks quietly to another
soldier thats him thats ryan
the major puts his hand on ryans shoulder
major command is looking for you son
youre going home
ryan looks up tired
american tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the road and over the bridge
in a small area cleared of the debris the bodies of jackson upham sarge forrest and the other paratroopers are laid out neatly respectfully covered
miller and reiben stay protectively close to ryan as if they dont want to risk him being bumped into or run over by any of the advancing troops or vehicles
walks to the bodies
he kneels down next to sarge and looks at him for a long moment
then with a steady hand he takes one of sarges two dog tags
then he does the same to jackson and upham
reiben and ryan watch silently
stands and walks back to reiben and ryan
he hands the dog tags to ryan who grips them tightly and nods in thanks
miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies then he shoulders his gear
miller lets move out
reiben and ryan gather up their gear
they walk with miller down the road away from the bridge
the three dirty bloodied tired men walk down the road ignored by the fresh troops marching in the opposite direction
upham and jackson what were they like
good kid smart he was writing a book
yeah and he was fast too ran the in twenty four five
jackson was from west fork tennessee he was going to be a preacher his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson
beat he was the best friend i ever had
smiles lemme tell you about sarge
they walk on disappearing in the distance among the hundreds and hundreds of american soldiers who are marching down the road and over the bridge
