written by robert mark kamen based on the novel by bryce courtenay february draft copyright warner bros
what if the power of one becomes the power of many and the power of many becomes the power of one
a white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse
on the door a decal capetown sanitorium
two men dressed in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm house one gently guiding a rather frail troubled woman toward the car the other totes her suitcase
of a young man narrates there comes a time in everyones life when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is yourself
that the only real power anyone has to get anything done is the power of one
with any luck you can make it through a lot of years before you ever have to face the reality of that fact
beat it was a luxury i never had
i discovered it the year my mother had her nervous breakdown
one attendant holds the rear door of the car open for the woman
before entering she turns one last time toward the farmhouse
a young boy looking one part scared one part sad and one part lost stares back at her his hand held by a large amiable black woman with tears rolling
down her round cheeks
i was all of six
the woman enters the car
the car drives off down the road
the boy watches it disappear behind a plume of swirling dust
my father died before i was born and even though i was raised by my zulu nanny with my mother depending on her health in nominal attendance it was decided
with her departure that i too would depart
beat for boarding school
the dust the boy has been watching reverses itself
an unseen vehicle comes up the road
but before i could be sent out into the world one very serious matter had to be dealt with
beat i was a chronic bedwetter
since my nanny was the one responsible for my well being she did what any responsible zulu mother would do
she called on the greatest medicine man of her tribe inkosi inkosikazi
out of the dust a large black buick roadmaster roars up the road and into the yard scattering chickens and geese stopping in front of the wide eyed six year
old and his tremulous nanny
a huge zulu jumps out of the front passenger seat and opens the rear door
a moment passes and then two splayed cracked feet descend from the car and settle into the dust
inkosi inkosikazi years old small black wizened hair and beard whiter than cotton a leopard skin draped over his shoulders a beaded fly switch in one hand a trussed chicken
in the other exits the car
a fire burns bright in the black african night
the boy sits holding the chicken close by the fire while inkosi inkosikazi shuffles around him drawing a circle in the dust with a stick
legend had it that inkosi inkosikazi was the last son of the great zulu king dingaan who fought both the boers and the british to a standstill nearly years before
and the night inkosi inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun rose
the circle complete the old man sits down opposite the boy
from a leather pouch he produces several bones
he throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a moment
he begins to wave the fly switch back and forth in front of the boys eyes chanting low softly
the boys eyes grow heavy his lids droop
the boy and the old man are standing above a great waterfall
in the swirling pool far below are ten stepping stones linking one bank to the other
the medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones counting as i went until i reached dry land
the boy jumps cascading down the falls and into the pond below
he clambers up the first rock
it is slippery
he falls off and climbs back on buffeted by the spraying water
he makes his way stone by stone toward the other side
even though it was only a dream i felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real
the water was like ice bone chilling cold and as i made my way from one stone to the next i could feel my strength desert me
the progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the boy keeps slipping into the swirling water coughing and sputtering
i was three rocks in when i ran out of gas
i couldnt pull myself any further
no matter how hard i
tried the current tried harder
i felt myself going under for the last time
the boys grip slips off the rock
he starts to go under
the fire has gone out
the boy is still sitting in the circle the chicken still in his lap
his eyes snap open
the first thing he sees is inkosi inkosikazi sitting across from him with a big smile
inkosi inkosikazi enters the buick
the boy and his smiling nanny watch
they boy still holds the chicken
inkosi inkosikazi said the spirit of the great zulu warriors lived in me
he told me that whenever trouble arose i should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks until the trouble passed
he said three rocks were enough to conquer my problem with the night water that i was very brave
he said i was a man for all africa bound to her by my spirit bound by my dreams
beat and he let me keep the chicken
the boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of dust
the boy sits on a train looking out the window at the veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance
a sack on his lap moves
the chickens head pops out
the boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches behind his scraggly comb
although i was bound by spirit
and dream to africa i was bound by heritage and language to the birthplace of my grandparents england a country i had never seen but one that was to cause
me eminently more problems than bedwetting ever did
a motorcar driving along the road to the school
the school i was sent to was attended and staffed entirely by afrikaaners the oldest of the two white tribes of africa
the six year old walks timorously through the halls filled with bigger boys brash noisy hostile
they only speak the taal afrikaans
over and over they jostle or verbally deride the six year old knocking his books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is kicked in the
or pulling his shirt out from under his jacket and making it hard to move
i spoke only english
the hated tongue
the language of the enemy who had usurped power and stolen the country through political chicanery and military brutality
a mob of boys led by a big bully jaapie botha runs the six year old through the bathroom and into the showers fully clothed
he tries to run out
jaapie botha grabs him and throws him back in holding him with one ham fisted hand under the shower head and turning the shower on with the other
the six year old stands miserable as the stinging water pelts him
during the boer war of boer women and children were herded into detainment camps by the british where they died like flies from dysentery
malaria and black water fever
and it seemed i was destined to shoulder the responsibility for each and every one of those deaths
the six year old in his first soccer game receives the ball
he tries to move upfield but he is kicked and pushed the ball taken from him
he gets up gamely to follow the chase only to be flattened blindsided by jaapie botha
and no one made this more evident to me than jaapie botha a wheat farmers son from the transvaal
the six year old asleep his chicken perched alertly atop the bed
the only time i was at peace was when i slept
inkosi inkosikazis chicken proved to be like his previous owner a salvation
the boy builds a small shelter for the chicken who clucks and forages contentedly
during the day he would live outside the dorm happily scarfing down bugs and grubs secure in a little house i built for him
and at night he would hop through the window and perching over my bed squawking if any intruders came near
several boys sneak up in the dark
the chicken begins to chatter
the six year old wakes a shoe in hand ready to throw
the shadows scatter
the boy gives the chicken a few grains of corn and an affectionate scratch behind the ear and goes back to sleep
he was my best and only friend
boys and faculty running through the halls excitedly showing newspapers with pictures of hitler and chamberlain on the front
posters and slogans with swastikas are slapped up on walls
some boys mimic heiling to each other
im sure in time a status quo would have been achieved between me and my schoolmates were it not for the cataclysmic events occurring in that faraway place none of
us had ever seen
beat two montjhs after i arrived at the school world war ii broke out in europe
hitler had vowed to crush the british empire
the boers sharpened their swords in anticipation
the six year old comes back to his bed in the dorm to find a swastika carved into it
the six year old sleeps fitfully
there is a muffled squawk
a blanket is thrown over his head
the boy is dumped on the floor the blanket removed
his eyes open in horror
the room is lit by torches
shadows dance fearfully off two dozen boys with swastika armbands and leather pistol rigs without pistols strapped to their sides
in front of him on a platform jaapie botha stands his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder
as another student painfully tattoo scars his arm with a swastika using a knife and blue dye
seeing the six year old jaapie turns his attention to him and addresses him in afrikaans
god has sent hitler to deliver us from the english bastards who stole our country and killed our people
the other boys chorus in
we will swear a blood oath
when hitler comes well rise up and kill the verdomde rooineks
a blood oath
a blood oath
jaapie bends down and grabs the six year old by the shirt front yanking him up
with your blood
jaapie slaps the boy across the mouth three times
blood flows from his mouth and nose
jaapie dips his finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo
he holds up his bloodied fingers
we swear allegiance to adolf hitler
we swear allegiance to adolf hitler
death to all englishmen in south africa
the chorus repeats
god bless the fatherland
the voices come back to him stronger
jaapie grabs the six year old again
see what we have in store for you when hitler comes rooinek
he gives a command
the boys at the far end of the room part
the six year olds eyes open in terror
feet away inkosi inkosikazis chicken his chicken is hung from a rafter upside down haplessly flapping against his bonds
but before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is gang tackled and held
jaapie picks up a sling and a rock
for crimes committed against the whole boer people
i jaapie botha the judge and uberfuhrer sentence you and your rooinek kaffir chicken to death
jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around
the six year old struggles to get free
the sling whistles through the air faster and faster
jaapie releases the stone
it flies true catching the squawking struggling chicken flush in the chest
the flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers
jaapie flings his hand forward victorious
the boy takes the opportunity to break loose
he rushes jaapie whose arm is outstretched putting him off balance
the boy catches him low driving his head into jaapies exposed stomach
jaapie falls back and gets the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass
jaapie botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs futiley for the embedded blade
his cohorts laugh thinking it tremendously funny until jaapie removes the knife and turns with it dripping his own blood his eyes murderous
the laughter dies
jaapies breath comes hard
hang him up
a few boys protest
but botha is murderous intent on revenge
he waves the bloody knife in the air
three boys grab the six year old and drag him to where the chicken is hanging
two more boys throw a rope over the same rafter
others bind the struggling boy trussing his hands to his sides
you will pay for the deaths of our grandfathers and grandmothers our aunts and uncles
all rooineks will pay and you will be first
the boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter
the six year old is hoisted up until he is eye level with the chicken
in the name of adolf hitler and the fatherland i sentence you to die verdomde rooinek
jaapie swings the sling overhead faster and faster
he watches as jaapie bears down
as jaapie is about to let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two staff members burst in surprising in
the rock flies from the sling but jaapies attention is diverted
his aim is off
the rock grazes the boy above the eye
he loses consciousness
the scene fades to prince of wales school
pk going on well built intense clear eyed handsome stands in front of a seminar and continues reading to students honor students headmaster st
johns chosen few
john with the demeanor of an oxford don and a mane of snowy white hair that reaches his shoulders sits off to the side listening
i came to after being unconscious for two days the rock missing my eye by half an inch
after a week in hospital it was decided id be sent to my grandfathers house in the english town of barberton at least until passions at school cooled
jaapie botha was expelled sent home to his familys farm in disgrace
beat and so the first recorded south african casualty of hitlers insanity was not a boer nor a rooinek but a tatter feathered half bald kaffir chicken
the end of class bell rings
offstage other classrooms are exiting into the common hall but no one in st
johns study moves
john takes his
glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately
after a long moment he turns to face the class
very evocative yes
particularly the image of the chicken
good choice there
john rises lecturing
any ideology that needs to attack the thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its own generation
inclusion gentlemen not exclusion is the key to survival
beat something our new government should take heed of eh
his eyes roam from face to face fixing his point
next week we have mr
levy who will enlighten us on
morrie a bright eyed kinetic speaks up
sport and wager in imperial rome sir
facetious very apt mr
we look forward to the experience
pause all right
the boys bolt for the door
thank you sir
ive received notice from the
oxford selection committee
you are to appear before them in three weeks
i assume youll be reading a piece of your fiction as your presentational
a word of caution
contemporary to most of these fellows means the seventeenth century
try and keep your theme um classical if you know what i mean
beat will the scholarship be decided at the same time sir
moneys a different matter
very good sir
john picks up a book and opens the pages
he begins to read
pk takes it as a cue for his dismissal
he goes to exit
pk turns at the door
good luck tonight
thank you sir
john returns to his book
morrie waits in the now nearly empty hall taking some money from another boy and making notations in a black book
pk comes up to him
how we doing
morrie consults the book
you win and your dream comes true
you lose were back to bread and butter sandwiches till terms end
whatd he want
my appointement before the oxford committee came through
for a brain like you maybe
come on youll read one of your pieces theyll be begging you to attend
but will they pay for the privilege
well lets bloody hope so
itll be a lonely time without you there
is that the voice of sentimentality i hear coming from you
sentimentality my ass
where am i going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody oxford
he shoves morrie playfully out the door and follows
as they walk down the long hall looking straight ahead
sweat dapples pks face
both boys are focused on double doors at the end of the hall
there is the distant muffled sound of a crowd cheering
you hear sutcliffe screwed bartletts sister when he stayed with them over holidays
i dont believe it
i heard it from bartletts own lips
hes selling reservations for next holiday
a pound for one night three pounds for four
for both of us
took the whole holiday
the cheering crowd grows louder the closer they get to the double doors
im about to have a calf
this bloody boer gets lucky were in the poorhouse
they reach the double doors
still in closeup morrie turns to face pk for the first time
were not here to exhibit our wares
we go in we do the job we get out
pk is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors
he does not move his head a hair
morrie and pk draw a deep breath
together they push open the double doors
together they stride into a floodlit fully packed sports arena and head down the fan lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center
schoolboys in their respective school blazers afrikaan and english yell whistle and clap
pk and morrie in full frame reveal pk in a boxing robe with taped hands and morrie with towel and bucket
and at the end of six matches in all weight divisions the score is prince of wales three victories helpmakeer three victories
the stands explode with cheers
and now for the final bout to determine which school will win the johannesburg public school boxing team championship
in this corner weighing pounds standing from the helpmakeer school with a record of on the year jannie geildenhaus
a huge cheer goes up for jannie muscular bare chested as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd
pk enters the ring
he stands robe on eyes intent on jannie
when the noise subsides the announcer continues
and in this corner representing the prince of wales school the current johannesburg public school welterweight champion also with a record of on the year also pounds kid p
now the english schoolboys cheer for their man but pk does not respond
he barely moves
he raises an arm in bare acknowledgment
his attention stays focused across the ring on his shadowboxing opponent
pk watches jannie dance closely when a low chanting begins from outside the stadium african tribal mystical harmonies of black voices building until the white voices inside the stadium are
stunned to silence
the song carries beautifully in the night
for the first time pks focus is broken but not like the others in the audience who havent a clue as to whats happening
he has heard this before
this is familiar
this is for him
a distant knowing flickers in his eyes like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his name
over and over one phrase is indistinguishable the chorus of the song
ono bi shobi ingelosi
the chanting stops as suddenly as it began
a moment passes before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon
the announcer attempts to bring everyones attention back to the business at hand
we thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm
but now on to the main event
fighters to center ring please
pk focused again meets jannie at the referee
you both know the rules
no butts no elbows no low blows
first man to score three knock downs wins
lets have a good clean fight
good luck to you
the fighters slap leather
pk turns back to his corner when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the crowd
sit one of them maria elizabete marais with honey blonde hair and lapis blue eyes turns her head and engages pks eyes and his heart
she quickly looks away
but a connection has been made fire passed
goes back to his corner and takes off his robe
morrie stands holding pks mouthpiece
first row third from the left
find out who she is
morrie looks down at maria
were in a bloody war here in
case you forgot
lets keep our mind on that hey
he jams the mouthpiece into pks mouth as the bell rings
pk turns to an onslaught by jannie a real brawler
jannies big overhand rights almost nail pk until he finds his footing and dances away
jannie comes after him hard his schoolmates bellowing encouragement
but pks far superior boxing skills put jannie at an immed iate disadvantage
it is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter
pks jabs keep jannie at an arms length until he closes with a combination
jannie willing to take three punches to land one absorbs pks point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches
when he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch
ill kill you
pk pushes off as jannie hammers at his kidneys
backing up pk repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the face
pk works jannie turning him left then right working the angles keeping him off balance while he racks up the points
jannie goes left
as pk chases him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring
with a younger black companion of more average height the only black faces in a crowd of people
their presence distracts pk for a split second and in that split second jannie seizes the opportunity
he comes across with a big right hand to pks jaw
pk goes down hard
the crowd goes wild
morrie leaps up and down in the corner
but pk is seeing double
he shakes his head trying to clear it
dancing in his corner sensing victory the ref over
pk forces himself up
the ref checks him
jannie comes rushing in banging pk with a series of hard rights but dropping his left each time he throws one
pk absorbs the punishment as best he can backing up dancing away
jannie is all over him just as the bell rings
jannie goes back to his corner triumphant
pk goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex pression
morrie goes to work on a small cut over his eye
what are you trying to do bankrupt us
pk turns and looks at the two africans at the rear door
morries eyes follow him tensing as he sees the two men
if they get caught in here theyre dead
beat what the hells going on
i dont know
well worry about it later
in case you havent noticed this boer bastard is trying to kill you
you see the way he drops his left when he throws the right
the bell rings
pk and morrie trade a look
jannie comes rushing over and throws a big right
pk steps to his own right side and pops jannie right over his dropped left hand
he looks at morrie again
thank you god
jannie comes after pk paying for each big right he throws as pk finds his mark
pk plants one then two then three punches on jannies face
finally frus trated jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail pk with wild flailing blows
pk bobs and weaves and feints
jannies punches grow weary
pk begins to bear down driving his man back with rapid fire com binations until he delivers the coup de grace a left hook to the heart and a driving
jannie goes down in a heap
the crowd goes wild
the referee counts him out
jannies seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter
morrie also rushes in followed by the prince of wales boxing team
they hoist pk up on their shoulders
rising from her seat and leaving with the other girls
their eyes meet
her hint of a smile breaks his heart
she disappears in the crowd
pks eyes rise to the rear exit
the tall african and his companion have vanished
the boxing team and a number of their supporters are in raucous celebration
morrie comes bouncing through the crowd until he enters the empty dressing room in the rear where pk is getting dressed
morrie takes a wad of money out of his pocket
here you go pal
he hands pk the money
youre the treasurer of this company
you hold it
did you find out what i asked for
uh listen p
you know in this world there is no greater proponent of sins of the flesh than morrie levy
but do yourself a favor on this one
take my advice
thanks for the advice
the information please
do you know who her father is
professor daniel marais
hes the nationalist partys resident intellectual
the man is one of the architects of this damned system of what are they calling it
he has about as much use for a rooinek englishman rutting after his daughter as the queen does for balls pardon my french
whats her name and where do i find her
maria elizabete marais seniors cottage room devilliers school
they dont call it fortress virgin for nothing
youll never get in
pk slips his school blazer on
you going to take book on that
three to one says you dont
whered you bet
i took a big position you do
pk smiles at his friend and starts to leave
morrie stuffs some banknotes in his breast pocket
in case you have to bail yourself out
pk boxes him around playfully and skips out running the gauntlet of the celebration outside
indeed fortress virgin
surrounded by a high stone wall the schools gothic towers loom medieval in the african moonlight
a security guard mans the front gate
pk takes a route through shadows and shrubs searching for a way in
he finds one in a tree whose massive limbs reach over the wall
in a flash pk is up the tree and over the wall
pk makes his way through the darkened campus
a few stu dents and some staff are about
pk hugs the shadows as best he can
pk passes a statue dominating the quad a boer family from the last century the man looking for ward his gun braced for action the women and children at his
shoulder brave resolute
pk comes up to the cottage where a few girls can be seen through the windows studying at lamplit desks or readying for bed
other rooms are already dark
pk slips inside the building
pk moves along the hall looking for room
he is about to turn a corner when two girls chattering in afrikaans come down a staircase
pk backs into a
darkened room to his left
the girls appear in robes with towels and toiletries and step into the same room
one flicks on the light to reveal the shower room separate cubicle stalls
still chattering the girls disrobe
pressed hard against the inside wall of a stall with a clear view of the proceedings
he holds his breath as one of the girls heads towards his stall
her girl friend cautions her
those are always cold
use this one
the girl turns away to another stall just in time
the showers start
pk allows himself to breathe again
he exits quickly
maria marais sits at her desk in a nightgown working on a paper when there is a knock on the door
with her mind still on her work she opens the door
her eyes go wide with shock when she sees pk
he puts a cautionary finger to his lips
may i come in
maria frozen with surprise steps back
pk enters gently closing the door behind him
im sorry to scare you
nervous you cant be here
she speaks in afrikaan accented english
i didnt know how else to meet you
i could be expelled
girls dont usually come to boxing matches
we went on a dare
pk ignores her anxiety
did you like it
you were very good
in afrikaans thank you
im glad i impressed you
surprised you speak the taal
ill speak zulu if itll help me see you again
i need my fathers permission
is it hard to get
hard for an afrikaaner boy
impossible for an english one
how about your permission
do i have that
all of a sudden there is a knock on the door
pk moves quickly behind the door as it opens to
were having coffee upstairs
want to come
i have to finish this paper
come when youre finished
well be up late
they close the door
maria reinforces it with her body
you didnt answer my question
there are plenty of english girls
what makes me so important
the way i felt when i saw you
he is so direct she can only blush deeper
her response is indirect but affirmative
my father will insist on meeting you
i cant wait
the outside door to the dorm opens
a matrons voice calls out
lights out ladies
pk opens her window and starts to climb out
in afrikaans good night maria marais
in english good night pk
i dont remember telling you my name
smiling and i dont remember telling you mine
pk smiles back at her
he drops to the ground
maria closes the window and watches him scoot across the campus until he is swallowed by the night
an ample house
pan across a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in boer history the great trek an endless progression of oxcarts heading north the battle of blood river against the
zulu armies the hang ing of boer farmers by british regulars
women and children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn in the background
boer kommandos sniping at a british column on the veldt
pan from the pictures to photographs sepia toned his torical and dr
daniel marais and pk strolling past the pictures
marais points to a photo of a young boer turn of the century posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched hat of a boer kommando
jan piet marais
at he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him
i consider myself an african sir
as do i
as do the zulu the xhosa the pongo the ndebele
were all africans
but all from separate tribes ay
why do you say that
because its the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in south africa
the problems of south africa my boy do not come from tribalism
they come from counter tribalism
from people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since gods creation should be tampered with
does the gazelle sleep with the lion
does the rhino graze with the mouse
the separation of things is not coincidental
do you think a zulu wants to see his culture his sense of identity replaced by someone elses anymore than i do
but i dont think he wants being a zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has
which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law
laws define rights
but do they define justice
the banner behind which the english marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world
justice my boy is only relative to whos in charge
and how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice
beat with all due respect
marais fixes pk with a stare
pks eyes meet his evenly unwavering
papa would you like coffee in the library or the parlor
pleasant the library mein leib
maria smiles at pk and exits
he leads pk towards the library
i cant figure out if youre brave or foolish
why is that sir
you come here to ask for permission to see my daughter
and knowing who i am what i stand for do you think this sort of discussion is going to put that request in a favorable light
i thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldnt want his daughter seeing someone who didnt think
let me give you some advice then
i admire a keen mind
but intellectual reputation or not i am first a marais a member of the volk
and if youre trying to impress a member of the volk with your intellect dont do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an english private school
these ideas i picked up somewhere else
marais opens the library door
joking no doubt from an expert on race relations
actually sir from an expert on cactus
a brilliant african sun beats down on the veldt below
on the rock a seven year old pk sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape
a long shadow covers him
the click of a camera is heard
pk turns shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall white haired figure shirtless in hiking boots and kneesocks holding a box camera
you will excuse me please
doc speaking in german accented english moves off from the suns glare down to pks level
on his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it
this i do not normally without permission do ja
but to catch the expression
after all it is the expression that is important
without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat
you have some problems i think
i am professor karl von vollensteen
doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly
he holds out his hand
doc takes it
such a young person with such an
i think we can be friends
eighteen year old pk narrates
that was how i met doc as he insisted i call him
a chance meeting between a directionless seven year old boy and an old german professor out collecting cacti on the african bush veldt
pause so began my education
doc and pk walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails down dry river beds through the jungle always collecting cacti and aloe samples doc always talking always explaining
doc believed the brain had two functions and that the south african public school system unfortunately dealt with only one
the brain p
has two functions
it is the best reference library ever which is a good thing to have
but also from it comes original thought
in school you will get all filled up with the facts
here your brain will learn where to look how to look how to think
and then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been
doc and pk sit high up
pk watches the endless animal migration below while doc points things out across the landscape
doc knew everything
he had a love of learning
but his real passion was centered around two things music and cacti
pk and doc walk up a steep road toward docs house which sits on top of the hill both carrying cacti filled
until he was fifty doc had a successful career as a concert pianist all over europe
on his fiftieth birthday he gave it all up and moved to south africa
from that point on it was all cactus
behind docs simple whitewashed cottage is a magnif icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples doc has collected for years
pk and doc plant another specimen
doc photographs it
pk records its genus in a notebook
every specimen doc found would be carefully photographed and catalogued
doc an pk walk through the cactus garden
if god would choose a plant to represent him i think he would choose of all plants the cactus
this one plant has all the blessings he tried but failed to give man
it is true
the cactus is humble but not submissive
it grows where no other plant will grow
the sun bakes its back the wind rips it from cliffs or drowns it in the dry desert sand
not a complaint
in good times or bad it will still flower
it protects itself from danger
doc touches a cactus needle
but it harms no other plant
has patience and solitude and modesty
in mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night
that is saintliness of the highest order i think
from cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of god or stare into the mouth of
it is the plant of patience solitude love and madness
toughness and gentleness
of all the plants i think it is closest to god
doc was a hard man to disagree with
so when he decided i must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my educational environment i didnt argue
shabbily genteel doc sits in his sunday best a cup of tea on his lips talking in earnest to pks pipe puffing also shabbily genteel grandfather as pk looks on
appealing to my grandfathers stoic belief in the primacy of european culture in all its forms doc offered to instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate
and gather his precious cacti
doc and pk practice on a beautiful steinway so grandly out of place in docs simple abode
as a student of music i was never more than adequate something i suspect doc knew from the start
it is the love of music that is most important he would tell me and i would believe him
doc and pk wander through the jungle looking for flora
everything fits p
nothing is unexplained
nature is one big chain reaction
everything depends on everything else
from the smallest to the biggest
always in life an idea starts small like a tree
doc shows pk a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it
this tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky
but this little vine can choke it and keep it small
most people are like these vines
afraid of new ideas
afraid to let things grow
doc rips the vine away from the tree
always listen to yourself
follow your own idea
if you are wrong so what
you learn something
and with learning you grow stronger
and if you are right at the beginning
an even bigger bonus
doc and pk move alongside the great herds
i roamed the kloofs and ridges the dry riverbeds and jungle floors with doc for over a year learning more than i realize even today
pause i also played a lot more god save the king due to my new musical celebrity
track through barberton a small town on the low veldt in all its colonial backwater splendor
barberton was a very proper english town with a proper square a wide main street and the colonials overblown patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen hanging in
the air like fine dust
not quite seen but there nonetheless
pk plays god save the king on the stage
the towns population stands the men stoic the women dewey eyed at patriotic attention
some people file out the men in officers uniforms of the south african penal system and their wives boers
they exit to the dagger stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from her majestys loyal subjects
the only afrikaaners to live in barberton were sent there to work at the government prison just outside town
germany had covertly supported the boers in their two unsuccessful wars against british rule supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample stocks of ammunition
germany was an old friend a trusted friend
and in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond for life as the war in europe grew fiercer tensions in barberton heated up
suspicion was afoot
spies were everywhere
doc and pk walk toward the cottage
doc reads pks report card
he looks down at pk
if there is one thing i know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory
but i dont want to be known as a brain
who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school
my boy to be smart is not a sin
but to be smart and not use it that is sin number one
and as for getting beat up on use your brain to figure out how not to be
he hands pk the report card his displeasure obvious
as they crest the hill the cottage comes into view along with a parked army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it
seeing doc and pk the soldiers smarten up raising their rifles and advancing
docs face grows pale his lips tight
pk pulls close to him for support
again it begins
do not be frightened
doc puts na arm around pks shoulder drawing him close comforting him
one of the soldiers pulls a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances
a car pulls up
doc in shackles is escorted from the car
pk exits after him
two guards lead doc toward the doorway to the prison a square in the looming gates
doc walks his head held high
pk walks alongside holding his hand
karl von vollensteen for the failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with his majestys government orders to do so you are hereby sentenced to
be confined at barberton prison for the duration of the war with germany
at the door a guard touches pks shoulder holding him back
the door opens
doc goes through
just before the door closes he looks back at pk one last time
the door slams shut
pk with tears streaming down his cheeks is left outside
morrie lies in bed asleep
pk sits up at his desk writing
and again i was alone with nothing to depend on to see me through except the power of one
pk puts down his pen and sits regarding the pages
he raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a rock
pk smiles at hidden memories caps his fountain pen turns off the light
the room is pitched into darkness
the seedy side of town
pk carrying a gym bag and morrie looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come striding up the alley
look even if the scholarship doesnt come through my old man said hed lend you the money
well call it the levy carpet emporium scholarship for poor but proud christian gentlemen
tell your father i appreciate the offer
god i hate people who cant be bought
why is that
i dont know
pk nods in agreement
the boys come to their destination marked by a rickety faded sign goldmans gym
excitement shines in pks eyes
he bounds up the narrow flight of stairs
morrie and pk rush up the stairs stop at the landing and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym
they take a breath and enter
a down and dirty boxing gym humming with the rhythm of
sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood
fighters both black and white train with each other
morrie is amazed
how do they get away with this
but pk has his mind on other things
his eyes fix on an old man across the room standing by ringside
there he is
christ hes old
and hes the best
pk leads morrie across the gym
pk passes an african fighter
he stops training when he sees pk
he turns to another african fighter glancing at pk
one by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at pk
pk and morrie approach the rheumy old man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick polish jewish accent
god gave you two hands so you can knock a man out from either side
he moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate
solly turns to the boys
a look of bemusement comes over his face when he sees their blazers
you boys lost
im the one who called you yesterday
from the prince of wales school
oh yeah yeah
and who are you
the champeens manager
solly rolls his eyes to heaven
beat you know you train here its not like those nice school fights youre used to
three knockdowns you win
just then as if to underscore his point one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw
he hits the canvas inches from where they are standing
solly pk and morrie all look at him and then at each other
what does it cost for you to train him
for my personal attentinons mr
fifty pounds a month
for one of them
points to the other men working with fighters less
morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to solly
heres for six months in advance
three hundred pounds
solly pushes the money back
i dont know your boyll last six minutes
solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has stopped working and is staring at pk
what are you staring
punch dont stare
work or youre out
the blacks go back to work
that your gear
go change in the back
well see if you couldnt find a better use for all that money
thank you sir
pk heads towards the rear
solly turns to morrie
whys he want to do this a nice looking schoolboy
he wants to be welterweight champ of the world
solly breaks up laughing
oh sure sure
and id like to be twenty five again
you like to make book on it
joking you giving odds
you name them
solly gives him a long look
you both meshugah
solly walks away
pk is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well built opponent
morrie stands at ringside with solly
lets just start out nice and easy now
he hits the bell
the fighters circle
pks opponent starts punching jabbing probing
after two feints he comes after pk in earnest
pk steps left and peppers him with three quick blows to the face
sollys interest is suddenly piqued
again the fighters circle
again the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks
this time pk dodges hits him hard and spins him around hitting him twice more
a smile appears on sollys face
the opponent angered now gets more aggressive
pk keeps bobbing and weaving sticking and slipping punches
the opponent unloads banging away at pk with everything he has
pk backs up two steps then shifts positions
the opponents momentum carries him into the ropes
as he comes off the ropes pk throws him an eight punch combination demolishing his opponent
pk steps back
the opponent sags
solly hits the bell clearly excited
never i seen someone so young throw an eight punch combination
where did you learn such a thing
in prison sir
you trying to be a comedian and a boxer
manager come to my office
well talk terms
you get showered and see me after
well talk training
solly and morrie head off toward sollys office
pk watches them go a small victorious smile on his face
seven year old pk stands at the gate holding a bucket waiting to be let in
pk sits on a bench in the hall
black prisoners are marched by guarded closely
at pks feet is the metal bucket
the door to kommandant von zyls office opens
a guard summons pk
pk rises takes his bucket and enters the office
the kommandant a brusque man with a salt and pepper brush cut sits behind his big desk
so you are pk
i am kommandant von zyl
the professor has requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus
this is the first specimen
he alludes to the bucket
he holds the bucket up
a small cactus resting on some tobacco leaves
the professor taught you this ja
of course to your english town he is a prisoner a criminal
to us who respect such learning and culture he is an honored guest
he hands pk a pass
this pass is good for any time any day
would you like to see him now
i will take you myself
von zyl rises and opens the door for pk
pk and von zyl walk together
we have cleared a little plot behind the cellblock for the cactus
and tomorrow we have the professors piano moved here
there is not another instrument like it in the territory
maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us hey
just then the sound of grunting and thwacking fills the air
pk passes a room set up as a boxing gym
through a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached by some guards
some guards are also being coached by a second man
a third man lieutenant smit oversees the whole training session
pk watches mesmerized
you like to box
i would like to learn meneer
are the boys prisoners
laughs no no
the sons of the guards
see that one there
points to a
little pudge boy flailing away thats my son danie
its a club
smit comes over
we have room for one more on the squad
smit looks down at pk
hes a little small kommandant
well build him up then
but i really dont have anyone to spare to teach him right now
you know with the tournament coming up
there must be someone
smit looks around the hall
a crumpled old black man a lifer with broken bandied legs and a fighters flattened face wiping the floor picking up used towels
geel piet comes shuffling over properly submissive
you teach this boy basics and you teach him good or i knock your black head flat you hear
i teach him best i know baas
we train every day
first thing in the morning
miss two trainings youre gone
see this old kaffir
thank you meneer
lieutenant a word
the two men step off to the side
dont worry little baas
little can beat big any day
first with the head then with the heart
little defeat big when little is smart
you can remember that
dont never call me sir
specially in front of the guards
what should i call you
geel piet assumes his submissive posture again
he winks at pk and shuffles off
a bell sounds
a bell at the top of a strongmans game sounds
a big boer farmer mallet in hand roars in triumph swinging the mallet again and ringing the bell again
walking through the carnival munching popcorn
you took a big chance talking to my father the way you did
going in i was behind on points with him
i attend a politically suspect school
im a boxer
he likes boxers
all men like boxers
but not for their daughters
so i had to find some way to make an impression
they get on line for the ferris wheel
you could have picked a more agreeable topic
and made much less of an impression
talk to someone about their passion
even if they disagree theyll remember you
it was really the most logical strategy if you think about it
do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me too
know what i think
their turn comes to mount the ferris wheel
they get into the seat and strap in
when i was little we would go to my grandfathers farm in the high veldt for holiday
the ferris wheel starts to go up
my father would take me to the top of the highest hill and wed play this game what do you see until we ran out of things to see
do you ever play that
want to try
the ferris wheel stops to let more people on
johannesburg glitters beyond
i see a forest
it goes on forever
there are giant trees which keep getting bigger and bigger over thousands of years
the wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops
i see little trees growing on the forest floor learning to grow with the little bit of light the big trees let in
i see the big trees getting bigger their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of africa
the wheel stops again at its highest point
i see the sun growing weaker giving off less light
i see the big trees dying because they cannot live without a lot of light
i see the little trees take over the forest because they learn to adapt
you tell a very good story
her eyes sparkle making her irresistible
pk leans forward
maria turns her face towards him
her lips part slightly
they kiss tenderly
the camera rises from them to the star littered sky twinkling above
the sky goes from black to grey as the camera pans down
sing song cant hit you cant hurt you
cant hit you cant hurt you
cant hit you cant hurt you
geel piet is punching at pk slowly with a large pair of gloves
the seven year old bobs and weaves quite expertly
geel piet stops winded
you wear out this old man
see how it can work
how little beat big
but when do i get to punch
you not going to just punch man
you going to combination
pk does his best to mimic
oh do we have a boxer here
we build you to eight punch combination
the geel piet eight
then you catch afire
doc appears in the doorway
how is the next joe louis this morning
try and hit me
doc takes a half hearted swing
pk bobs expertly
doc sets up and swings left then right
pk avoids both swings
you are amazing
and im going to learn the geel piet eight
yes yes yes
but right now you have to come learn the beethoven fifth for one hour so we can get to the cactus before its too hot to plant
did you bring her
pk points to a nearby bucket
we make from you a champion and a brain
furtive excuse me big baas
but can i talk to the small baas
geel piet looks hesitantly from the man to the boy and then begins
every day i see you bring the bucket and in the bottom is some tobacco leaf
it keeps the roots wet
what happens to the leaf after
a little i use in some water to make a bug spray for the plants
and the rest we throw away
geel piet fidgets
he drops his head speaking low
if you leave the pail when you go plant is a problem small baas
i dont understand
is like this
you see how hard the life is for the people here in prison
only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night a little smoke
now with the big war in europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside
inside it is gone
we are the forgotten in here
we have bunches of leaves at home
ill bring a whole bucketful tomorrow
mustnt do that little baas
i dont understand
what geel piet means is it can be dangerous
something the guards might not want the people to have
whats wrong with tobacco
why wouldnt they want them to have it
whats wrong is people whose job it is to punish
after a little while it is all they know how to do
what should i do
this is for you to answer
the sound of a truncheon on metal turns them to the door where sergeant bormann a side of beef with a sadists eyes stands truncheon in hand
he enters the room and circles the trio
i smell something not right here ay kaffir
he pokes geel piet with his truncheon
submissive no meneer sergeant
everything okay here
bormann swings his truncheon into the back of geel piets knees buckling the little man to the floor
i dont fuckin believe you
he glares at doc and pk
if youre up to something ill find out
bormann still eying them suspiciously exits
doc and pk help geel piet up
this old kaffirs okay
sorry to make any trouble little baas
we just stick to the boxing now on
geel piet goes hobbling off picking up towels
doc and pk go to exit
at the door pk turns
geel piet turns
i leave my bucket on the side by docs toilet when i practice piano
geel piet breaks out a smile he usually keeps to himself and exits
pk looks up at doc who tossles his hair approvingly
pk to me you are the champion of the world already
let us go box now with mr
pk and doc exit
pk in the ring is about to start sparring
solly gives him instruction as morrie stands by
now at the end of the geel piet eight you do this
he punches the air one two three
the solly goldman thirteen
solly hits the bell
the sparring begins
pk works his way in
move him around
pk pours it on laying in the geel piet eight
solly is silently counting
one two three
pk fires the last three punches like lightning and backs up
now work around the defense
the opponent becomes aggressive
pk starts dancing slipping punches
how do you get away with this mr
why dont they close you down
i mean there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other
in a public match
not in a gym
not yet anyway
the boer is a funny people
outside the ring the black is not equal
inside he is
but only in private not in public
so i keep my mouth shut the police go a little blind and thats that
its a crazy world huh
a whistle from across the gym draws sollys attention
he and morrie turn to his office where his assistant stands with the tall black man from the schoolboy championships
sollys face takes on a serious ex pression
he rings the bell
he turns to morrie
work him on the heavy bag
solly heads for his office
turning away from his opponent
he and the tall black man trade a glance just before the man enters sollys
office and solly closes the door
pk pounds the heavy bag as morrie stands by
six seven eight nine ten
pk stops relaxing
morrie throws a towel over his shoulders
one of sollys assistants comes over
solly wants to see you two
pk and morrie look at each other and head for sollys office
solly faces the door as it opens
pk and morrie enter
you wanted to see us mr
close the door
beat someone i got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request
he wants to put you in a match
a young guy just turned pro
a black fighter
they want him to fight a black fighter
in a black township
out of the question
not even up for discussion
morrie goes to exit
who asked you to ask
the man who promotes all the fights in sofiatown elias nguni
and you trust him
in thirty years i know him number one on the list
youre both out of your minds
did he tell you why he wants the match
i told you what he told me
just talking boxing how do i match up with mandoma
i mean besides getting thrown out of school and into jail do you know what else happens you do this
hes a pro
the minute you fight him youre a pro
theres no purse being offered
thats a good career move
risk everything to gain nothing
very sound business sense
nguni ill think about it
pk exits with morrie steaming behind
they head for the locker room pk clearly perturbed
whats going on
i dont know
well why dont you tell me what you do know
theres an african myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors
they call it the myth of onoshobishobi ingelosi the tadpole angel
that chanting at the school championships
i havent heard it in years
pk begins to disrobe
and how did this honor fall on your broad back
i told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at barberton
well after that was going for a while i learned that even though they could send and receive letters they never did
they couldnt read or write
so you did it for them
and after that
a clothing program for their families and a food program
one thing sort of led to another
i can see where angel would be an appropriate title
beat but it was uh this geel piet who was really behind all of it wasnt it
he was very good at pointing things out
man like that should be running a country not rotting in prison
hes not in prison anymore
pause hes dead
pk steps into the shower pulling the curtain closed
pk and morrie exit the locker room
talking to solly
she sees pk and smiles
pk and morrie come up
i thought id surprise you
well you succeeded
goldman was explaining the theory behind the left hook
beats talking about the weather
you may have heard about me
how dyou do
sollys assistant whistles for him
well nice meeting you maria
nice meeting you mr
we never had a girl come to the gym
beat its not such a bad thing huh
solly moves off
you got a pass to come out on a weeknight
maria lifts her jumper a bit displaying the results of treeclimbing on her knees
your tree pass
pk moves maria and morrie off down the stairs
do you box too morrie
do i look that daft
morries the brains of the operation
he means the bank
your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance
they exit the staircase
in the shadow of the alley stands smoking a cigarette
in zulu i see you nguni
i see you p
they talk across the narrow street
you have heard my request
why do you make it
a woman has thrown the sacred ox bones
she has made a fire and read the smoke
what did she read
that the onoshobishobi ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief
but its not true that im a chief
who knows what is true and what is not
the legend of onoshobishobi ingelosi is very powerful among the people
they see you box the boer and always you win
they have heard the stories from barberton
the people live with little hope
they must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man
and if i lose
if the spirit of the onoshobishobi ingelosi does not exist in me anymore then what will they live with
but still they must
it is our way
at that moment a spotlight blinds them
a police car comes up the alley stopping in front of them
the police exit threatening
whats this here
maria is gripped by fear
morrie is cautious unmoving
an old family servant officer
we just ran into each other
come on be quick
nguni reaches into his pocket
where you coming from
i train there
im his manager
the police look at each other and share a laugh
to maria and youre the sparring partner hey
the police laugh
police satisfied ngunis papers are in order hands them back
you have an hour to curfew and a long way to go kaffir
subservient yes baas
going right now
nguni moves off no semblance of the proud man in his gait
ill do it
nguni smiles and disappears into the night
pk watches him go
pk and maria stand by the tree set to climb over the wall
im scared for you pk
sollys a great teacher
he wouldnt put me in a fight i couldnt handle
i mean about how involved you are with the black people
that scares me
because you dont understand them
no i dont
if you did you wouldnt be so scared
you ever have a conversation with a black person
besides a servant
marias silence is her answer
you should sometime
i hate it when you tease me
he kisses her
pouty no youre not
yes i am
he kisses her again
this time she responds kissing him back
the kisses become more passionate touching feel ing
the heat in both of them begins to rise when a car passes its headlights arcing across the tree startling them out of their passion
they cling to the shadows until the car turns the corner
i better go
they kiss once lightly
pk boosts her over the wall and waits until she is safely on the other side before run ning off into the night
the oxford board of examiners eminent academics all sit four across at a lecture table looking absolutely musty with learning
across from them pk sits a folder in his lap
one man professor lewis peruses the file in front of him
according to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world
lewis reads the last sentence with a tinge of amusement in his voice
dont you find seeking a career as a pugilist and reading for a degree at oxford a bit how shall we put it intellectually
lord byron was a boxer sir
and ive never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity
one of the other examiners coughs theatrically to hide his smile
lewis looks down the table at the man
i do not recall lord byron actually engaging in matches for money
actually sir there are several recorded instances of lord byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money
in a letter to his wife shelley makes mention of just such a thing
for hundreds of pounds actually
lewis has heard enough
lets move along shall we
as your presentational youve requested to read from a work of your own fiction
well then let us hope well be treated to the stirrings of another byron
his sarcasm is not lost on pk
pk ignores it opens his folder and begins to read
the concerto for the southland and the death of geel piet
pause his name was geel piet yellow peter
he was a mix of half the blood in africa dutch portuguese zulu sotha and who knew what else
deserted his mother before he was born
his stepfather threw him out to survive on the streets of capetown when he was nine
geel piet is instructing a nine year old pk in the geel piet eight
both boy and man are enjoying what they do and each other
when i met him he had spent forty of his fifty five years in one south african prison or another
he was a thief a con man a black marketeer
as the narration continues the scene fades to with a much better grasp of the geel piet eight
he and geel piet seem closer than ever
he may even have killed a man or two in his time
but despite all that he was one of the kindest wisest most self effacing persons i ever knew
he was my teacher he was my friend
pk sits opposite a black prisoner who talks to him
pk thirteen years old now writes what the man says on a piece of paper
when he is finished he folds it puts it into an envelope and hand it to the man
the man smiles shakes pks hand profusely and exits
pk turns to geel piet who is on his hands and knees polishing the floor seemingly part of the surroundings
geel piet and pk share a smile
geel piet bore no animosity held no hate
should a guard beat him he regarded it as self inflicted
the result of some carelessness on his part
to survive the system he lived in he became an expert in the art of camouflage a master of the invisible
in this he strove to be perfect and in the end it was his quest for perfection that provoked anger from above and killed him
quite advanced after five years of planting
pk and geel piet are bent over a cactus transplanting it
a group of prisoners on the way to a hard labor work task march by
they chant a verse to onoshobishobi ingelosi
pk is a little embarrassed by it
you know every time they do that i want to jump up and say im just a twelve year old
im not anything else
to them you are
you are the one who brings the smoke the one who writes the letters the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold
you are onoshobishobi ingelosi
but you know thats not true
who is to say what is true and what is not true kleine baas
doc comes running up excited waving a newspaper
the allied armies have crossed the rhine into germany
it is almost over
thats great isnt it
he turns to geel piet
subdued yes kleine baas
you are a good faker geel piet
but you dont think its great at all
it means you lose your star letter writer and tobacco importer
no matter that professor
we always manage here
what pains me most is i lose my boxer
ill come back
adamant no kleine baas
you leave this damn place you dont come back never
geel piet when a painter finishes a work of art he doesnt lose it
he sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation
this is what you are going to do
and to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here i have composed an entire concerto the concerto for the southland which
it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners before i leave
the kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing
hell think its a concert for him and the brass
but well know ay
and the people will know
hell never let black be with white here doc
if the black is part of the
orchestra like the piano he will
but the people have no instruments in this place big baas
they have their voices
each tribe a different voice a different language all singing together
it is brilliant no
except the tribes dont trust each other
they dont even talk to each other
this is correct
this stupid hatred
they will do it for you kleine baas
you are onoshobishobi ingelosi
you bring the tobacco
you write the letters
you put clothes on their childrens bodies and food in their bellies
all you do is ask and they all sing for you
you are the smartest of us all
geel piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit
a truncheon stops him
all turn to sergeant bormann
a kaffir smarter than all of us
you are a strange german professor
that little maniac with the moustache in berlin you admire
he is the strange german
and soon kaput i hope
if thats true youll not be long for this place eh professor
and you too little rooinek
but you kaffir hitler comes or goes
he takes geel piets hand
you are going to stay with me
he forces geel piets hand closer and closer to a cactus with long thorns
and i will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone
he pushes geel piets hands onto the cactus needle
geel piet does not cry out
i have you
he lets go of geel piets hand
geel piet removes it from the cactus bloodied
get out of here
geel piet takes his watering can and goes
you see professor they are not like us
a white man would scream bloody murder
doc and pk glare at bormann
he smirks and walks away
as the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer my life was a whirlwind
pk and geel piet appear before various tribal leaders talking agreeing shaking hands
having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups we set about instructing them
four men from each tribe were taught the
intricacies of their groups parts
they were the choral leaders responsible for teaching the others
pk and doc instruct
doc plays the piano
pk leads the singers
geel piet turns the pages for doc
at night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing
nervous guards patrol as the sounds of the prisoners singing wafts through the air
geel piet instructs pk
my boxing instruction accelerated as well
it was as if geel piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge he had before we parted
and always from the corners and shadows bormann watched and waited
bormann watches pk and geel piet from the door of his room his truncheon beating idly against his leg
a photographer sets up a group picture of the boxing squad kids and guards
geel piet stands off to one side out of frame
our boxing squad the barberton blues won the state championship with a perfect record
i won at lbs
it was my first championship
it made me want
the group disperses
pk beckons the photographer to wait
he grabs geel piet and forces him to stand much to the little mans protestations for a photo of the two of them
as the picture is taken geel piet has the widest smile imaginable
the guards all in crisp uniforms patrol nervously truncheons at the ready
the towers bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard
finally the night of the concert arrived
the prison atmosphere normally tense was keening
each prisoner entering the yard is searched
it was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling
divide and conquer
the policy of control
this was to be the first time in the history of the south african prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle
and if trouble came it would be the last
all the prisoners are seated on the ground behind doc who is raised with the piano on a small stage
guards surround the prisoners a solid edgy border encasing a black center
the front of the yard is filled with seats on which sit the kommandant his wife assorted prison brass politicians and a smattering of the local afrikaan hierarchy
pk is overseeing the seating of the prisoners when doc comes up to him
have you seen my page turner
he asks a prisoner in zulu
have you seen geel piet
the man shakes his head
pk looks worried
reassuring he will come
the kommandant all medals and polished leather mounts the stage signaling a beginning to the festivities
where is bormann
i need bormann to translate to the prisoners
i dont know kommandant
is there a problem here kommandant
i want to address these filthy kaffirs but i dont have a translator
you can speak zulu pk
he addresses the prisoners
tell them this concert is the gift to them from the professor who even though he is in prison is not a dirty criminal like them but a man of
culture and learning
subtitled the kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing
for such a man i am happy to do this
but one hair of trouble and its finish
subtitled he hopes each tribe will sing its best and bring honor to its people
one wrong move and you get marched back to your cells and dont come out for a month
subtitled he says tonight let us be one people under the african sky
the prisoners break into spontaneous applause
von zyl looks at pk unsuspecting pleased
you did a good job
thank you sir
he turns the stage over to the professor and takes his seat
the professor sits at his stool poised
pk in front of the singers watches him for a cue
doc drops his head
pk points to a group of singers
music and voice blend spontaneously
the concerto for the great southland begins
doc plays magnificently with great style
pk focuses on leading the singers
each section each tribe singing its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on rhythm pace and tone
leading the singers in and out of the music
being raised and lowered on a familiar back
pk is caught short by the flash
he falters a bit then regains his concentration
coming down on a familiar head geel peits
instinctively the first four prisoners in each group the leaders stand and turn to face their people
they take up the lead
pk distracted by his inner vision runs off stage
doc looks after him worried but keeps playing
pk runs through the empty cell blocks looking for some one
pk runs through the corridors
he runs through the kitchens the empty dining area the sound of the concert chasing after him
he runs through the recreation area and past the boxing room when he hears a thud and another
he bolts into the room and hits the light switch
the light over the ring comes on illuminating bormann truncheon raised over the lifeless broken body of geel piet
startled bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off
pk scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless blood ied head in his lap and begins to sob
pan down along geel piets arm to his bloodied hand holding the snapshot of him and pk
the concerto grows louder around pk until it enfolds him in its melodies
the voices of africa the music of europe reaching for a musical and spiritual crescendo
geel piet died of massive internal hemorrhage the result of bormanns ramming a truncheon up into the little mans body until his entrails spilled out
when i reached him he was already dead
i sat there crying stroking his head and crying with african
voices rising to heaven above even as her blood soaked the ground below
the music swells until the voices meld as one
the four examiners all sit enthralled by the story
when pk looks up a tear runs down his cheek
lewis who is visibly moved clears his throat
another man blows his nose with a handkerchief covering his emotions
thank you very much
you will be notified as to the universitys decision by mail
pk rises and goes to exit
point of curiousity
your headmaster told me your work is somewhat autobiographical
this bormann he was real
was justice ever served
sergeant bormann died of cancer
pause of the rectum
pk turns and exits
solly goldman sits behind the wheel of his old car
two figures sneak out of the school and come running toward the car
solly starts the engine as pk and morrie hop in
we have to make a stop first
the night wont last forever boychick
itll only take a minute
solly puts the car in gear and drives off
maria is sleeping when a hand goes over her mouth
she awakes startled to pk finger to lips
a police car patrols the edge of the vast dark ram shackle township its cruiser light scanning the openings to the dark rutted alleys
it passes and disappears down the road
a moment later an african steps out of the shadows and whistles a signal
in the shadows nguni hears the whistle
he looks at his watch and up the road tense as another set of head lights appears
nguni steps back into the shadows
solly strains to see out his dirty windshield with the headlights as his car bumps along the unpaved road
the night i escaped from the tsars army it was just like this
six of us four jews two ukranians
dark as anything
in the day we hid in bushes
at night we went
whey they come take you at thirteen years old and tell you its twenty five years in the army its your duty to desert
nguni steps out right into the path of the headlights
solly hits the brake hard throwing everyone forward
you said the end of the road
he opens sollys door with some urgency
nguni sees maria
smiling welcome miss welcome
nguni turns into the township and is swallowed by the dark
the car bounces along the rutted darkened streets of the township
the glow of smoldering cooking fires through open doorways offers minimal illumination to the squalid lives within
maria peers out at a world she has never seen
as the car drives women and children gather along the road peering in
mothers point to pk instructing their children
the people have come from everywhere to see you
maria takes pks hand a little nervous
pk smiles at her confidently
where are the men
they are to be witness
the muffled sounds of voices singing reaches them grow ing louder as they approach
maria is tense
nguni senses this
he turns to her
no worry miss
it is the sound of happiness
he stops the car at a door in a high wooden wall guarded by two big men
we are here
everyone gets out of the car and passes through the door which shuts behind them
nguni leads everyone down the hallway
pk is dressed to fight hands taped robe thrown over his shoulders
i dont see why we have to weigh in
theyre going to fight anyway
it is very important the people see everything is correct
they come to an arch which leads into a big empty room
in the center of the room stands a scale and a dozen africans all dressed in worn but neatly pressed suits
mandoma the other man who attended pks fight at school clad only in boxing gear waits on pk
in zulu i see you gideon mandoma
i see you pk
i just want you to know you fight a man
onoshobishobi ingelosi is just a name i was given at barberton prison
it means nothing
it is not for you or me to say what it means
an old man one of the dignitaries says something to nguni
he motions for pk to step on the scale
the weight is duly noted
mandoma then does the same
the twelve men are satisfied
they head for the exit
it is time
he motions for the others to follow
pk goes to walk with maria
nguni pairs him with mandoma
they exit the room
the party walks towards a big double door behind which a single voice preaching can be vaguely heard
nguni knocks on the door
the doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with humanity
a boxing ring is raised in the center
the only lights in the area directly over it
with the twelve witnesses in the lead the party makes its way through a path in the crowd
an old woman with a fly switch not unlike inkosikazis speaks from the ring
as pk passes the whispers start
the woman in the ring begins to chant
the crowd picks it up
shobi shobi ingelosi
pk looks back at maria who is a bit unnerved as are morrie and solly
he looks across at mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead betraying nothing
the two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners
the old woman shuffles over and peers into pks face
she mutters something inaudible then turns to the crowd
the crowd picks up the chant
she waves and the crowd goes silent
somewhere in the darkness a single voice begins to sing nkosi sikelel i afrika the african national anthem
the crowd picks it up
pk looks down to the front row where nguni sits courteously attending to maria in a seat of honor among the twelve men in suits
the african national anthem finishes
the bell rings three times
the old woman is led from the ring
an indian referee in all white enters the ring and waves the two fighters forward
you are listening to me please
when i am shouting break you must break at once
when a knockdown is coming it is for an eight count
no heads no elbows
you fight clean or by golly i am giving you penalty points
good luck boys
pk and mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective corners
what do you see
solly watches mandoma dancing across the ring
a very tough fight
the bell rings
watch the left hook
mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire everything in his arsenal at pk overwhelming him
pk cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat ing combinations which end in a left hook to pks jaw
pk drops like lead
the referee starts counting
pk shakes his head clear and rises at eight
the referee checks his gloves
there is a cut under his right eye
again mandoma comes charging hard
pk defends himself as best he can trying to counter
but mandomas offense wont allow it
he beats on pk until the round ends
pk sits down in his corner
morrie works on his eye
god he hits like a truck
hes going for the quick knockout
he cant keep it up
soon the truck runs out of gas
if he catches me again like that ill run out of gas permanently
the bell sounds
pk is hardly off his stool when mandoma is on him pummeling him
pk backpedals bobs and weaves
mandomas punches come fast and furious each one looking to end the fight
mandoma gets pk against the ropes and bangs away
pk covers up
mandoma punishes his arms and kidneys
pk swings back and es capes
mandoma pursues him
he catches pk with a body chop and then a chopping left
pk goes down again
the referee starts to count
the crowd is completely silent
the bell rings
pk returns to his corner shaking his head trying to clear it
he flops onto his stool
hes had it
hes got no strength in his punch
couldve fooled me
im telling you
look hes taking water
they all look
of mandoma breathing heavily sweating profusely drinks deeply from his water flask
where that water goes you go
right to here
he pokes pks belly
you put your punches there you win
you dont you lose
the bell rings
mandoma comes charging out
pk goes on defense
he hits mandoma hard to the head
mandoma whips around and hits him hard
pk spins and hits the canvas
his vision blurs doubles
the sound of a waterfall fills his head
struggling to climb the rocks in the pool below the waterfall
he is halfway across this time
struggles to mount the fifth rock
he clings to it wet exhausted as the water pummels him
the crowd goes wild
the referee holds up six fingers
how many fingers
where are you
in a fight behind on points
mandoma rushes in for the kill
pk feints and comes up under one of mandomas punches burying a body shot into his gut
mandoma grunts and backs up
pk pursues him
mandoma tries to recover
he throws another big punch
pk ducks under it and puts two more hooks into mandomas stomach
mandoma starts to back up for the first time in the fight
pk boxes jabbing feinting pushing man doma around the ring taking control
mandoma heading for exhaustion throws another big punch in desperation
pk hits him with three punches in return
mandoma swings again with a last desperate effort and pk buries the solly goldman thirteen into every part of his body
pk steps back and with his last punch puts mandoma down
the crowd goes silent
the referee counts mandoma out
he raises pks hand
still the crowd is silent
were in the shit now
nice knowing you solly
he and solly look around at the somber black faces flick ering in the shadows of the ring light
pk looks down at mandoma in silence
mandoma rises unsteadily
he stands in front of pk staring into his eyes and then he raises pks arm above his head
the crowd goes wild chanting singing over and over as pk and mandoma stand in center ring arms raised
pk stands with maria by the tree they use to climb over the wall
in the b
solly and morrie wait in the car
the seniors dance is two saturdays from now
i would like it if you could escort me
maria marais with a rooinek at the senior dance
what will people think
theyll think what they think and ill think what i think
and what is that
maria touches his face
her eyes soften
i think i love you
pk swallows hard
they kiss and embrace
pk caresses her face
i would be honored to be your escort
i didnt doubt it for a minute
solly honks the horn
pk kisses maria once more
ill give you a boost
pk stirrups his hands
maria boosts up to the first branch of the tree
she crests the wall
thank you for tonight
you were great
she smiles and drops down behind the wall
pk runs back
toward the car
sollys car pulls up opposite the gate
morrie is sleeping in the back seat
solly and pk are sitting in the front
when you and your manager first came to me with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you did not have a big believer here
but i gotta tell you
now you do
in london lives benny rosen the greatest trainer in the world today
when you go to your oxford i give you a letter to rosen
whatever i cant do for you he can
solly pokes morrie awake
and i give the address of a very good bookmaker
teach you also a thing or two
now go on back to being fancy schmancy english gentlemen
im proud of both of you
pk and morrie exit the car and run back to the school
as pk and morrie jog toward their dorm a voice stops them from behind
pk and morrie stop cold
they turn to st
john up early
for his daily constitutional
youre up early sir
best time for walking
best time for running too sir
have to put in the roadwork sir
you know keep those legs strong
john eyes the bruise on pks cheek
quite a fresh bruise there
maybe you should change your footwear
he looks down at their shoes
both boys are wearing pro per shoes not at all what would be worn for roadwork
to something a little more appropriate for
busted the boys squirm uncomfortably
john fixes them with a look and then walks off
the boys bolt into the dorm
pk and morrie open the door and stop cold
gideon mandoma sits in a chair facing the door
please excuse me for coming like a thief by the window
you speak english
pk is surprised
you are a great fighter gideon
second greatest in this room
but you didnt come to talk about fighting
mandoma shakes his head
he waits for a moment then begins
when you say to me onoshobishobi ingelosi means nothing you are right
and you are wrong
the legend gives the people hope for a good tomorrow
but hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people
you cannot write our letters get us clothes food work
these things we must do ourselves so we can be part of this countrys good tomorrow
if we are not the hope will disappear
the people will grow tired
the tired will grow angry and there will be no good tomorrow for anybody black or white
what are you asking from me
to be part of something you must know what everyone else knows
we have our own knowledge
we need yours
we get our knowledge in schools gideon
were not born with it
then it must be the same with us
you have schools
and teachers who cannot do more than their own abcs
we have a system made not to teach us
anxious i am only seventeen years old gideon
i cannot teach five million people how to speak english and do sums
you taught the singing to thousands at barberton prison
you were only twelve
you are a great fighter pk
second greatest in this room gideon
mandoma exits through the window
pk stands in front of a pondering st
you are asking me for a lot young man
im only asking you to put what youve taught us into practice sir
you are asking me to put the reputation of this school in jeopardy
the reputation of this school sir is based on its integrity
im aware of that
im also aware of what will happen if this ever gets out
we live in a country where the rules are being rewritten
then wed better be careful to keep a firm hand on our pens
john regards pk
i will allow it on a trial basis
here are my conditions you tell no one you operate at night on saturdays when the student body is gone you involve no one besides yourself and mr
if you can comply you can have your school
maria and pk are about to race
maria is given a head start of ten yards
they both take off
maria runs as hard as she can
pk catches up to her
she strains with the effort
pk crosses the finish line first
maria trips and falls rolling in the sand
pk comes back to her
he kneels down
youre supposed to let me win
then youd say i was being condescending
you were guilty of that when you gave me a head start
she kisses him and stands up
they begin to walk along the beach
get your formal yet
pk grows uncomfortable
the dance is only a week away
beat i cant come to the dance
shocked why not
i have an obligation
cant you change it
its a permanent obligation
every saturday night
beat it starts tonight
maria cannot believe what she is hearing
youre breaking up with me
then what could be so important that it takes all your saturday nights
i really cant say
maria starts to cry
she throws her arm around him
i love you
please dont go away
im not going away
yes you are
i can feel it
im just tutoring
maria pulls back
i started a school
beat for gideon mandoma and some others in the seniors library
marias sadness turns to anger
im losing you to a bunch of kaffirs
youre not losing anything
are you escorting me to the dance
are you going to see me on the only free night they give us
maria this is important to me
and my lifes important to me
she runs off in tears
a pained pk doesnt attempt to go after her
on an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest cover pk and doc move along the sheer cliff face with photographic equipment and rucksacks
pk notices docs labored breathing and slow movements
they reach some small cacti growing out of the side of
the cliff in full bloom
breathing hard ach
you see how beautiful
you ever hear of glycerine doc
going to oxford smarty pants
of course i know about glycerine
what do you want to know
why you dont use it
its only a little pill under the tongue
tongues were not made to put little pills under
when i have to start with that i become something else
well until you become something else the little pills would make this easier on your heart
a clap of thunder cuts into their conversation
thick roiling rain clouds appear suddenly
little pills or no little pills we dont find cover we both turn into something else
lightning splits the sky
rain begins to fall pelting the escarpment
look for a cave
always in this kind of rock there is caves
pk starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like a spider on a wall
the rain becomes torrential
pk turns to look back at doc
dont look at me
pk forges ahead
some yards ahead
ive found something
the rain is so heavy pk can barely make out doc behind him
when he can he sees the old man pause breathing hard
pk makes his way back to doc
halfway there doc waves him forward and starts to move
pk reaches the small opening and slips in
pk stoops in the small cave dripping wet
a moment later docs foot appears at the entrance
pk helps him in
doc slumps down exhausted
breathing too hard to reply doc shakes his head in the affirmative
pk looks out at the rain forming a sheer wall of water outside
he turns to doc who is getting up flashlight in hand
what are you doing
why dont you just rest
plenty time for resting when i am something else
he strikes a match
a wind from inside the cave blows it side to side
when does a cave have wind
is more than some little cave my friend
doc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening
he shines the light into it
there is a passage
before pk can say anything else doc has wriggled through the small opening
pk a bit peeved takes his own flashlight and follows
pk crawls after doc making his way through the small tunnel on his stomach
you know the pyramids are nothing more than mans attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had the cave
it is the ultimate safe resting place
the first place man could lay down and have a good nights sleep without worrying about waking up as somethings supper
doc stops crawling
so does pk
a dripping can be heard
you hear that
there is something waiting for us
doc starts moving quicker
lets hope its not hungry
doc squeezes out of the small space
pk joins him in a slightly larger tunnel the same size as the first one stoop height
whats that smell
all of a sudden there is a rustling noise
doc recognizes the sound
he pounces on pk knocking him to the floor and covering him with his body
not a moment too soon
for a thousand bats fill the tunnel flying through
flying wildly through the flashlight beams
in a blur the bats are gone disappeared into another tunnel entrance to the left
doc an pk rise slowly
the silence of the cave is punctuated by the dripping
maybe its stopped raining
who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave
you dont know that
the bats didnt come from a shoebox mr
know it all
doc heads off
sometimes i think maybe sending you off to that fancy shmancy school was not such a good idea
it was your idea
youre the one who pushed for me to go
but who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of
which part is that
the one where is all the questions
the curiosity center
ahead in the tunnel is a luminous glow filling an entrance
did i tell you
doc and pk hurry on
as they come to a tunnel opening a large cave perhaps feet wide by feet high filled with stalactites and stalagmites composed of pure crystallized calcium carbonate
the whole chamber glistens with an eerie phosphorescence
toward one end of the crystallized room eight stalagmites grown up from the floor cement to form a huge crystal slab some ten feet off the floor
a buttress of stalg mites drip off it forming a natural if uneven stairway
doc and pk stare at the crystal cave in amazement
how many hundreds of thousands of years to make this masterpiece
everything outside can change p
this remains the same
we are in the heart of africa p
the heart of africa
doc in his own world of wonderment wanders down into the cave among the stalactites
pk follows soon losing sight of doc behind the large crystal columns
you know if a person stayed here for years what would be
like a crystal mummy
to himself incredible
docs preoccupation with death irks him
he studies a piece of crystal
i wish we had brought the camera
think theres enough light to shoot
doc does not answer
his concern rises
he moves through the maze of crystal his pace quickening
still no answer
his vision obscured pk reaches the elevated slab
he clambers up the buttress for a better view
when he reaches the top he stops cold
lying on the crystal slab eyes closed hands folded on his chest
this is not funny
doc opens his eyes
this is incredible
you can feel the life go right through you
come try it
thats all right
can we go
we have only just gotten here
whats the matter p
all day long youve been talking about becoming something else about dying
you never talked about dying before
im next month
not to a sixteen year old its not
doc realizes what pk is saying
you are right
i am sorry
sixteen year old ears should only hear life
doc starts to whistle the marriage of figaro by mozart
the resonance of the whistling off the crystal sounds beautiful exotic
doc beckons pk to join in with him
pk does so hesitantly
then pleased with the sound and the feeling more fully
doc and pk exit through the stalactites whistling
pk and a very exhausted doc enter
doc sits down heavily on the bed while pk shrugging off his rucksack heads right for the small kitchen area
ill just set you up with some coffee here so in the morning you wont have to bother making it
he begins to prepare the coffee
i didnt mean to tell you what
you can and cant talk about back in the cave today
i guess i just dont like to think of you being
beat something else
i know its natural law and its the way it is with everybody
beat i just wish it werent with you
there is no reply
pk turns to doc dead asleep still sitting up
pk goes over and gently lays the old man down
he removes his boots and throws a blanket over him
pk blows out the kerosene lamp and goes to exit
he is about to hang their two rucksacks on two hooks by the door when docs voice turns him
im here doc
the crystal cave will be our secret ja
whatever you say
i rest a little
beat the heart of africa p
doc lays down
he is asleep when his head hits the pillow
pk watches docs chest washed in moonlight rise and fall lightly
a sudden sadness falls over him
the corners of his mouth turn up in a bittersweet smile
he finishes hanging the rucksack and exits
pk and morrie stick close in the shadows
pk looks at his watch and then twenty feet away to the locked gate
if someone would have told me this is where id be on a saturday night last term of my senior year id call them batty
beat you know youre going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one
i figured youd hold me to it longer
you get the insider friends rate
a black groundskeeper comes walking along seemingly on his duties
pk pokes morrie
walks up to the gate
he looks left and right then quickly unlocks it
he walks away
pk and morrie advance
pk opens the gate
as he does
gideon mandoma followed by men and women enters
i see you p
i see you gideon
lets get inside before the whole bloody world sees us
he clasps morries hand first in a traditional hand shake then in an african handshake
you some great friend
morrie is taken by his sincerity
stay to the fence
the group moves out
the africans are seated around desks waiting for morrie and pk to tell them what to do
all right class
i know you dont understand a word im saying but part of learning a language is hearing it spoken
so i am p
he taps his chest
taps morrie is morrie
now you all have a chalkboard
he holds up the chalkboard
chalk and an eraser
i will say
you will say the letter
i will write the letter
you will write the letter
morrie will check the letter
here we go
in zulu say it
the door to the library suddenly opens
maria enters the room
pk is stunned
pk hurries over to maria
not a word needs to be spoken
her presence says everything
i thought you might need some help
or i can just sit and watch
pk hands her the chalk
this is maria
she is now the teacher
to maria were doing alphabet from the letter a
pk takes up his position with morrie ready to check the chalkboards
maria takes the front of the class
before her watching intensely
she battles the butterflies in her stomach as she writes an a on the blackboard
she clears her throat
no one says anything
maria looks a little lost
in zulu repeat what she says
to maria say it again
she writes it on the blackboard again
pk and morrie trade a look and a smile
she mimes to the chalkboards
all the africans obey
pk looks up from checking the students
marias eyes are twinkling
the africans are exiting
maria morrie and pk stand receiving their heartfelt thanks one by one
mandoma is the last to leave
to maria you are one brave boer miss maria
and you are one lucky english
he kids pk
good night gideon
he playfully pushes gideon out the gate and closes it
he turns to maria and morrie
well i think ill go
lay on my back and count the cracks in the ceiling
nice to see you maria
good night morrie
morrie runs off
pk takes maria around
i am one lucky english
they embrace and kiss
can i ask you a favor
we dont have to go in or anything
you can hear the music from outside
id love to have one dance with you before i graduate
i feel so good
race you to the gate
you need a headstart
she takes off
they disappear into the night
in the shadows watching them run off
pk is working on a speed bag
morrie comes running in with two open letters in hand
we made it
we made it
he thrusts one of the letters at pk
i couldnt bear the suspense after i read mine
i had to open it
pk looks at his letter
three months and were out of here
youre out of here
what the hell are you talking about
he snatches pks letter
reading dear sir
it is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to matriculate at trinity college oxford etc
it says nothing about the scholarship
another boy comes over
john wants to see you two in his study
good news travels fast
ill get showered and changed
he said to come as you are
the boy runs off leaving pk and morrie wondering
pk and morrie enter to a somber st
wanted to see us sir
close the door
as the door closes brigadier johannes bretyn a quiet but formidable man comes into their line of vision
trouble is in the air
this is brigadier bretyn from the police department
bretyn just nods his head
he has come to deliver in person an order to close the saturday school
because it is illegal
were only teaching them how to read and do sums
you dont have certification to do that
prince of wales is a certified school
but not certified for that
sort of thing
can he do this sir
of course i can do it
would i be here if i couldnt
come now meneer headmaster
lets end this now
i have a full day ahead of me still
john meets bretyns steely eyes
he cannot hold the mans gaze
resigned the saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice
thank you meneer headmaster
your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated
bretyn goes to exit
you know it cant go on like this forever
what youre doing
im just doing my job
and if youll take some advice you should just do yours
is that really the end of it sir
for the moment im afraid it is
if we let them get away with it on our own grounds it will never
itll just get worse
history disputes you
history takes too long
yes it does
but it is never kind to those who try to hurry it
i feel we should resist sir
so do i p
but this is not a subtle government
they mean to have their way and damn the consequences
and i cannot jeopardize this school no matter how i personally feel
beat i heard you were accepted at oxford
received notification today
thank you sir
john looks at pk who remains silent
to both of you
tight thank you sir
an uncomfortable silence lingers
well talk before you go
will that be all
thatll be all
pk turns immediately and exits
morrie and st
john trade an uncomfortable look
pk walks down the hall anger building in his face
he exits the hall
pk comes up to the main gate
a guard stops him
id like to see maria marais please
the guard checks his list
shes not allowed visitors
well if i could just talk to her
pk backs away and moves off down the street
he turns the corner
he uses to scale the wall is in the process of being cut down
morrie is asleep
pk wakes him
i want to show you something
what time is it
he looks at his watch and turns over
can i see it later
he pulls morrie out of bed
morrie groggily starts pulling his clothes on
you know when we get to oxford separate rooms
will you hurry
is there some girl out there waiting for me
breasts like casabas
just waiting for you
pk throws a jersey into his chest and pulls him out of the room
the campus is swaddled in early morning fog
pk and morrie stand on the side of the school chapel while a black groundsman opens the door to the basement
what do you think
i think youre fooling yourself into thinking the bastards wont
come after us in here
the groundskeeper opens the door to the basement
the boys enter
pk switches on a light switch to a cavernous space cluttered with old desks blackboards and church pews
this is a church
didnt you ever hear of the christian concept of sanctuary
but im not the one who has to respect it
even the boer has limits morrie
im sure he does but id still like to see a big bolt on the inside door
the caretaker pulls a large deadbolt out of his pocket with a smile
mandoma and pk both with protective equipment on square off
now move it nice and easy the both of you
pk and mandoma circle
mandoma throws a jab
they want us to close the school
mandoma lays in a combination
we are still game
pk throws a combination
so are we
would you two find some other time to chat
this is a boxing ring not a social club
mandoma and pk start boxing in earnest both smiling
a watchman makes his rounds
he passes by marias window
when he is gone pk appears from behind a tree
he taps on the window
maria comes to the window and sees him
her face lights up
she opens the window
cool i was in the neighborhood
maria puts her finger to her lips and waves him in
pk climbs through the window
maria points to the door
she puts a record on her phonograph
she turns to pk and embraces him fiercely holding on tight
whispering theyre sending me away to school in pretoria
i told my father i wouldnt go
he said if i didnt hed see they arrest you and ruin your chances
i couldnt let him do that
as he holds maria
when do you go
beat i want to make love to you p
pks eyes fill with her words
she releases him
they look at each other
pk leans forward and kisses her awkward as if for the first time
as their lips part their breath shortens
maria moves forward slowly lifting pks hand to her breast
he touches it
the heat builds
passion overwhelms them
they begin to make love
maria sleeps peacefully in pks arms on her small bed
pk lies awake staring at the ceiling
he rises quietly so as not to wake her
he pulls on his clothes gently brushes a wisp of hair away from her eyes kisses her forehead and exits through the window into the breaking dawn
pk and morrie stand by a side gate near the athletic field looking alertly about
the gate opens
the africans led by mandoma come through
pk and morrie greet them
when they are all through morrie closes the gate and runs after them
a man with a walkie talkie sits in the shadows watching people run across the athletic field
he talks into his walkie talkie
the light switch is on
the four lights above the center of the room illuminate a classroom area desks set up in neat rows with stools a blackboard
the other furniture has been piled high against the walls on either side of the room where the light does not reach
if youll all be seated we can begin
the africans head toward their desks
pk turns to morrie
so far so good
morries response is to throw the new deadbolt into its slot with a skeptical eye
pk takes his place at the head of the class
i want to thank you all for having the courage to come tonight
in zulu thank you
in zulu youre welcome
i will be teaching the first part of class tonight and mr
levy will teach the second
a woman whispers something to mandoma
mandoma raises his hand
will she not be coming
this causes a flurry among the women
pk writes on the blackboard the word see
he says the word in zulu
he moves his hands eliciting response
pk holds up a book with a picture of a boy
i see the boy
i see the boy
pk holds up another picture
i see the girl
i see the girl
there is a knock on the door
morrie pulls the bolt opening and shutting the door quickly
pk and maria look at each other
i wanted to say goodbye to my students
beat and to you
the four women in the class speak in unison
we see the girl
maria smiles surprised
the moment is shortlived as a sound from behind the pews in the rear of the room turns everyone
in the shadows risen from behind the piles of furniture against the two opposite walls stand policemen with long menacing riot sticks
bretyn steps into the light
mandoma gives a command and the africans form a phalanx around the women
youre violating the sanctity of the church
you are with your damned race mixing ideas rooinek
by the door slowly slipping the bolt lock trying to remain innocuous while doing so
pk sees him and trades a look with mandoma who also sees what morrie is doing
at least let the women go
you want everything to be equal little boetie
why not men and women too
just then morrie throws the bolt
he goes to charge out the door but to his chagrin the door does not open locked from the outside
bretyn smiles cruelly
locks keep people out but they also keep them in
he has walked right up to morrie not taking his eyes off morries for a moment
morrie meets his gaze evenly
the moment is broken as bretyns baton slams into morries stomach dropping him to this knees
get up you bloody commie jew
he bangs morrie hard in the jaw knocking him out cold
the two police lines start to move towards each other sandwiching the africans pk and maria
mandoma gives an order
the blacks pick up anything they can to face the inevitable stools chairs a flagpole
you never should have come
at the ready
the two police lines tense to charge forward
the blacks brace to defend
the police charge from both ends of the room yelling clubs held high
the africans respond with their own war cry and engage the club swinging police
a policeman swings at pk who ducks and buries a hook into the mans ribs followed by another to his jaw
the man goes down
morrie has risen to take a policeman out with a stool over his head
two other police beat morrie from behind
he goes down once again under their brutal clubs
pk turns just as another club comes for his head
he slips past the blow and punches out his assailant with a lightning combination
as the man falls another cop charges from behind
pk turns off balance
the club cuts through the air
maria is caught flush on the forehead as she comes between pk and the club
she falls to the floor dead
pk swings a stool with all his might breaking the cops face open
pk drops to the fallen girls side
he is frantic at the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of her open blank eyes
the battle raging around him recedes before his pain and rising rage
all at once he explodes screaming like a madman
he leaps at bretyn and bangs one punch after another into the startled man
bretyns face is broken over and over against pks fists
still pk keeps pounding blow after blow into the fallen man
three cops descend on pk and beat him mercilessly until he drops to the floor unconscious
mandoma is hit hard and goes down
the few africans left fighting go down before the withering assault of clubs fists and boots
hundreds of afrikaaners are gathered
daniel marais and his wife stand by the open grave grieving as the minister reads the final prayers
the coffin is lowered
daniel marais steps forward and shovels the first dirt down after it
as marais looks up he sees pk standing behind the mourners yards off
his anger replaces grief
marais advances towards pk clutching the shovel as a weapon
several men restrain him
marais glares at pk
all of a sudden a thousand african voices cut through the air singing songs of mourning
thousands of africans and a smattering of whites have gathered outside the cemetery
the singing rises from them
gideon morrie st
john and solly stand in front of the crowd
marais glares at pk tears of rage in his eyes
pk stands his ground
marais turns away back to his daughters grave
pk stands tears streaming down his cheeks as the singing engulfs the scene
pk sits at his desk filling out application forms
he picks one up off the desk and looks at it
surprised youre applying to south african universities
in case the scholarship doesnt come through
why are you so bloody stubborn
you dont belong in a south african university any more than i belong in the priesthood
will you take my fathers loan
pk takes the applications back just as a telegraph delivery boy comes to the door
there a mr
its your scholarship
morrie grabs the telegram
odd name p
whats your name
youre not one to talk about names
morrie scribbles his signature and proceeds to open the telegram
pk snatches it away from him
he pulls the telegram out
his face falls to worry
whats it say
pk walks through the small house followed by commandant von zyl
nothing is out of place
since his pneumonia last year ive had one of the men drop by once a week to see if he needed anything
of course you know the professor
he never did
pk looks out at the cactus garden watered now by drip irrigation
at the beginning of the week he wasnt home so i decided to drop by myself
waited a whole day here
when he didnt come back i sent search parties
after three days i sent the telegram
seven days is a long time for him to be gone
do you have any ideas where he went
pk looks at the pegs where the rucksacks hang
there is only one hanging
pk hikes along watching the trail
his eyes spot something
he kneels over the remains of a small campsite
pk touches the ashes
his eyes rise to the escarpment soaring above the jungle floor
pk climbs along the cliff face
he drops down into the entrance to the crystal cave
pk stands at the bottom of the crystal slab almost dreading what he will find
he resolutely climbs the stalagmites to reach the top
pks eye level shifts from below the slab to even with it then to above it
as his sight rises docs corpse comes into view
laid out serene hands clasped on his chest
from above the stalactites drip onto his body ever so slowly turning him molecule by molecule into crystal
pk stands off to one side
a small metal box by docs feet
pk picks it up and opens it
inside is a letter
pk unfolds it and with trembling hands reads so mr
it did not take you so long to figure out what happened
i hope you forgive me for not saying goodbye but i did not think it would be necessary between us
what could i say you dont already know
that i love you with all my heart
that you have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes could fill
that the last thoughts i have before becoming something else will be of music cactus and you
you know all this
pk turns the sheet to page two which is a whole side of music
last night this music came into my head
it is my music for africa
my music for you
be welterweight champion of the world
be a writer
a great writer
remember the only thing between a dream and a reality is you
until we meet again your friend doc
pk looks down at doc as a piano concerto beautiful haunting begins to play
pk plays the music doc wrote with only the moonlight illuminating the page
the music is soul stirring rich evocative
tears run down pks cheeks
pan from pk through the cactus garden to the full moon illuminating the african veldt as the music dominates and then fades into the night
the overnight train pulls in
pk exits the station
pk comes down the street
a police car sits in front of the gym
the two cops inside eye pk
he eyes them back and enters the building
the gym is empty
pk enters and is stopped by the uncustomary silence
pk heads for the office
he finds solly packing up his mementos from the cluttered office
goldman why isnt anybody
whats going on
a repeat performance of history my boy
solly goldmans being deported
of course last time i didnt have the luxury of being able to pack
for what reason
their reason is that im here illegal
i didnt enter the country with a passport
like the czar was issuing passports to russian jews in
this is because of me isnt it
this is because of them
they are the problem not you
dont ever think different
you look tired
want a glass tea
i have to get back to school
solly opens his arms
pk hugs him
you got your head screwed on right
dont let these meshuganahs screw it on wrong
now go on
you want to find me look at benny rosens gym in east end london
thank you for everything
were not finished yet
pk smiles and exits
solly waits for a moment then goes back to packing
pk comes up to the school gates
he notices two plain clothes police cars just across the road
pk enters with a growing sense of uneasiness
pk hurries down the hall to his room
he opens the door to daniel marais sitting at his desk reading from his fiction filled notebook
youre a very good writer
the subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting
what are you doing here
i came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the national scholarship fund
neither will you be admitted to any of the south african universities
here are your applications back
he hands pk the applications as he rises
i told you when you came to my house
i am first a member of my tribe and i will defend it any way i know how
he and pk glare at each other implacable enemies
pk looks out his window thinking
walking off across the campus
they dont want you here any more than they want me
take the hint
screw the scholarship
if i leave or if i stay in south africa its because i choose to not because they choose for me
he takes a small handbag throws a few books into it and docs picture
he picks up his notebook and packs that too
he goes to exit
where are you going
save my place at oxford
pk exits the room
morrie chases after him
he grabs pk stopping him
save my place
morries grip releases
pk walks out
hundreds upon hundreds of black laborers and white mine workers descend into the mines
a milling mass of disenfranchised humanity come to work the underground hell of the copper mines
pk exits the management shack and walks through the crowd
here is how it works
the copper of the mines in northern rhodesia is mined below ground
all day a behemoth of a man a diamond driller works a stope which is like the top of a funnel
a huge diamond driller at work drilling and blasting in the stope
setting charges and drilling the rock
the only way for the raw ore he takes from the sides of the stope to get to the haulage below is to pass through the spout of a funnel
and out the steel doors at the bottom sixty feet down
opening as the haulage cart fills with ore and moves away on the track in the tunnel below
halfway down the spout area is a set of six tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large to make it through the funnel mouth
to safe haulage
six bars with men working them
these are taken care of by a grizzly an explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing and since when the ore doesnt flow neither does the
money working the grizzly is a very crucial and therefore very well paid position
work earns a years stay at oxford
yesterday on receiving my blasting license from the school of mines i signed on to work the bars for a year
a crude place where the bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of
being there to drink hard and long
thomas a harsh ruddy faced welshman the school of mines instructor downs a drink pours another and looks up at pk
are you crazy
to sign on for a year
you said i was the best you ever taught sir
and you are boyo
the absolute best
but even the best doesnt survive a year on the bars
down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later
you may be a genius at reading the rock but you aint no fuckin fortune teller
thomas throws back another drink
you worked grizzly a year
and let me show you what i have to show for it to this day
he holds up his hand
it shakes noticeably
and thats thirteen years after the fact boyo
a noise from the doorway turns thomass attention
he looks over as four huge men enter drillers men whose faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock they work
one of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as an enormous jolt of pain runs through it
he shakes it off and follows his friends to a table
thomas looks concerned
the bartender comes over and puts another shot in front of thomas
one double brandy
derisive lemon soda
he puts the lemon soda in front of pk
come on then
thomas lifts his glass
on being the best damned blaster ever taught by ian thomas
thomas and pk clink glasses
thomas knocks his shot back
the bartender pours another
sure you dont want one
i dont like the taste
you dont drink for the taste
he holds out his hand
it is steady now
he fixes pk with a portentous stare
thomas looks over at the table of drillers
the man with the headache is downing one shot after another
he draws pks attention to the drillers
hes got a powder pain from breathin too much of that damn gelignite
the pains bad enough
mixed with a little alcohol its fuckin lethal
he watches the driller down two more shots of liquor
we aint got much time
thomas directs pk towards the door
the two most dangerous things youll ever see in your life boyo a hangup of rock that wont blast free on first shot and a driller with a powder headache
as they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a roar
he grabs his head and staggers backwards a mad look comes into his eyes
his three huge frineds rush to grab him
he throws them off as if they were ants
he rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete floor and flings it across the room
the men drinking in the bar all tough cases begin to flee
thomas grabs pk whose eyes stare in amazement as the behemoth struggles against his three massive friends and pulls him out of the bar
pk is watching a rugby match being played at twilight
the players are a rough brutal bunch and play their
fights continually break out
off a play a fight breaks out
one of the men is kicked unconscious
two of his teammates carry him off the field dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of potatoes on the sidelines
they run back as play resumes
pk turns and walks back through the camp
a company built miners camp
cement huts with steel doors and corrugated roofs
no shrubbery only dust cement and the roughest looking bunch of men assembled on earth
to answer your question yes sports are played here but only in the loosest sense of the words sport and play
the rules are different for everything in games as well as in the rest of our lives
the managers the foremen the company people
they live apart from the miners
they have families
the miners the crud as we are called dont
this is a society of men many of whom have pasts better left behind
future does not apply
it is a society only in the loosest sense of the word
the laws of survival are simple you either do or you dont
pk comes down a side street
a half a dozen men at cards hard faced desperadoes see him pass eyeing him closely
pk averts his eyes
from behind his back comes the sound of lips puckering loudly indecently
pk swallows hard
the sound of a charge turns him to the six men bolting from their card game after him whooping with lascivious intent
pk takes off
the chase takes pk and his pursuers flying through the streets of the camp past one identical cement hut after another
people watch disinterested
no one raises a hand to help
pk comes racing around the corner to three of the men
blocking the street in front of him
the others catch up behind yelling and hooting
the two lines advance
pk gets ready
when the first man is close enough he hits him hard breaking his jaw
he swings at another catching him flush in the face
but then the rest are upon him
even though pk fights like hell he is overwhelmed
the blows come from everywhere beating him to the ground
his arms and legs are firmly grabbed by four men
he is banged hard face down onto a concrete table
the fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth begins to undo his own fly
all the men scream obsceni ties anticipating the rape
pk struggles like hell to no avail
as he is about to be violated a roaring giant of a man tears into the pack like a bear shredding dogs
he scatters the men knocking some unconscious sending the rest to flight
he stands over pk a looming block of granite with a wild black beard and coal black eyes
his intent only becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or helping a friend when he offers pk his hand lifting pk effortlessly
he examines pks bruised face with some concern and then smiles
you know rasputin i had them right where i wanted them
another minute they were done for
rasputin claps pk on the back and addresses him in russian to which pk responds with a smile
the two men walk off together
a tchaikovsky symphony plays on a rickety old record player
pk works out on a speed bag and a heavy bag he has hung in the room while rasputin the giant russian sits next to the record player finishes drinking
a bottle of brandy tears running down his face as he fol lows the symphony
when he finishes the bottle he takes another one out of a case sitting by his side and begins to drink anew
friendships are rare arising out of mutual need rather than
any shared interests
but they do exist and even flourish
except between the drillers and their grizzlies
no one wants to get too close to the man who might be buried at night by what you drilled loose in the day
pk inspects his nightly quota of gelignite charges and fuses
five africans all serious faces keep their eyes firmly on pk
the africans who come here looking for work are driven by a different desperation drought famine locusts
satisfied with the equipment pk nods for the box to be closed
elijah his head man closes the boxes
they come and risk their lives to send money back home to the families sitting on the barren farms starving waiting for death or rain
when the boxes are closed the other five men in the crew lift them and follow pk out
the elevator descends into the mine
superstition runs deep in them so a good grizzly man attracts a good crew
on the bars the longer you live the luckier you are
and by association they are
pk and his crew make their way through a narrow tunnel and come to the grizzly
it is dark
the only light comes from the lamps attached to their helmets
boulders litter the bars
pk and elijah are onto the bars first
their light beams move along across the boulders
pk turns to elijah
his lamp catches elijahs face which is looking upward
pk looks up
his pov in the narrow bands of light a bunch of rocks big and small packed into the funnel
his face grows dim
five feet across a rock wall with stones of all sizes blocking up the funnels mouth
hangups are the worst of it
when the top of the funnel gets blocked up and the ore wont flow
pk scales the sheer rock wall of the funnel his shirt packed with explosives
the only way to unblock it is to set a charge to blow inward
and the only way to do that is to set the charge in mud which means climbing up to the mouth of the stope and coming face to face with
pk reaches the hangup
he works at taking a prepared parcel of gelignite sticks and jamming them carefully into a crevice
as he does the hangup creaks deeply shifting ominous
a few rocks fall
pk freezes holding his breath
peeking out of the safety shaft below terrified
elijah remains on the grizzly bars his light shining on holding very still listening
sometimes the rock doesnt need the provocation of explosives
sometimes the earth shifts
beat a pebble moves
beat you talk too loud
beat and in the moment before you are turned into something else by fifty tons of rock you understand why it is called grizzly
pk finishes setting the charge
he scales down the wall
a large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes bouncing down the sides to the funnel just missing pk crashing through the bars below
elijah holds his breath
the crew in the safty tunnel quakes
pk comes down the rest of the way
he takes the cordtex rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse
he nods to elijah
elijah lights a cheesa stick
he hands the glowing stick to pk
pk waves towards the tunnel
one of the africans sounds the warning whistle
two blasts followed by two blasts
pk nods for elijah to be off
elijah stands his ground
i wait for you baas
pk lights the fuse
elijah takes off like a scared rabbit for the safety of the shaft
pk is right on his tail
the fuse travels quickly toward the bomb
pk coming behind him grabs him by the collar and flings him into the safety tunnel diving after him a second later just as the bomb explodes
a few rocks come down but nothing else
the africans look at each other with real apprehension
pk rises from elijah and peeks out
is still in place
pk studies the hangup stepping out onto the grizzly listening looking
the hangup groans
the africans are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel
pk stops midway on the bars
he studies the hangup intently then picks up a rock
choosing a target he heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup and runs like hell
the rock hits the hangup
pk springs off the grizzly right into the africans as the hangup thunders down
dust and small rocks fill the safety tunnel
when the avalanche has stopped pk raises himself off the africans
they are all covered in dust but smiling and babbling happy to be alive
pk peeks out and up
he signals to elijah who hits the ll clear whistle
lets clean her off and call it a night hey
happy the africans lift shovels and crowbars to clear the bars
as they pass pk they touch him reverentially as one would an icon
the africans think the longer you survive the luckier you are
and the luckier you are the longer you survive
i know theres something inherently wrong with their logic
still im beginning to see their point
especially with less than six months to go
pk and rasputin play a game of chess as tchaikovsky plays in the background
there is a knock on the door
jocko the bookmaker enters
if youd let him win once in a while we could take a little book on it here
he doesnt care if he wins
he just likes to play
i like to win
which is why im about visiting you
youve come on the board man
there are odds on your making it or not
how are they
low not in your favor my boy
why are you telling me this jocko
when you come up on the boards boyo its time to bow out
its an omen
i bow out you cant make book
pk its not a bet i want to collect
tell me jocko how high will the odds go on something like this
the shorter your time the higher they go
with you probably ten twelve thirteen to one when youre short a month
when the odds hit the top put me in against all bets for two hundred quid
i did not come here to solicit your bet
i know that
i appreciate it
but if you dont take it someone else will
youre a bleery fool
and ill be prayin every night its the only bet i ever have to pay off on
and so will i
jocko rises to exit
you should let him win once in a while
when he wins it wont be because i let him
rasputin says something in russian as he moves a piece excited to have taken one of pks pieces
pk turns and checkmates him
rasputin laughs speaks in russian and starts to set the board up again
the elevator descends into the shaft
pk and his crew exit
there is a low sound of a blast muffled that stops them all
did you hear a blast whistle
then after a moment the vague sound of a drill leaps through the rock
i never heard a drill at night
the africans get nervous
they chatter to one another
its not a ghost
its just some driller trying to squeeze extra pay
pk moves forward
the africans follow him out of the elevator with reluctance
pk steps out onto the bars with elijah and examines the debris
there is a tremor of fear in his voice
pk follows elijahs face upwards to a hangup
not the first bloody thing
bad sign baas
bad drillings more like it
lets get it going
elijah goes back to fix the charge while pk studies the hangup
he hears the africans talking in the dark
when his light points on them they stop turning their heads away
elijah comes back with the bomb
whispered whats the matter with them
they say juju
bad magic is in the mine tonight
pk heeds the warning somberly
he takes the bomb from elijah and starts to climb the wall
track with pk as he makes it up to the hangup
he quickly seals the bomb and drops the cordtex
on the bars catching the rope
he is growing more nervous by the moment as he fastens the fuse
making it down the side of the tunnel
the hangup shifts
peeking out of the safety tunnel scared
scared but standing his ground
making it back onto the bars
he carefully makes his way to elijah as the hangup sends some pebbles down
shes playing with us tonight
pk holds his hand out for the cheesa stick
elijah lights the flare
he goes to hand it to pk
pk notices elijahs hands shaking
he sees the fear in elijahs eyes
i stay with you baas
thats an order
elijah released from his responsibility retreats quickly
pk stands holding the flare a little distracted by elijahs fear wondering
elijah sounds the blast whistle
a muffled blast comes from the other side of the hangup deep in the stope
pk freezes confused and then a second blast goes off
the hangups starts to give
and pk lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars toward the tunnel
the hangup loosened by the explosions inside gives before pks bomb ignites
the rock is crashing down
pk races the rock
the tunnel is within sight
the men yell for him to jump
pk is about to leap when a rock hits the bar bounces up and catches him in the stomach
he loses his balance and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down
pk hits the wall of the lower funnel once twice and then lands in the soft stuff the shale flake cushioning the steel doors below
against the wall of rock
a rock ledge carelessly left when the funnel was originally built
pk rolls under it
a moment later fifty tons of ore in large chunks and small chunks and dust comes crashing down burying pk
he lays there semiconscious buried but alive
the falling rock has stopped
the funnel is full
the bars as well
elijah and the crew look out of the safety tunnel tremulously
elijah looks up the stope
his light catches a man at the very top of the stope climbing out
elijah pulls the warning whistle
five blasts over and over
men hear the whistle and stop work
men shovelling ore stop shovelling
rasputin is timbering with his crew fitting huge timbers into place making new haulage when he hears the whistles
he yells at his crew to grab the tools and he runs off down the tunnel
a deep hole has been dug through the rock piled in the lower funnel
rock comes up in a bucket and is carted off
timber is passed down
a crowd of miners black and white watch and help where they can
no doubt about it
you give me a fair odds on ten quid
four to one
make it a sixer and you got me
six to one hes dead
rasputin works like a man possessed piling rocks in the bucket to be passed up shoring timbers as they are passed down
elijah is pointing up the stope to two mine managers as dozens more mill around hauling the rock out trying to help
two miners observe elijah and the managers
he says someone was up there
blasted it out on pk from the other side
whos the driller
no one drills bothas stope but botha and he only works days
the miners look at each other knowingly and return to work
rasputin bloodied his hands ripped apart by the stones his chest torn by the rough timbers labors on herculean
he hears movement above faint but perceptible
rasputin sends another bucket up
he stands his chest heaving
he hears something
he drops his ear to the floor
he hears the faintest sound
he starts tearing away at the rock doubling his effort
almost unconscious hearing rasputins voice
he breaks into the smallest of smiles and passes out
pk sits in the hospital bed battered but otherwise in good shape
rasputin sits in a wheelchair by his bed side his hands and chest bandaged pondering the chess board between them
well look at ya now boyo
up and at em in no time
and rich as a fuckin lord
he tosses a fat wad of cash on pks bed
your ticket to ride
two hundred quid at fourteen to one
but i didnt make it
im a month short
not according to managment
they cashed you out at twelve months for eleven worked
last thirty days was bonus
and until someone shows me a calendar reads different twelve months and a year are one and the same kind of thing
and the bet was for a year
so get yourself mended and get your ass out of here
theres someone i have to see first
jocko grows uncomfortable
what do you want to go pressin it for
youre rich lad
why do you want to go pressin it
because i want to know
that the man has
blasted so much gelignite hes permanently deranged in the attic
that even the other drillers leave the bar when the man drinks so crazed does he get
he tried to kill you
but he didnt
youre alive is all that matters
do us all a favor boyo
get out of here
get on a train and dont come back
weve no liking to be burying someone were all so fond of
the luckier you are the longer you last
the longer you last the luckier you are
rasputin moves a chesspiece and bellows
he is ecstatic bubbling with his joy
laughter springs from him
jocko and pk trade a look
theres an end to everything boyo
pk walks to the seamy metal gate dressed healed
rasputin his hands still bandaged walks alongside of him
rasputin is concerned
well i guess this is goodbye my friend
ill never forget you
rasputin speaks urgently in russian
pk does not respond
take care my friend
he grasps rasputins bandaged hand to shake it
rasputin takes him around in a huge bear hug smothering him
pk survives a bit rumpled
he smiles at rasputin and exits
as he walks away pk
pk turns the corner and is gone
pk walks through the huts of the drillers massive to a man
most of them are coming off shift
some of them rub their temples trying to soothe the pain of the powder
pk comes to one hut
he knocks again
a driller comes by
who you lookin for
the driller from stope number five
hes at the bar
i wouldnt disturb him
theres a reason hes there and were here
the driller enters his hut
pk absorbs the warning
the three bartenders stand outside along with a dozen other customers
youre not going to go in
is botha the driller in there
always we give him one hour alone before we open
you dont know this because you work at night but it is the rule
in one hour it is pffft
he motions a man falling on his face
pk regards them for a moment and then enters the bar
in the murky light one hulking figure sits at the bar drinking shot after shot of whiskey
pk enters and walks across the room to the massive man
are you botha
botha does not turn around
i worked your grizzly
whyd you try to kill me
botha turns slowly to reveal his face swollen with anger and drink
he tears the short sleeve off his left arm revealing a crudely tattooed swastika
because i missed the first time rooinek
botha rises drunkenly
pk backs up
you remember rooinek
it was thirteen years ago
because of you they expelled me
because of you my father beat me
threw me out from the farm
because of you
he throws back another drink and rushes pk with a roar
pk sidesteps and heads for the door
botha gets there first and bolts it
weve made a lot of money working together
let the past be the past
you ruined the country all you rooineks
you come and ruin the country
he rushes pk again
again pk sidesteps
no jaapie botha
its hate ruining the country
he swings at pk
at that moment the powder headache strikes
botha bellows grabbing his head staggering backward
pk runs for the door
as he reaches it a table slams against it thrown halfway across the room by a powder mad botha
pk jumps out of the way at the last minute
mens faces begin to appear at the iron meshed windows
people start to bang at the door
pk realizing there is no talking to botha now does his best to stay out of the charging giants way
botha charges him
pk sidesteps and hits him with a left hook
the punch has no effect
botha swings out wildly
pk easily dances away
botha picks up another table and heaves it at pk
pk jumps to avoid it but trips on an overturned stool
he goes down
the miners outside crowding three deep yell and shout
people start to make bets
botha charges pk as pk scrambles up
the blow glances off pks shoulder and sends him flying spinning over a table
botha leaps at pk driving him into the wall
pk grimaces sagging
botha picks him up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive arms
pk his hands free starts to pound on bothas ears with his palms
botha screams as the powder head ache accelerates through the top of his skull
he drops pk
pk rolls away and swings a stool at bothas midsection
botha is driven back
pk goes to swing the stool again
botha catches it as if it were made of balsa
he rips it out of pks hand and flings it back at him charging behind it
pk goes topping end over end
botha gets a hand on him and lifts him from behind
he flings pk over the bar
pk hits the floor stunned
botha pulls at the bar trying to get at pk
he rocks the bar and rocks the bar as pk is trying to regain his bearings
finally with one tremendous rip the bar comes away from its bolting
botha pulls it aside
pk rises just as botha moves in
pk hits him three solid shots to the stomach but botha hardly feels them
he grabs pk and starts to squeeze him again
face to face bothas crazed eyes watch the life fade from pks
pks eyes going blank
diving off a waterfall into the turbulent water below
squeezing harder breaking pks concentration
swimming exhausted climbs on a rock one more in front of him
he dives into the water again
the crowd yells and screams as botha squeezes harder
odds are called out
blood starts to trickle from pks mouth
as he swims to the last stone
he reaches it and struggles on top
he stands on the stone trimphant
squeezing again bellowing
pk opens his eyes draws his head back and butts botha in the face
bothas nose shatters
the grip slackens a bit
pk hits him in the face again
botha drops pk to the floor as he screams at the unbelievable pain
blood pours from his nose
catches his breath and is on botha
he throws three hard punches to his face
enraged botha howls and swings at pk
pk goes underneath his arm and hooks three times into the ribs
botha grunts hurt
he swings again with the other hand
first with the head then with the heart
little defeat big when little is smart
pounds into bothas ribs under another wild swinging punch by the giant
botha shouts and keeps advancing swinging
pk backs up peppering him leading him forward
he punishes botha for each punch the big man throws but always backing up
botha half blind spitting blood follows
the crowd screams for him to move side to side
the betting changes fast and furious
pk glances over his shoulder to the cement wall behind him
he takes two more steps and then fires two jabs at bothas face and then stands stock still
wild with anger botha throws a huge right hand to pks head
coming down on marias head
at the last moment pk sidesteps
bothas hand smashes into the cement wall
his hand shatters into a hundred pieces
the pain is so immense he is rendered helpless
pk doesnt waste a second
he starts banging away at botha with hard fast combinations
want to see the wages of hate
botha feels the punches
he steps back faltering
pk pursues him
here is what hate gets you
pk hammers away punching with each word harder and faster
for my chicken
for geel piet
botha is out on his feet
pk unleashes a final pjnch the hardest one he ever threw
it catches botha square in the jaw
botha goes over onto his back like a tree falling
the crowd outside screams and yells with delight
money changes hands
pk collects himself and steps over botha
he unbolts the door and steps outside
the crowd goes silent as pk emerges
the crowd parts
pk looking neither right nor left begins to walk away
i knew as i walked out of the mines out of africa that i wasnt fleeing
that one day i would return
inkosi inkosikasi was right
i was a man for all africa
bound to her by my spirit
bound by my dreams
and africa had taught me the lesson i would take out into the world and one day bring back
great changes can come from the power of many
but only when the many join together and create what is invincible
the power of one
zoom out as pk continues walking out of the camp and toward tomorrow
