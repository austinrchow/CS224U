by robert benton a large and very comfortable office over looking st
at the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women slumped in chairs sitting on desks all of them very tense
among the crowd of people we note murray fisher a young and very ambitious junior executive and phyllis bernard an attractive woman in her early thirties
she is a lawyer with the agency
at the moment ted kramer nice looking without being what you would call a matinee idol paces back and forth
his tie is loosened he checks his watch every fifteen seconds
clearly he is very distraught
predicting the worst theyre not gonna call
i tell you theyre not gonna call
i blew it
i dont know what i did wrong but i teds boss and good friend
he is in his middle fifties nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker
he sits back in his chair with his feet propped on the desk and a drink in one hand
not unfriendly ted will you take it easy
revlons not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this without making us sweat
now just relax okay
everythings gonna be fine
at this stage nothing will help i dont think so jim
maybe i shouldnt have sound effect the phone rings
as oconnor reaches for the phone the room is dark the only light coming from a small night light
we see a beautiful five year old boy billy kramer
he lies in bed half asleep
hold for a beat as a beautiful woman joanna kramer leans over kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her
intense i love you billy
drowsy i love you too mommy
she gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the childs room
dont let the bedbugs bite
joanna stops in the doorway silhouetted against the light
she turns takes a last look at her son then steps outside
now that the light is brighter we can see her more clearly
in her mid thirties she is beautiful dressed in a style that can best be described as bloomingdales
hold for a beat as she leans against the door
it is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset
then making up her mind she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase
the camera tracks with her as she carries it into the bedroom lays it out on the bed and opens it
pan with her as she crosses to a closet grabs an armload of clothes and dumps them helter skelter into the suitcase
it is a few minutes later the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress
jim oconnor now standing raises one hand for silence then making a toast
heres to ted kramer
cheers and good natured jokes
putting an arm around ted squeezing him tight i wanna tell you something about this little runt
he went out there and sold the shit out of revlon and thats why we got the account
it was his idea it was his concept right down the line
more hoots and cheers
people start to yell speech
embarrassed but cannot stop grinning all i can say
all i can say is this is maybe one of the five best days of my whole life
joanna stands at the medicine cabinet going through it packing things in a travel kit rollers deodorant makeup birth control pills
she starts to take a small bottle of perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left inside hesitates then puts it back
now some time has passed most of the crowd has gone and only the regulars are left
in the middle of a story so anyway jim and i are making the pitch right
and all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and i keep on going and he keeps on coughing and i keep on going and he keeps on
coughing and murray fisher leans over shakes teds hand
interrupting congratulations ted
that was a hell of a job
surprised where you goin murray its early
got to get home
glancing at his watch oh christ im late
i gotta get out of here
however instead of going he settles back and resumes his story so anyway i look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and i swear to god
the only thing i can think about is that this poor sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch
insert a long and meticulous list that joanna is making out of the phone numbers and addresses of doctors and hospitals of what the various medicines are for and of
the foods that billy is and isnt permitted to eat
as joanna puts the finishing touches on the list and carefully arranges it on top of the kitchen counter next to a box of unsweetened whole grain cereal and a
jar of honey
note it is this same set of notes that ted will later unthinkingly throw away
as the doors to the outer lobby open and ted and oconnor appear
ted starts to hail a cab oconnor stops him
hey whats the rush
cmon walk me a couple of blocks
jim ive got to go
im already late listen ted
i just want to tell you when old man schmidt retires next year ive got a pretty good feeling theyll kick me upstairs
he turns and starts to walk off down the street ted of course follows
and when they do i just want you to know im takin you along with me
as she goes through her jewelry case taking some things leaving others
in the b
we see a framed photograph of billy smiling looking into the camera
tracking with them as they walk
feeling no pain yknow ted i mean what i said back there
you did a hell of a job on this and i want you to know im turning the whole show over to you
i mean it ted youre running this one
the suitcase is now full
joanna zips it shut and looks around to make sure that she hasnt forgotten anything
then she hefts her suitcase and starts out of the room
joanna carries in the suitcase sets it by the front door then she crosses to the living room and sits down at the dining table
she takes out a list made on the back of an old envelope
as she begins to review it checking off some items off screen sound a key turning in the lock
as joanna looks up
as the door swings open to reveal ted kramer an enormous grin on his face a bottle of champagne in his hand
he is so full of himself that he doesnt notice there is anything wrong
note throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of champagne never putting it down
i thought you might just like to know that at five fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon
she takes a deep breath then ted im leaving you
that represents a gross billing in excess of two million hearing her what
joanna opens her purse takes out her keys and wallet
here are my keys
i wont be needing them any more
note ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will really leave him
all he can think of right now is that he will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one of her moods
sardonic im sorry im late all right
im sorry i didnt call i was busy making a living
joanna doesnt even bother to look up at him
she opens her purse takes out her wallet and begins removing credit cards
my american express
my bloomingdales credit card
my check book the martyr okay okay
what is it this time
what did i do now
ignoring this i took two thousand out of the savings account
that was what i had in the bank when we got married
joanna whatever it is believe me im sorry
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning
theyll be ready on saturday
hard lining it now listen before you do something youll really regret youd better stop and think not bothering to look up ive paid the rent the con ed and
the phone bill so you dont have to worry about them
she checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches dumbfounded
there thats everything
joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door
in an instant ted is after her
panic starting for gods sake joanna would you at least tell me what i did thats so terrible
would you do me that little favor
at the door
look its not your fault okay
its my fault you just married the wrong person
placating her so weve got problems
everybodys got problems thats normal joanna opens the door and they step out into the hallway
ted youre not listening to me
its over finished
im listening joanna believe me im listening
my wife is walking out on me after eight years of bitter you just dont get it do you
as though to a child i am really and truly leaving you
i heard you joanna
i promise i heard you
no you didnt
quietly you didnt even ask about billy
stiffening what about billy
im not taking him with me
tears start ted i cant
i really tried but
i just cant hack it anymore
cmon joanna you dont mean that
youre a terrific mother from her gut i am not
im a terrible mother
im an awful mother
i yell at him all the time
i have no patience
hes better off without me
unable to look at ted ted ive got to go
ive got to go
desperate okay i understand and i promise i wont try and stop you but you cant just go
look come inside and talk
just for a few minutes
please dont make me stay
if you do sooner or later
maybe tomorrow maybe next week
maybe a year from now
looking directly at him ill go right out the window
sound effect the elevator approaching
there is nothing more that can be done this is the last moment of intimacy
quiet where are you going
i dont know
the elevator door opens joanna steps inside
do you want me to help you get a cab
joanna shakes her head
the elevator door closes behind her and it starts to descend
he stands for a moment stunned unable to move
then he turns and races back into the apartment
the camera tracks with him as he rushes across to one of the living room windows throws it open and leans out
looking down to the street from the eighth floor
we see joanna step off the curb and hail a passing taxi
calling out joanna
either she doesnt hear him or else she pays no attention
she gets into the cab closes the door behind her and it drives away
as he stands for a moment watching the taxi as it disappears
then slowly he closes the window turns and as the camera tracks with him walks into the bedroom
the bedroom is a mess the closet door stands open inside joannas section is empty except for some shoe boxes and a few dresses that are scattered across the floor
several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied
hold in a wide shot as ted wearily picks up one of the dresses and hangs it back on its hanger in its proper place ready for joannas return
as he continues straightening up the room ted kramer paces back and forth eyeing the phone
then coming to a decision he crosses to it picks up the receiver and starts to dial
the building is dark except for the kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights
hold as we hear sound the phone ringing
then obviously asleep huh
righteous all right thelma
ive had it
you can call your good friend joanna kramer and tell her enough is enough okay
i mean i dont know what i did but you can tell her shes made her point
ted what are you talking about
dont play innocent with me thelma
you know perfectly well whats going on
exasperated ted i dont understand a word youre saying
you tell me
sound effect as ted slams down the receiver
instantly a light is turned on two floors below
as we hear sound effect the doorbell rings
a moment later ted opens the door and thelma phillips enters
she is a neighbor apt
b and joanna kramers best friend
about four months ago thelma and her husband charley were divorced
until then the two families had been very close the kramers son billy being about the same age as the phillips daughter kim
with the divorce however the kramers tried to remain friends with both thelma and charley and that has caused a certain amount of friction
thelma is an attractive woman in her mid thirties
she dresses well works out religiously at jack lalannes and goes to a therapist twice a week
she is also given to acting the lay analyst with her friends
thelma is generous with her advice sharing the wealth so to speak
with all of this she is kind loyal and a loving friend
at the moment however she is all business
looking around suspiciously all right
whats going on
from his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost between them
all right thelma you want to know whats going on
ill tell you whats going on
ill tell you exactly whats going on
look ted all i starting to really roll i came home tonight
we just got the fire and ice account at the agency
do you know what that means
do you understand what that means
it means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life
ted all i wanted to know was where not letting her get a word in edgewise i walk in the house and before i can say how are you
did you have a nice day
before i can say anything
pow shes out the door
didnt she say anything
she mustve said something
sarcastic yeah she said it wasnt any use talking anymore
ted dont be so hostile
ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the ambassador to the court of st
however during the following he begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with real vehemence
whack thelma im not hostile
thud i am anything but hostile
sock but if you want to know what i am
ill tell you what i am
what i am is i am hurt
i am very hurt
and i just want to know one thing okay
just one thing
thats all i want to know
how to say this ted joanna and i used to talk a lot and
well she told me a lot of
ah things about the two of you
instantly nervous things
what kind of things
clearly she knows more than shes willing to say i mean
ted joannas very unhappy and flash of anger listen joanna kramers got a goddamn good life
shes got a husband that loves her
shes got a terrific kid
shes got a wonderful home getting mad herself what dyou know about how joanna felt
you went off to an office every morning and youd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought
everything was swell
did it ever occur to you guys that joanna kramers not the easiest person in the world to live with
for one thing shes always thirty minutes late
you can set your watch by it exasperated so shes late
whats the big deal
thats just a way of saying pay attention to me
not listening two
she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it
thelma do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially oh for shits sake ted you are the
most selfish human being i have ever met
no wonder she said you came first then billy then if there was anything left over she got the scraps
joanna said that
then how come she never said anything like that to me
maybe she didnt feel like she should have to
maybe she felt like if youd been paying any real attention to her to start with maybe you wouldve noticed
stung boy you guys are really something yknow
id like to know one thing okay just one little thing
did you tell joanna she should leave me
she turns and starts toward the front door ted at her heel
yknow something thelma you are the typhoid mary of divorce
i mean it
joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up
ted divorce is a terrible thing
i know i went through it
youve got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay
pause but ill tell you something
you may not want to hear it but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did
id like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child
that stops her dead in her tracks
she had always assumed that joanna took billy with her when she left
joanna left billy
she didnt take him with her
ted shakes his head
there is a long beat of silence
stunned quiet oh shit
it is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front of the building hosing down the sidewalk
hold as a garbage truck enters frame and the garbage men begin loading sacks of trash into the back of the truck
as it begins to grind up the garbage with an ungodly sound the camera pans up to billy kramer lies in his bed fast asleep
hold for a beat as we hear off screen sound from the street below the garbage truck grinding up garbage
a moment later billy opens his eyes struggles to his feet and as the camera tracks with him trudges sleepily out of his room across the hall and into the
as the child stands in front of the toilet eyes closed we off screen sound effect as the child pees noisily
then when he is finished he turns and without bothering to flush the toilet shuffles down the hall and into his parents bedroom
the bed is empty there is no sign that anyone has slept in it
a look of suspicion on his face he turns and starts back down the hall toward the living room
as billy enters looks around
ted kramer still fully dressed looking like the wrath of god is asleep in the chair
as he marches across to his father
his eyes open he looks around startled
what time is it
suspicious the little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine
where is mommy
trying to pull himself together oh christ
you want to know why moms not here right
bullshit okay im going to tell you
its like this
mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while
you know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself
well its like that okay
subject closed now how about some breakfast
ted struggles to his feet and the camera tracks with them as they start toward the kitchen
when is mommy coming back
by now they are inside the kitchen ted looks around
there on the kitchen cabinet is a box of natural grain cereal a jar of honey some wheat germ and a banana with carefully written instructions from joanna underneath
he takes one look at the note crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket
the camp counselor ill tell you what kiddo why dont i fix us some french toast
french toast really
the camp counselor sure
didnt i ever tell you french toast was my specialty
ill bet i never told you that
now then the first thing we need is
trying desperately to remember eggs
ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs
this is terrific
isnt this terrific
as ted begins the process of making french toast it soon becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing
what follows is a symphony in incompetence on teds part
he breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the shell mixed up with the egg
then he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl
saying it will make it so im having a good time
are you having a good time
watching all of this with increasing apprehension
you forgot the milk
still the camp counselor thats right
youre absolutely right
its been a long time since i made french toast
ted takes a container of milk pours it into the bowl so that it is filled to the brim
then he sloshes the bread around until it is half dissolved
look at this isnt this something
he lops off a huge hunk of butter drops it into an omelet pan and turns up the flame
he looks as though he is about to throw up
what about my orange juice
the counterman right
he opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice
as he does black smoke begins to billow ominously from the frying pan
ted turns spots the smoke
he lunges for the handle of the frying pan which by now is very hot
he grabs it lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess frying pan butter bread goes crashing to the floor
suddenly all the rage comes pouring out
son of a bitch
as ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess
to himself as much as to billy its okay
its gonna be okay
everythings going to be all right
as it pulls to a stop
the doors open and a stream of mothers and children get off
among them we spot ted kramer with billy
as they start across the street ted reaches down and takes hold of billys hand
the moment they get to the far side billy takes his hand away from teds and wipes it on his pants
clearly teds hands are very sweaty
as they start down the block toward billys school
when is mommy coming back
i told you before very soon
nervous will she pick me up after school
if im not here you go home with thelma and kim
what if she forgets
weary ill call thelma and remind her okay
they walk in silence for a few steps then but what happens if shes on her way to school and she gets runned over by a truck and killed
what happens them
ted looks at billy in amazement
as the two of them enter the school and disappear from view
as they open and ted steps out looking like the wrath of god
the camera tracks with him as he crosses the waiting room toward the inner offices
glancing up as he passes
cheerful congratulations mr
looking at her like she has lost her mind
nevertheless he continues on passing through swinging doors into a long corridor lined with secretaries desks and offices leading off of it
suddenly a younger man rushes up grabs teds hand and starts to pump it vigorously
terrific news ted
ted smiles at the man humoring him and continues toward his office
oconnor appears throwing his arm around ted squeezing him in a bear hug
look who was out celebrating last night
suddenly ted realizes that all these people are congratulating him for getting the fire and ice account
trying to appear nonchalant uh jim
can i talk to you
ted and oconnor sitting across from one another
oconnor has just heard the news
thats a real blockbuster
shakes his head i always figured you guys had it made
morose you want to know the real kicker
the real kicker is for the first time in my life the first time i feel like a loser
oconnor nods sympathetically
actually he is praying that ted wont start to cry
stiff upper lip listen dont let it get you down
doesnt believe it for a second youre going to be fine
toujour gai me
ive never been better
i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine
look ted im the oldest whore on the beat okay
three marriages two divorces
youre gonna be okay
wishful thinking im going to be okay
the way i see it joannall come home its just a matter of time
emphatically shell be back
ted nods in agreement
there is a beat of silence as both men consider joannas imminent return
then trying to be tactful but
just in case
i mean just on the off chance she doesnt
what are you going to do about the kid
the wind goes out of him i dont know jim
this whole thing has happened so
pow like that
a friend having to say something very difficult look its none of my business so you can tell me to butt out okay
but if you want my advice youll send billy away to stay with relatives for a while
just until you get yourself straightened out
doubtfully i dont know jim
the dutch uncle ted this may sound a little rough but weve just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency right
and now its up to us thats you and me to deliver the goods
ted youre my main man and if i cant depend on you a hundred and ten percent twenty four hours a day because youre worried about a kid with a
runny nose jim i appreciate what youre saying
i mean it but i really think joannas coming back
clearly he doesnt believe this
i hope youre right ted
i really hope youre right
it is postmarked denver colorado
the letter is addressed to billy kramer and it is from joanna
as he rips open the letter
he sits in the living room watching television a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other
off screen sound a saturday morning kiddie program from the television set
focused on t
you got a letter from mom
instantly billy turns down the volume of the television
excited when is she coming home
as he starts to read slowly carefully so that billy can absorb it
my dear sweet billy mommy has gone away
sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little boys
but sometimes a mommy can go away too and you have your daddy to bring you up
as ted continues to read billy starts turning up the sound on the television using the remote control device
raising his voice so he can be heard i have gone away because i must find some interesting things to do for myself in the world
everybody has to and so do i
being your mommy was one thing but there are other things and this is what i have to do
i did not get a chance to tell you this and that is why i am writing you now
by now the volume from the television is so loud that ted has to shout to make himself heard over it
i will always be your mommy and i will always love you
i just wont be your mommy in the house
but i will be your mommy of the heart
and he looks up about to tell the child to lower the volume billy
billy sits watching television with an almost ferocious intensity on his face doing his best to block out teds voice
he watches his son for a second then carefully refolds the letter puts it away
as he reaches across turns down the sound on the t
well talk about it some other time
reading joannas letter
she finishes the letter looks up at ted
what are you going to do
i dont know thel
this whole thing has happened so
pow like that
i mean what are you going to do about billy
stiff im gonna keep him why
look this is nothing personal but i dont think you can do it
thelma ive lost my wife im not losing my child
backing off all right
but lets get something straight right now
i mean im sorry about what happened between you and joanna but its not my problem understand
im not going to have you calling every fifteen minutes just because you cant find a hot water bottle understand
ive got enough trouble raising my own kid
i dont need another one
youre on your own understand
a long pause she looks at him with all the warmth of a top sergeant facing a raw recruit
then all right
whos billys pediatrician
he hasnt the foggiest idea
machine gun delivery ed davies
east th street
fifty bucks a house call thirty for an office visit
write this down im not telling you twice
whats the nearest hospital
as he grabs a piece of paper and starts writing frantically
wait a minute
wait a minute
not waiting lenox hill
th street between park and lex
the emergency number is
ted stands in the middle of the room sorting out a huge pile of dirty clothes
thelma sits on the edge of the bed watching
colors in one pile white things in another and shirts in a third
in the background we see the bathroom door as it opens and billy kramer steps out freshly bathed and wearing clean clothes
without looking around brush the teeth
hang up the towel and flush the toilet
billy immediately turns on his heels and heads back into the bathroom
that is inscribed ted and joanna kramer married april
hold for a beat then teds hand reaches into frame and picks it up
as he takes the cigarette box and balances it on a stack of scrap books photographs ash trays etc
that he is carrying
he crosses to another table picks up a framed photograph of joanna and billy and piles that on top of everything
we realize that ted is going through the apartment from top to bottom and methodically cleaning out every trace of joanna that he can find
as ted goes through the room picking up billys clothes which have been strewn every which way
the camera tracks with him as he carries them into billys room
billy is fast asleep the only light coming from the night lamp on the dresser
ted dumps the soiled clothing in a hamper hangs up billys jacket then he neatly folds the boys sweater and crosses to the dresser
as ted opens a drawer and starts to put the sweater away
suddenly he spots something
there in the drawer sitting on top of a pile of clothing is one of the photographs of joanna that ted put away this afternoon
billy has retrieved it and hidden it here hoping that ted wouldnt find it
as he takes a long look at the photograph then turns to his son
billy asleep tangled up in the covers
he removes the photograph from the drawer crosses to the bed and places it on the nightstand nearby so that billy will be able to see the picture of joanna
when he wakes up in the morning
he sits for a moment longer on the side of the bed and reaches across and smooths down his sons rumpled hair
clearly in a rush loading his briefcase with work to do that evening
he starts for the door and the camera tracks with him as he walks along the outer office corridor heading for the elevator
as he passes the door to oconnors office calling out night jim
calling out hey ted
i wanna talk to you
reluctantly ted stops turns around and walks back to the door to oconnors office
oconnor sits back in his chair his feet propped on the desk a drink in one hand
jovial whats the big rush
cmon in put your feet up have a drink
hanging in the doorway clearly anxious to leave
cant do it tonight
gotta pick up billy
paying no attention to that listen i heard a terrific joke today
theres this polish skydiver urgent sorry jim ive got to go
ill talk to you tomorrow
and before oconnor can say anything he is gone
he sits for a moment drumming his fingers on the desk top then reaches for the phone and starts to dial
a moment later murray
jim oconnor why dont you drop by and have a drink
as ted emerges from the building starts to hail a cab
as the cab pulls to a stop
ted leaps out and rushes inside
the elevator doors open and ted steps out
the camera pans with him as he crosses to the doorway of an apartment rings the bell
as the door is opened by a pleasant looking woman in her thirties
this is mrs
she has the slightly haggard look of someone who has just survived a birthday party with eight five year olds
in fact behind her we see an abundance of crepe paper and balloons
kline im sorry im late but thats all right but im afraid billy was a little nervous
she glances off screen billy his coat on his goody bag in his lap sits alone on a bench in the foyer
the moment he sees his father he gets up and starts for the door
to ted accusingly youre late
im sorry pal but i had a meeting and to mrs
kline anxious to get away goodbye
thank you for coming
calling out to her son in the next room mark
say goodbye to bill
and he hustles his father out into the hallway
once door is shut behind them sullen i was waiting a long time
by now they have crossed to the elevator
ted rings the bell
this aint exactly the greeting hes expected it wasnt so long im only
checking his watch twenty minutes late
the elevator doors open
all the other mothers got here a long time ago
and the doors close blocking them from view
ted and billy sit at the dining table a large pizza between them
ted is working hard trying to establish some kind of rapport with his son
billy is silent he picks at the slice of pizza in front of him
more of the camp counselor how was school today
same as usual
billy dont eat with your fingers
there is a long beat of silence
like pulling teeth well i see the yankees finally won a game
mom i mean dad
can i be excused
im not hungry
i think ill go to bed
too much birthday cake right
as he gets up from the table i guess
as billy shuffles off toward his room
ted sits for a beat picking at the food on his plate
the camera tracks with billy as he gets up from the table and walks into his room
hold in the doorway as he takes off his shirt and pants and leaves them lying on the floor
the boy crosses to the closet gets his pajamas and puts them on
standing in the doorway watching
he starts to crawl into bed
the camera pans with him as he crosses to where billy dropped his clothes on the floor picks them up
listen pal im sorry okay
i know how you feel
ted crosses sits on the edge of the bed
look i remember one time when
i was a couple of years younger than you are now and
i was staying with this cousin of mine and my parents were supposed to come and pick me up by three but it got later and later and they didnt
and they didnt show up and i remember i got really scared that something had happened to them and i remember when they finally came instead of being happy to see them i was very angry and
billy i promise ill never do that to you again okay
his face is turned to the wall
hold for a beat as we see him nod
note the following scene which is written as one is actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper
it is a different woman sometimes nervous and excited sometimes large and lugubrious with six shopping bags sometimes looking like a headmistress at dachau
they are uniformly until the last unappetizing
throughout this we see ted becoming increasingly desperate
looking around nervous its very big
they didnt tell me it was this big
no actually its only two bedrooms
this place is a real pig sty
defensively look my wife just walked out on me
its been a tough week
dont tell me your troubles mister
i got enough of my own
note with the fourth woman we begin on a closeup and pull back to reveal that we are in teds office and it is the middle of the afternoon
the first thing is i dont do floors
at that point the door behind her opens and oconnor pokes his head in
ignoring him or windows
i come in at ten and i get wednesdays off
brisk ill be with you in a minute jim
back to the woman you couldnt make that saturday could you
she is a slightly built attractive woman in her early sixties
there is a long pause as she looks around
what kind of boy is your son
this is the first person that ever asked about billy
taken aback well hes
ah hes a good kid
hes shy and
i think hes probably very creative and
could i see him
hes right in here
as they start toward the childs room
in the darkness we can see billy all scrunched up in the covers
hold for a beat as the door opens and the light from the hall falls across the sleeping boy
ted and mrs
willewska stand silhouetted against the light
hes very beautiful
as he stirs in his sleep
kramer you are a very lucky man
this is the first time since joanna left that this has occurred to him
willewska could you start on monday
tracking just in front of them as they wheel a shopping cart along the aisle
ted has a shopping list in his hand
ted stops takes a box of detergent off of the shelf starts to put it in the shopping cart when worried mom i mean dad
his mind elsewhere uh huh
thats not the right soap
we use the kind in the green and yellow box
cmon theres not much difference firmly we use the green and yellow
ted looks at his son for a moment then carefully replaces the detergent that he had originally picked and reaches for the green and yellow kind
they continue on for several steps and ted stops again this time looking for a dishwashing liquid
he starts to reach for one stops looks around at billy
billy shakes his head
ted points to another
shaking his head again the pink stuff
ted takes a bottle of the pink stuff puts it in the shopping cart and consults his shopping list
okay what color cereal do we get
it is that same afternoon and billy his clothes are much dirtier by now is running back and forth with a group of other children
walk him over to bethesda fountain and buy him an ice
he sits on one of the playground benches the work he took from the office stacked beside him on the bench
sitting next to him is a personable looking man of about teds age
he is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest tie and polished gucci loafers
we will call him the saturday father
note the saturday father and his daughter a pretty young girl of about ten will appear from time to time throughout the film
he is a divorced father putting in his time not giving a shit about the child
the saturday father insists on treating ted as though they were members of the same secret fraternity
and he comes to represent teds nightmare of what might happen to him
looking in the direction of the voice what
walk him over to bethesda fountain buy him an ice
itll kill twenty minutes
ive got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill
checking his watch i get off duty at five thirty
bored anxious to make conversation how long you been divorced
surprised three months
how can you tell
youve got that look
my lady and i split two years ago in august and im an old pro at this shit
first thing stay away from the childrens zoo
its pure hell if i never see another chicken ill be happy
calling out to his daughter off screen im here darling
finding this distinctly unpleasant
he glances around looking for billy
the sprinkler area
other children are running around but there is no sign of billy
calling out billy
another area of the playground
billy is nowhere in sight
as he grabs his stuff and starts toward the exit of the playground
looking in another direction
standing among a crowd of people just outside the entrance to the playground
he is looking around wildly
there in the distance is billy kramer running as hard as he can away from ted
tracking in front of him as he starts to chase after billy
it is clear that billy is running with a purpose
billy pays no attention to him
tracking in front of him as he continues to chase his son
closer now we can see that ahead of billy is a woman that from behind looks remarkably like joanna
as he realizes what is about to happen
catching up to the woman
a moment later he gets close enough to grab onto her skirt
as the woman turns around quite clearly it is not joanna
his face becomes impassive again
all the excitement vanishes
i thought you were my mommy
his face reveals all of the pain that billys cant
as it opens and billy kramer wearing an outsized moustache a makeshift cape and a stovepipe hat made from construction paper
he stands for a moment looking around finally he spots someone grins and begins waving
across the room eighteen to twenty mothers ted kramer is the only man present are gathered sitting on tiny chairs and at work tables watching as their children put on
suddenly he forgets his lines looks around nervously
a moment later a very pretty young teacher leans over whispers in his ear
ladies and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the greatest show on earth
welcome to the
he forgets again he leans forward mouthing the words as the teacher prompts billy
ted breathes a sigh of relief his son having gotten through it
a look of total pleasure on his face
from time to time when billy does something particularly difficult ted nudges the woman next to him
note in all of the shots of billy we see the teacher there guiding helping over and over and over we cannot help but notice how attractive she is
toward the end of the show teds pov occasionally follows the teacher rather than the child
the show is over and the parents and children mill around eating popcorn drinking lemonade from paper cups
ted stands off to one side talking to the teacher as billy runs around
kramer i just wanted to tell you what a wonderful boy your son is
clearly attracted to her i dont know
ive been worried
glancing around making sure billy is out of earshot i mean with what hes been through and everything
i solicitously no
billy is doing just fine
giving himself a few points well you know its not easy raising a kid on your own and i thought if we could get together and uh discuss at that
moment one of the class mothers interrupts reaches across ted and takes hold of the teachers hand
when is the baby due
not til august
inadvertently glancing at the teachers stomach nothing shows
as she turns back to ted
you said you wanted to talk mr
embarrassed yes but
ah not now
checking his watch ive got an appointment
i forgot all about it
as ted begins beating a hasty retreat tracking in front of him as he walks down the street carrying a large and elaborate papier mache art thing that billy made
as he manages to notice every single pretty girl that passes thread his way through the crowd and still balance billys enormous work of art
as they open ted squeezes off and as the camera tracks with him he crosses the waiting room and enters the offices proper
he pauses at his secretarys desk and deposits billys papier mache thing
she jumps up from her desk takes the papier mache thing and her notebook in hand and follows ted as he walks down the corridor towards oconnors office
theres a meeting with the revlon people in the board room and youre fifteen minutes late
in a rush i know
schmidt cant have the figures on the television buy until monday
tell him i asked for it friday
i want it friday
lombardo from packaging wants to meet on friday
by now they have reached the board room
he enters without knocking his secretary still in tow
kelsey called to ask if billy can come to stephanies birthday party on tuesday
the room is filled with executives in three piece suits and oconnor who is doing a lot of backing and filling
as he enters yes
remind me to pick up a crying chrissie doll at lunch on tuesday
clearly he is very irritated at this
sardonic if its all right with you mother kramer can we get down to work now
it is a real mess legal files and law books scattered everywhere
in the midst of all this chaos sits phyllis bernard as we said before she is about thirty very pretty in spite of her glasses
she looks up as ted enters
it is clear from their attitude that they have known one another for a long time and are very relaxed together
he drops into a chair and shoves a stack of papers across the desk to her
these are the revlon contracts
i thought you ought to check them out
she takes the papers and starts to rifle through them stopping every so often and making a note in the margin
as she does we notice that the second and third buttons of her blouse have come undone and that she is not wearing a bra
as he realizes this
she glances up to ask ted a question about some point or other notices the direction of his gaze and unself consciously buttons up her blouse
she goes back to her papers as ted continues to watch her
not looking up from her papers
baffled yes what
looks up serious yes ill have dinner with you
although the room is dimly lit we can see quite clearly that ted and phyllis are in bed together
they have finished making love and ted lies back half asleep
phyllis reaches across to the nightstand puts on her glasses and checks her watch
kramer ive got to go
ive got an eight oclock closing tomorrow down on centre street
half asleep mmmmnph
ill get you a cab
but he makes no move to get up
phyllis gets to her feet and in the dim light we can see that except for her glasses she is naked
as she crosses the hall on the way to the bathroom thats okay
its just that ive got these clients that are there is billy kramer standing by the toilet buttoning his pajamas
he looks up at phyllis
there stands phyllis naked as the day she was born a look of stunned amazement on her face
softly to herself oh god
too startled to cover herself
he looks her up and down then very serious do you like fried chicken
suddenly remembering to cover herself
hoping desperately it is the right answer ah
so do i
and he shuffles off to bed
phyllis waits frozen until he disappears into his room
then she turns and flees back into the bedroom
as she bursts into the room closes the door behind her leans against it
eyes wide i just met your son
who has leapt out of bed and is scrambling into his pants
he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken
phyllis nods rather frantically
grinning so whats your problem
stand side by side
he is cutting chopping making some kind of stew
thelma stands nearby watching sipping a glass of white wine
from off screen we can hear billy and kim running around playing
you ever think about getting married again
no not really
she thinks for a moment then i guess its different if you dont have children but
i dunno even if charley and i dont live together even if were sleeping with other people even if charley was to marry again
hed still be my husband
that stuff about till death do you part
thats really true
nodding toward a cookbook that is propped open nearby how many onions does it say to use
without bothering to look in the book three
and add some basil
as he does dyou think you and charleyll ever get back together again
i dont think so
so charley had a little fling
all in all he was a pretty good husband
look i know this isnt gonna make any sense okay
i mean forget the logic part
but i keep thinking if charley really loved me he wouldnt have let me divorce him
the saturday father and his daughter clearly with nothing to say to one another stand eating ices from a nearby vendor
the camera pans away from them across to billy ted and phyllis
she is dressed in a very nice suit silk blouse high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in central park on a saturday afternoon
at the moment ted is trying to teach billy how to bat
now look you hold it like this
he places billys hands on the bat just so and you swing like this
taking him through the motions watching
she cant believe what shes seeing
finally she cant stand it any longer
impatient no no no kramer
thats not how you do it
she crosses to billy gently takes the bat from him and demonstrates
you hold it like this
showing him her grip farther down the bat
and you swing like this
to ted throw me one
as he gives billy a look that says we have to humor her
he throws a ball
as she swings connects and slams a ball in a long looping fly that goes at least two hundred feet
watching the ball disappear in the distance he turns back to phyllis open mouthed
embarrassed she grins shrugs and hands the bat back to billy
oconnor murray and the art director are in oconnors office as the door opens and ted enters carrying a pile of papers charts graphs etc
heres the report on
he stops in mid sentence looks around
on the walls are a series of mock ups of the various fire and ice ads none of which are what ted and oconnor had agreed upon
surprised what the hell is this
innocent murray had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs
weakly i think theyre kind of interesting
bugged i dont
jim this isnt anything like what we talked about
its not even close
oily ted basically its still your concept
chiming in murray just added a few things thats all
now hold it right there im the one that went in and sold revlon on this idea to start with remember
you said i was going to be sound effect the phone rings
oconnor picks it up
he listens for a moment then hands the phone to ted
its for you
as he takes the receiver
then embarrassed he turns his back and lowers his voice
look billy i told you before one hour of t
a day thats the rule
clearly billy is giving him an argument i dont care what the other mothers do
listen i cant talk now im in a meeting
firm billy ill talk to you later good bye
note during the phone call the camera pans away to murray oconnor looks of bored condescension and smug superiority on their faces
ted hangs up the phone and turns back around
smooth ted i appreciate what youre saying but i really think youre just too close to it right now
quickly murrays right
reassuring look its just some ideas okay
i mean nothings locked in cement
i promise you this is your show
not very reassured
trust me on this one ted
ted is sitting at the dining room table working
spread out all across the table are layouts rate sheets etc
billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt tipped pens
hold for a beat then worried about something mom i mean dad
busy in a minute
beat of silence then what do you do when an elephant sits on your fence
you get a new fence
he hasnt heard a word cmon billy
im trying to work for gods sake
another beat of silence then billy reaches for his glass of hawaiian punch and accidentally tips it over spilling purple liquid across all of teds papers
instantly ted is on his feet yelling
goddamnit cant you watch what youre doing
quiet im sorry
je sus christ
i catch all kind of shit at the office because im not pulling my weight because im busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and im sorry
sardonic thats terrific
thats really terrific but i notice im the one thats cleaning up this noticing an important paper covered with grape juice oh crap ill have to do this one over
starting to help im sorry
by now there is nothing the boy can do right
look its after your bedtime okay
just do me a favor and go to bed okay
billy gets to his feet collects his stuff and walks into his bedroom
hold on ted who sits for a moment then gets wearily to his feet and as the camera tracks with him crosses to the door of billys room
he stops in the doorway looks billy struggling to get his pajamas on having a hard time
look im sorry i yelled okay
quiet thats okay
ive been catching a lot of flack at the office
as it opens and phyllis comes out
in the background in oconnors office we see oconnor and murray talking laughing
the camera tracks alongside phyllis as she walks to ted kramers office and opens the door without knocking
how about lunch kramer
as they sit across from one another
a waiter stands over them setting drinks in front of them
perrier and lime
placing a drink in front of phyllis and scotch with soda
putting teds drink in front of him the waiter bustles away
okay phyllis whats up
she breaks off uncertain whether or not to go on
then making up her mind she reaches across takes teds scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp
in a rush oconnors out to get you
hes going to take the fire and ice account away from you
angry i dont believe it
why would jim do something like that
phyllis polishes off the rest of teds drink
angry herself you want to know why
ill tell you why
signaling to the waiter another scotch and soda for the gentleman
back to ted ill tell you exactly why
because youre not his buddy anymore
because he cant count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him
ive got billy to take care of
exasperated you dope
oconnor doesnt give a damn about billy
all he wants is somebody thatll hang around with him every night so he wont have to go home
stiff i dont believe you
the waiter sets teds drink on the table in front of him
he starts to reach for it but phyllis is quicker
taking a stiff drink all right
but tell me something kramer
who do you think is palling around with oconnor these days
how should i know
stunned but trying to be nonchalant
whats so terrible about that
would like to take him by the shoulders and shake him until his teeth rattle oh for gods sake kramer
you have got to be the worlds most naive human being
leaning forward murray has gone in and changed every single ad youve done on the entire fire and ice campaign
every single thing right down the line
no i dont believe it
jim oconnor would never let anything like that happen
he gave me my shot in this business
if it wasnt for jim oconnor id be i dont know where id be
hes a wonderful man
apologetic for having upset ted kramer im sorry
all i was trying to do was cutting her off i dont want to hear another word against him
not another word
hes a wonderful man
a wonderful man
insert the finished proof of the ad that murray had done that ted had seen in oconnors office
tracking with him as he steams out of his door and marches along the corridor to oconnors office
as ted brushes past her im sorry mr
oconnor is in conference
but it is too late
ted barrels into oconnors office without bothering to knock
oconnor is alone in the office
he looks up startled as ted comes barging in
furious all right jim
you said i was running this show right
you said no decisions without my approval right
brandishing the ad well what the hell is this
whats going on jim
embarrassed well ah
i thought it over and i decided were doing it murrays way
jim this is garbage
this isnt anything like what we talked to revlon about
none of it
you cant tough thats my decision ted and thats final
who sits looking down at the plate of food in front of him as though it was a coiled rattlesnake about to strike
what is it
he is eating but he doesnt taste a thing
i hate it
you dont hate it
we had salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine
stubborn no i didnt
i hate the brown stuff
strained patience all it is is onions and gravy
im allergic to onions
you are not allergic of onions
youve had them lots of times
sullen i want a pizza
trying not to lose patience no
this is fine
just take a bite youll like it fine
reluctantly billy takes a tiny bite
he barely puts it in his mouth before he spits it out with a great show of being physically ill
i think im going to throw up
getting pissed off oh for gods sake
he reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the meat
now thats just plain old hamburger
some of the brown stuff is still there
through clenched teeth then eat around it
anger building now listen to me young man
do you know what i had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table
obstinate i dont care
i hate it
i want pizza
blowing up not on your life
ive had it with crap around this house
from now on no more pizza
starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being
by now both of them are out of control
you want to know something
you are a spoiled selfish little brat
now eat billy takes his plate and looking his father straight in the eye deliberately overturns it spilling food everywhere
he is out of his chair like a shot crosses to billy and jerks him to his feet
go to your room
he half carries half drags the child kicking and screaming into his room
the camera tracks alongside them
at the top of his voice owwww
youre hurting me
youre hurting me
i hate you
i hate you
seething youre no bargain either pal
i want my mommy
i want my mommy
by now they have reached billys room
ted dumps him on the bed unceremoniously and starts out of the room
sobbing i want my
i want mmmy
at the door tough shit
youre stuck with me
and he slams the door behind him
the dining area
ted sits down and tries to resume his meal alone
sobbing fighting to catch his breath i want my
i want mmmy mmo
as he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can see that he is shaking like a leaf
as he finishes doing the last of the dishes dries his hands and looks around to make sure that everything has been put away
he flips off the light and as the camera tracks with him he walks from room to room turning off the lights until he reaches the door to billys room
which is still closed
ted hesitates for a moment then eases open the door and steps inside
billy lies sprawled across the bed all tangled up in the covers
as he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten the covers
all anger gone yeah
kisses him thats okay pal
go back to sleep
its very late
he starts to get up when daddy
very quiet are you
stunned at the question
of course im not going away
i love you very much
ill be right here
there is a beat of silence then it comes pouring out thats why mommy left
cause i was bad
the boy begins to weep
he puts his arm around billy and holds him close oh christ
he thinks for a moment then no pal
your mom loves you very much
the reason she left didnt have anything to do with you
pause this is very painful look i dont know if this will make any sense to you okay
but ill try and explain
you see the reason your mom left was because
well i guess it was because i kept trying to make her into a certain kind of person
make her be the way i thought a wife was supposed to be
only she wasnt like that
smiles to himself well she wasnt like that
and now when i think about it i can see she tried very hard to be like i wanted very hard
and when she couldnt then she tried to tell me about it
only i wouldnt listen
i guess i thought that if i was happy that meant she was happy too
only she wasnt
the truth is the only reason she didnt leave a lot sooner was because she loves you so much
joanna stayed until she couldnt stand me any longer and then she left
but it wasnt you pal
it wasnt you
there is a long beat of silence as billy thinks about this
clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from his shoulders
finally is mom ever coming back
you mean for good
i dont think so
ted gets to his feet starts for the door
now go to sleep
its very late
dont let the bedbugs bite
see you in the morning light
ted pauses in the doorway smiles
i love you
as ted runs along beside billy who is learning to ride a bike
then in the last shot ted lets go of the bike and runs along just behind
slowly as billy gains confidence he speeds up leaving ted farther and farther behind
finally as billy glances over his shoulders
as the boy by now a considerable distance away turns and waves
waving back a grin of enormous pride on his face
he glances around embarrassed to make sure no one is watching and wipes tears from his eyes
as it pulls to a stop and a mob of mothers and children get off
among them we spot billy and ted kramer
the camera pans with them as they cross the street and enter the school building
the camera continues its pan across the street to a coffee shop with large plate glass windows facing the school
there standing in the window watching is joanna kramer
hold as the camera slowly zooms in on her and we see a look of overwhelming pain on her face
sitting on a bench the area around them is stacked high with toys that the kids have brought with them to the park
off screen we can hear billy and kim racing around playing
a little too casual thel you ever hear from joanna
also with deliberate nonchalance not for a couple of months
the last time i heard from her she was living in san francisco
watching him uh huh
she said she had a good job was playing a lot of tennis
she wanted to know all about billy
there is a beat of silence then the real question she ever ask about me
lying uh huh
what dyou tell her
i told her youre doing a pretty good job
ted glances around billy and kim are standing near the jungle jim
billy has a toy airplane in his hand
presenting billy kramers fantastic superjet
and he begins to race around the area making jet noises and holding the airplane in his hand
watching him smiling
weaving in and around the benches
he turns and starts back towards ted
as he does billys foot as he trips
as he starts to fall still holding onto the airplane
as he hits the concrete
he leaps to his feet starts toward the boy
as he looks up
there is a terrible looking gash running from his cheek into his hairline
kim screams at the sight of the blood
as ted carrying billy wrapped in his coat comes barreling out of the park nearly knocking over several people with shopping bags and begins running like hell with the camera
tracking just in front of him
in the background we see thelma and kim chasing after him
the length of the tracking shot he is covered with billys blood it is on his face his shirt his trousers
at the moment he stands helpless watching as off screen a surgeon examines billys wound
calm reassuring thats good billy
thats a brave boy
now then hows that
now weve cleaned it out
billy lies on the examining table with the doctor bending over him
that wasnt so bad was it
billy doesnt say anything
now then you just wait here billy
i want to talk to your dad for a minute
the doctor motions for thelma to wait with billy and he crosses to ted who stands in the doorway
low voice again calm and reassuring your boy is very lucky mr
one inch over and it would have caught the eye
but im going to have to take some stitches
flat how many
ted closes his eyes there is a sharp intake of breath
because of the position of the wound and your sons age i dont think there will be much of a scar
otherwise id call in a plastic surgeon
now id advise you to wait outside
itll be eas like a shot no
kramer theres softly but with real vehemence fuck you
hes my son
im staying with him
he holds his son tightly while the doctor stitches up the boys wound
from this camera angle we can see teds face but only the back of billys head
although we do not see the stitches being made we do see the doctors hand with the needle and surgical thread as it moves into and out of view with
a slow steady rhythm
billys hand clutches teds so tightly that the knuckles are white
softly as each stitch is taken ohhh
whispering to his child its okay son
just a little more to go
dont worry son
it is late only a few lights are still on
he lies in bed fast asleep his head swathed in bandages
the camera pans away from him across to ted who sits in a nearby rocking chair watching his son
hold for a beat then ted gets to his feet walks quietly to the door and steps out into the hall closing the door behind him
thelma having washed and dried the dishes is now wiping off the top of the counter top more to keep busy than anything else
she looks around as ted enters
how is he
standing in the doorway
he hasnt changed his clothes and he is still covered with blood
nods hes okay
thel can i ask you a favor
i dont mean a little favor
i mean a big f favor
she watches ted closely
he doesnt look at her
thelma if i die aghast what
quickly i didnt say im going to die but if i should deeply upset dont say that
i dont want to hear you say that
firmly thel listen to me
if on the million to one shot that i should correcting himself that anything should happen to me
would you take care of billy
you want me to take care of billy
i thought about it a lot and youre the only person i know that i trust with him
i mean if anything happened to me hed be okay with you
youre a good mother
thelma looks away from him
hastily i know its not an easy thing to answer
she still cannot look at him
look if its too much responsibility thelma nods unable to speak
she nods again
thank you thel
thank you very much
as he lies in bed asleep
some time has passed and billys bandage is much smaller
hold on him as we hear off screen sound from the street below the regular six forty five garbage truck that serves as billys alarm clock
as he wakes up struggles to his feet
the camera tracks with him as eyes closed he stumbles into the bathroom pees and still not remembering to flush the toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father
as the child turns and walks toward the kitchen the camera holds on ted
he heaves himself to his feet and eyes closed in much the same manner as his son stumbles into the bathroom
he automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to look walks into the living room opens the front door and picks up the paper
as he starts into the kitchen he meets billy coming the other way carrying two plates a doughnut on each
the camera now tracks with billy as he walks into the living room carefully sets the plates on the dining table crosses to the television set and turns it on
he returns to the table and sits down as ted appears carrying two glasses of orange juice and vitamins
he takes a seat in the chair opposite billy and opens his paper and starts to read
hold on them as they sit without talking eating their breakfast the only sound a childrens cartoon program coming from the t
from time to time ted glances up from his paper to look across at the cartoon
hold on them as we see that they have become roommates in the best sense of the word
it is a gray cloudy day in mid november
snow is falling
sound effect a telephone ringing
as ted enters looks around
the maitre dhotel approaches
from his attitude it is clear that ted and joanna were regular customers
good evening mr
we havent seen you for a long time
kramer she waits for you in the back
thank you john
the camera tracks with ted as he walks toward the back room of the restaurant
several waiters approach and say hello the piano player looks up and smiles
as he reaches the door to the back room
she sits against the wall a glass of white wine in front of her
she is dressed simply and no longer has a tan
nevertheless joanna is still stunningly beautiful
hold on her for a beat as she looks up smiles
he stands watching her his knees weak
it is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again
as he crosses to her table sits down
you look well
so do you
the waiter appears carrying a scotch and soda
he sets it down on the table in front of ted
the usual mr
not taking his eyes off joanna thanks gino
the waiter nods and promptly disappears
hows the new job
there is a self conscious pause
from the bar the piano player begins playing a new song
from ted and joannas reaction it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past
they listen for a moment then look at us joanna
just like any old married couple having dinner
who would believe it
the question he has been dreading
not looking at her except he had
he fell and he cut his face
he has a scar joanna from about here to here
indicating where and how big there is a beat of silence
a moment of shared feeling
he has to say it to someone i cant help but feel somehow
its my fault
i keep thinking i couldve done something stopped it
you cant tell it from a distance ted
for the first time he looks up at her
ive seen him
a few times
sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school
he looks like a terrific kid
he still cant get over it you sat in that coffee shop across from school completing the sentence watching my son
ted ive been living in new york for the past two months
amazed youve been living here in the city
a deep breath ted
the reason i wanted to see you
i want billy back
you want what
firm i want my son
im through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street
i want my son
are you out of your mind
youre the one that walked out on him remember
trying to explain ted listen to me
you and i we had a really crappy marriage hastily look dont get so defensive okay
it was probably as much my fault as it was yours
anyway when i left i was really screwed up joanna i dont give a she will be heard ted all my life id either been somebodys daughter or somebodys wife
or somebody elses mother
then all of a sudden i was a thirty two year old highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child
i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get
i guess it wasnt far enough
so i started going to a shrink
leaning forward very sincere ted ive had time to think
ive been through some changes
ive learned a lot about myself
like a shot such as
boring in come on joanna what did you learn
id really like to know
relentless one thing okay
just tell me one goddam thing youve learned
there is a beat of silence then quiet determined ive learned that i want my son
he reacts as though he has been slapped
joanna go be a mother
get married have kids
dont get married have kids
do whatever you want
i dont give a damn
just leave me out of it and leave my baby out of it
ted if you cant discuss this rationally getting to his feet joanna go fuck yourself
and with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the restaurant
a large very plush office lots of antiques beautiful nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with autographed photographs of at least three ex presidents of the united states
sitting behind a large and imposing desk is john shaunessy a handsome formidable man in his early sixties
he is well dressed a cornflower in his buttonhole that sort of thing
at the moment shaunessy leans back in his chair as ted finishes his story
leaning forward intense look she walked out on her own child right
thats desertion right
shaunessy im telling you its an open and shut case
first theres no such thing as an open and shut case
especially where custody is involved
second the burden is on us to prove your ex wife is an unfit mother
that means im going to have to play rough and if i play rough you can bet they will too
can you take that mr
third itll cost you five thousand dollars
thats an astronomical amount of money to him
thats if we win
if we lose you could end up having to pay your wifes court costs as well
youve hired yourself a hell of a lawyer mr
down to business how old is the child
he shakes his head
in most cases involving a child that young the court tends to side with the mother
this is not what he wanted to hear
but she signed over custody
he digs in his pockets pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts it at the lawyer
glancing at it im not saying we dont have a shot but it wont be easy
thinks for a moment mr
kramer do me a favor
there is something i find very helpful in matters like this
i sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons on an issue
i actually write them down and look at them
i want you to do that okay
then after that if youre really sure you want to retain custody of your child then well go in there and whip their asses
ted sits at the dining table the supper dishes have been pushed aside
he has a legal pad in front of him and is writing
the camera dollies in closer
the legal pad
on one side ted has written pro and on the other con
underneath con ted has written a long list of the drawbacks involved in keeping billy sex life money possibility of remarriage sleep emotional dependence
the pro side of the list is empty
he sits for a moment staring at the list then he crumples the paper gets to his feet
as ted enters
he crosses to billys bed where the child is fast asleep sits down on the edge and starts to rub the childs back
i love you billy kramer
half asleep i love you too daddy
ted kisses the child gets to his feet and starts toward the door
dont let the bedbugs bite
almost asleep again see you in the morning light
oconnor stands with his back to ted looking out the window
from the beginning this is clearly an awkward and unpleasant moment
scared to do what he is about to do look ah
i just got word from the guys at revlon and
ah they did some marketing tests on our campaign and the results were
hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired
it only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum and
theyre not very happy and
well the guys have decided they want to
ah re think the entire concept and
look i dont like having to do this okay
i mean what i mean is
ah im going to have to
ah let you go not really sure he heard right are you firing me jim
he still has his back to ted
cmon ted dont get emotional
whining look this isnt exactly an easy thing for me to do yknow
i swear murray and i did everything we could but those sons of bitches were out for blood
i mean it was all i could do to keep the account inside the shop
look i promise if i hear of anything ill let you know first thing
ted i want oconnor looks around
the room is empty the door stands open and ted is gone
as ted grabs a picture of billy from his desk takes his jacket and coat and stalks out the door
as he walks along the street in a state of total shock
behind him in the windows of expensive stores we note christmas decorations
ted sits across from the interviewer a polished young man in his middle twenties very efficient he sounds a bit like a tape recording
glancing at a form ted has filled out ummm hmmm
the good news well this looks very good
of course the bad news you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job
what do you mean i dont understand
kramer nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus
look you dont understand
i need a job
ive got a kid and smooth i understand and im absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up
ending any further discussion after the first of the year
ted stands inside talking on the phone
as the camera dollies in closer he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment section of the new york times which is filled with listings he has circled and
crosses off one
he goes on to the next takes a dime from the stack on the shelf in front of him and starts to dial
who stands at the sink doing the last of the dishes
a dishtowel is tucked into his belt serving as an apron
hold on him as we hear sound effect the phone ringing
ted wipes his hands picks up the phone
from the phone mr
please hold for mr
then a moment later ted
theyve set the court date
i just heard today
checking his notes january sixth
despair oh christ
john theres some thing i ought to tell you
ah situation has
i lost my job
there is a long pause too long
thoughtfully ted i wont lie to you we dont have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if youre out of work
ted doubles over the phone like he has been hit in the stomach
softly but with real feeling good christ joanna just get the hell out of my life
are you there
trying to make himself believe it dont worry
i plan to have something within twenty four hours john
amazed how the hell are you going to do that
grim i dont know
the same young man sits across the desk from ted
smirk mis ter kramer as i mentioned yesterday this is a very bad time of year to look for work
now im sure well have something for you by mid february march at the latest
leaning forward impatient
i need a job now
the interviewer gives ted a weary look
then he starts to flip through the card file
going through the motions no
finally he pauses at one card pulls it out
doubtfully there might be something at j
shaking his head i dont think theyre really serious
the positions been open for two months and
shrugs they may just be on a fishing expedition
cheerful im sure youll be much happier if you wait until after the first checking his watch call up the people at j
set up an appointment at four
politeness strained almost to the breaking point mis ter kramer its
checking his watch almost four now
its the friday before christmas
nobody is going to want to leaning forward tough as nails either you call and set up the appointment or ill call
and if i call you lose the commission
arch my we are a hot shot arent we
ted is already on his feet and halfway out the door
you bet your ass
it is dark outside and the lights are on in the office
from beyond the door we can hear the sounds of a christmas office party in full swing
the advertising manager
a balding man in his mid forties he wears a suit complete with vest
at the moment he sits behind his desk listening to teds spiel from time to time he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him
ackerman as you can see from my resume my experience in setting up the leisure package concept means that ive spent a lot of time working along the same lines
as your multiple buys and your regional advertising ideas
i know the pitfalls but and this is more important i know the potential revenue for the company inherent in these programs
as he finishes
he sits back pleased with himself
kramer i must say this has been very impressive
id like to think about it and get back to you
leaning forward mr
ackerman is there anyone else that i should see before you come to a decision
spencer our advertising director
no time to waste could i see him right away
taken aback im sorry but hes leaving this evening for a two week vacation
ill set up something the moment he gets back
he gets to his feet starts to shake teds hand ready to end the interview
id like to see him now before he leaves
kramer i dont think means it i want this position very much
ackerman gives ted a long considered look then wait here
he turns and goes out the door
the large room is crowded with secretaries junior executives researchers editors ad men etc
they all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on
the camera tracks with ackerman as he steps out of his office closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to mr
spencer the advertising director
at the moment spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman
ackerman approaches him whispers something in his ear
spencer shakes his head and points to his watch
ackerman says something else and finally with a look of weary resignation spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows ackerman back to his office
the camera follows them
as ackerman opens the door to his office the camera is angled so that we can see past them into the office where ted stands waiting
as they enter mr
not wasting any time so youre the go getter
all right youve got ten minutes
as the door closes behind them blocking our view the camera pans up to a clock over the door
it reads five fifteen
which now reads five twenty two
the camera pulls back to reveal spencer now sitting in ackermans chair his feet on ackermans desk
ted has just finished his pitch
sipping his drink thats very interesting mr
i must say its very interesting
let me think about it
ill let jack
indicating ackerman know and hell get in touch with you
spencer gets to his feet starts to retrieve his coat
as he decides to take a gamble
excuse me i believe you said i had ten minutes
almost at the door looking around
checking his watch
that means ive got two minutes left
i understand youre paying twenty five
a deep breath then a real huckster all right ill tell you what im gonna do ill take the job at twenty two five
now thats twenty five hundred less than youre offering
the only thing is you have to say yes right now
not next week
not after the holidays
its worth it to me for a yes right now and ill take twenty five hundred less
there is a long beat of silence as spencer and ackerman look at one another
they were clearly not prepared for this
watching them today only
one day only
twenty two five
kramer can we talk privately for a moment
as he steps out of ackermans office sits down
now all of the fear all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up
what if he pushed too hard
what will he do if he doesnt get a job
if ted kramer could fall to his knees and pray he would
that swirls around him
we notice in particular one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men
she is wearing a dress with straps one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape
finally the door to ackermans office opens and he steps out
ted jumps to his feet starts into the office
he looks at ted carefully for a long time then grins welcome aboard mr
there is an instant of relief then with astounding cool well gentlemen im pleased to be with you
as they shake hands say their good byes
the camera tracks with ted as he makes his way through the christmas party that is still going strong
then suddenly as he passes the very pretty woman we noticed earlier he turns and kisses her
as a look passes between them a sudden chemistry something we have not seen in ted before
steps back from the astounded girl grins merry christmas
as it pulls to a stop the doors open and along with the usual flood of mothers and children we see ted and billy
the camera tracks with them as they walk to school
billy is talking a mile a minute describing in minute detail the plot of an episode of i dream of jeannie
ted listens intently then almost involuntarily he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the coffee shop
there standing in the window watching is joanna
as they continue to walk
teds eyes remain on joanna
as they reach the door to the school ted looks at his son
kissing billy goodbye youre a terrific kid billy kramer
he stands watching as billy rushes off into the building
then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of the coffee shop
this time there is no one there
hold for a beat as we hear off screen sound a telephone ringing
then a moment later hello
john shaunessy here
i just got a call from your wifes lawyer
she wants to see the kid
ted kramer the phone cradled against his ear is cleaning up the remains of one of billys attempts to make the perfect peanut butter sandwich
she wants what
hes been through this a million times shes the mother
that means shes within her legal rights
agitated john what if she kidnaps him
ive heard all these the patience of a saint look ted i dont honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if
she was planning on kidnapping him
doubtful i dont know john
i mean to be brutally honest im not so sure what kind of mental shape joannas in right now
yknow she admitted she was seeing a shrink
a flicker of interest you ever see her talk to the walls
no but then you dont have a choice
have billy at the seventy fifth street entrance to central park saturday at ten
tracking in front of them as they walk along the central park side of fifth ave
from their attitude it is clear that each of them for their own reasons is very nervous
about half a block away joanna paces back and forth
she hasnt seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are
ted stops turns to billy and gives him a last minute check
then spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief spits on it and wipes the childs chin
now satisfied he takes billys hand and they continue
suddenly as he spots his mother
as she turns spots billy starts to run
tracking with him as he lets go of teds hand and starts to run flat out toward his mother
she kneels opens her arms wide for him and he goes barreling into her almost knocking her down from the impact
somewhere between laughter and tears oh billy
oh my billy
oh my son
joanna gets to her feet and takes billys hand
to ted but looking at billy ill have him back at six
and they start off in the opposite direction
realizing that billy has not said good bye has not looked at him once
ted stands helpless watching them leave
ted now almost lost from view on the crowded street still hasnt moved
ted and phyllis getting ready to go to bed
they look like a couple that has been married at least five years
ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt
phyllis is getting undressed also hanging things in the closet putting things away in drawers
but as ted continues to talk she watches him apprehensively it is clear that something is wrong
he has become an armchair lawyer so naturally you assume that since joanna left that would be a compelling point against her right
but it doesnt work that way
a major decision was handed down by the appellate court in in the case of haskins vs
kramer now in haskins vs
haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby
theres something i ought to tell you
ive been offered a job in washington with h
he stops what he is doing turns to her
a deep breath im going to take it
he sits down on the bed
its a very good job too good to pass up
ill be handling funding for the whole
she stops sits beside him on the bed look i
she means love like you a lot
she means love like me okay
maybe if it was a year from now maybe things would be different
quiet but its not a year from now is it
she shakes her head then reaches out and touches him
ill miss you kramer
it is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman a bit overweight and very serious
this is dr
alvarez the court appointed psychiatrist
alvarez judge atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet
wont you come in
alvarez enters the apartment
ted helps her off with her coat
where is the child
hes in his room playing
ill see him in there
as ted carries her coat to the closet dr
alvarez walks into the living room looks around
kramer do you ever have sex in here with anyone
doctor i attempt to conduct my social life discreetly
at the moment i am seeing no one
does that distress you
the prospect of losing my child
makes some notes then very well id like to see him if i may
they cross to the door of billys room
ted opens it
the room is a mess blocks are stacked everywhere
billy sits in the middle playing with his toys
they stand in the doorway
this is dr
she would like to talk to you
looking up from his toys sure
there is an awkward pause as ted remains in the doorway
pointedly id like to talk to billy privately
embarrassed at being caught oh yeah
reluctantly ted leaves closing the door behind him
the camera tracks with him as he crosses the living room to the couch where he has a stack of legal books and a number of note pads spread out
he is obviously continuing his legal education
what do you have here billy
have you ever been to detroit
but ive been to brooklyn
i see you have people there
what are their names
and this ones thelma and thats mrs
willewska and this is daddy and thats batman and over there is robin
what about your mommy
here this can be mommy
do you like to be with your mommy
ted by now has given up all pretense of working
he wags his pencil in the direction of the door
the defense attorney objection
youre leading the witness
what do you like best about her
lunch in a restaurant
what do you like best about your daddy
tell me does your daddy ever hit you
he starts to get up
lots of times
this brings ted all the way to his feet
he starts across the living room headed for the door to billys room
interested when does he hit you
ted has his hand on the doorknob about to enter
he hits me on the planet kriptarium when i steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory
in real life when does he hit you
laughing my daddy doesnt hit me silly
why would my daddy hit me
it is a saturday afternoon
hold for a beat as we see ted kramer and billy approaching
billy is talking a mile a minute
ted listens intently absorbed in the boys description
as they turn into the entrance of the office building a long corridor with desks for secretaries lined up next to doors leading to smaller individual offices
as they approach a door in the foreground that bears a small sign reading ted kramer interrupting billy who is still in the middle of his story see
thats my name
looking at the sign its my name too
as he opens the door it is a pleasant enough office but nothing spectacular windows that look out over fifty seventh street simple formica furniture that sort of thing
as they enter
he stops dead in his tracks at the sight of the office wow
pleased you like it
billy crosses to the window presses his nose to the glass looks out
is this really where you work
ted nods walks over to the desk and begins collecting paperwork to do over the weekend
as he does billy goes through the office sitting in every chair looking in every drawer
is this really your desk
is that really your chair
can i sit in it
billy plops himself down in teds chair swivels around
did mommy ever see this
no she never did
are you going to get remarried
i dont know
i hadnt thought much about it
are you going to remarried phyllis
shaking his head no
there is a long pause then will you and mommy get remarried
ted stops what he is doing looks across at billy no son
daddy and mommy will never get remarried
looking around teds office boy i bet you if mommy ever saw this shed remarried you
as it rings the camera pans across and we see joanna sitting in bed wide awake smoking
as she puts out the cigarette she has been smoking and starts to get out of bed who stands with a cup of coffee in his hands looking out the
window but not seeing anything
hold for a beat then he checks his watch and starts for the bedroom
as she selects a very conservative suit from her closet
as ted now fully dressed wearing a dark blue suit white shirt conservative tie leans over billy and wakes him
joanna sits across from her lawyer as he talks to her intently giving her last minute instructions
taking billy to school
they stop at the entrance ted kisses his son good bye and stands for a moment watching as the boy runs into the building
it is a bleak january morning the streets around the courthouse are mobbed with people on their way to work
we see ted kramer a tiny figure among hundreds coming out of the subway
he crosses the street and starts up the steps of the large and forbidding courthouse
as ted gets off the elevator and starts down the corridor toward the courtroom
in the f
standing by the door of the courtroom itself is john shaunessy he greets ted they shake hands and talk together for a moment
then as they enter the courtroom as ted enters looks around
willewska sits in one of the back rows wearing her best easter hat
ted pauses by her thanks her for coming
several rows in front of her is thelma
ted crosses to her they talk quietly between themselves for a few moments
then ted moves on to a table at the front of the room where john shaunessy waits
as they swing open and joanna along with her lawyer a mr
the camera pans with them as they walk to the front of the room and take their seats at the table opposite ted and his lawyer
the third circuit court of the state of new york judge atkins presiding is now in session
as the judge enters takes his seat
opening business of the court
as gressen joannas lawyer gets to his feet
as our first witness i would like to call joanna kramer
the lawyer leans across to ted
stage whisper real direct
theyre going right for the throat
as joanna gets to her feet crosses to the witness stand and is sworn in
note throughout the following we continually cross cut to ted kramer leaning forward listening intently
it becomes evident that in spite of himself there are moments he feels great compassion for joanna
now then mrs
kramer would you tell the court how long you were married
and would you describe those years as happy
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult
kramer did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex husband
no i did not
did you wish to
i tried to talk to ted my ex husband about it but he wouldnt listen
he refuses to discuss it in any serious way
i remember one time he said i probably couldnt get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for billy
tell me mrs
kramer are you employed at the present time
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer
and what is your present salary
i make thirty one thousand dollars a year
switching tactics mrs
kramer do you love your child
and yet you chose to leave him
there is a long pause then speaking carefully with great thought yes
look during the last five years we were married i had
i was getting more and more
unhappy more and more frustrated
i needed to talk to somebody
i needed to find out if it was me if i was going crazy or what
but every time i turned to ted my ex husband he couldnt handle it
he became very
i dont know very threatened
i mean whenever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack
anyway we became more and more separate
more and more isolated from one another
finally i had no other choice i had to leave
and because of my ex husbands attitude his unwillingness to deal with my feelings i had come to have almost no self esteem
with feeling at the time i left i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me that my son would be better off without me
it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasnt a terrible person
and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that didnt make me unfit to be a mother
to the judge your honor i would like to place in evidence a report on mrs
kramers therapy by her therapist dr
elinore freedman of la jolla california
and with that he hands both the judge and shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers
then turning his attention back to joanna mr
kramer why did you set up residence in new york
because my son is here
and his father is here
as a mother i dont want my child to be separated from his father
kramer can you tell the court why you are asking for custody
there is a pause then because hes my child
because i love him
i know i left my son i know thats a terrible thing to do
believe me i have to live with that every day of my life
but just because im a woman dont i have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man
dont i have a right to a life of my own
is that so awful
is my pain any less just because im a woman
are my feelings any cheaper
i left my child i know there is no excuse for that
but since then i have gotten help
i have worked hard to become a whole human being
i dont think i should be punished for that
i dont think my son should be punished for that
billys only six
he needs me
im not saying he doesnt need his father but he needs me more
im his mother
there is a beat of silence then thank you mrs
i have no further questions
as he stands collects his papers from the table and taking his own sweet time crosses to joanna
now then mrs
kramer you said you were married seven years
is that correct
in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way
did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way
would you describe your husband as an alcoholic
a heavy drinker
was he unfaithful
did he ever fail to provide for you
wry smile well i can certainly understand why you left him
switching his line of questioning how long do you plan to live in new york mrs
note during the early part of shaunessys cross examination joanna has been very forthright very sure of herself
now as he starts getting tougher she begins to falter
smiles like a shark smiles mrs
kramer how many boy friends have you had permanently
her head snaps back as though shes been hit
i dont recall
boring in how many lovers have you had permanently
looks toward gressen for help i dont recall
more than three less than thirty three permanently
he is again on his feet outraged
the witness will answer please
almost a whisper somewhere in between
do you have a lover now
to the judge your honor i would request a direct answer to a direct question
does she have a lover
ill allow that
the witness will answer please
in a whisper yes
by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled i
i dont know
then we dont really know do we when you say permanently if youre planning to remain in new york or even to keep the child for that matter since youve
never really done anything in your life that was continuing stable that could be regarded as permanent
gressen jumps to his feet
i must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness
a new attack mrs
kramer how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult
red in the face objection
ill ask it another way
what was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life other than parents and girlfriends
i guess id have to say
with my child
wonder irony whom youve seen twice in a year
kramer your ex husband wasnt he the longest personal relationship in your life
reluctantly i suppose
would you speak up mrs
i couldnt hear you
how long was that
we were married two years before the baby
and then four very difficult years
so you were a failure at the longest most important relationship in your life
i was not a failure
what do you call it then a success
the marriage ended in divorce
so angry she forgets her cool i consider it less my failure than his
seizes on this congratulations mrs
you have just rewritten matrimonial law
you were both divorced mrs
on his feet objection
to the judge your honor id like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at
to joanna mrs
kramer were you a failure at the longest most important personal relationship in your life
who sits silently
please answer the question mrs
whisper it did not succeed
suddenly fierce not it
not it mrs
were you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your life
barely audible yes
shaunessy smiles turns his back on joanna and walks back toward the respondents table
no further questions
as shaunessy sits down next to ted
leaning over in a whisper jesus christ
did you have to be so rough on her
tough do you want the kid or dont you
shaken she gets down from the witness stand crosses to the petitioners table without looking at ted
she sits leans across to her lawyer and whispers something in his ear
as he nods
who sits in the witness stand
at the moment he is being examined by gressen
now then mr
oconnor how long did ted kramer work for you
eight almost nine years
and did you have a close personal relationship
in a whisper yes
and how did you find his work
it was good
he was a hard worker a lot of drive a real hustler
and yet you fired him
there is a long pause
looking down ted was a good worker
after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own things started to change
look i know he had problems i understand that
ive got problems everybodys got problems
but ive got a shop to run i cant let that kind of thing get in the way
quietly i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office
i have no further questions
shaunessy stands up
oconnor does the agency still have the fire and ice account
up tight no
oconnor can you tell me where you are employed at the moment
stiff at the moment i am unemployed
if the petitioner has no further witnesses we will hear the respondent tomorrow morning at
ted sits at the dining table poring over law books writing copious notes on a legal pad
billy sits across from him drawing in a pad with magic markers
hold for a beat as billy looks up at his father
it is clear that something is bothering him
mom i mean dad
not looking up uh huh
what did you do when you were little
still involved in his books i guess about the same kind of things you do
did you watch i dream of jeannie
distracted uh uh
we didnt have television then
he finds this hard to believe
you didnt have t
he looks up for the first time smiles
it hadnt been invented yet
he starts to go back to work
this is serious business was there apple juice when you were little
yeah there was apple juice
was there burger king
there was no such a thing as burger king
what else wasnt there
he takes a long look at his son then closes the law book puts his notes away
well lets see
there wasnt mcdonalds
and there wasnt astronauts
and there wasnt frozen yogurt
and there wasnt
as he continues on about what wasnt we she sits in the witness stand being examined by shaunessy
from her attitude it is clear that she is very wrought up that all of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on her
phillips how long have you known ted kramer
ever since ted and joanna moved into the building
how often do you see mr
kramer and his son
to the judge by way of explanation charley my husband and i are
divorced and kim thats our daughter is about billys age and the children play together a lot
so i guess we see each three or four times a week
can you describe the relationship between mr
kramer and his son
its just beautiful
they have a beautiful relationship
getting wearily to his feet
patronizing objection your honor
the answer is to be generous very vague
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr
kramers care of his child
fighting a losing battle with her emotions ted mr
kramer spends a great deal of time with his child
i dont just mean hours i mean good time involved time
he reads to billy
they play together
they talk all the time
tears start he is a very
devoted father and
she turns to joanna and joanna if you ever saw them together
there wouldnt be a trial at all
she breaks down weeping oh shit
note during this we cross cut to joanna who sits staring at her friend shaken
gently no further questions
thank you mrs
without looking up from his notes no questions
thelma leaves the stand and walks back to her seat
sitting in the witness stand
kramer would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child
speaking quietly when joanna to the judge correcting himself my ex wife when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage
well i guess most of what she said was probably true
there were a lot of things i didnt understand a lot of things i would do different if i could
just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change
but we cant
some things once they are done cant be undone
joanna says she loves billy
i believe she does
so do i
but the way it was explained to me thats not the issue
the only thing thats supposed to matter here is whats best for billy
when joanna said why shouldnt a woman have the same ambitions as a man i suppose shes right
but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex
i guess ive had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent constancy patience understanding
where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman
billy has a home with me ive tried to make it the best i could
its not perfect
im not a perfect parent
unconsciously echoing something joanna said earlier i dont have enough patience
sometimes i forget hes just a little kid
but i love him
more than anything in this world i love him
thank you mr
no further questions
as he gets up from the petitioners table and crosses to the witness stand
hard lining it mr
kramer by any chance have you ever had a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next room
pointedly so do i
switching to another line of attack mr
kramer isnt it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago
not losing his cool technically the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go
i was one of them
snotty you were fired correct
yes but im with j
walter thompson now
i dont think that will happen again
snide give them time
objection your honor
counsel is harassing the witness
to the judge pettish your honor im only examining the mans employment record
he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job
he is thoughtful for a moment like a man trying to decide whether or not to drop the bomb
then turning back to ted very tough mr
kramer did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care
he looks across at joanna
joanna looks away
boring in mr
kramer did you or did you not tell the childs mother that you were responsible for the injury that permanently disfigured your child
shaunessy is on his feet racing toward the bench
your honor counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings
to the judge while the child was in the care of the witness he cut his face badly and is now scarred
to gressen are you introducing the question of negligence here counselor
yes your honor
well youll have to do better than that
do you have any affidavits to support negligence
i do not your honor however this is an isolated incident counselor unless you can prove otherwise
back to ted does the witness deny the injury took place
before ted can say anything no counselor im going to over rule you on this line of questioning
then i have concluded my questions
joanna sits still not looking at ted
she holds her face one hand shielding her eyes
as he makes his closing statement
shaunessy and ted stand talking reviewing the case
then the two men shake hands the lawyer waves goodbye turns and starts back into the building
the camera pans with ted as he walks toward the main exit
as he comes out of the building starts down the steps
he stops turns there standing waiting for him is joanna
his face a mask of cold anger
she crosses to him
i just mentioned it in passing
i never thought hed use it
sarcastic yeah well he did didnt he
i never would have brought it up if i thought im not interested joanna
as he turns and walks away from her leaving her standing watching him as he disappears
it is a bleak winters day
the camera tracks with them as they walk along ted carrying a bag of groceries thelma with cleaning
the children run around them playing
you heard anything yet
shakes his head any day
they walk in silence for several beats each clearly lost in their own thoughts
preoccupied uh huh
this is hard to say ah charley and i are
well were thinking about
i mean actually were sort of talking about maybe getting back together
thunderstruck you and charley
conflicting emotions hey thats terrific
i said maybe
apologizing for her good fortune what i mean is ah
i dont think itll really work out but charley seems to want it so
she leaves the sentence unfinished
they walk in silence for several more steps
then she takes his hand
cant help grinning oh god
ted i am really scared
they walk in silence for a beat then ted looks off screen spots something the saturday father restless bored walking with his daughter who is also bored
it is clear that they have nothing to say to one another
he looks around spots ted waves and starts in his direction
he reacts as though he has seen a vision of his own death
to thelma urgent cmon
to billy and kim billy kim
as ted ushers them across the street away from the saturday father
a crowded rather posh watering spot
shaunessy sits alone at a table for two a drink in front of him
as ted enters spots shaunessy and starts in his direction
as ted sits down
as he looks up at ted says nothing
he realizes that they have lost
the judge went for motherhood straight down the line
i lost him
i lost him
i cant tell you how sorry i am
reading from a piece of paper ordered adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child effective monday the rd of january
that the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child four hundred dollars each month
that the father shall have the following rights of visitation every other weekend one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the childs vacation period
looks up at ted thats it
grim what if i fight it
matter of factly we can appeal but i cant guarantee anything
determined ill take my chances
its going to cost
his mind is made up dont worry
ill get the money
there is a beat of silence then ive got to tell you something ted
this time itll be billy that pays
this time ill have to put him on the stand
as his last hope goes crashing to the ground
oh christ no
i cant do that
he looks up at the lawyer in despair excuse me
that is all ted can manage to say
he gets to his feet and rushes for the door
willewska comes out
her eyes are red from crying
the camera pans with her as she turns up the street on her way to pick up billy from school
the camera holds in position as she meets thelma
they stand talking for a moment then thelma turns and starts to run toward the building
they open and thelma steps out
she runs to the door begins to knock
calling out ted
there is a beat of silence then very quiet please go away thel
i just have to be by myself for a little while
ted i just heard
thelma leans against the door and begins to sob
oh ted im so sorry
willewska brings billy back from school
it opens and billy and mrs
billy sees ted and rushes across to him
youre home early
did you get fired again
laughing in spite of himself no son i didnt get fired
fake cheerful ill tell you what well do okay
how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little t
and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow
just you and me
how bout that
hold for a beat then he sits at the dining table a typewriter in front of him
as he begins to type hunt and peck system we the page in the typewriter
we see and hear at the same time
this is by way of introducing william kramer
he is a sweet child as you will see
he is allergic to grape juice but will more than make up for the loss in apple juice
he is also allergic to peanut butter from the health food store but not from the supermarket
dont ask me why
as ted mails the letter
at times in the night he will have nightmares one particular monster is called the face
the face as best as i can determine looks like a circus clown without a body and from what the pediatrician says and what i have read may be sexual
fear of losing his penis or a fear of his own anger or just a circus clown he saw once
as a sack of mail is loaded into a truck
his doctor by the way is still ed davies
the sundafed is for colds one tablespoon every four hours
i will pack it in the blue suitcase
a postman enters the building carrying a bag of mail
his best stories have been babar and winnie the pooh up to now with batman moving up
his housekeeper has been etta willewska and she is the main reason for the note
she is a loving woman conscientious very concerned about billy and more important billy cares about her
as it is dropped in front of a doorway
we see that the letter from ted to joanna is on top
i urge you to retain her
her number is and i think she will take the job if it is offered
im sure other things will come up
ask me what you need to and i guess eventually well talk
as she finishes reading the letter
thats all i can think of except to repeat what i said before hes a terrific kid
im grateful for the time weve had together and i feel i am a better man because of my son
it is a clear cold beautiful winters day
ted and billy walk along the beach at the edge of the water
the camera tracks with them
there are several beats of silence as ted tries to think of how to begin
finally billy sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced theres a discussion about who the child should live with the mother or the father
now there is a man who is very wise
hes called a judge
and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with
why does he decide
well thats what he does
hes a very powerful man
like a principal
bigger than a principal
the judge sits in robes in a big chair
the judge has thought a lot about us about you and me and your mom and he has decided
a deep breath he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment
fake cheerful and im very lucky
because even though youll live with your mom joanna ill get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month
i dont understand daddy
trying very hard not to cry what dont you understand pal
where will my bed be where will i sleep
at your moms
shell have a bed for you in your own room
where will my toys be
ill send your toys there and im sure youll get some new ones
who will read me my stories
worried daddy what if the face comes when im at mommys
your mom knows all about the face okay
dont worry shell tell the face to beat it
will you come and say good night to me every night
suddenly ted cant stand it any longer
look its getting cold
why dont you go inside where its warm
ill be along in a minute
billy hangs back watching ted
go on scoot
the boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house
then he stops turns back to look once more at his father
ted stands at the oceans edge his back to camera weeping
it is early monday morning
they stand side by side like a surgeon and his assistant
spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings of french toast
the following is done with great efficiency in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the same ritual
they work in silence except for an occasional command
each concentrating on this last moment of closeness each doing his best to avoid thinking about billys departure
finally looking at his father trying to memorize the older mans face
ted turns sees his son watching him
with false gaiety hey
whats doin with that bread
lets see a little hustle around here
billys bags are packed and stacked neatly in the living room
nearby billy and his father sit silent waiting
sound effect the intercom from the lobby buzzes
ted looks at his son smiles
the boy smiles back
this is it pal
billy fighting back tears nods
sound effect the intercom buzzes again
ted gets to his feet and starts toward the foyer
as ted picks up the intercom yes
ted its joanna
can you meet me in the lobby
and she hangs up before he can answer
willewska in the kitchen ill be back in a minute
as they open ted steps out looks around
the lobby is dark the only light coming from the window
joanna sits off to one side wearing sunglasses
she looks up as ted approaches a small smile on her face
abrupt okay im here
now why did you ted do you love him
what the insistent ted do you love him
i love him too
i dont think i ever knew how much until now
there is a long pause as she looks at ted unable to speak
finally a deep breath then ted when we got married it was because i was twenty seven years old and i thought i should get married and
when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby
and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and joanna what the hell is urgent please
please dont stop me
this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do
struck by the urgency in her voice
after i left
when i was in california i began to think what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child
it got to where i couldnt tell anybody about billy i couldnt stand that look in their faces when i said he wasnt living with me
finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved
and i did
and i won
it was just another should
she begins to break down sitting in that courtroom
hearing everything you did everything you went through
i guess it doesnt matter how much i love him or how much you love him
i guess its like you said the only thing that counts is whats best for billy
i dont know maybe thats all love is anyway
ted i think billy should stay with you
she reaches out takes his hand hes already got one mother he doesnt need two
her last ounce of reserve crumbles i wont fight you for him any more
oh my god
only can i still see him
no more waiting in coffee shops
joannas last ounce of reserve crumbles she begins to sob
ted puts his arms around her and holds her
they do not kiss
then after a few moments she steps back
chin high okay
i think ill go talk to my son now
wiping her eyes how do i look
they step into the elevator and as the doors close blocking them from view we
tracking just in front of them as they walk to the park
they are deep in conversation although we are too far away to bear what they are saying
hold on them and as they reach the entrance to the park billy first then ted begin to run overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive of being together
as they continue to run the camera pulls back and up and we see that they are only two among thousands of parents and children in central park on a
the camera continues to pull back until they are lost from view and it is
