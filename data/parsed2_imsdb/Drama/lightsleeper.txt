john letour well groomed khaki slacks leather jacket tippet like scarf belt pouch beatle boots a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows new york day night watching listening
rarely speaking nonexistent seen only by those he sees
his face an affable blank
make of it what you will
the eyes flicker the hands shift discreetly
a map of calculation
once he had a drug problem
life turned a page
today he follows instructions he sleeps light one eye open anticipating

loner voyeur has been drifting toward an unknown destination
at mid life the destination draws near
the circle tightens
the dealer is anxious
the destination is love
credit sequence new york by night
john letour nestles in back of a blue car service sedan face reflected in the window
neon mixes with steam street people with tourists young dates each with a different agenda a hidden purpose
his beeper goes off
he clicks it checks the digital message
the driver stops at an uptown corner
letour opens the curbside door motions to the driver hell be back in ten minutes
he enters the video laundromat a twenty four hour video rental laundromat tanning salon
inside he meets a retro yuppie j
crew division in the classics section
on the sidewalk money is exchanged for a packet
letour pockets the uncounted cash
the yuppie mouths goodbye eager to put distance between him and letour
john checks his beeper stops at a pay phone dials
john letour re enters the sedan the driver heads downtown
high rises give way to tudor city
uncollected trash lines the curbs
letour eyes a pedestrian pedestrian looks back
the streets are dark
letours car passes a glowing korean market
letour narrates from diary voice over labor day weekend
some time for a sanitation strike
everybody crazy to stock up
they decide to score at the last minute and want it now
the faces look alike
you gotta use memory tricks each has some peculiarity it keeps you sharp
told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary its time to quit
i started writing after that
not every night now and then
just to burn off the night
fill up one book throw it out start another
the sedan drives on
letours sedan drops him off near a ten story west s apartment building
john gives the driver a forty dollar tip standard procedure turns the corner
he presses the intercom a buzzer unlocks the door
he enters the lobby walks past english reproduction furniture toward the elevators
presses the button
penthouse c door opens
ann lets john in with a smile
ann forty four striking in a tailored dress greets him with a wet kiss
her hair is coiffured her face made up
she is johns employer mentor confidante mother hen she keeps the books
her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff shes been in the drug business fifteen years
anns apartment is a jumble of sensibilities dark green walls zebra skin sofa haitian wall friezes framed magazine photos of paramahansa yogananda liz taylor the duke of windsor paintings stacked
behind an oversized urn
a bird flits in its cage
one corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business macintosh computer billboard of trade paper clippings and ads herbal samples reference books color charts
robert fifty slight waves hello as john locks the door
gay hip worn hes johns co runner
they work and eat out of anns apartment
take out tins of indian food are stacked amid crystals tarot cards glasses and vitamin bottles
no sign of drugs drug paraphernalia or money

john unzips his belt pouch walks toward the bedroom to deposit the nights earnings
twenties and tens
goddamn cash machines

letour turns to leave

laughs yeah big kiss
he throws two kisses exits
first light reflects across the hudson as letour walks west on nd street toward his chelsea apartment building
a delivery truck passes uncollected garbage
he enters a nondescript doorway
inside his studio apartment john sits at a second hand table writing in a composition book
he drinks from an eight ounce glass of white wine continues
the room has little personality anns apartment has enough for two
nails indicate where pictures once hung a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes books autobiography of a yogi the secret doctrine fashion magazines a stack of unopened cds
a futon is unrolled beneath the rooms sole decoration a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit
wine bottles chenin blanc
precious little to show for forty years
letours narration resumes as he writes voice over labor day
union movement theres a contradiction in terms
i know about long hours
its worse when im off i just walk and walk
where am i going
theres an element of providence to it all
like rolling numbers
youre walking down the street some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick up four hours ago theres an apb description out and a cop pulls
you in cause hes cold and wants to go inside they grab your stash
your numbers up

whacked his numerology on us
peers through curtain its started
the farmers almanac is based on numerology
take a coat
to robert and you clean up the product before the food delivery comes
john grabs his belt pouch heads for the closet
rain falls on letours car near an east side luxury high rise
the door opens to eddies apartment severe decor once chic now dated
eddie thirty two is a mess puffy face sweaty shirt pinched lips on a drug jag
what took so long
steps inside traffic
i need a quarter you got it
nods robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday
slurs some friends came over
how much is that
letour nods as eddie employing diminished skills counts from a roll of twenties
john looks around full ashtrays porn tapes empty vodka bottles there have been no friends
look at yourself
ive known you what like eight years

i knew your wife remember her

eddie counts as letour takes a gram from his pouch gives it to him

eddie nods one more thing
i gotta use the phone
eddie pockets the envelope as john checking his beeper walks to the phone
letour sits in an upper west side apartment as an earnest mid twentiesh man wearing undershorts snorts a hefty line offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks
continuing but if theres no god how can man conceive of him
the idea of god presupposes the existence of god
thats the ontological argument
fourteen hundred im not sure checks his watch ive got to go
gesturing let me finish
okay if the idea of god is implanted by god the sensus divinitatus the sense of the divine what is the role of human thought
not faith thought
letours mind drifts
his diary voice overlaps voice over everybody wants to talk
its like a compulsion
my philosophy is you got nothing to say dont say it
they figure you can tell a d
anything things they would never tell anyone else
of course theyre stoned to start
if i could tie together all the hours of coke talk ive heard that would be a lot of string
it was roberts idea to add twenty five dollars to home deliveries cause its such a hassle
fifty is more like it
narration continues as sedan drives through rain
a tribeca loft
letour swaps drug jargon with two n
students at an impromptu party
attractive ingenues drift by
trendy twosome blasted sways to techno rap
business done letour turns to leave
the first student grabs his shoulder cmon tour stick around

heads toward exit letours sedan heads down lexington avenue
it rains unabated
puddles glisten red taillights refract on the windshield
john rests in back a bag from enhancements beside him
pedestrians well dressed and casual desperately wave for taxis amid sacks of garbage
no use nothing for blocks
johns sedan stops for a midtown light
letour looks out the window sees a woman vainly hailing a cab
he looks again
she turns her head
he recognizes her
to driver carlos
wait a second
he leans over opens the far door calls marianne
ill give you a ride
marianne jost thirty five stylish in short black hair and long black coat steps closer looks through the rain
recognizes him john
youre getting soaked
she ducks inside slams the door
the car moves on

she fades into the rain
john watches aching
eighty third street
the sedan continues uptown
his diary lies open on the desk
letour sits clothed on the futon drinking white wine
he pages through a cheap half filled photo album
he touches snapshots s from another time john and marianne arm in arm on a florida beach marianne surprised by the camera snorting coke at a party john marianne and
ann posing smiling same party john and marianne kissing over birthday cake same party john blowing a kiss in fez airport letours narration continues over embossed card on an entry table teresa aronow psychic reading jones street new york n
voices under narration out of shot coffee

john accepts a coffee mug sits on a sofa across from teresa
sunlight falls through crocheted curtains
teresa aronow fortyish professionally young is compact demure she wears business jacket and skirt patterned blouse
nothing about her is remotely paranormal nothing except of course her aura
the other side
her voice is at the same time soothing piercing
teresas west village consultation room is startlingly mundane a bourgeois walk up
upholstered furniture tiffany objets dart framed photos of her husband and children a trip to capri
a twenties portrait of madame blavatsky above the fireplace centers the room
im not sure how this works
have you ever been to a psychic before
no but ive well ive heard about it
do you need advice

we were either scoring or coming down mostly coming down
there were good times
area out on the street laughing dancing with friends we were magical
you took off for three months without telling me and called once
thats how magical we were
you were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies i heard them all
nobody could clear a room like you john
and the friends you may have noticed turned out to be mine not yours
i envy you
a convenient memory is a gift from god
in rehab they call this euphoric recall
you only remember the highs never the lows
we were happy
i was drowning

shakes head actions have consequences so do overlap inactions
i didnt marianne smiles i meant well

she doesnt answer
he slides his hand across the table
she notices his gold and onyx ring
you bought it for me
its inscribed inside
she pushes his hand away
details open doors
ive got to find something else to do
ill believe it when i see it

john leans forward eyes open
she presses up an eyelid examines one iris the other eyes are deceiving
if i could do that i could do anything

ann and letour sit in a prominent booth power moguls confer quietly
a deferential waiter brings fresh berries retrieves empty salmon plates

the chef stops by asks if the meal was satisfactory
ann assures him it was kisses his hand
the chef nods gratified
john resumes the conversation i dont know

letour wearing tweed jacket walks down the corridor checks room numbers
a nurse passes
he stops at a room pushes the door a crack peeks inside quietly enters
inside the hospital room mrs
jost sixty five lies sedated attached to iv tubes and a respirator
flowers wreathe the bed
randi sleeps in a chair by the window
letour looks from mrs
jost to randi and back again a vibrant woman reduced to a shell
he soundlessly eases into a vacant chair
his mind goes back
randi twists fitfully in her chair
a stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill
marianne steps into the doorway stops frozen watching the tableau john randi her mother
her face is ravaged the death watch has taken its toll
letour reaches his arm touches the hospital bed
marianne tiptoes behind john
he turns stands
soft im sorry
she puts her finger to her lips
she steps closer holds him politely
his cheek nestles in her neck
they turn toward the door step into the corridor walk arm in arm as if supporting each other
after a moment i always thought my father would die first
he would die then my mother and i would reconcile
just her and me
i hated him for living
its like a joke
its not a real feeling
its like a feeling of a feeling
my old man bawling in the hospital me popping in and out of the john getting loaded
beat i miss you
she kisses him
you tried to kill me
you took ten years of my life one way or another
he kisses her i couldnt hate my mom i was too busy hating you
i thought i was just killing myself
she runs her hands under his shirt up his back
what it felt like
kisses his face what this tasted like
he slips his hands under her blouse caresses her breasts
i see you and my heart starts thumping
they kiss deeper bodies grinding
the painful present fades
a nurse approaches with wheelchair patient
she tries to pass one side of john and marianne tries the other side is blocked again
the nurse stops stares at their soap opera
sensing her glare john and marianne hands over and under each other stop look to the nurse embarrassed yet blissful
to marianne lets go
come with me
paramount hotel room vermeers lace maker dominates phillipe stark decor
letour and marianne are all over each other
the pain of the moment the pain of the past are subsumed by passion

street lights cast horizontal shadows
letour crawls over falls upon mariannes breast
she wakes up looks at john looks out the window returns to slow sad reality
marianne stands pulls on her panties
waking you need to go back
she dresses before responding this is the end

he pulls his pants on
looking for his socks he peruses mariannes personal things
