written by pedro almodovar a huge clock marks p
the clock belongs to some landmark building to be determined
immediately following the building goes dark
establishing shot of the eiffel tower lit
suddenly all the lights go out
the same thing happens with the granadas alhambra sevilles giralda tower the guggenheim at bilbao the gate of alcala
all these well known architectonic wonders turn dark abruptly
beauty that disappears suddenly beauty thats extinguished and envelops us in darkness
harry fifty years old sits as if he were waiting without hurry immobile and patient in his study next to his desk as if it were the thing keeping him
he isnt doing anything
he lets time take its course
his silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that come and go
at first we cant see who the footsteps belong to until they stop
in the living room a few meters from harry judit stops
she too is shrouded in darkness
she looks at her wristwatch the second hand moves from left to right on the watch face
judit forty eight looks younger breathes impatient
she is dressed soberly in a dignified and practical manner
she approaches a window that looks out onto the street
everything outside is also in darkness
the building in front is just a dark mass
she looks to the end of the street
almost all the buildings visible from the window are dark the gate of alcala in the background is also not lit
without turning she says to harry the door of alcala has also darkened
harry is still sitting inert absorbed by his thoughts
the whole house is in darkness only the ambient clarity of the night comes through the windows curtains drawn back
judit heads slowly toward the kitchen
on the wall there is a vitra clock to which she gives a cursory glance
she turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water
from her pocket she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in silver
she opens it
she grabs a small pink pill
she takes it
she glances once more at the stylized design of the vitra clock
the minute hand nears p
on a windowsill or on the kitchen table there is an open newspaper
the exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global warming
an international date has been convened for a five minute blackout at p
standing in the kitchen judit poised and tense looks up at the spot where the clock is
the stillness of all the elements comprising the frame make it seem like a painting
she waits until the seconds hand completes its cycle and its oclock sharp
swiftly judit powers the central electrical switchboard which is in the kitchen
the kitchen lights up the refrigerator emits its characteristic sound
the lamps in the living room also light up
low hanging lamps that make the light bounce
the house is awash in a special luminous atmosphere dense translucent with darkened zones
all the furniture is flush with the walls
there are some paintings hanging and a rug on the ground everything is of the kind of quality that denotes good personal taste
upon the lights return judit exhales a profound sigh of relief
she moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and contemplates how in the building across the way the windows begin to blink in square patterns of light
the lights return is contagious a true spectacle which ends with a blinding light that floods the screen
it will probably be a close up of the sun
that very sun enters through another window which is not that of harrys house nor that of the building across the way
it is the window of a hospital room perhaps a sign should specify that the following scene occurs fourteen years earlier the hospital is on lanzarote island in the canary
the scene occurs fourteen years earlier
the characters are the same
harry and judit
harry lies in bed his head completely bandaged
sunlight enters through the window
judit is seated on the bed
she holds his hand and pleads worried and loving mateo say something
mateo is dead
sweet and devastated dont say that
the character to whom judit refers as mateo the same one that in the previous scene we have called harry has a recent wound either on his arm or on
his hands along with his head which is completely covered by bandages
mateo and harry are the same person the difference is the fourteen years that separate them
harry in the present is fifty years old
in the time period when the flashback takes place he was thirty six
lets say that when he was thirty six harry was called mateo
the character has two names which his own voice off explains while we observe what his day to day consists of in
i always wanted to be another person to be someone beside myself
to dispose of a single identity didnt seem enough
living a single life wasnt enough for me
and half joking i came up with a pseudonym for myself harry caine an adventurer who as fate would have it became a writer
at that time i had him author all the scripts and stories that i wrote
i came up with a standard biography to fill the back flap of his books
he had been a sailor an industrial spy the doorman at a parisian cabaret a boxer a waiter and an advertisement hand double
a self made man active and attractive like an english spy vital skeptical and sarcastic
for many years mateo blanco and harry caine shared the same person me but a time came when all of a sudden i couldnt be anyone other than harry caine
i became my pseudonym
he applies lotion in front of the mirror we first see him in front of it and then doubled reflected in it
then suddenly the mirror does not reflect him
of his two identities he only has one left
just as i had planned a heterodox writer and never better stated a self made man one might even say self written man
there was only one detail i had not foreseen harry would be a blind writer
despite his fifty years and his blindness harry is a man that keeps himself in great physical shape
in the morning he places a cd in a player
by himself he selects and starts the program on a treadmill
he steps on and begins exercising
he takes a shower mateo blanco and harry caine shared the same person me but a time came when all of a sudden
the camera pans over various parts of his body under the running water dense waves of white foam slide down his skin as if it was a landscape
the hangers have braille stickers that indicate the characteristic of the clothing they hold
all the closets have sliding doors in his bedroom he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will wear
despite the fact that he cannot see himself he stands in front of a mirror
he smiles pleased with his appearance
everything in the house is rigorously ordered
all that harry needs to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch
he exits onto the street
harry traverses aided by an umbrella
the pedestrian crossing
when he reaches the opposite sidewalk the credits appear on the black and white stripes that mark the crossing
the crossway is clear of pedestrians so that only cars pass through not many and as they do they run over the letters of the credits making them disappear in
on a different stripe a new title appears and as it does it is run over and destroyed by another car
like this successively
just on the sidewalk across from where harry lives there is a news stand and next to it perhaps on the nearest corner a bar
harry buys the newspaper at the news stand
this is part of his daily routine
he greets the attendant familiarly
he has the kind of face that provokes pity
he grabs the newspaper folds it and places it under his arm
he enters the bar
he leans down somewhere on the bar table
just as soon as he sees him he is approached by his waiter friend an approachable guy somewhere in his forties who is helped by a south american waitress wearing
her makeup since the early part of the morning whom he is obviously screwing
he brings him a coffee
all of these actions are part of a daily ritual
do you want me to read you something from the newspaper
i am off on a stroll
harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of the street the passersby their different sounds and corporeal odors
the camera swirls around his head
at first he hears all the noises indistinctly mixed and then he begins to separate them
he selects one he likes the rest of the sounds of the street disappear or their volume is lowered
girls cars high heels the smells of different ethnicities
a multi racial street
harry selects an odor the body of a woman whose aroma appears and disappears harry follows it having also singled out the sound of her heels
he loses them
he finds them again
he walks self assuredly without tripping either on the urban furniture or the people
he leans lightly on his umbrella which he uses as a cane
at first glance he doesnt appear blind
he reaches a pedestrian crossing
nearby he recognizes the odor which had attracted him he follows its trace until he reaches the sidewalk
the odor emanates from a young girl just next to him waiting before the crosswalk
harry searches with the tip of the umbrella until he brushes her shoe
he excuses himself as if the contact had been inadvertent
the girl regards him
harry then takes one step forward intent on crossing the street the cars come very close to him almost running him over
a real sense of danger
the light is red for pedestrians
the girl takes him by the arm pulling him toward her frightened
alarmed watch out
you cant cross
ill tell you when
thank you very much
they make it through the crosswalk
she is not holding his arm but almost harry doesnt need it
he knows the surroundings well
they reach the other sidewalk
harry thanks her for her help the girl observes him the entire time intrigued and curious
i live nearby two blocks up would you mind coming along with me
the girl accepts delighted
tall thin attractive modern and inexpressive like a model this is what the girl is like
once at the entrance harry invites her to come up so that she can read aloud the newspaper to him
the girl checks her watch and ends up accepting
but i warn you ive never read out loud you may not like it
you will only have to browse
the same living room weve seen in sequence
there is very little light
do you mind if i turn on the light
so that i can read
its too dark in here
turn the light on
the girl turns on a table lamp
harry is sitting on a sofa and she is in front of him on an armchair
she opens the newspaper down the middle before she reads anything she directs a brief but intense glance at harry
she reads about the percentage of those in madrid who abided by the blackout that was organized in the name of global change
she turns a few pages and stops
reads as if for herself ernesto martel is dead
i know one of his granddaughters
so hes dead
you knew him
turns more pages
what are you interested in politics economy
i am interested in you
what are you like
do you mind describing yourself
the girl begins to describe herself at first a little tentative
she knows them by heart
she describes herself
the color of her eyes
how shes dressed while she traces over him with her glance when she speaks of her eyes we see his eyes when she speaks of her mouth we see his
her gaze stops at harrys crotch
harry can feel her watching him
the situation seems perfectly natural
harry approaches her he knows shes right in front of him
with his hands he places a brief caress on each of the parts the girl has just described
the eyes the hair the mouth
he lowers his hands until they fall spread on her breasts
it is as though the blind man could gaze at her with his fingers and palms
he rests his head on the girls breast pulls down her bra straps and he begins to savor her breasts delicately
harrys cell phone rings but he ignores it doesnt pick up
they make love on the sofa
the girl asks for the bathroom harry gestures with his hand in its direction
half naked with some of her clothes in her hand the girl heads for the bathroom
harry still sitting on the same sofa begins to dress and to smooth down his clothes without hurry
the doorbell rings
twice in a row
immediately following the key is inserted into the keyhole from the outside
someone is opening it
before he arrives to the foyer the door is already open
in the middle of the doorway a woman judit the same one who had been with him during the blackout of the opening sequence
harry finishes tucking his shirt barefoot
judit closes the door slowly and surveys him up and down with inquisitive eyes which he cannot see but one could say that he can guess
what are you laughing at
i am only smiling because of the way youre looking at me
the sound of a running faucet emerging from the bathroom distracts judit first the sound then the immediate appearance of the girl
both women look at each other and are surprised despite their attempt to hide it
judit appears more annoyed than surprised
after a very brief silence to harry i must go
thanks for helping me cross
judit forty eight years old seems younger is dressed in an informal and sober manner little color etc
her hair is pulled back parted in the middle her attitude is that of a guardian she puts away the key to the door while she gazes sternly at the
the girl very uncomfortable quickly vanishes
once alone annoyed and without apologizing even if it seems shes trying im sorry i thought you were alone
she helped me cross the street and i invited her in to read me the newspaper
harry you cant bring into your house the first person who helps you across the street
one of these days something awful will happen to you
sullen and ironic everything awful thats had to happen to me has
now all thats left is for me to enjoy life
judit changes the topic so that harry may also change his tone
she turns off the table lamp and she opens the window drapes that lead to the terrace
diego told me yesterday that you finished the script
i would like to add a final epilogue
it may not be necessary but id like to write it
i agreed to deliver the definitive version to the producer and director today
you will have it by tomorrow dont worry
as he speaks harry has made his way back to the sofa without the use of a cane he knows by heart the landscape of the house which he walks
through as if he could see
if anything he touches any given piece of furniture with the tip of his fingers as if to ascertain whether its still there
he walks both with ease and with the characteristic rigidity of blind people
he picks up the socks from the floor and slips them on the newspaper is open on the floor
he puts his shoes on
judit watches him for a moment and then turns toward the window
she observes how on the sidewalk across the way the girl enters the main door of the building just next to the news stand where harry buys his newspaper
from the window she can make out that its an important modeling agency
judit is still looking out the window her back to harry when she hears him say ernesto martel has died
judit turns to harry surprised but masking it with her voice
i think he was very ill
its been so long since weve spoken of him
judit nods plainly with her head
ernesto martels death doesnt bring good memories to either of them
the doorbell rings
its diego judits son who doubles as harrys typist and co scriptwriter
he is a special kid twenty five years old
baggy eyed a weary aspect but he overflows with charm
dresses as a modern kid but not obnoxiously so
he speaks delicately an attitude uncommon for someone his age
he greets his mother
you look awful
i ran here
and its monday
diego you dont have to run for me
we are not in a hurry
i am ive committed
youll have it by tonight dont worry
start thinking of the next script
some kind of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers
its what sells best
i dont know if ill know how to
i was thinking of developing a story inspired by arthur millers son
perplexed the writer who married marilyn
after marilyn he married the photographer inge morat and they had a son
he was born mentally handicapped and arthur miller hid him he doesnt even mention him in his memoirs
he never recognized him publicly
from the moment he was born he had him placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of him
despite his condition the boy was able to learn and to make an almost normal life for himself
he lived in an apartment with other friends and he found a job as a clerk in a supermarket
judit looks at him perplexed
for some reason harry has his back turned
this happens many times
and miller never saw him
continues his back turned one day miller was giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man who had been condemned to death after what was believed to be
a forced confession
among those present was his mentally handicapped son who was integrally involved with organizations that aided all sorts of disabled people
the son was very proud to finally be sharing something with his father
at the end of the conference he approached the stage and held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless to arthur miller who did not know how to
extract himself from this mentally handicapped man imagine it would not have been politically correct least of all given the situation in which miller found himself
then the stranger let go of him and told him i am your son daniel and i am very proud of you father
this was the only time father and son saw each other
judith listens affected and disoriented
she looks at her son as if she were looking for help
diego stops thumbing through a magazine in order to listen to harry and to witness his mothers reaction
she wasnt ready for harry to counter with such a shocking narrative
somewhat tense its very moving but i dont think we can write a script about arthur miller without procuring rights from the family
we change the names the story is not about the writers miserliness but about the strength of the son who survives without the least bit of rancor toward the father
who has ignored him his entire life
it is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent goodness
there arent those many good men that one can write about
judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script this is not what she had in mind but she doesnt want to come off rude
diego keeps watching them
her mother appears oddly cornered until she remembers a past comment of harrys that suits her just its a beautiful story
but years ago when you began writing again and i began selling your scripts you told me youd never write remakes sequels nor biopics
nor stories whose protagonists were film directors handicapped or blind
i remember clearly because the part of the biopics surprised me
i cant bear them
as if he had at that very moment remembered its true its true i said all that but this wouldnt exactly be a biopic
they hear the doorbell ring two or three times
for judit its the best way to escape the conversation
ill get it
diego settles on the armchair in front of his laptop
on the other side of the table sits the computer that is specially programmed for harry
diego powers his laptop
harry heads for the work table
and he sits in front of diego
diego go to the end of the document
diego obeys while we hear judit approaching the door and before she opens it someone opens it from the other side
we see the documents text a script scrolling fleetingly over diegos computer screen
at the door judit finds mariacruz the latin american maid who also has her own key to the house
she is carrying two shopping bags
judit gives her some directive about the windows the curtains the kitchen furniture the food the floors things to be dry cleaned etc
and she leaves saying goodbye to harry and diego with a simple boys im leaving
diego chooses a track that functions as background music to the three night sequences that follow although its not absolutely necessary
he works at a modern bar not very large as a d
he spends most of the time inside a small booth which only a few friends access
alex his same age enters
did you bring me the session
alex takes three cds out of his jacket
its still warm
just downloaded from the emule
ill throw it in now
you want something to drink
and you would you like a tip of crystal
i do need to sleep once in a while
at that moment harry is in front the computer a special computer sonorous set up for harry with braille signs jutting from the keyboard
he attempts to read some digital newspaper its contents can be heard spoken by a very unpleasant synthetic voice
his search produces annoying and strange sounds
harry continously makes mistakes but thats the way to do it
he manages to get into el pais the obituary section
he listens to a list
he finally finds the news of ernesto martels death
he listens to the headline
the sound of a mobile phone ringing interrupts him
its judit from her office
in front of judit on the other side of the table full of papers is the head of production and someone from the american production
they are trying to decide on the budget
from the ashtrays full of cigarettes the bottles of water and the cups of coffee one assumes that they must have been at this task for many hours
one should be able to see the layout of the shooting schedule something visual
the american production can be heard in the background
and run in parallel she greets harry
you need anything
what are you up to
harry touches the small mp much easier than to listen to the digital newspaper
he doesnt want to tell her that he is attempting to listen to ernesto martels obituary so he tells her what he will be doing next
i was going to read an alice munro story on the mp
then ill leave you
ill stop by tomorrow when i can
i have to finish the budget for the americans as soon as possible so that i can decide what to do
hangs up to the americans in english
ok we can continue tommorow
once he hangs up his mobile harry returns to his computer this is when we actually hear the biographical sketch of the deceased financier
fade to black
during the fade to black we continue to hear the biography
in voice off
ernesto martel has passed away at his residence in the countryside la berzosa
financier of chilean origin who achieved great success and notoriety due to his involvement in the financing of crucial public infrastructures in different latin american countries
a modern building in the financial district
a sign displays the name of an important financial company m
capital and the year when the action takes place
the end of the voice off is heard over the image of ernesto martel himself alive attending to a phone call while we hear the last words of his obituary
recently he had been involved in various financial scandals
he was implicated for fraud in the infamous case of bank banelco
he was married three times and had two children
the interior of ernesto martels office elegant ostentatious and decorated without concern for cost
through the windows one can witness a cosmopolitan madrid from whose soil skyscrapers begin to bud
ernesto martel almost sixty impeccable suit settles a conversation with the transportation minister
framed photographs sit on a piece of accessory furniture one of him with his two children a boy and a girl who do not resemble one another
they have different mothers
the walls are decorated by an abstract painting belonging to the avant garde group el paso
i just spoke to the transportation minister
things are in full swing
yes we are doing the caracas metro
theres a lot of money
at least five years
i am looking for a qualified company and had you in mind
of course i will serve as intermediary i have been told so by the president himself
on the same floor
fairly close to the boss office divided by modern and ample cubicles we find some of the companys employees
his secretary magdalena her diminutive is lena is speaking on the phone with a look of contained alarm
in her early thirties lena is dressed soberly almost excessively so as if she were attempting to project a maturity effectiveness and responsibility that she not yet possesses
she is a very beautiful woman on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its mark
she has a small mole slightly raised next to the seam of the lips and another one on the top edge of the nose
she could do more with her physique modernize it but this is not what she aims for
her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the american film noir brought up to date
she possesses the turbulent and at once translucent beauty of gene tierney and the bored disdain of linda darnell in fallen angels
lena is a splendid fallen angel
we cant hear what she says but judging from her reaction the content of her conversation is dramatic
her eyes flash with indignation and anger
ernesto martel calls lena his personal secretary by way of an internal line
magdalena interrupts her conversation with ill call you later as the indicator lights up announcing another call on the line
she pushes on the button corresponding to that phone call and she hears her boss voice summoning her
yes sir she responds promptly
she gets up from the table
she dries her eyes and nose with a kleenex grabs a pen and a rectangular writing block and heads to ernesto martels office
despite the fact that hes dealing in grand scale business there are few documents for him to consult on his desk
it gives the sense that for the most important part of his job grand scale speculation ernesto deals directly
he is the great intermediary without intermediaries
he invites her to take a seat
she complies without altogether controlling her nervousness professionally detached she attempts to hide the tension that the recent and truncated telephone conversation has caused her
i will dictate a letter for the minister of industry
magdalena opens her writing pad ready to write looking serious
her pen drops to the floor
are you alright
as she picks it up yes thank you
but its not true
lena looks agitated despite her efforts to hide it
why dont you tell me whats wrong
im sure i could help you
lena looks at him serious and hurt my father is very ill
this afternoon they are releasing him and i wanted to ask you if i could leave an hour early to go pick him and my mother up
whats wrong with him
stomach cancer metastasized
i am really sorry
its a hot and sunny afternoon at the end of july
lena arrives inside a taxi to the entrance of puerta de hierro hospital
on the sidewalk next to the entryway her mother awaits chubby tired defenseless and impatient shes around sixty next to her a suitcase and a huge plastic bag full of
the mother is a small town woman dignified and beaten
the shock provoked by the situation has liberated her if only momentarily from falling into desperation
through the cars window lena can see her mother on the sidewalk and her ailing father a man in his sixties very debilitated and aged sitting on a sofa in
lena tells the cab driver to wait and runs toward her mother
i cant believe they have thrown you out of the hospital like dogs
humiliated hurt yes honey yes
indignant does dr
alvaro de la torre know this
the mother gestures for them to get away from the door that way the father cannot see them
hes been the one
if he was going to operate him this week and last week and the other week
i couldnt explain on the phone
she recounts dr
de la torre called us for an appointment
i though it would be to tells us that they were finally going to operate on your father
but instead he tells us they are releasing him
in disbelief i asked him what he meant and he replied quite simple its july and i am leaving for my vacation as her story moves forward the mother relives
the same states of mind that she went through in her conversation with the doctor and i told him you are throwing us out onto the street
and he insisted without the least bit of compassion i am releasing him so that you can go home but what can i do with him at home in his
thats your problem he told me she cries do whatever you like i am leaving on vacation
he is dying
well let him die in peace at home he said to me
powerless furious it cannot be
they cant keep him for twenty days torturing him with tests in preparation for an operation and now leave him like this just because the doctor is leaving on vacation
the mother looks at her without knowing what to say
she takes a small handkerchief to her nose
have you protested
de la torre is the head surgeon
there is no one over him
lena refuses to accept the situation
the father appears through the doors of the hospital entrance exhausted
he leans down to catch his breath
with a weak voice almost inaudible he says to them did you forget about me
lena and the mother approach him almost jubilant hiding their sense of helplessness and frustration
her eyes welled up with tears she gathers her last bit of strength how could you think that dad
between the two women they help the father to the taxi that is waiting for them nearby
they put him in the car
the man can hardly walk
he is very thin his bones jut out from under his ashen skin
he walks crouched over
the taxi pulls off
you know what dr
de la torre told me before he broke the news
he is too exhausted to speak
to the mother you tell her paca
he said i am glad you are not still in the service emilio
not understanding why
because if you were still in the service after what i am going to tell you youd shoot me
lena stares completely wide eyed with amazement
he really said that
and he was smiling he thought it was funny
the taxi parks in front of a humble building in one of those outlying neighborhoods in the periphery of madrid a commuter town
children women street ambience
its like a provincial town transported to a huge city that is in the midst of merciless development
at that hour there are few people on the street
the passage between this sequence and the next happens through the doors of the car and the apartment respectively
the father exits aided by lena and the mother when the door to the taxi closes its the door to the apartment that shuts with all three characters inside the
lena locks the door from inside
its a humble and small apartment magdalena and her mother situate the man on the bed in the master bedroom in the most comfortable way possible
the decor reflects the bad taste of the era especially of that social class here and there a certain rural detail stands out
antique photographs of the grandparents
photographs of the father in his policeman uniform next to the mother
over the headboard there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a thick wooden rosary
religious images on the nighstands
attention placed on the bedspread the curtains the dresser the closet and the walls
everything is new ugly period furniture
the effect generated is of a somber kitsch
lena opens a dresser drawer on top of it sits the picture of the father in his policeman uniform with the mother
she finds a star mm pistol
she grabs it and tries its weight the mother sees her and tells her to leave the weapon in its place
perhaps at that very moment the mother is injecting the father with morphine
in the dinning hall lena hands her mother money so that she can buy food and her fathers medications
call me any time no matter what it is
the light that shines through the windows covered with curtains of an indefinite but slightly brilliant pattern begins to fade
mother and daughter kiss
while lena was at her parents apartment night fell
lena departs lost in her thoughts she cant shake off her parents situation
she shifts her eyes
she must find a solution urgently
she lights a cigarette
she looks at her wristwatch
she seems to have made a decision
she looks out the window
she finds the inter urban landscape desolating
the taxi stops in front of the building where lena lives
she exits the taxi and opens the door
lena enters her apartment
a tiny studio but charming
no sooner has she dropped all that she is carrying than she heads to the phone and makes a call
the decor is agreeable
little money but well spent
a poster of hitchcocks vertigo dominates one of the walls or a framed photochrom of kim novak in the film
there may be another film reference jean seberg and romy schneider
lena secretly is a cinephile
alternating between both spaces madame mylene is a blonde woman very dressed up older between fifty and seventy has had plastic surgery and has not renounced her womanhood
despite the quality of her attire her makeup and her jewels there is something about her appearance that is unequivocally sinister and heartless
while she speaks she has a drink and smokes a cigar
a man of professional appearance keeps her company
its the den of a high class madame
the den seems more practical than feminine
hello its severine
its been so long
im so happy to hear from you
i need money
my weekends free
i am busy during the week
ill see what i can do
may i call tonight if i find something
her tone gives it away that she wont have the slightest problem finding something for lena
ill wait for your call
the telephone rings
lena has her hair down she has put makeup on in excess
she looks more attractive but the makeup also gives her a harder edge
she covers herself with a robe
she immediately grabs the phone
she seems like a different woman worldly and nocturnal
on alert who is it
we see ernesto martel speaking on the phone in one of the living rooms of his mansion
he is dressed to go out a drink in his hand
he is alone his tone is that of a man courting a woman
i am calling on madame mylenes behalf
lena recognizes the voice there is no doubt its his
despite the shock she manages to bluff categorical and quick slightly altering her voice youve made a mistake sir
no severine lives here
ernesto martel doesnt believe her but he plays along
i must have dialed wrong
lena hangs up confused and irritated
lena dials madame mylenes number hi
has he already called
you will not complain about my speediness
how have you given him my number
i couldnt say no
things arent done like that
have you gone mad
he knows everything
and i havent been the one to tell him he found out on his own account he knows about your foray into acting and that you sometimes acted for me
lena listens furious and impotent
months ago he made me promise him that if you got back in contact with me i would call him
i couldnt say no he is one of my best clients
unmoved look on the bright side
he must really like you to go to the lengths he has
perhaps youve found your sugar daddy
lena remains in silence humiliated cornered
what have you agreed on
remember i am part of the business
lena doesnt respond
she hangs up the telephone
magdalena is sleeping in her bed
the phone wakes her
its her mother in the middle of a crying fit and panic attack
wakes up suddenly frightened how is dad
crying not well at all my dear
weve been through a hellish night
he has not eaten anything
but he wont stop bleeding
and everything is coming up
its as if he has burst inside
the mother speech falters she is very scared
i will be there with an ambulance immediately
be ready to leave
before she calls an ambulance lena calls ernesto martel
they greet each other
ernesto does not pretend to be surprised he comes across cordially
he thinks this may be the continuation of their phone call from the previous night
delighted good morning lena
i am sorry to bother you
gallantly you are never a bother
my father is dying
we must admit him urgently but i dont know where
as i told you they released him from puerta de hierro yesterday
ernesto changes his tone
now he is an all powerful man generous and with every recourse at his fingertips
we will take him to the emergency room at a private clinic
wanting to confirm you told me that he has stomach cancer
thinking the best digestive surgeon in europe is at the clinica de la luz
i will take care of the admittance issue
call an ambulance and tell them to pick up your parents
ill meet you at the clinica de la luz in an hour
plainly but grateful thank you very much
even though neither one of them mentions the phone conversation of the night before it is present on both of their minds
an ambulance traverses madrid at full speed
it arrives to the emergency ward at the clinica de la luz
they carry lenas father in a stretcher her mother alongside him
one of the hospitals hallways
the mother lena and ernesto are waiting together on a row of chairs next to a door
blasco emerges an eminent surgeon specialist
an impenetrable man he doesnt mince words
getting information from him is like pulling teeth
he is polite but not accommodating in the slightest
hows the patient
you have brought him in terrible conditions
which i suppose you know
the mother affirms with a gesture
with good manners but authoritarian will you be able to save him
we will do everything possible
at this very moment it is impossible to operate
lena and the mother look at both men anxiously
we are providing parenteral nutrition
he will need a blood transfusion
looks at both women do you have any relatives who can donate
i dont know
the mother also doesnt know what to say
give him the best blood youve got
i will keep you updated on his condition in the next hours
he says goodbye to them may i stay
yes of course
you can stay in his room as long as you wish
the mother is not accustomed to so many privileges
the doctor says goodbye to ernesto martel and the women mechanically
when the three are alone the mother thanks ernesto martel for what he has done for them
she looks at her daughter in a knowing way as if she understands and accepts what else can she do
ill stay here mom
you have to rest
with strength but beaten no you rest
youve already done enough
thank you very much mr
if my husband survives it will be thanks to you
he will survive maam
really you dont want me to stay
or that i bring you something
you both must have things to do
in effect there is something urgent she must do pay the price for all those privileges
to pay the cost of her fathers life
ernesto and lena walk to the other end of the hallway
before she enters the room the mother bids farewell to them with a look thats sad tired but of fortitude
the two figures slowly recede down the hallway until they disappear in a fade to black
the door to harrys apartment
the doorbell rings
the house is completely dark
harry moves with his characteristic naturalness
he is coming from the bathroom his hair wet and wearing a robe
he feels around until he finds the peephole
he opens it and reaches his eye toward it as if he could really see the person on the other side
he is not waiting for anyone so he hopes the visitor will think he is watching even if he cant see a thing
from inside who is it
a voice on the other side of the door responds im ray x
theres no such a name
its a nickname at one time i took a lot of ecstasy
what do you want
to write a script with you so that i can direct it
its your first film
i made a documentary naive
a very good one eighteen years ago this would be my first fiction film
call judit garcia my agent and explain everything
if she finds it suitable she will set up a date for us
and now id like to go dry myself you pulled me out of the shower and i am dripping wet
the words escape you are naked
its none of your business
ray does not move
neither does harry
they both remain still and mute on their respective sides of the door waiting for the other to do something
ray is mortified about having asked the last question
will you stand there all day
you havent given me judit garcias phone number
find it out
she is a well known production director
this time ray steps away from the door and walks toward the elevator
at another point in the day
harry plays music a cd with songs that diego has selected for him expressly he looks after the bonsai or he waters the plants while he listens to the radio
harry touches the plants as well as the bonsai delicately with the tip of his fingers
the phone rings
a young director has been in contact with me
his name is ray x and he wants to write a script with you
does this ring a bell
he is about to tell her he showed up without notice but judit doesnt give him time to
since she is always busy and in a hurry well he wants to see you this afternoon or tomorrow if you can
i have asked him for an advance and he has accepted but i cannot accompany you either today or tomorrow
i will speak to him
and let you know
good i hope you like him he seems to be loaded
have you seen him
no just judging from his voice
and from the check i am about to ask him for
i will send diego over so that youre not alone
the next morning harry wears different clothes than in the previous sequence and ray x as well
the doorbell rings
its ray x
mariacruz opens the door
harry waits for him while seated at his desk one can hear the noises his computer generates
ray x heads toward the den and introduces himself
harry stretches his hand and waits for the other man to find it and shake it
hi im ray x
they shake hands
please have a seat
please dont address me formally
perhaps the kitchen is lit and only the light from the window enters the area where the conversation is taking place
ray watches harry inquisitively
he observes everything the furniture the wall hangings and harrys own body shamelessly taking advantage of the fact that harry cannot see him
mateo senses the heat of his visitors gaze over his body
ray is thirty five years old and his physique is somewhere between freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed hard to classify thin with a beard
only when he speaks he reveals his well bred origin not excessively nor parodically just sufficiently evocative
he is excited by the very fact of being there it seems it is something he has been desiring for some time
he takes advantage of the fact that harry cannot see him in order to observe him without reserve
during the conversation harry is not always sitting
at some point he moves to look for cigarettes perhaps and remains standing
i love your work i know it from the start
i have seen all of mateo blancos films including the last one girls and suitcases
is that so
you must be the only one
at this exact moment diego enters
mariacruz opens the door for him
just in time to hear rays question
what happened to mateo blanco
why do you ask
diego goes to the kitchen
harry has heard him he knows hes there if he hasnt called him its because he doesnt need him
because he vanished from public life
it would seem that way
almost as if hed died
ironically i lost track of him some time ago
ive always been intrigued by the case of his last film
the first five are stupendous
you were the screenwriter for all of them how do you explain that the last one was a disaster
made uncomfortable by the topic films turn out well or badly
the reason is always a mystery
mateo switched genres perhaps he wasnt skilled for comedy
but tell me about the story you want to write
ray x measures his words its very important to him and he doesnt want to do so hastily
i would like to write a story about a sons revenge one against the memory of his father
why does the son desire revenge
speaking personally because the father ruined his life practically nullifying him while he lived
the father is a successful financier violent homophobic very powerful and unscrupulous
he thinks everyone has a price and thats how he behaves with people
i dont know if youve had the misfortune of meeting someone like this
harry does not allay his doubt
when you say he is powerful what kind of power are you referring to
economic with everything that entails
he is a broker of the generation of speculators that made quick high profit gains in the s he amassed a great fortune during the oil crisis
the son is sensitive with complexes and artistic preoccupations and lives under his shadow trying to please the father in everything
despite being a bit
homosexual the son marries twice just like the father and just like him he separates
he has a son that hates him just as much as he hates his own father
when the father dies the son is finally able to rebuild his life
that is his salvation and his revenge
i get it
i am afraid i am not the writer you are looking for
you are you dont know how much
harry registers what he has just heard
i will pay whatever you ask
its too personal
make it yours
i am not aiming for a biopic rather i think of it as a base from which to develop a fiction
thanks but no
he rises and now if you dont mind
he calls diego
the boy responds in that instant he was in the kitchen waiting for harry to call him
ray x will not give up so he writes his telephone number on a piece of paper and places it in his hand
there you have my phone number if you change your mind
harry is still standing with the piece of paper in his hand
diego observes both men
ray gets up
i am sure we will see each other again
in my case that would be a miracle
diego accompanies him to the door
and closes it behind him
harry opens his desks drawer and places the piece of paper with rays telephone number inside
he rummages through the drawers interior until he finds a key
he grabs it
harry and diego are now alone in the den
ruminating over ray xs visit and the story he was proposing harry
did you overhear that
im flipping out
why did he ask you if mateo had died
to provoke me
i dont know
help me find something
he points toward the drawers at the bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to open one of them look inside that drawer
diego opens the drawer with the key harry has given him
the drawer is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed in a certain order
there is a black notebook
a box with mexican handicrafts
some s postcards as well some from other decades some movie postcards some others of exotic landscapes
some of the groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes boxes or transparent binders
for diego its like looking into a treasure chest
it has been many years since that drawer has been opened
this was out of respect not from lack of curiosity diego would never do so behind harrys back
look through the pictures of the shoot
some of the photographs must have the date on it
after tossing aside various envelopes diego finds a lot of photographs of the shooting dated
he takes them out of their envelope
he shuffles through them until he pauses at one
i think this is him
the man who just left
rising describe the picture to me
its from the shoot
he looks at the box from where hes taken it
he is carrying a small camera like a super
its a mm
are you sure its him
he is now thinner and wears a beard but its him
he is talking to you
what am i saying
i dont know
he is handing you something it looks like a pack of cigarettes
its a radio microphone
he is asking me to wear it and i am refusing it
who is he
ernesto martels son
harry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts
he would have preferred to be mistaken
serious and pensive you can put them away now
diego returns the different sets of photographs to their place inside the drawer a photo appears of lenas face in close up
its the same woman who appears in sequences through
the drawer closes darkness engulfs its interior drowning lenas image soon reborn in the next sequence
out of the darkness lenas image emerges the year is a close up of the woman looking at herself in the mirror touching up her makeup
she grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts it on
a few meters away in the bedroom ernesto buttons up his fly after tucking in his shirt tail
the scene is that of a wealthy couple who get along
they are preparing to attend a concert
ernesto is a big fan of classical music
lena looks rejuvenated and more refined
her life and her facial skin have both improved since the first time we see her in martels office
the moles have disappeared from her face
her demeanor is still adult that of a young woman who has experienced life
ernesto martel frequently rests his gaze on her fascinated its hard for him to believe that such beauty belongs to him
the phone rings
ernesto senior picks up the handset
his relaxed countenance changes the second he hears the voice on the other end
its his second wife whom he divorced years ago
he treats her with disregard
i cant talk now rosanna
its about your son
i have caught him trying on my dresses
and its not the first time
its your fault you made him effeminate to humiliate me
thats not the problem the boy is very depressed ive had to take him to a psychiatrist
dont call him boy
he is already seventeen
the doctor has told me he is in need of a father figure
i think i am going to send him your way so that he can spend some time with you after all you are his father
if i havent been a good father in eighteen years i dont think i can learn to be one precisely now
how can you speak like that
have you no feelings
looks at lena intently i have them
very deep feelings they just dont include either of you
while he speaks lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to put on she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval something he gives without pausing
his phone conversation
lena makes a gesture of reproach
ernesto should not speak to his ex wife in that tone
if anything happens to him youll know whos at fault
stop blackmailing me rosanna
tell ernesto that if he wants to talk to me he should call me himself
ernesto martel senior hangs up bewildered
in reprimand dont be so harsh with them ernesto
he sips from his drink or he serves himself another one if he has already finished the first
why dont you invite your son to spend a few days here
itd be better if you didnt get involved with them lena
ernesto takes a sip from his drink
he can keep me company
does he like movies or theater
ernesto senior casts her a sideways glance
i dont know
but the mother has told me he is a bit faggot
if i ask him to come i would like for you to tell me if thats true
and whether you think theres any remedy
and how would i know
what an idea
i am not asking you to fuck him but you good looking girls can tell these things
call him but you cant count on me for the rest
ernesto approaches the telephone and dials a number
fourteen years later in the same room decorated differently more modern more colorful although it still retains some noble and timeless furniture pieces and the same layout ernesto junior we
in effect confirm that this is ray x speaks on the telephone while getting dressed to leave for a party
in that very room another man young handsome and ambitious is getting dressed in front of a piece of furniture equipped with a mirror at the very spot lena had
this piece of furniture is not the same one as the one fourteen years earlier this is a more masculine piece the other one was a type of boudoir
i am not reproaching you for our separation but that you live with a man
what will your children think
on the phone that their father is a homosexual he gazes at his handsome boyfriend and that he has very good taste
if they love me and you dont set them against me they will accept it
you should have told me before we married
if you hadnt been so exclusively concerned with my fathers fortune you might have noticed it yourself
the ex wife grumbles furiously
the beautiful boyfriend continues to dress and smiles at ernesto
another telephone rings
i have to go i have another call
s lover will it be your other ex wife
i hope not
into the headset yes
dryly its judit garcia
oh hello judit
in an amiable tone did you get the money
i dont want it
i just sent it back ernesto
she emphasizes his name
you wont call me ray
its my artistic name
what are you up to
hoping to erase my fathers name
and what does that have to do with harry
ive been wanting to see him for a long time
and its true that i want to shoot a movie and that i want him to write the script
looks at the boyfriend ive got the protagonist
the boyfriend catches the allusion
you are not a director
you should take a look at my documentary youd change your mind
ernesto forget about us
dont be afraid of me
i am not my father
do not come near harry again
if you ever stop by his house again i will report you for harassment
and she hangs up the phone
at that very moment judit is in her office with the american production team
she apologizes and attempts to recover her calm before undertaking the subject of the meeting at hand
the house is not very big but it is large enough for two people
its discretely feminine and very practical
the details indicate that an independent woman lives there as well as a young man twenty five years old
there is some detail of the decor the curtains for example that is replicated in harrys home
it is clear that judit has had a hand in setting up the writers home
judit is packing her bags she paces back and forth
she is a bit overwhelmed with multiple thoughts crossing her mind
at times she asks for diegos help
i am not at all pleased with having to scout outside madrid but the americans pay a bundle and we need money
you can leave without concerns
dont worry about me
i am also worried for harry
sounds more like an order than a request please look after him during my absence
protests i have things to do mom
i cant look after him all day
its only two weeks
harry manages perfectly on his own and right now we are not writing anything
acknowledges the reason for her worry
i am worried about ernesto juniors visit
i would like for you to be on guard in case he appears or calls and then let me know immediately
why are you so worried
judit stops what shes doing and takes a moment to take a deep breath
i dont trust him
evasive its a long story
persistent summarize it
diego please this is not the moment
it never is for you
exasperated hey if it bothers you so much to look after harry ill quit the job and stay in madrid
or ill hire someone
it doesnt bother me to look after harry
but i am tired of so much secrecy
its a civilized encounter no screaming
there is tension but it is kept under control by both of them a public park
diego and harry are walking along a straight pathway
kids dogs people jogging
it is a tranquil and pleasant place
diego is in front harry is behind him holding on to his elbow as reference but its harry who is moving faster pushing diego from his elbow
the boy shows signs of exhaustion he is wearing black sunglasses
dont go so fast
we are exercising
im just keeping you company
how can you walk so fast
i am training and i dont work at night nor do i drug myself
on guard what do you mean by that
that i take care of myself with the fanaticism of an older handicapped person
you are no fanatic
yes i am
all of us who survive a critical physical injury are
there is no other way
they exit the park
while they wait at a stop sign a billboard catches diegos attention
half of the billboard is taken up by the motto donate blood
the names of participating ambulatory hospitals and their hours appear below
harry can tell his company is distracted so he asks him what are you looking at
in huge letters it says donate blood it includes where one has to go
you want to donate blood
i was thinking that donate blood is a good title for a movie
it has a good ring
for a vampire flick
harry finds it amusing
they walk toward home
ironizing kidding improvising imagine that behind the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in ambulatory care are hiding
and they actually keep the blood they get from donors for their own consumption of course
your mother would like that story
mariacruz the latin american maid is preparing something in the kitchen
meanwhile diego and mateo gather around the table
diego sits in front of his laptop
both of the characters are improvising rapidly and become increasingly excited completing each others sentences
they are having fun as if playing a game
the sequence becomes a demonstration of the process of creating fiction based on an trivial real anecdote
they will begin the sequence by opening a document
diego writes the title in caps donate blood
the vampires would be like a type of ethnic group completely assimilated into spanish society they dont stand out
there are vampires who occupy important positions keeping it a secret like the opus dei
but even though they live in the shadows they have amassed great social and economic power
they control various industries
for example the one responsible for dark sunglasses
smiles and those that provide nightly entertainment bars discos after hours
since they dont need drugs to stay awake they are the most apt for working at night
they dont burn out
and for the sunscreen business
the poor things are very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in the ozone layer
their sunscreens are some of the best on the market
laughs and those which sell best
this is all great
diego talks and takes notes on his laptop
harry paces back and forth in front of the table like a caged animal
protected by the sunscreen they can function all day
the lotion must be as dense as armour
more inspired this is how the story could begin describes a gorgeous woman totally naked rubbing her body with a super dense lotion before heading to work at an ambulatory
her body is a velvety pale beautiful
continues what a great opening
we also need a love story
a hybrid love story between the female vampire and a normal guy
like in cat people a love story between beings of different species
she works at one of those labs where blood is donated and where they snatch it for themselves
the guy has gone to donate his or to get some tests
they like each other immediately
after the first needle prick into his vein she gets completely excited
so they start to date
but she doesnt want to turn him into a vampire
these arent proselytizing vampires they are above biting people
unless they truly need it to survive
but they must like sex right
thats one of the problems the couple desire each other desperately
but when it comes to fucking she becomes prudish
because she is afraid of losing control in her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular
when theyre horny she lets him do everything front back whatever he wants except ravaging her mouth
and her breasts
but that gets into high risk territory
when he sucks on her breasts she has to cover her mouth with a pillow which she ends up shredding with her fangs
and when she sucks his dick
no no sucking
she would tear it on the first bite
and how does he react
a man may do without kissing but its very rough not to have your cock sucked
since he is deeply in love he accepts the situation or gives up to it
once they are more comfortable with each other she wears a muzzle as security for both
because when shes turned on she has a type of dental erection her face grows into something like that of a she wolf
diego writes furiously while cracking up
i like your story very much diego
this one was your idea and youll author it
ill be your sparring partner for all the times youve done the same for me
harry is welcoming him as a writer
this fact doesnt escape the boy he feels an unexpected pride
at nights diego d
s inside a small booth
two of his friends or just acquaintances of the club scene one of them weve already seen earlier keep him company
the one we dont know friend a looks pretty loaded
he is very friendly with the other two
without acrimony stop fondling me
its the ghb
it kicks your ass
diego takes a sip of coke and whisky and sets it down somewhere inside the booth
do you want a little bit of x
referring to mdma aka ecstasy just a tip
he licks his finger and sticks its moist tip into the bag that alex offers him he takes his finger to his mouth tomorrow i have to work we are
writing a vampire script thats going to be the shit
the friend high on ghb grabs a glass of coca cola from the bartenders hands at the bar
he takes out a small container and adds a few drops of liquid ecstasy into the drink
he takes a sip and enters the booth where the other two are
he sets the glass down and begins to jump euphorically
stop already you are going to go through the roof
in between songs he is changing the tune diego grabs friend as drink
they are both drinking coca cola diegos has whisky and friend as has liquid ecstasy
distracted by changing tunes diego does not realize that he has grabbed the drink with ghb
he takes a long sip
and he falls flat to the floor
the two friends bewildered and scared attempt to revive him but to no avail
perhaps alex will exclaim holy shit hes taken a drink from your glass
why in the world did you get coca cola
didnt you notice he was drinking a jack and coke
i didnt realize
very alarmed hes unconscious
an ambulance arrives
they carry diego out unconscious from the bar on a stretcher
alex goes with him very scared
before they go into the vehicle diegos mobile phone rings
alex takes it from diegos pocket he doesnt know why he is doing so it is a hysterical reaction
on the other side of the line he hears harrys voice
im a friend
hes not well
we are taking him into the emergency room
can i talk to him
what hospital are you taking him to
the friend asks one of the ambulance employees who tells him the name of the hospital
alex repeats it for harry
who are you
i am on my way
harry gets out of a taxi
he aids himself with the typical blind mans cane
he cant find the entryway
he bumps into something
we have not yet seen him this clumsy
someone helps him enter
the same person accompanies him to the reception desk in the waiting room area
he is no longer the blind man who was walking euphorically along his streets sidewalk umbrella in hand
anxious i am here to see diego garcia
hes just been admitted
the receptionist looks through the admittances
taking into account that harry is blind she decides to call the doctor who has attended diego
shortly thereafter the doctor appears
he heads directly for harry
i am here to see diego garcia
are you immediate family
im his uncle and his godfather
your nephew is at the icu he arrived in a coma
harry reacts to the news
in a coma
but what has happened
he ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol
it is a lethal combination
his friend informed us it was a mistake
it happens sometimes kids grab the wrong glass
but diego is a very healthy boy
the doctor makes a neutral gesture of acknowledgement
barring any complications he will recover in six to twelve hours
if thats the case ill wait
go home we will call you
id rather wait
are you certain
guide me to a place where i can sit please
the doctor directs him toward an area with sofas
would you mind providing us with his parents phone number
he only has a mother and at the moment she is working outside madrid
i would prefer to call her myself
i dont want to alarm her unless he is truly in a grave condition
normally he should recuperate in a few hours
but in any case you should have a talk with him once hes better
yes of course
they arrive at a couch set ugly and lacking style harry collapses on one of the armchairs demolished
the doctor returns to work
the girl at the reception desk stares at harry who is immobile readied for a long wait
a slow fade to black
harry is still waiting this time at home sitting on a wingback chair close to the bed where diego sleeps
on the nightstand there are some medications and a glass of water next to a plastic bottle an alarm clock
and perhaps a book
through the window you can see the day beginning to break diego awakens
at first he doesnt know where he is
in the darkness of the room he discovers harrys figure sitting on the wingback chair
he cant tell if hes awake or asleep but it soothes him to know hes not alone
diego stares at him he doesnt say anything
to his surprise harry asks him how are you
diego makes a listless gesture
i dont know
did you speak with my mother
yes i told her it was something you ate
and she believed it
i dont know
she wanted to hurry back but i convinced her to continue with the location scouting
at some point youll have to call her
diego thinks about everythings thats happened
after a few seconds are you asleep
im not sleepy anymore
do you want to talk
would you like me to speak
i dont know
if youd like
i say so in order to distract you
when i was young before i got into making movies i was very good at telling stories
not sure well then
would you mind telling me why my mother is so afraid of ernesto junior
shes afraid of him
before she left she made me promise that i would remain alert in case he reappeared
she didnt explain why
she never explains anything
harry remains pensive for a moment diegos request has taken him by surprise
its a long story
judit says the same thing
how did you meet him
it is not easy to talk about
in some way it must be obvious that harry has spent many years fourteen avoiding this topic but he is determined to do anything necessary to entertain diego
diego serves himself some water and prepares to listen
we met him
in an office we had rented in preparation for my new film about fourteen years ago
the images that correspond to the past are edited more freely than the rest of the narrative
summarized and sped up by harrys voice off mixing media from diverse sources
after having written five dramas i had finally managed to write a script for a comedy or thats what i thought
i wanted to change genres
to take a risk ironic destructive and i swear i accomplished that the part about taking a risk
in everyone calls harry mateo
he is sitting behind a table filled with papers photographs books magazines an ashtray pencil and pen holders etc
at its center a script lies open with tons of notes scribbled on the margins of its pages
he is finishing the definitive version of girls and suitcases
the casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic
the only decorations on the walls here and there not following any particular symmetrical rule are postcards of painters actors or landscapes held in place by tacks
there is also a newspaper page that has caught mateos attention
or some astonishing photograph taken from a magazine
the cover of some magazine
everything without framing tacked directly onto the wall
the furniture is pastel medium shade green or red with velvet tapestry worn and outmoded
the pieces dont match but they look good together
judit enters also fourteen years younger but this is less obvious
she is a woman unmarked by the march of time
mateo is focused on the scripts pages
judit is mateos right hand man they are accomplices in everything both professionally and emotionally
a girl has stopped by
she doesnt have an appointment so there is no reason for you to see her
without much interest whats she like
too beautiful to be funny
she is ernesto martels lover the tycoon
she is here with his son
and shes an actress
if shes been with him for three years she must be
in any case go out and say hello to be polite
one must get along well with important men
you never know
mateo exits his office
in the improvised waiting area it is not a proper waiting room but a transient space turned waiting area by a couch left over from the furnishings of some previous
he finds ernesto junior in other words the character who had introduced himself as ray x fourteen years ago in his case the age difference is noticeable hes just a
he is a little heavier his hair longer he reminds us of the love struck big kid that phyllip seymour hoffman played in boogie nights
mateos gaze rests only for an instant on the young man even though the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from mateo throughout the entire sequence
ernesto junior has accompanied lena
when he sees her mateo freezes at the door to his office
lenas back is turned or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine
ernesto elbows her lena raises her head and discovers mateo watching her from the door to his office
mateos heart churns its a cinematographic churn he feels like james stewart in vertigo when he first sees kim novak at the restaurant with her famous green dress
time stops for an instant so that mateo may contemplate this womans apparition
after this brief hypnotic moment they introduce themselves forgetting ernestos presence who then since no one pays attention to him introduces himself
even though shes a bit nervous one can tell that lena is a strong and decisive woman
made up in dark tones that stand out on her pale skin
she doesnt have the aspect of a comedienne her presence is too intense she seems better suited to be the heroine of a film noir as weve said
genres and their iconographies pose no limit on mateos capacity to be attracted to her from the first instant
i am sorry we showed up like this but ive heard you are running auditions
and i would like for you to give me a try out
mateo observes her intently
she does not resemble any of the characters in the script but he no longer cares about that
at some point judit makes her appearance and gets to contemplate this scene herself displeased
i can come whatever day is convenient
youre already here
lets read something
it doesnt sound like lets read something but more like lets have a drink
they disappear through mateos office door
fade to black
over an establishing shot of the mansion one hears harrys voice off as he speaks to diego the reading didnt work out
we were both too nervous
the first meeting and the reading we did only served to make me realize that womans very presence perturbed me
great mansion with a huge green parcel of land with various trees bushes flowers
two or three dogs are running across the lawn
the plot of land must span about square meters or more
the dogs approach the camera as if it were a trespasser
alarm system etc
the main building has two levels joined by a grand staircase
all decorated by wives with the wish to be decorators aided by hired decorators
brand name furniture two or three paintings worth millions
a piano and a certain desolateness
one can tell that his previous wives have left along with a part of the furnishings
the father already knows he is missing information about something unexpected that has gone on that morning
they are at dessert
where have you been this morning
ernesto hasnt told you
i havent asked him
she hates having to account for herself
i went to see a film director
dryly for an audition
ernesto looks at her with surprise he doesnt approve of it
with less determination than she would like but enough to alarm ernesto senior i want to work
werent you going to study interior design
werent you going to redecorate the house
i thought we agreed that you would transform whats left of my two shipwrecked marriages into something more our own
call a decorator
i want to be an actress
ive always wanted to
brief pause youve already attempted it once
and look how youve ended up
lena shoots him a fulminating glance
affected thats a cheap shot
first he attacks
then he is sorry
loike any violent lover i am sorry forgive me
lena is frustrated and restless
excuse me i am retiring to my room
ernesto grabs her and then embraces her
lena remains still within his arms imprisoned and elusive the two locked in a strange posture
in any case dont worry
it didnt turn out well
i was too nervous
someone calls at the door
theres a call
its the voice of one of the hired help behind the door
mateo blanco and he says its important
yells come in
she breaks free from ernestos embrace and runs toward the door where the maid is holding the supplementary handset
avidly she grabs it from her
she listens excited
she responds only in monosyllables affirmatively
she hangs up the phone
her eyes glitter with intense happiness a feeling from which ernesto feels excluded
enthusiastically thats the film director
he says the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me once more
lena looks imploringly at ernesto senior
what are you going to do
go see him no
ernesto makes a gesture that betrays his anger and displeasure
i need to do something
and ive always wanted to be an actress
and what will become of me
they have not given me the role yet
well if i were to get it we would still see each other every day as it has been in the mornings and evenings
nothing will change except that during the day i would work just like you
why dont we get married
taken by surprise what
i am asking you to marry me
dont you think youve married and divorced enough times already
with you itd be the first
weve been living together for three years arent we fine like this
somber it doesnt seem you are
diego is better but harry prefers to keep caring for him
harry makes him breakfast
diego is sitting at the table
ernesto martel offered to produce the movie
your mother didnt want him to
she was waiting for a subsidy from the ministry and an advance sale to television but that would take months and i was suddenly in a great hurry to begin
part of the voice off is edited over these images
lena is in the process of being made up coifed and dressed
this under the control of mateo blanco who does not stop speaking offering references making ironic remarks etc
all of this is seen through the lens of a mm camera
images of contrasting colors
the editing is vertiginous and doesnt at all respect continuity rules
the young ernesto junior is carrying the camera
we also see this scene from the other side of the mm frame from the point of view of the main narration which includes images of ernesto junior filming with
the mm camera
on the inside frame of the dressing room mirror there are photographs of a young shirley maclaine kate hepburn young judy holliday audrey hepburn goldie hawn in butterflies are free
or any other film where she wears her hair long with a fringe
icons of the romantic comedy of today and yesteryear
over the voices of the characters that appear on frame one hears harrys voice off
i enjoyed making her up styling her and dressing her
lena could be the shirley mclaine of the apartment and the audrey hepburn of breakfast at tiffanys or even goldie hawn
through the mm camera we can see the details of lenas mutating image how it gets constructed
it is true that she reminds us of the three actresses that harry mentions in his voice off
the members of the team assisting her hair stylist makeup artist costume designer etc
and lena herself laugh heartily when they finish setting her up with goldies blonde long hair wig with a fringe
and they stare dumbfounded when she is made up as audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffanys or sabrina
its a style that fits lena like a glove
they are all fascinated by the change except judit estranged and angered by their playfulness
for judit mateo is constructing his ideal woman
she finds all that playing around obscene and dangerous
your mother didnt like lena
judit watches lena audrey with a fatalistic stare
i on the other hand liked her a lot and she liked me
mateo manifests his enthusiasm over the changes and lena looks at him with excitement
she also feels transformed on the inside and thats thanks to mateo
ernesto junior also liked me
ernesto junior directs his camera lens toward harrys face not hiding his admiration
i was hoping to use him for my own ends
his father had asked him to make a documentary about the shooting
ernesto senior is watching the make up test the hair styling test etc
part of what we have already seen through the mm lens
the sound is chaotic many people are always speaking at once
as far as ernesto senior was concerned we observe him watching the projection uncomfortably ive never known a man more obsessed with a woman except myself
he was producing the film out of a desperate attempt to not lose lena
in the middle of this emotional quagmire we began shooting
your mother was present at every instant her face like a sergeants
end with a shot in mm of judit
images from the making of shot by ernesto junior on mm with high grain and contrast mixed with direct images from the establishing shot of what is occurring
the look of lenas character is openly inspired by the audrey hepburn of breakfast at tiffanys with sabrinas hair style and loop earrings fringe and ponytail
she has also adopted the style of holy golithly her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that characterizes modern girls from rural origins
the only difference is a more visceral quality pina lenas character is exalted and mediterranean nothing like hepburn
her wardrobe is that of a modern girl in she is a professional model for cosmetic products
one of her advertising photographs is framed and hangs on one of the walls of the loft where she lives
pina lenas character is cutting tomatoes for a gazpacho inside a beautiful and shiny kitchen
pina is sad probably thinking about all the times she has had gazpacho with ivan the absent lover
a tear drops from her face onto the knife with which shes cutting the tomatoes
in slow motion one sees the collision of the tear with the knife in a cut in
hers is a subtly comic sadness
when she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of sedatives which she is carrying in her aprons pocket
she throws all the pills into the gazpacho
she keeps two or three for herself
she may even say out loud these are for me
with a wooden spoon she mixes the orange liquid even though it only contains red tomatoes
the cut ins are to be alternated with the making of of the cut ins
as well as mateos comments over the action which instruct lena how to react
the clap board marks the end
its the fifth take
mateo says great
lena almost screams with joy
maybe on two random chairs from the loft terrace which are piled up with objects from the set given that this is not where they will be shooting the chairs
are next to the corral with the chickens and rabbits
seen through the mm camera in the foreground the team thats preparing the next shot for the next sequence in the background without being able to hear what they are
saying mateo speaking to lena
they are both holding a script in their hands
mateo is giving her directions
everything is very professional but their demeanor radiates understanding complicity and
a latent desire
they are not talking about anything personal
now we will do the part where you return home frustrated after having left ivan a note on his door
when you bump into julieta
you just open this door you look at the answering machine from afar
the machine has become some kind of monster to you
you are terrified of it
your sanity depends on it
if the light blinks it means there may have been a call
and if it doesnt blink
you cant do anything but wait
and you lost your patience some time ago
what lena and mateo are saying on the terrace as captured by the making of by ernesto junior is being seen and listened to by ernesto senior in the screening
room that hes had installed in his own home
next to him a young female lip reader a girl of neutral aspect but interesting dressed as a glamour less russian
is translating for ernesto senior what lena and mateo are saying as if she were dubbing them
the tone of her voice does not betray anything suspicious
everything sounds strictly professional a director and an actress who speak in complicity about their work
they both appear contained their attraction made more evident by what they hide than by what they show
judit is present in all the shots of the setting up including the ones where mateo and lena are in the background as mateo makes suggestions on how to add
nuance to lenas performance
judit appears solemn and always with an annoyed expression
ernesto senior feels sympathy for this woman
the team has just finished shooting a shot with pina on the terrace leaning over a railing her back turned waiting for ivan
mateo yells cut
and the assistant sends the team away until the next day
the production team hands out the order for the next day as if handing out the last edition of a newspaper with breaking news
the different teams disband and head toward the exit doors
mateo crosses paths with ernesto junior
are you going to work on something
you may go
i dont mind staying
its best if you leave
i am going to try out some wigs
i love wigs
you dont love them
you already have many hours shot of wigs
this is more of the same
disappointed ernesto junior says goodbye
after she tries on the new wigs shes asked for a massage therapist she has a spasm
i dont have footage of spasms
couldnt i shoot that
ernesto stop being a pest and leave already
see you tomorrow
mateo speaks to him in a friendly tone as if there were a warm rapport between them
he does so strategically given that he thinks the boy is the plague
ernesto junior finally understands that there is nothing for him to do and disappears
and mateo breathes
mateo accompanies edurne the make up artist and old flame collaborator and accomplice in other films to discuss some detail of lenas hairstyle and makeup
they end up at the make up and hair dressing room
lenas dressing room is just next door
she is there with one or two actors who are still hanging around
the rest have left
the reason of the previous scene has been a pretext
they both know it to edurne i am going to speak to magdalena
do you mind being on the lookout
dont let anyone interrupt us
the hairdresser gestures in accord
lena sees him enter she glances at him ardently not surprised to have him in her dressing room
is junior around
i sent him home
theres only edurne on watch
mateo approaches lena and without the slightest preamble launches himself at her mouth kissing her fervently
the impression is that they are about to devour each other
they separate as if to catch their breath looking intensely into each others eyes
they tear each others clothes off shes in a robe
this is madness mateo
i am no good for you
you should have warned me sooner
there are no overtures
they devour each other hungry
they make love on a small bed as if they were on the edge of a precipice
desire contained by both during the past weeks explodes and levels them
neither one does anything to stop it
a train passes by at high speed both images fuse the lovers and the train across their bodies
fade to black
lena arrives late from the shooting tired and satisfied
this is supposed to be another day not the same day of the scene in the dressing room
ernesto senior awaits for her in the living room in front of a muted television with a drink in hand
perhaps the train will still be present on the television screen
lena approaches him and kisses him
ironic i didnt know one worked so hard in the movies
smiles well yes especially if youre a girl
why if youre a girl
lena sits and takes a sip from his drink
because you must put on makeup and then remove it dress up do your hair
get dressed again do your hair again
and that takes hours
and youre not tired
at the end of the week sure but im happy
i was thinking we should take a break a weekend
just the two of us alone
at the house in ibiza or in paris
wherever you want
you and i
i cant travel until the shoot is over
i am talking about just a weekend
we rehearse on weekends
dont you also rehearse during the shooting
whats going on you spend all day rehearsing
without losing her cool thats how one makes a movie
thinking you moron
but she doesnt say it
and everyone elses life
it cant be set aside for months
the movie is boss
excuse me im the producer so im the boss
mateo argues with the set designer over one of the sets
distractedly judit waters the plants real ones of pinas fake terrace some of them somewhat shriveled from being away from the sun for so long
mateo is going to go complain to her about the set but he notices that she is so worried and tired that he doesnt say anything
you look awful
he could hardly breathe all night
neither of us has slept a wink
worried you still dont know what it is
some doctors say its asthma others that its allergies but we dont know to what
they are still running tests but its driving me to the brink
take all the time you need
even if were shooting your son is more important
changing subjects one more thing ive talked to the producer
he complains that the shooting is monopolizing lena
exasperated and condescending and how does he think one makes movies
ernesto is a businessman not an artist
then he shouldnt have signed up as a producer no one asked him
i warned you
ernesto martel doesnt give a crap about this movie and those of us making it except for one person
this weekend he is taking her to ibiza with him so you wont be able to rehearse
mateo looks at her as if she had just slapped him
mumbles son of a bitch
lena and ernesto spend the weekend together at an ibizan house minutely decorated with ethnic details
the decoration super luxurious hippie does not ring untrue to the islands aesthetic
consider that ernesto senior and lena are in the bedroom on the bed making love luxuriously
theres no hurry they pay careful attention to all the details
after the final sprint they both come satisfied
or so it seems
ernesto remains spent on the bed motionless
lena gets up and goes to the bathroom
she opens the faucet and lets the water run
immediately she is overtaken by vicious retching
on her knees she vomits into the toilet
after shes done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the mirror
she wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet
she looks very pale the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face
quickly she puts some makeup on
enough to bring some color back to her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes
her eyes still glimmer from the tears shes shed
more than in any other sequence it is here that lena reveals her talent as an actress
she exits the bathroom wrapped in an elegant robe a bit divine hippie
ernesto senior is still lying in bed recuperating
he gazes at her love struck
have you put on makeup
animated without exaggeration
a well faked serenity i want you to find me pretty
to me you always are
its impossible that you wouldnt be pretty
lena sits on the bed her back to ernesto
he wraps his arm around her waist while she makes some typical girl gesture looks at her nails thinking of how shell fix them looks into her pocket mirror and
ponders the color of her hair grabs a magazine on the nightstand and thumbs through it calls her mother to see how shes doing
or simplest of all takes a cigarette out of its box looks for the lighter finds it and lights it
everything is done sluggishly shes trying to take up as much time as possible
would you like a cigarette
do you know how many fucks weve had since we arrived yesterday
smiles like a champ six
also smiles ten
with honours yes
lena forces a smile with her back to ernesto
yes i suppose so
ernesto senior embraces her from behind and brings her toward him
he mumbles affectionately we have to take advantage of our time
we only have one more day left
only the indispensable members of the team and the actors are clustered around the entrance hall and the elevator a scene is being shot where pina exits the elevator and
walks through the entrance hall in a hurry toward the street
she bumps into chus the porter who is holding two metal objects a robert indiana love impressive and metallic and a gucci alarm clock in the shape of a g
the g is also metallic
chus stops her almost by force
she is a very communicative woman and pina attempts to get her off her back as quickly as possible without being rude to her
chus shows her both objects with a questioning look on her face
look at what ive found on the sidewalk they fell from your terrace
they are gifts from mr
ivan and i tossed them out
he told me to keep them but i dont want them
but you cant do that ms
you could have killed somebody
you cant just throw things off the terrace much less if they are metal
in naples on new years eve they even throw out furniture my grandfather was neapolitan
i carry it in my blood
but this is not naples nor is today new years eve
i was anxious and throwing things relaxes me
keep them if you like
thanks so much ms
but thats not right
pina exits the entrance hall leaving the porter mid sentence while the porter repeats still two more times
its not alright ms
the scene is very simple but it must exude charm
chus is a natural comic talent and pinas character must act with a flippancy that plays comically
at the same time lena is noticeably exhausted both physically and emotionally
instead of lending the text lightness she brings it down
and shes aware of it
for the first time mateo does not hide his annoyance as a director because the scene turns out badly and as a lover because he is jealous of her weekend
with ernesto senior
lena cannot stand to look at him she cant bare his angered expression
mateo takes her aside to a secluded corner of the set and away from the team
serious your tone is off magdalena
very depressed i know
in a very low voice whats wrong
whispers on the brink of tears ill tell you later
mateo gestures for the assistant to come over
lena still has her back toward the team
mateo says something to the assistant who then says out loud for all to hear we break for thirty minutes its snack time
mateo meets with lena in the darkest corner of the entrance hall
ernesto senior must be intercut watching in his screening room all that occurs at the shoot
next to him the lip reader
the members of the team slowly depart from the entrance hall
they take the opportunity to grab a bite or get some air they gather close to the trucks or next to the catering
all except ernesto junior who remains inside and hides furtively behind a styrofoam panel somewhat removed from the couple who cannot see him
mateo looks all around to ensure that they are alone
with urgency whats happened
ive had a horrible weekend
we havent rehearsed so that you could rest
i havent slept a wink all weekend
sighs on the brink of tears its been a nightmare
mateo once again ascertains that there is no one in the entrance hall
he hands her a kleenex so that she may wipe her tears
i have literally had ernesto on top of me all those forty eight hours like a leech
repulsed expression he has not given me a second to breathe the asshole
mateo grabs her by the arm and takes her up the stairs to an apartment that the production company has rented in the same building
ernesto senior hears the entire conversation from the lips of the lip reader
a stony expression on his face
the reader repeats the dialogues in an unexpressive tone which makes them sound even more dramatic and painful
fade to black
returning from black
various shots of pinas loft
everything seems chaotic typical of the end of the work day
the furniture is out of place silverware and plastic is all mixed together with electrical material and stage equipment
the warehouse lights begin to shut off
the team disbands
on her way to the dressing room lena tells ernesto junior that she is headed to her yoga class as she does every day
and that she wants to go alone
my father asks me why it is that i dont go with you to yoga he asks me all the time
well you tell him that i am a grown up now and free and that ive forbidden you to follow me
you know i cant tell him that
it would do you good
do as you wish but youre not coming with me
and she leaves him behind
ernesto junior watches her walk away disoriented
he always has a tripod attached to his camera as in peeping tom
its the fist time we see this setting the entrance of the building where mateo lives
almost all the windows are darkened
we watch this sequence through the mm camera situated just in front of the buildings doorway
we watch as mateo appears on the sidewalk walking toward the buildings doorway
in front of the building in the main narrative we see ernesto junior filming with his mm camera
he is hiding behind a bush or cloaked by a trees shade
either way mateo does not discover him
at the same time that the former is taking place lena arrives to martels mansion
she finds ernesto senior with a drink in his hand in one of the living areas or playing the piano she approaches him and gives him a slight kiss on
the lips in a gesture of hello
quotidian and tranquil an unexpected demeanor for a character of his temperament how are you
on guard yes
the yoga is doing you good isnt it
lena catches ernestos allusion but she pretends she hasnt
she demonstrates her control over herself and her cold determination
yes especially after work
i am going to snack on something
will you join me
i am not hungry id rather go to bed right now
ill only have a yogurt
lena climbs up the long staircase heads directly for her room
ernesto listens to her steps as they recede
his ironic tranquility disappears and gives way to a furious expression
fade to black
a different day
framed by the window to mateos living room seen from the street one observes the bottom halves of mateos and lenas bodies as they move around the apartment
only half of their body is visible because the roman shades are halfway drawn
one gets the impression that mateo is showing her around the house
they say goodbye
we see all this through a mm camera
without a pause in the shooting we realize that the person carrying the camera crosses the street and waits outside of the front door to mateos building
lena exits through the door
the second she discovers the camera she confronts it
ernesto what are you doing here
turn that off you idiot
hasnt mateo forbidden you to tape us outside the shooting
not far from them there is a garbage truck that is making horrendous noises and makes it difficult to hear what they are saying
the truck gets closer and the noises louder so that ernesto junior and lena must scream back and forth at each other
my father has told me not to listen to him
he wants to see everything
you both have no scruples
remember i am taping you
lena throws herself at ernesto junior and attempts to take the camera from him
they struggle the camera continues shooting the images move around dizzyingly
ernesto junior manages to break free from lena
they are both out of breath
ernesto backs up a few steps in order to frame lena again and so that he can focus her image
lena could take off running but instead she stays right where she is she lets ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly while she fixes her hair
she looks straight at the camera in a barrage listen carefully ernesto
yes i am talking to you
she points toward mateos house i was just with the man i love and i am the happiest ive been all my life because he loves me too
screams and listen carefully ernesto
i will let you be very soon
there is no need to spy on me
there is nothing left to hide
we see this at the same moment its happening
the next day ernesto senior is watching the previous nights scene on the screen of his private projection room
we discover this when he is halfway into it the images pick the action up at the point when lena exits mateos house and confronts the camera right after she
has attempted to grab the camera away from ernesto junior
the shots in mm alternate with the shots in mm that belong to the main narrative
the sound is uproarious we can hear what they say in a low volume just as reference
ernesto asks for the sound to be muted so that the translator can do her job
the lip reader tries as usual to be neutral and inexpressive but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the scene affect her
she acts as a mere vehicle not part of the conflict nonetheless she gets a little nervous
she is seated next to the volcano ernesto senior stony frozen silent and about to explode
just a little earlier right before the dizzying images appear on screen those caused by lenas attempt to remove the camera from ernesto juniors hands on the opposite end of
where the screen is behind the back of both ernesto and the translator a door opens
she watches the scene that is unfolding on screen as she lets her voice rise to her mouth
the entire dialogue in which she has addressed ernesto senior directly is seen during the action taking place in the projection room not on the street
at first her voice overlaps with that of the translator who becomes instantly silent and turns her head toward the door where lena is standing
lena is dubbing herself
i was just with the man i love and i am the happiest that ive been all my life because he loves me too
and listen carefully ernesto
i will let you be very soon
there is no need to spy on me
i dont have anything left to hide
the translator watches lena and ernesto senior who is still motionless watching the screen
on screen we see lena walking her back turned for a good stretch
with an equal obsession she is followed down the street by the son and in the screening room by the father
an avalanche of snow on the television screen
some short shots of both ice and whisky as they fall into a tall glass function as an ellipsis between one scene and the next
lena paces around anxiously in her bedroom
she attempts to focus on a fashion magazine but is unsuccessful
she takes a deep breath makes a decision
she opens the closet and takes out a small weekend suitcase
she fills it with her most indispensable clothes
she exits her bedroom on the top floor
in the hallway only a few meters separate the door to her bedroom from the stairway
there is a small landing just before the top of the stairs it has a small table against the wall a beautiful vase with flowers a mirror and two small
sofas on either side of the small table
ernesto is seated on one of them holding a glass of whisky in his right hand
it cannot be the first hes had
one could say hes been waiting some time now for lenas exit a bottle and an icebox keeping him company
lena walks a few steps
se approaches ernesto but keeps her distance
she speaks to him in passing
suitcase in hand i am leaving ernesto
i am leaving you
cold drunk contemptuous you are not going anywhere
and how will you stop me
every single one of the words in this dialogue sounds laded and slow no sooner has she said it than lena realizes that it has been an unnecessary provocation
but its too late to take back whats been said
ernesto senior shoots her a deathly look
but then gets up and changes his expression to calm her
pleading lena please
one more time ernesto begs forgiveness but lena doesnt want to see him or hear him
she turns and begins to descend the stairs
the first step
ernesto approaches her slowly from behind
he is still pleading as in a litany lena please
but lena keeps her back to his supplication descends one more step her second one
suddenly without any change in his expression ernesto pushes her with a quick and unexpected movement of his arm
lena loses her balance and falls rolling bouncing violently against the edges of the steps until her whole body hits the floor at the foot of the stairs
during the time the fall takes ernesto doesnt move he watches her fall bump by bump
he waits until shes on the floor and she casts him a fulminating glance before he reacts
lena lands on the floor broken and stunned by the blows
she lifts her head and attempts to move but cant
ernesto descends quickly and comes to her side
he begs calmly without violence for her not to move
lena cannot stand her battered body only allows her to drag herself toward the door like a reptile
ernesto takes her delicately in his arms
lena gazes at him in horror
he exits into the night onto a green lawn with the woman in his arms they look like two newlyweds
the dogs disconcerted follow them in procession they intuit that something is not right
once inside the car none of the hired help is there that night he opens the gate from the inside and exits onto the highway
lena is lying on the back seat pale and in pain but shes not complaining
ernesto is driving faster than km hr
he alerts a pair of patrolmen
when he realizes hes being followed he increases his speed
the patrolmen signal with their lights for him to stop on the curb but ernesto martel ignores their signal until the police car catches up to him and forces him
the two patrolmen get out of their vehicle and head enraged toward ernesto
they gesture for him to lower his window
ernesto lowers the window relaxed despite the situation
the two patrolmen especially the one who calls the shots recriminate him their voices raised for all the infractions he has just committed
they are very agitated and they quickly notice the high level of alcohol emitted by the drivers breath
knocked out on the back seat lena observes the whole scene
her face is contorted with pain and anxiety
a river of cars continues to pass nearby
using a nasty tone one of the policemen asks ernesto for his documents
the following conversation takes place while the policemen verify the vehicles documents
ernesto explains to them with a common sense thats disarming we have to get to the hospital
my wife is badly hurt
lena moans in affirmation
the policeman takes a look inside the car in order to ascertain that she is indeed not faking it
i was in the living room and since we werent planning to go out i started drinking early
i am pretty drunk as you may notice
suddenly i heard a thump i ran to the stairs and there she was
she tripped and fell down the stairs
is this true madam
cant you leave the paperwork for later
your husband cant drive in this condition
what do you mean
ernesto attempts to start the car but the other policeman stops him
lena moans inside the car
she may even start crying
she says this to the two men
get out of there
i will drive
you either let me drive or we all stay here until the ambulance arrives
to ernesto stop it ernesto
let him drive
to ernesto paternalistic and contemptuous get down and sit in the back with your wife
threatening if anything happens referring to lena you better be ready
you have no idea who i am
taking his time ernesto vacates the drivers seat and sits in the back next to lena
i will pretend that i didnt hear you
i will also pretend i noticed neither how drunk you are nor your affronts to authority mr
sulking and with an alcohol driven affection and casual he asks are you all right
to the policeman and could we get the fuck going
the policeman gets the car moving and his partner follows them in the patrol car
ernestos car driven by the patroleman arrives to the entrance of a hospital
immediately at the emergency room some male nurses arrive with a stretcher
x rays of arms legs and head along with all other routine tests in short shots
a broken leg
a cast must be applied
the image of the x ray takes up the whole screen
we may hear the nurses giving instructions
dont move dont breathe etc
the last thing we see is the x ray of the head which dissolves over lenas head and face as she asks a nurse for the telephone telling her that
she needs to make an urgent phone call
ernesto censures her with his look
once the last x ray has been taken the nurse brings her a supplementary handset and plugs it in
she hands the handset to lena
you really cant wait
ernesto looks at her not knowing what to expect
nonetheless he remains seated next to her
lena doesnt react she doesnt care if he overhears the conversation she almost wants him to
the brutal beating to which she has been victim is an inescapable reality that gives her an edge over ernesto an edge of which she intends to take advantage
she is wounded but she is no longer afraid of him
she rings mateos number
they greet each other
whats going on
are you not coming
has something happened
something unexpected has happened but dont worry everythings ok
tomorrow the shooting begins in the afternoon will i see you before then
i wont be able to
i will see you directly at the studio
i have something to do
worried youre acting strange magdalena
are you sure nothings wrong
ill see you tomorrow
ernesto seniors car arrives at the puerta de hierro mansion
various members three or four of the mansions personnel approach to help the couple
lena exits the car with her leg covered in a cast up to her knee
she leans on crutches or a cane
the group gathers in the living room of the ground floor
ernesto asks the help to bring them something and then to leave them alone
a table set ad hoc
lena is sitting in front of her breakfast or lunch sullen pale implacable she doesnt move a single muscle of her massacred face
ernesto senior is all sweetness toward his victim
lena begins to pick at her food listless in silence in order to keep her mouth and eyes occupied
begs sincerely what would you like me to do
what can i do so that you will forgive me
seriously take me to the studio
you shouldnt move
if you dont take me ill go there myself even if i have to drag myself
her face is still covered in bruises on her cheekbone and around her eyes
at some point someone from the hired help appears sir madam do you need anything else
no you can leave us alone i have already told you this for gods sake
ernesto senior responds
the servant quickly vanishes
lowering his tone and what will you say
how will you explain the cast on your leg and the bruises
lena appears implacable throughout the conversation
its up to you
i will do whatever you ask as long as you promise youll stay with me
i will stay under the condition that you let mateo finish the shooting according to what he decides
he will barrage you with questions that guys not stupid
i will tell him i tripped
and how will you shoot if you cant walk
i dont know
whatever mateo decides but i want to rest assured that you will respect his decision no matter the cost nor the time that it will take
is that clear
ernesto senior hates to negotiate under predetermined limitations
he weighs out his options and realizes that lena has the upper hand
they enter the warehouse temporarily turned into a studio
the darkness is almost absolute
a huge door opens
the silhouettes of ernesto senior and lena on a wheelchair enter
the dark vast space is pierced by the blinding light of a doorway which both frames and silhouettes the figures of ernesto and lena like cut outs creating a powerful
epic and terrible
they bump into some of the members of the team who begin their work day slothfully
when mateo discovers the pair he approaches them immediately
mateo is seated at a casual table
the entire decoration of the office is casual and chaotic not luxurious austere nothing like lenas dressing room
an enormous drip eats away at one of the corners of the room
lena is sitting across from him on a wheelchair and seated on an ugly armchair ernesto senior
judit is also present shes standing
they have just finished talking
lena has told the version that she and ernesto senior agreed on
and thats it
mateo looks at them in disbelief
judit still as a statue waits for the others reactions
lena breathes expectantly
and ernesto senior looks uncomfortable and insecure he is used to being the one who calls the shots the inverse role that of listener disorients him and puts him in
a bad mood
ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide
containing his rage decide what
i cant move from one shot where you are walking normally to another one where you are wearing a cast
how long must you wear the cast
mateo lets out a huff
to ernesto senior can we stop for those three weeks
with pay for the team of course
if there is no other option
a bit agitated i hate stopping
movies when you pick them back up are no longer the same
looks at judit and ernesto senior
dryly do you mind if i speak to lena alone for a moment
its not a question but a demand
judit shoots him a look of recrimination as if saying this is not the moment for that but she cannot do anything to stop him
ernesto senior is also not pleased but he knows he cannot say no and this irritates him even more
he glances first at lena who orders him with her own glance to accept and then looks at judit who warmly invites him to exit with her
for some reason ernesto senior empathizes with that woman
judit and ernesto senior exit the office and hang around not far from to the door
they smoke perhaps
they are both restless
they look at each other as if seeking some kind of understanding despite their differences
and they find it
they are joined by their jealousy
at the other end of the warehouse like a mirage amongst the shadows pinas loft appears majestic ramshackle and mysterious
ernesto contemplates it without understanding it but is affected by its presence
he is unable to understand the essence of this make belief game but its the first time he begins to grasp its hermetic fascination
mateo lifts her skirt in an attempt to see how far up the cast goes
on the white skin of her thighs like in an uneven print various asymmetrical bruises stand out
mateo touches with his lips on every one of them kissing them delicately
be careful he may walk in
let him walk in
and he continues kissing her thighs until he comes close to her pubis
lena lifts and or caresses his head
mateo lifts it to look at her
tell me the truth
people dont fall down the stairs that only happens in movies
lena avoids giving a direct answer but in her own way she lets him know somberly and urgently
mateo we must finish the shooting as soon as possible
until then i cannot leave ernesto
hes a psychopath
what more proof do you need
i cannot leave ive made a deal with him
i have promised to stay in his house in exchange for his letting you finish the film under your conditions
but i cannot ask you for such a sacrifice
you have not asked me
i cant accept it either
pleads mateo please
there must be another answer
the only solution is that i continue to live with him until you finish the film
can you take it
you dont have to think about that
whats important is that you finish shooting
exactly what have you agreed to
ive told you to live under the same roof with him in his room and me in mine
he doesnt have the right to anything more
and you think he will be content with that
angst ridden i dont know
but the sooner you finish shooting the better
come up with a reason not to pause
mateo goes over the story in his head desperately attempting to think of something
lena observes him expectantly
finally something seems to hit him
unenthusiastic we would have to repeat part of the stairway scene
taking up the whole screen we see the scene through the moviola with the texture of a bad copy streaks grain etc
the solution mateo has proposed is to repeat the last part of the sequence
on the surface of the moviola screen the reflection of mateos face is barely visible over the first set of images screened
a wooden landing and stairway in a building of the old madrid
at its center an elevator also antique
pina has just left a note for ivan on the door to his study asking him to please call on her that she needs to speak to him urgently that
something unexpected has come up
she is dressed as she was when she came out of the entrance hall in the previous scene with chus
this sequence is supposed to be the one that follows it
she has just left the note when julieta appears she is dressed conventionally but with some extravagant detail something that garners attention
she bumps into pina by the elevator pina does not know her
julieta knocks on the studios door just as pina had done earlier she doesnt get an answer
she notices the note that pina has just affixed on the door
she takes it down and reads it much to pinas bafflement who has been watching her from the other side of the landing
after reading it julieta crumples it up
pina cannot believe it
she remains motionless on the other side of the landing because she doesnt trust the eccentric looking woman
indignant leave that note there
its not for you
how dare you take it and crumple it
julieta throws the crumpled note through the gap in the stairway and looks condescendingly at pina while she approaches her prepared to walk down the stairs
what do you have to speak to ivan about you whore
its none of your business
i am his wife
his wife has been admitted at a psychiatric hospital for twenty years now
these images are what will be retained from what had been shot previously
pina makes a gesture as if to say so you are the ex wife the crazy one
pina and julieta begin to descend the stairs
repeats i am no longer committed
i am now here with you
walking down the stairs
pina looks at her apprehensively
she steps down only one stair
you are in a hurry to see him arent you
well what are you waiting for
she pushes her and pina falls rolling all the way to the bottom
images that indicate the passing of time during the shooting
short sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams as if assembling ballet pieces all of it accompanied by a musical score the d
sets up the lighting for the shoot the bulbs are lit the filters applied the interior of the camera cleaned the film is loaded
the atmosphere is set
pina in her bedroom lying on the bed with one leg in a cast is relaxing breathing deeply
the actress playing chon jokes around with the costume team they laugh
but no one pays attention to the others
edurne in a close up retouches one of pinas eyes
the mouth as well
chon stops laughing so that the hair stylist may shape her hair
all the images are very brief
the score predominates the ambient sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a whisper
the scene must not last longer than a minute
this set of images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in its final days after a long journey
there will probably not be many images but less the bulb that lights lenas eye as edurne retouches it its blinking its sadness
chons mouth as she speaks without pause stopping only when lipstick is added
the film loaded the hair fluffed
lena lying on the rug in her dressing room totally motionless her eyes made up and closed doing breathing exercises for relaxation her leg in a cast etc
the doorbell rings in the loft
pina limps over to the door
she looks through the metal peephole its design creates an optical illusion
on the other side of the peephole chons exalted eyes appear
chon is a better midler type in her s that kind of extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isnt quite so
she is wearing designer clothes despite the fact that her demeanor is direct and crass
both of them pina and chon are tired and hysterical which each one of them interprets in her own way
pina opens the door and chon enters
even though they are good friends the last thing pina is in the mood for is to see chon much less an over excited chon with problems
whispers what a drag
she opens the door in a languid bored tone oh its you
reproaches depressed ive left you a thousand messages
chon notices ivans suitcase in the middle of the foyer and looks at it as if shed never seen a suitcase
and this suitcase
judging from the tone one would guess she could care less
but the script asks for her to inquire about the suitcase and she inquires
sounding bored asleep its ivans
hes leaving me
chon disconcerted notices that pina drags herself around with a cast on her leg
she has picked up pinas inexpressive tone and that broken leg
his ex wife the crazy one
she pushed me down the stairs
i see were in great shape
interrupts the take cut
final clap board
its take number twelve
the camera team directs load camera new film stock is loaded the one already inside has run out
mateo has a look of worry the scene is not funny at all the actresses are bored and tense
they behave like automatons
lena looks at mateo she had never seen him so disconsolate
a general impasse and discouragement
the team betrays boredom preoccupation and exhaustion
the actress playing chon grumbles annoyed
juanba the hair stylist approaches her to fix her hair
in the background one sees mateo speaking to lena
ernesto junior wanders around the set
we suppose that he has already shot the other takes we notice a change in his attitude
he watches lena and mateo converse then watches them as they move away from the set he has no intention of following them
one might say that he is now on their side against his own father
in some place of the warehouse where no one can see them and they can speak calmly
mateo and lena
during this time lena has been keeping her end of the deal and continues to live with ernesto martel but as much as she attempts to diffuse it its effect
has been devastating
she is very depressed
she can hardly hold herself up
lenas state of mind and how it affects the shooting makes mateo feel impotent and guilty
distressed maybe shell cry i am sorry
dont worry it will turn out
acknowledges but i dont know what more direction to give you
exhausted hard on herself you have told me everything in every way possible
somber and guilty ernesto is getting just what he hoped
that we make a piece of crap of a movie
i told you not to agree to that deal
lena breathes grasping for a solution and for breath
she attempts to regain her strength
we cant let him have his way
she dries her tears feeling newly replenished every day i arrive worn out and every day i recover right
i ask you only for a bit more patience
and a kiss
mateo kisses her as one kisses one shipwrecked although the one shipwrecked is really him
in any case the kiss brings life back to both of them
the clap board indicates that they will shoot take number thirteen
a traveling shot follows lena as she limps toward the door
she looks through the peephole behind it chon
they are supposed to be good friends but shes the last person lena wants to see
whispers what a drag
contemptuous she greets her oh its you
listen if thats how youll greet me ill leave
pina treats her with a friendly disdain which plays comically
she has once again recovered her strength and her lightness
her low spirits have disappeared and she comes off thoughtless and impudent
her reenactment has an effect on chon who also performs much better than in the previous take
these first few phrases are enough to determine that the two actresses have improved
lena is now a different actress light and delicious
mateo smiles brimming with admiration
mateo and his editor and the assistant editor watch the end of the sequence on the moviola
shes so much better
grab this one
mateo smiles satisfied
on the same table where the moviola sits luis the editor has a notebook in which each page corresponds to a sequence numbered respectively
the sequences are divided by shots and the shots by the number of takes
luis draws a circle around take number thirteen
lets look at fourteen its even better
luis an editing assistant and mateo sitting in front of the moviola examine the footage
there is a palpable complicity between luis and mateo
luis has edited all of mateos films they have been colleagues for a long time
as with judit despite their differences one can tell that luis belongs to mateos artistic family
the characters are dressed differently
as they load the film and sound onto the moviola we hear harrys voice off
only audio year
voice off of harry speaking to diego
we hear it over the running moviola
when we finished shooting i quickly selected all the takes for the film so that i could rescue lena as soon as possible from the martel house
the situation had worsened we could hardly see each other he had practically kidnapped her
they were difficult days for everyone but lena insisted that i leave all the takes selected
then we could leave
he hasnt finished saying this when we hear the phone ring
the assistant phone in hand to mateo its for you
he takes it surprised he is still staring at the moviola screen
is there something wrong
ive forgotten my money
i have to pay the cab
ill be right down
he exits the editing room
mateo descends the stairs of cinearte at a good clip he wasnt expecting lenas visit
he can sense somethings happened
when he arrives at the foyer he cant find her
the phone operator ugly but polite at the reception desk tells him lena is in the bathroom
he enters the bathroom and finds lena barefoot wearing only her bra and panties cleaning wounds shes suffered on her face and legs
the surface of the sink is tainted with blood
mateo looks at her horrified
she is no longer wearing a cast
a mans jacket lies on top of the counter this is the only piece of clothing that appears in this scene
what has happened
we have had a brutal fight
at the end he ripped my clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto the highway
the jacket belongs to the cab driver
you must give him a good tip if it werent for him i dont know how i would have made it here
mateo cannot believe his eyes
he hurls insults at ernesto senior
lenas apparent composure is purely hysterical
mateo and lena exit cinearte
they enter a cab that is waiting for them
to the cab driver take us to the nearest police station
we must denounce him magdalena
he will turn against you
the cab begins moving
mateo gives the cab driver his address
no not your house
we have to look after you
lets go to a hotel
pleads lets leave madrid
mateo looks through his pockets fortunately he has all his credit cards on him
mateo and lena are living in a bungalow zone on famara beach a complex nestled between the beach and the foot of a mountain
it is a special and intimate place like an enormous grotto where the sky is its ceiling and the mountains one of its walls
lena and mateo exit a bungalow and get into a rented car a red opel corsa not in very good shape
on the peak of a reddish rock on golfo beach mateo takes photographs of the natural wonders surrounding him
next to him lena contemplates the view
what mateo sees with his camera a wine colored rocks b the yellow green lake circumscribed by a rope that has become white against the black sand
c the black sand of the enormous beach licked by the shimmering foam of the waves
d the rocky walls enveloping the beach eroded through centuries by the wind on the surface of which it has created peaks and valleys resembling the jutted edge of a
one of the images captures part of a wine colored rock
below it the infinite surface of the black beach licked by the white foam of the waves
in the backdrop an immense limestone wall its surface full of pit holes where the wind circulates
the sequence ends with a close up of the click of mateos cameras shutter opening and closing like an owls eye
mateo harry and lena pick up their photos at the stores counter
the owner of the shop hands them to him he is an attractive and bohemian middle aged man
mateo opens the envelope impatiently he wants to make sure that his photographs are in effect the ones inside it
he looks at the last one closely the landscape with the rocks the beach the foam etc
somewhere on the vast black sand beach one can make out a couple their size is tiny compared to the immensity of the beach
the two are melded into a tight embrace
the beach is deserted
mateo had not been aware of them when he took the photograph and is overtaken by his discovery
he shows it to lena
i thought it was empty mateo asks the bohemian attendant for a larger print
they go through various traffic circles
mateo comments that it is the island of the useless traffic circles
thats part of its charm comments lena
they stop on one of the stop signs at the traffic circle
in the center there is a huge mobile sculpture by cesar manrique rocked by the wind
mateo and lena exit the car to take pictures of themselves
their faces close together their eyes happy
the sculpture turning around itself produces a strange screeching sound
many days have passed
mateos hair is longer and he appears more tan the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also affected magdalenas appearance now much more savage but
also more serene and more humble
she is dressed in cheap clothing which she has bought on the island and which fits her marvelously and her hair is pulled up into a messy bun
the photograph enlarged presides on top of a small table where mateo writes
the picture is leaning against the wall
its the only image inside the bungalow
the photograph is a clear metaphor for the mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of mateo and lena and of their fusion
while mateo writes lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in the bathtub
the two wear t shirts comfortable and sporty clothes
on the tape deck one hears la lupe singing
porque hay un hombre para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre y nosotros somos nosotros somos
la pareja because there is only one man for each woman and only one woman for each man and we are and we are
mateo and magdalena the couple
in the bungalow there isnt much furniture theres a large couch on which they can lie comfortably a short table along with the wooden table on which mateo writes
some armchair and lamps
and a tape deck
engulfed by the couch mateo and lena are absorbed watching on a small television a broadcast of voyage in italy roberto rossellinis
the scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are working on some excavation
the married couple in the midst of their breakup played by george sanders and ingrid bergman is on a tourist trip in that area of italy and they have gone
to visit the excavation
one of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in excavating part of a city that had been buried centuries ago by the lethal eruption of the vesuvius
at that moment the men who are working on the excavation begin bit by bit to uncover a couple a man and a woman sleeping in an embrace whom the
eruption had taken unaware leaving them preserved in this position for centuries
ingrid bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an eternal embrace
she compares it to her own marriage destroyed by their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between them
she walks away from the place unable to contain her tears
the scene affects magdalena and mateo as much as it had ingrid bergman
mateo and lena instinctively embrace each other seeking refuge in each other their posture echoes that of the calcined couple
suddenly mateo breaks their embrace
he positions the camera on top of the table where he writes not far from where the image of the other embrace sits
he points it toward the couch and he presses the automatic button
and they take a picture together locked in an embrace
harry and diego now completely cured are sitting on a bench
do you want to go back home and return to the donate blood story
i am hoping to get back to it but first tell me what happened in lanzarote
you cant leave me hanging
harry takes a deep breath
at this stage of the narrative it is only understandable that diego would want to know everything
but it pains him to think of what is still left to tell
without realizing a month had elapsed
i knew that sooner or later we would have to return but we kept postponing it
i was only worried about you and your mother
i had not even said goodbye and you were still suffering from your allergy problem when we left
i can imagine judit was furious with me
you cant imagine how much
i was planning to return soon to finish the editing
and to explain things to your mother
but magdalena decided shed wait for me on the island
she couldnt stand the thought of seeing ernesto again
mateo and lena are walking toward the office for the bungalow complex
part of the previous dialogue is heard as the couple are approaching the office behind the counter there are two foreign employees a man and a woman
lena addresses them in english while mateo keeps himself busy at the other end of the reception hall next to a table with magazines and newspapers
he grabs a newspaper
in english sorry to interrupt
i wanted to ask if there are any employment opportunities available here with you
you always look so busy
i have a lot of free time
we could use the help especially now that the high season is about to start
do you have experience
i have worked as a secretary at m
capital a very important finance company
looks at her you could first work during the afternoons and then we could see
with his back to the counter at the other end of the reception desk mateo reads a newspaper frozen
suddenly the employee opens a national newspaper and looks for a particular page
he shows it to lena
on the entertainment page an ad for mateos movie opening soon
the ad is a close up of her in her role as pina in the movie
lena is stunned
she cant believe it
we were just saying that the girl in the ad looks like you
lena looks toward where mateo is standing and she notices that he is as perplexed as she is staring at the ad for a soon to be released film in
to the employee no
its not me
they exit the office
mateo and lena walk toward their bungalow as if someone were chasing them
they have just run into the very thing they have been attempting to escape in madrid
i was wondering how long it would take him to emerge
disoriented but they cant release the film so soon right
its a scheme to annoy us and a trap to get you to return
the ad is only lacking the words missing
what are we going to do
a few surfers are preparing to go into the ocean
a father and his young son toss their kites into the wind
lounging on lounge chairs on a cobble stone area before one reaches the sand lena and mateo harry are reading the news of the opening of the film in a
they only have one copy and mateos eyes are transfixed on the news
the note accompanying the event says in bold type the financier ernesto martel has managed to gather all of madrid for his first film as a producer missing are only
its director and star
two pictures accompany the news of the event
printed next to them there is a review entitled disaster
mateo throws the newspaper away from him enraged
he refuses to read the review
the wind dishevels the newspaper pages
lena rises and chases the pages that fly like kites slightly above the ground
in mid flight she catches the entertainment page and reads it as she approaches mateo who watches the ocean feeling impotent furious unable to quite grasp what is happening
lena sits down next to him still reading
disconsolate what does it say
that the only intelligent thing we have done has been not to attend the premier that my acting is pathetic that you seem like a first time director and that
you lack talent
at the end it wonders who might have made your first films
never before has such a resounding downfall been witnessed
mateo rises and heads quickly for the bungalow which functions as the office for the complex
lena follows him alarmed
what are you going to do
cut to directly to the shot of the telephone
mateo has just dialed judits number
he gets the answering machine hearing judits voice encourages him to leave a message
you have reached judit garcias voicemail
leave your message after the tone and i will return your call as soon as possible
mateo leaves his message
i hope you and the boy are ok
i apologize that i left without notice but terrible things have happened i will explain
speaking of which i need to talk to you urgently
please call me
heres the number
asks one of the employees oh and ask for harry caine i have registered under that name
said almost as an order i will be waiting for your call
he also rings luis the editor
he also doesnt answer
he leaves luis a shorter and more violent message
luis i just read in the newspaper that the film has opened and i am beside myself
i dont know what the fuck is going on there but i would like to know
ok ill ring back
he looks at lena breathless his face contorted from sheer helplessness
harry is standing pacing back and forth
diego stands next to the bookcase
the drawer with the photographs is open
he looks at the photograph of the traffic circle and at the one of the embrace on the black sand of golfo beach
he has taken them out of the large brown envelope
at the bottom of the drawer one can begin to see luis the editor notebook
diego is holding a dymo label machine this dymo has appeared in previous scenes with all of its keyboard buttons corresponding to the regular alphabet in braille
he is writing in braille famara lanzarote so that he can stick the raised title onto the old envelope
and mom did she call you back
cant understand hes almost indignant why
she was pissed i suppose
i remember that time it was while i was undergoing treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis
it was a horrible time for me
not just because of the illness my mother was like a crazy woman
i had just seen the exorcist and for some time i believed she was possessed
smiles pathetically i was the demon diego
and i am sorry
i suppose i behaved selfishly but i am not sure i had a choice
diego thinks about this
emotionally exhausted no matter how upset she was she should have alerted you to what was happening
the fact is she never did and weve never spoken of it
neither one of us has broached the topic
surprised and you werent curious
curiosity was killing me
for two days i called both your mother and luis non stop the editor says it agitated but neither of them answered
so i decided to return to madrid the next day so that i could witness what was happening for myself
night falls while they dine
mateo and magdalena dine at el mirador a local restaurant with spectacular views
their table is beside a long sliding door window that overlooks the valley
a group of rocks seem to grow next to the window as if they were plants made of stone
the view of the valley is breathtaking
there are few patrons inside the restaurant
perhaps a foreign couple sitting far from lena and mateo
a waiter brings their first course
they are drinking wine
lena appears melancholic and fearful
how did you meet ernesto senior
its not a topic she likes but she doesnt hesitate to answer
i was one of his secretaries
how did you end up with him
you fell in love
he was very generous with me and my family
my father was dying i needed to take him to a private hospital and ernesto took care of everything
he paid for everything
and he made sure that my parents could return to their home town and that they lacked nothing
mateo imagines the situation it upsets him
he is perturbed by the very idea of lenas past with ernesto but he doesnt want to upset her on the night before his departure
they have gone out to dinner with just the opposite intent
lovingly pardon me i have no right to ask you about that time in your life
its only natural that you would want to know
and i dont want any skeletons between us
unguarded i would like to be able to forget all that but you have the right to ask
assuring her no
i do not have any right
for me you were born the day you came for the audition
you looked at me i saw your face and
i was left hypnotized
she is both comforted and relived by remembering that moment
i remember your face perfectly
i think i fell in love with the way you looked at me
i thought this man will be my salvation
mateo is moved by her use of those terms to speak of their first meeting
they exit in an embrace and head toward their car parked nearby
they kiss before they get in the car
we notice another car which we will have the occasion to recall in the future the camera gives it just a passing glance
childish its the first time we part
pampering either way i will return next weekend
but if you are going to be worried you should come with me
i will be better off here
and she smiles as if the worry has already passed so as not to disquiet mateo
view of the sea of lava or of la geria in an aerial shot with the car moving across the landscape
the full moon allows us to glimpse through the darkness of the landscape
mateos car once again heads for the bungalow complex
show the highway illuminated by the headlights and the landscape as it appears to its left and right
from inside the car one can see the mobile sculpture of cesar manrique at a distance
very insecure and did i manage to save you from anything
enigmatic and unwavering yes
lena does not elaborate on the dangers that mateo has saved her from he doesnt understand them exactly but he likes to hear her say so
they approach the traffic circle
a set of lights first betrays the presence of a car that appears from the left
mateo yields to it and briefly kisses magdalena on the lips
mateo continues on his way a short instant later as he enters the traffic circle an suv moving at full speed crashes into them
everything happens very fast
from inside the car without any particular attention to lena or mateo the screen fills up with light noise and darkness
all the different noises form a deafening magma
at the center of the traffic circle cesar manriques sculpture rotates propelled by the wind
in any case we will also shoot the crash from the outside
and although it will not be obvious at first sight the back side of mateos car is illuminated by the headlights of a car that we never quite see but
which has been a witness to the accident
the huge mobile sculpture by cesar manrique continues to rotate with the wind immediately following the collision
one can hear the screeching wheels of the suv escaping from the accident scene
one also hears the sound of a second vehicle which approaches and stops and something that sounds like a door opening and a moan
the camera only focuses on the sculpture swaying in the wind
diego looks at harry in silence he doesnt say a word
he is still holding the dymo
harry also says nothing
magdalenas death didnt catch us melded in an embrace but sitting on separate seats
it caught me by surprise in that of leaving me alive
when harrys face once again appears we begin to hear his voice off
the entrance to a hospital in lanzarote
through one of the windows we can see mateos gaunt and nebulous figure resting on a bed his head bandaged
just as in the beginning judit is next to mateos bed
she is holding his hand and begs him mateo say something
mateo is dead judit
bags under her eyes and tearful dont say that
a naturalist decor and stage setting of an island hospital of that era located in a very picturesque place
through the window we can see the local surroundings
the walls are a pastel color green or blue an aquatic color and they have various spots where humidity has seeped through
other than the psychiatrist there is another doctor present explaining the situation to judit
we call him by his name but he doesnt respond to it
he insists mateo has died
images are the source of his work
and to live in the dark i suppose thats death to him
is there any chance he will see
his is what we refer to as a cortical blindness and its irreversible
its the result of a lesion to the occipital lobe the intelligent part of the brain which has the role of processing all visual information
in other words the neurons have died
and thats permanent
i felt as though i had died with lena
the mateo film director who had left madrid would never return
days or weeks later
judit exits the hospital with blind mateo hes hidden behind black sunglasses now without the bandages or very few and with little diego eight years old holding hands
mateo walks tentatively and slowly
he will probably be aided by the typical blind mans cane
they get into a car that is waiting for them
judit instructs the driver to take them to famara beach to the bungalow complex
this is a good opportunity to show some of the more dramatic landscapes of the island
the lava sea black and twisted and the rented car that crosses it through the highway that divides it
or la geria and its vine stalks buried in half spheres of black dirt to protect them from the winds
the green palm tree fronds flop around against the backdrop of this black dirt landscape
inside the car mateo asks judit did you visit lenas mother at her hometown
what did she say
she was very thankful to ernesto for having taken care of everything
yes they buried her next to her father
did you visit the grave
mateo nods in defeated acknowledgement
the car stops in front of the bungalow that functions as the reception desk for the complex
judit and little diego exit
judit helps mateo out
mateo remains glued to the ground
he cant move
judit stares at him
even though mateo had renounced being mateo he has inherited his most painful memories
being near the reception bungalow and thus near the bungalow where he lived with magdalena generates some kind of spasm in him that keeps him from moving
he feels an intense heat inside and outside of him as if he were approaching a bonfire the flames of which would slowly scorch him were he to move
perhaps well have to inlay the image with the flames of an imaginary conflagration
the face contorted
weakened you go
ill wait for you on the beach
the idea excites little diego
i also want to go to the beach
he approaches mateo and instinctively grabs his hand
judit watches the couple
the situation unfolds before she can stop it
do whatever you need to do
well wait for you there
judit is worried about the wind
she buttons diegos jacket and wraps his scarf around him
she does the same thing with mateo
and dont get too close to the water
to little diego dont let go of his hand
little diego grabs mateos hand
despite the wind the boy is excited about the idea of going to the beach
he has just become mateos guide and mateo lets him guide him like a somnambulist
in the offices of the complex the two employees are in the middle of a brawl
consult with the original in front of the desk judit addresses one of them in english
i am here to pay mateo blancos bill
we dont have anyone here registered by that name
judit gestures that she doesnt understand
its the man who had the accident
he was in bungalow number two
oh you mean harry caine
yes of course
they are not the first to have an accident on that traffic circle
mateo and little diego walk only a few meters past bungalow number two where he lived with magdalena
at that moment they are walking facing the wind a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their clothes
it is as if nature itself wanted to keep mateo from walking away from the bungalow where he loved lena
from this point on his life will become just that an endless battle against the elements and against the memory of lena
little diegos voice distracts him
there are kites
at times little diego forgets that mateo cannot see
so he points toward the sky of a nearby beach whose surface is dotted by various kites
mateo is grateful for the life affirming sound of the boys voice and so he allows himself to be towed
the winds violent sweep over all the different elements that compose the landscape creates a symphony of strange sounds
judit using the key she was handed at the reception desk opens the door to bungalow number two
she enters into what had been mateo and lenas love nest
she takes the entire space in with one glance she is overtaken as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space
she imagines mateo and lena filling up the space with their presence
a strange modesty comes over her but her curiosity is greater
lenas spirit at least in judits mind hangs in the air but in the material surrounding her absence is absolute
those who took her body did not leave any trace of lena
not a single object not a single dress
ernesto seniors cohorts or ernesto himself took all of her things
mateos clothes and things are found piled up in a closet
yet the table where he sat to write remains intact
on it the photograph of the embrace on golfo beach still rests along with his notebook blank pages and some envelopes
judit observes the photograph on golfo beach as if it were alive still palpitating
and she imagines that the two lovers locked in an embrace lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand are mateo and lena
she opens the desks drawer and much to her surprise finds it overflowing with torn photographs of mateo and lena shuffled in no particular order one might say they had
been thrown violently into the drawer
the violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has left its pulsating mark
judit picks up all the pieces slowly and delicately and she places them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to mateos notebook
her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the expression on her face
at the base of the complex on one end of the beach the car that brought them is waiting
judit places the bags with mateos belongings which she has just carried from the bungalow inside the trunk
she raises her head emotionally exhausted
from where she stands she can see little diego ecstatic in front of a group of surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of kites around eight
or ten darting through the sky like flying fish
mateo is motionless in front of the sea soaking up its strength
judits pain is at odds with the boys joy and the overwhelming vitality that the place exudes at that very moment
she begins to walk toward mateo and little diego
once she is a few meters away she observes a surfer riding a wave
in the foreground of her line of sight stands mateo out of focus
as he comes into focus judit yells out to him harry
it seems as though she is invoking the wind a hurricane which moves the waves along with the expert surfers riding them
when he hears judits voice mateo turns to face in her direction and were here judit
and raises his hand like a child judit approaches them petrified with emotion
the wind tears tears from her eyes
we have to go harry
to the boy lets go dieguito
give me your hand
protests politely cant we stay a little longer
we must obey your mother
youve had enough wind for one day
but im already all better
judit walks in front of the blind man and the boy her eyes glitter
mateo has responded to her call and that has filled her with uncontrollable emotion
at this very moment she decides that she will dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man
this is how it will be
diego is still sitting on the floor next to the brown envelope
he sticks on the braille title famara
in front of him spread on the floor like a puzzle lie the pieces of various embraces between mateo and lena like archeological finds like the minoan paintings in crete
the pieces begin to join with one another an order is established and soon the better part of the picture is clear
there are four photographs where regardless of the missing pieces one can make out the image
two are of embraces and the rest are of domestic scenes
the scratches on the four photographs reveal the passing of time
neither of the two men speak
mateo remains seated at his desk
they prepare to watch hear a dvd
diego goes over harrys collection even though one would imagine he knows it
on the spines the titles are written in braille
he has already asked him what he would like to watch he reads off some titles in general all the movies are made prior to all classics
play elevator to the gallows and take a look at the ending
while he looks for it
do you always watch the same movies
since i know them by heart i can visualize the action
is there any new movie youd want to see
but youd have to describe the action
your mother used to describe some to me some time ago
i wouldnt mind doing so
i would like to watch one by tarantino or scorsese and also some asian cinema
they pick a movie chosen by mateo
diego hooks up the television then inserts the dvd
images of mateo blancos last film girls and suitcases appear on a random television station it is the beginning of one of the sequences of which the spectator is already
for harry it is all a shock there is not doubt that it is his film
it is the sequence where magdalena wearing a cast opens the door for her friend chon
pina limps toward the door
through the peephole she sees her friend chon looking back with an exaggerated look of reproach what a drag
she opens not very welcoming oh its you
in front of the television having heard only those two phrases harry jumps up as if propelled by springs
thats girls and suitcases
diego observes him and then looks at the television
turn up the volume
sitting on the floor next to the television diego turns up the volume
harry focuses on the sounds from the screen and diego on everything else
they are supposed to be good friends
chon has an endearing appearance she is a little chubby well dressed according to her age forty and her profession a counselor for social affairs
spontaneous and direct she is kind of a bette midler in her forties but the actress is lacking grace and her restlessness reveals more about her fear of running into
the moving camera than about the very funny way that the character inhabits her own anxiety
lena is also quite languid lacking spark tired and unenthusiastic
as a comedy its without charm and as a drama its uninteresting thats what the critics said
reproachful ive left you a thousand messages
a thousand from you and none from ivan
as if ivans phone call depended on chon
harry twitches around in his chair anxious and impatient
he doesnt like what he hears
sees the suitcase sitting in the middle of the loft
looks at it as if it were some strange insect
and this suitcase
hes leaving me
and the cast on your leg
his ex wife the crazy one
she pushed me down the stairs and i broke my leg
all said without any spark
the actresses are reciting the text mechanically and they appear tired of interpreting it
well were in good shape
i also broke up with my husband
diego and harry are still staring at the television
harry with his ear turned toward the screen disappointed and tense
diego is more indulgent of the scene
annoyed theyre terrible
each of the men focus their respective senses on the television screen
how could i have thought these takes were the good ones
what was i thinking
with the same fury with which he had thrown down the newspaper with the bad review of his film onto the sand he abruptly shuts off the television monitor
he remains suspended for a few moments as if trying to find an explanation for what he has just heard
was he so caught up in magdalenas problems that he was unable to distinguish when a take was good or bad
the next morning harry wakes up early
he has spent an entire night thinking about the same thing
dressed in a bathrobe but not showered yet he walks over to his desk
all these scenes take place in the dark
a faint light from the breaking dawn enters through the corners of the drapes that cover the windows
he opens the drawer with the photographs
when diego had opened it before we had been able to see that along with the photographs there were other objects for example luis notebook the editor
diego had not mentioned any of this to harry
harry pokes around in the drawer with his hands finds the notebook
he grabs it
he opens it on top of his desk
he touches the different pages
the tips of his finger tips run over the numbers corresponding to the sequences the shots the selected takes attempting to find a message
harry walks over to diegos room with the notebook in hand
the boy is naked drying himself with a towel after his shower
harry asks permission to enter
may i come in
drying himself yes come in
not giving him time to get dressed harry hands him the notebook
luis the editor sent it to me six years ago
at that time i didnt even bother to open it i didnt want to know anything about him
i am now thinking that perhaps he had something to tell me
would you mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there is something else written
diego looks through it carefully
the last pages are empty
the rest only have the numbers pertaining to the sequences the shots and the selected takes like we have seen in the sequence with the moviola
although there is something written on the last page
my new number
at the end he says this is my new number a numbers written down
harry hands him his mobile phone
call him please
its too early
it doesnt matter
diego dials the number and hands the phone to harry
may i get dressed
oh im sorry
he turns around and leaves
he exits the bedroom and heads for his dark den
on the phone could i speak to luis please
surprised luis died six years ago
oh i am so sorry
i had no idea
it was cancer
im his widow
who are you
luis edited all my films
more serene mateo blanco
luis spoke to me about you
i am his second wife
the one i know is nieves the first one
we married twelve years ago
sincere and sorrowful i am sorry to hear about luis death
i would have liked to speak to him
he would have liked so too
once he was quite ill and didnt want to speak to anyone he would always tell me that if it was you i should hand him the phone
harry keeps silent
you have no idea how sorry i am
diego is in the kitchen
he is preparing breakfast both for himself and mateo
harry heavy hearted approaches the kitchen pensive
a half hearted happy birthday escapes diegos lips
harry doesnt react perhaps he hasnt heard him
noticing the look on his face diego is not eager to insist
whats going on
i just found out he died six years ago
diego remains silent and lets harry continue talking
not long before he died he sent me this notebook
but i didnt want to know anything about him i also didnt know he was dying
and i put it away
his wife just told me he would have liked to speak to me that was the purpose of sending me the notebook
but i didnt give him the chance
had you spoken since the accident
diego places plates with toast and juice on the table
he serves harry some coffee and adds sugar
the coffee is in front of you
harry finds the cup easily
are you ok
would you like me to stay here
youre heading out
my mother arrives today
i would like to be home when she arrives
i didnt know she was arriving
i didnt either she left me a message this morning
shes coming to celebrate your birthday with us
its my birthday
it seems so
todays the he tells him the day does that sound right
a day like today fifty one years ago i entered the world
judit returns from location scouting
she enters her house
she hugs her son effusively
she drops a large suitcase with wheels
the sequence takes place in various rooms in the house
from the foyer she should move toward the bedroom or the kitchen where she makes herself some tea or where she opens bags full of food that shes brought typical
to the region shes just visited
she looks inside the refrigerator and doesnt find anything
things like that
i was dying to see you
are you ok my son
i was very worried about you
mateo has looked after me day and night
youre not calling him harry
diego had not realized
todays his birthday we must get him something
what have you been up to all this time
as if it were something strange talking
judit looks at her son
she finds him different
as if all the confidences shared with harry had left a physical and visible mark on him
diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking
so what happened to you
sort of joking i dont know if i should believe the thing about the stomach flu you two used that as an excuse in a script
elusive i suffered
but i would rather not speak of that right now
irritated by the surprise what kind of accident
its hard to explain
orders him annoyed try to
i am not that stupid
lets leave it for another time yes
i am all well now
judit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the same way that she could before she left on her trip
those two weeks have irreversibly changed him
whats wrong with you diego
im doing just fine
im going to buy a present for mateo
repeats for mateo
offended she doesnt want her son to think she is a drag so she makes an effort not to bombard him with questions call him however you wish
thats the advantage of having two names
diego disappears and leaves her in mid sentence
is this his way of avenging himself
perhaps his reaction is unfair but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother answering thousands of questions regarding an accident when there has been another accident that he
is much more intrigued by and that she has kept silent for fourteen years
the maid may be around mateo goes to open the door
judit has the key in one hand and a huge flower bouquet in the other
they greet each other enthusiastically
mateo harry attempts to hug her but his arms collide with the flowers
wait my arms are full
are those flowers
mateo and judit talk they are sitting on a sofa the conversation is already mid way
thank you for looking after diego
i dont know how to thank you
youve been looking after me for fourteen years now
judit brushes his acknowledgement off with a half smile
ive found him somewhat hostile
he left without telling me what it was that happened
will you tell me
i dont know
it should be your son to tell you
judit is upset by both of their evasiveness
what is wrong with the two of you
why is it that he suddenly is not calling you harry but mateo
he evades the first question but responds to the second one
two weeks ago at the place where he d
s by mistake he grabbed a friends drink that had been spiked with g
he thought it was his drink both drinks had coca cola
its a very dangerous drug when its mixed with alcohol and diego had already had two cuba libres before he drank from his friends glass
he was badly affected
he spent two days in urgent care after that i brought him here
judit looks at him horrified
she cant seem to comprehend such a turbulent and simple story
diegos a drug addict
ive told you he drank from the glass containing liquid ecstasy by mistake
but how can one make a mistake with something like that
at first glace one cannot tell the difference
both glasses contained coca cola
its not the first time it happens
judit sighs defenseless and horrified
diego has not told you so that you wouldnt be alarmed
that i wouldnt be alarmed
well he hasnt succeeded
at some point he will have to speak to me no
he is wanting to do so
judit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it
is that so
because i ask him and he doesnt answer
then you should try answering him when he asks you
judit smokes in silence she is curious to know what mateo and diego have been talking about in her absence but she doesnt dare ask mateo
the two of you are acting very differently
both of you
you both have changed
she laments it as if she had been put aside and they had not taken her into account
judit and mateo are having something to drink
mateo tilts his head subtly in front of judit
you smell good
insecure i have put on some makeup and i am dressed as a woman
whats the dress like
judit describes it with few words and almost shyly
and the hair
how are you wearing your hair
its been so long since ive asked you that i dont even know whether its long or short
the fact that mateo betrays that type of interest flatters and disconcerts her
i havent changed much harry
i am wearing my hair short
short like jean seberg in breathless
like joan of arc on the bonfire
like liza minnelli in cabaret
or like yul brynner
short or rather very short like that of all fortysomethings who want to appear younger
i am sure it looks good on you
thanks for dressing up for me judit
diego looks at them amused
he hands mateo three dvds scorseses goodfellas or the coen brothers fargo tarantinos kill bill and kiarostamis taste of cherry
near them on the bar table two couples talk excitedly as if they were about to go on a ride at an amusement park
the barman tells them they may now enter
once theyve crossed the doorway a man signals them to follow him
hes a blind man that like mateo moves smoothly he knows the place by heart
the restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness all the waiters men and women are blind
the one in charge of mateo diego and judit introduces himself my name is javier
how many are you
there is not a single light inside
the following sequences take place in absolute darkness
please grab onto each others shoulders and follow me in indian file
i will guide you to your table
its number eight
what is the idea here harry
we are dinning in darkness
you didnt know this maam
anxious feeling slightly ridiculed no
you should have been warned but dont worry
people get used to it after a few minutes
they have arrived to their table as signaled by the waiter
table number eight
he tells them where to sit
imagine that your plate is the face of a watch
your silverware is at h and at h
your glass at h
bread at h
each of them reaches for the objects as indicated by the waiter around an imaginary clock
judit still believes this is some kind of joke and that the lights will come on at any moment and that something spectacular will appear before her eyes
if she had been able to see she would have been witness to the very interesting scenes surrounding her
two couples kissing with bestial enjoyment
and a well bred woman performing fellatio on the man sitting next to her
no one sees them except our camera
harry what is all this about
the waiter responds
we want our clients to discover that the lack of sight harnesses the other senses
touch taste smell and sound will acquire a special intensity tonight maam
i hope youll enjoy them
judit says nothing
she hides her nervousness in order not to ruin mateos night he seems fascinated with the place and completely unaware of the process she is now living the discovery of
a bottomless pit
will the gentlemen be drinking something
bring us a bottle of wine to toast
the waiter leaves them
slowly judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into anxiety
the evening feels far from a party but she doesnt want to spoil it for either mateo or diego
she hears mateo explaining to i found out about this place in the newspaper and i wanted to check it out
its a german idea there are various restaurant like this one theyre totally in fashion
cant believe what shes hearing
darkness in fashion
i dont understand
judit pours herself some water and drinks
and she gets depressed in silence
she lights a cigarette
javier the waiter arrives with the wine
he tells judit she cant smoke
she puts out the cigarette
on the floor
to enliven the occasion diego proposes a toast
mateo pours the glasses
they each grab one
clumsily they bring them close until they can her the sound of the crystal clinking
we must look into each others eyes
she has already said it and its too late when she thinks of retracting it
well were kind of screwed
they attempt to clink glasses
it is not such an easy task
the three glasses head for each other in the darkness it would have been easiest to have all three meet at the center but instead each opts to find the
only mateo puts his forward and leaves it in place waiting for the other two to find his
when this happens judits glass collides with too much force breaks his glass and wine spills all over the table cloth
mateo attempts to make light of the situation as if nothing had happened
he presses his fingers into the wine that has spilled on the tablecloth and exclaims joy
to judit bring your ear to me so that i can sprinkle some wine behind it
its for good luck
judit attempts to heed his request she leans forward offering her head parallel to the table
mateo cant quite find her ear
her head topples onto the table without strength and she bursts into tears
show both terraces the exterior one and the glass enclosed one
the sequence begins once all three of them judit diego and harry are seated and drinking
judits emotional state has not improved
the short sequence of events that shes had to live through since her arrival have been making her increasingly tense and worried
she is trying to combat the letdown by way of gin and tonic
they are sitting on one extreme of the ellipsis that makes up the glass enclosed terrace decorated with cheesy deco motifs
at the center where the bar is located two or three waiters prepare to clean up the tables
once in a while they look over at the only three remaining clients
once in a while they are also able to catch judits words
and once in a while the waiters function as the audience witnessing a theatrical production
although on this occasion the setting is real and so is the drama
judit sips down the gin and tonic quite rapidly
mateo and diego accompany her
i dont know what youve been talking about these past days
a topic which they have waited to broach since she arrived from her trip
neither of the two men respond but they are both made uncomfortable by the comment
but i do know what i havent talked to you about all these years
mateo directs his face toward her surprised and polite
ive never asked you
but you must have asked yourself a thousand times
this is my birthday gift mateo
to diego the gift is also for you diego
she takes another sip to draw courage but shes already gathered enough momentum to mateo after you disappeared ernesto senior thought only of his revenge
a plan had occurred to him but to carry it out he had to bribe at the very least both luis and me
it wasnt an issue we both sold ourselves without hesitation
luis and i
with me he had the courtesy to provide an alibi he proposed that i leave for a month and a half to the united states to the mayo clinic so
that diego could undergo a cure for his aspergillosis that way i wouldnt have to be present while he destroyed the movie because that was his plan to make a mess out of the film
i opted to stay in madrid and have diego undergo his cure here
i wanted to witness everything
if i was going to betray you i wanted to pay the full price
what a living hell
for both of you
you said it
she takes a deep breath and continues yes
it was torture to watch ernesto select the worst takes of each shot and luis edit them together turning your film into a monster briefly tears
the only way of withstanding that was to suffer more
overcome i sold myself to ernesto because of my pain and jealousy
i couldnt take it and i couldnt then forgive you for having abandoned cinearte with lena without saying a word
my betrayal was my revenge against you against her and against myself
the only innocent one was diego
to diego forgive me my son for the bitterness that youve had to absorb all these years
no one deserves to grow up like this
she approaches the bar table
she orders another gin and tonic
the waiter doesnt dare to tell her theyve already closed so he serves her
with the glass in her hand judit returns to the table where mateo and diego wait expectantly
she has observed them whispering but she hasnt heard what they have said
she sits down with them
judit takes a sip
interrupts her dont continue judit
its not necessary
now that you once again call yourself mateo i have no excuse
judit takes a sip from her drink to gather her strength
no one knew where you were
we had no idea
ernesto senior put everything together the premier all that ruckus to see if youd react
his revenge was pointless if neither of you found out about it
pauses ernesto asked me constantly if i knew where you were but i said that i also didnt know anything which was true
somber thats why i never called you but even if you dont believe it i was very worried for you and the boy
i believe you
diego attempts to say that he too believes him but judit doesnt give him time
ernesto hired various detectives to search for you but before they found you you called me two days after the premier
i was too embarrassed to answer and
i still am
when ernesto senior asked me again about you i dont know why i gave him the phone number for famara
mateo and diego listen to her with renewed attention
this new information reveals an unexpected possibility something that neither of the two men had considered
their reaction toward judits painful declaration changes in character
in mateos case his compassion vanishes and is replaced by doubt now incited by new suspicions
ernesto sent his son to find you in lanzarote
images of ernesto junior inside a rented car following the couple across various places on the island including the highway that leads to famara on that last night
he was the one who found you after the accident and called the hospital
did he have something to do with the accident
but i cant stop thinking that had i not given his father the phone number perhaps nothing would have happened
dryly why do you think that
i dont know
categorically if you dont know then stop torturing yourself
he says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly
for judit its like a splash of cold water to the face
the confession rather than ending as a liberating catharsis has devolved in its opposite
the silence is weighed down by suspicion and the new abyss between mateo and judit
never before has judit felt mateo this distant and antagonistic
her dramatic confession far from liberating her has opened new wounds and generated new suspicions
and judit feels taken over by an arid anxiety corrosive unbearable
she almost cant breathe
judit mateo and diego are inside judits car
diego is driving
the three are tense and silent
in silence they arrive at the entrance of the building where mateo lives
mateo is possibly carrying his umbrella or a blind mans cane
he exits the car
judit walks him to the front door
she is glad that mateo cant see her look of embarrassment
destroyed good night
call me if you need anything
mateo doesnt respond
when the entrance door shuts like a resounding no
judit waits until she sees him disappear into the elevator
from judits point of view mateo disappears into the elevator which soon begins to rise
undone and she no longer pretends otherwise judit returns to the car
before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently
diego gets out of the car and holds her by the waist
he attempts to help her
judits face is contorted
she wipes a thread of saliva still hanging from her lips
despite the retching she has not vomited anything other than liquid
touching her forehead you are sweating
its a panic attack
takes a deep breath as if she had lost her wind hand me the purse
diego finds the purse in the car and hands it to her immediately
judit searches through the purse impatiently
she takes the purse and drops all of its contents on the sidewalk
she find a box of tranquilizers
the pill she presses through the aluminum seal comes out with a pop she places it on her tongue
she leans over the car
diego looks at her scared he has never seen her like this
articulating poorly so as to not move her tongue judit say to him this will pass soon
diego hands her a glass of water
once in bed judit takes two sleeping pills
she has overcome the crisis
diego looks at her very concerned
his mother has never shown herself to be so physically fragile
he wants to help her but it doesnt seem like there is anything more he can do than what he already has
judit attempts to smile in order to calm him
i will sleep well with this
do you want me to stay here
in case the panic returns so that you dont feel alone
judit eyes swell with tears
i am feeling better
and ill fall asleep soon
call me if you are not feeling well
he kisses her twice and exits
the curtains that cover a large window that looks out into an interior terrace are made from the same material as those that mateo has in his bedroom
the next day
standing over his desk mateo searches the desk drawer under the computer
there are not many things inside credit cards envelopes with money a jump drive the mp etc
he goes through it meticulously until he finds the note that ray x had left him the day he came to ask him if they could write a script together
ray x has hand written his own telephone number on the note
he goes over it with his fingertips as if he could see through them
he dials a familiar number diegos
diegos mobile phone vibrates four or five times
but diego is sleeping and he doesnt wake up
the mobile phone stops vibrating
in all the scenes where mateo is alone at home he never turns on the light
he will be in the dark lightly illuminated by any light that the cracks in the windows let through
mateo leaves him a message i am sorry to call you so early
tell your mother to call me as soon as she can
as usual mateo buys his newspaper at the same news agent
he turns his body toward the modeling agency but no one there enters or exits whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar
there are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all heading like zombies to work
he enters the bar where his waiter friend works
the place has just opened
there are very few clients
he greets him
why here so early
i couldnt sleep
would you mind dialing this number
he hands him the phone and the piece of paper where ray xs number is written
diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and judit
he works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a generous and varied breakfast toast juice coffee and tea marmalade toasted bread spread with
oil and tomato etc
judit appears through one of the kitchen doors calm with a look of having rested but also with the hangover of having survived a nightmarish day the day before
diego does not hear her approach
the mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender smile
when diego turns to look the tenderness disappears a little more out of modesty and a lack of habit
in any case judit enjoys the peacefulness of the moment her son caring for her after the storm
judit looks over the culinary display
i am specializing in breakfasts
i would do the same for mateo
judits expression changes now a bit more somber
are you ok
yes still a bit beaten down dont worry about last night
its horrible but it only happens occasionally and i know how to stop it
it scared me it seemed as though an alien would pop out of your stomach
its not a bad way of describing a panic attack
changing the topic one can tell shes made the decision before she arrived in the kitchen
diego there was one last thing i didnt tell you yesterday
assuming it will be painful he attempts to dissuade her about mateo
you can tell me some other time
now its time for breakfast
if i dont tell you now i may never do so
at the end of the eighties in to be exact
the year of punk
yes in the year of punk mateo and i became involved
in a love affair
we were just getting started in film and we are still at it but our love affair ended at least on his side
that didnt keep us from working together
i knew all that or i imagined it
theres one more thing
mateo is your father
diego looks at her astonished
and that fleeting lover my supposed biological father
you made him up
can hide things
but i never make things up
i dont know how to make up
the fleeting lover existed he was gay and our affair was short lived
his name was vicente and it was while i was with him that you were conceived but your biological father was mateo not vicente
still thinking about what he has just heard diego places the breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of tea
judit begins to drink it one tiny sip at a time
assimilates the news
he is not displeased does mateo know
at that time he asked me and i denied it of course
i didnt want to put pressure on him i didnt want our relationship to change because of it
after all i had never asked him if he wanted to become a father
the pieces begin to fall together
if you think i made a mistake dont tell me now
we have the rest of our lives for recriminations
diego remains pensive for a moment
i will not recriminate you
i think i like being mateos son the son of a bitch
speaking of he called early this morning
she looks at the clock and its h
what did he want
for you to call him as soon as you could
surprised tense that i call him
why in the world have you not awakened me
because after what happened last night you needed to sleep
he didnt say it was urgent
you can call him now
judit grabs her sons phone agitated once again and dials mateos number
in the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where he is
all one can see is a bit of a curtain out of focus
attempts to appear calm since her confession her voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker diego has told me to call you
are you ok
do you need anything
this is what shes most worried about
almost with irony i am not alright judit
and yes i do need something
the forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last film in order to edit it
i am at the home of ernesto junior and i just found out the material was destroyed in
i imagined something like this i just didnt think it would have happened that soon
with urgency let me explain
cuts her off no
i am in a hideous mood judit and i dont want to take it out on you
surprised and alarmed what are you doing at ernestos house
the shot opens up and we discover ernesto junior at the other end of the room next to a mm camera on a tripod recording everything that mateo says and
does while he searches around in some drawers
i think i am going to bribe him
we need money i dont want diego back at that damn bar
i want to pay diego a salary we need money and he has money to throw
the studio has a different configuration than when his father lived but we recognize the place nonetheless when the father was alive the space served a different purpose
ernesto looks at mateo fearlessly he is still determined to search urgently for something inside the drawers of a chest
the place is a pretty big mess
mateo stop talking crazy
it is not craziness
i cant think of anyone else to blame for magdalenas death
she asks diego to bring her the box of tranquilizers
wait a second
i have something to tell you
let it be you already said enough last night
she takes a pill and yells at him listen to me mateo
as she raises her voice she becomes dominant
i was the production director if you want to know anything about the footage ask me
since you insist i will ask you
what do you have to tell me
in effect ernesto senior asked for it to be destroyed
very shortly after the release of that aberration
in any case sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material
and that was many years ago
thats not anything that i dont already know
as the films producer i was the only one who had access to the lab
to all the material
after i gave the order to have everything destroyed i intercepted it
and i kept it
i have all of it at home
you are lying to me
i didnt tell you this last night because i didnt realize you wanted to edit it
i took everything all the double takes the internegative the sound tapes
you can have it whenever you want
the silence on the other end of the line reassures her
that changes everything
begs please get out of that place leave ernesto alone
he had nothing to do with this
mateo looks over at ernesto junior
the camera is still on its tripod rolling
i am not so sure
he has yet to explain what he was doing in lanzarote
ill let you go it seems he wants to talk
hangs up ernesto finally finds a dvd
he has it in his hand and brings it toward mateo
his hand enters into view on the screen of the mm camera
here is a copy of the making of
and why would i want that
i cant watch it
plus im not interested
ernesto takes his hand and places the dvd softly onto it
have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it
this dvd proves that i wasnt responsible for the accident
oh and even if my father had asked me to harm you i never would have
you are very important to me mateo
ernesto speaks naturally for the first time mateo takes him seriously
diego is watching the images of the making of while mateo works out on his treadmill
at the last moment an instant prior to being struck by the suv mateo and lena kiss inside the car
they are then distracted by a noise from the car that is about to hit them
these images have been recorded from inside a different car which has been following them from behind at a safe distance ernesto juniors car
mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house dripping with sweat
diego has just watched the kiss and the accident
he rewinds and he pauses right at the moment when mateos and lenas kiss fills the whole screen
is there something new i should know about
surprised and moved its a very interesting documentary
and yes in effect ernesto followed you to lanzarote until the last moment
the images are there
those of the last night
they take a look at the images that ernesto taped at el mirador from the outside
through the glass of the large window we see lena and mateo talking
he recorded you at a safe distance while you were on you way back after dinner
the scene is lit by the light of his headlights
its not a lot but enough to see what happened
not only did he not have anything to do with the accident he saved your life
mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see it taking in the information diego gives him
and one more e thing when you were at the traffic circle before the suv crashed into to you you and lena kiss
i dont remember it
it was an ordinary kiss just one more of the many kisses a couple gives each other almost without thinking
pensive the last kiss
even if it sounds cheesy someone has to tell you lena did not die in your arms as you dreamed but the last sensation she experienced in this world was
the taste of your mouth
mateo watches without seeing the television he gets close to the screen
with his fingertips he caresses the surface literally touching lenas last kiss
shots of mateos hand caressing the screen with the image of the kiss
shot of diego observing the entirety of the scene moved
a shot of everything
the appropriate kind of music accompanies the scene as it begins to fade out bit by bit while a sign appears luis notebook open on given sequences as if luis
were present on this last moment of the definitive editing
an ashtray with a lit cigarette
the hands of the editor powering the avid directing the mouse through all the necessary steps until the screen fills with a block of sequences of girls and suitcases in
the images fill the entire screen of the main narration
it begins with the same sequence diego and mateo watched on television
everything is the same but it plays completely differently
the actresses are funny and fresh
the spectator does not know what the difference is but unconsciously he must feel enthralled by the sequences of pina and chon as if spellbound
pina limps fed up toward the door
looks through the peephole behind it chon
they are good friends but chon is the last person pina wants to see right now
what a drag
she opens not the least bit welcoming
oh its you
i have left you a thousand messages
a thousand from you and none from ivan
looks at the suitcase as if it were a menacing strange bug
what about this suitcase
hes leaving me
she notices that pina is wearing a cast on her leg
and that cast on your leg
his ex wife the crazy one
she pushed me down the stairs
well were in good shape
ive also broken up with my husband
oh sorry to hear it
i will make some coffee i have spent my entire night looking for ivan and i havent gone to bed
neither have i
on her way to the kitchen chon notices through the bedroom door that the bed has been burnt
she bumps into the phone that has been ripped out of its socket now on the floor
she says nothing she doesnt want to pry but she thinks that pinas situation must be more complicated than hers
the chickens are living large free to roam throughout the entire place
when did you leave him
four days ago
i could see it coming
the thing is that after breaking up i go out onto the street and i notice there is this guy looking at me
she also discovers the gazpacho on the kitchen table
oh my gazpacho
can i have a bowl
ive spiked it with an entire box of downers
in case ivan arrived he loves gazpacho
pina my god
throughout the conversation pina makes coffee and prepares a tray of fornassetti cups and the whole bit
and thats not all
since he wasnt calling ive torn the phone from the wall in a moment of rage
ive tripped on the thing but i didnt want to pry
and the bed
i think i noticed it smoking a bit
i dropped a lit match and it began to burn and i didnt want to squelch it
i will have to change the mattress but all for the best
a whole lot of less memories
chon looks at her friend
but excuse me ive interrupted you
you were telling me
she grabs the tray now full with coffee and pastries
lets have breakfast on the terrace
the two women head for the terrace which sits in front of the beautiful backdrop curtain of madrid
chickens and rabbits running around
lots of plants etc
an idyllic and false image
only the feelings are authentic and the womens happy disposition for living in hysteria
struggling with what shes about to say
i was telling you that i also have a suitcase at home
its a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine uncut
pinas eyes open wide
youve become a dealer chon
how could you think that
i am still a counselor for social affairs in the city hall
the suitcase appeared in my closet
imagine the scandal if the police find out
they could put me in jail
i have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as possible
because of the hours we keep politicians consume a lot of drugs
so between my party cohorts and city hall i could distribute two kilos but what do i do with the rest
throw it out
are you crazy
how could i throw it out
i have to keep the police from finding it in my house
i have to take it some other place immediately
but i dont understand
well its clear honey
finishes her question
how is it that the suitcase appeared in your closet
drinks a little coffee and takes a bite from a pastry
as i was telling you after breaking up with my husband i bumped into this guy on the street who kept watching at me good looking well hung
summing up i took him home and screwed him over and over
takes another sip of coffee
an how was he
look at my arm hair
ive got goose bumps
she shows her the hair on her arm standing straight up
hes that kind of guy who knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure
so you lost your mind
what else could i do
so he asked me if he could stay at my place for a few days and i said ok but i couldnt promise anything
i didnt want him thinking that i was that easy
so breathes in he brought the suitcase
he asked me if i cared if he kept it in the closet
he said that he was attached to the suitcase
and well why would i care
breathes in by pure chance i am watching tv last night and i find out that the police have nabbed him in the course of a drug sting operation and
that he is one of the most wanted traffickers
i open the suitcase and i discover that it is filled with little bags of cocaine
i ran out of the house and i havent returned since
pina breathes out in solidarity
what a story my god
i was wondering why he was such a good fuck
for men living in such high stakes conditions each fuck could be the last
she reaches her arm out again
look the goose bumps
once again she shows pina her arm hair standing straight up
ive seen them already
they comes easy for you
and the suitcase
i was going to ask you
if you didnt mind that i brought it here
if they find it in my house well its not about what could happen to me but that its just not an ideal situation for the counselor of social affairs
imagine how upset the mayor would be and my party
my party cant take one more scandal
the doorbell rings the police
shush how could it be the police
no one knows youre here
i am a woman who attracts attention pina
since i was a little girl
just pretend youre here for coffee
pina limps toward the door uncertain
behind it she will find new adventures
she looks back toward chon half smiling tired but charming filled with understanding and a love for life with all its emotions and its contradictions
its with this half smile on magdalenas face that the sequence arrives at its end
mateo judit diego and the new editor somewhat removed from them are seated in front of the editing table they are both moved and entertained
this is hilarious
wants to be sure
it doesnt sound like what we watched on tv right
not at all
this is a whole different thing
judit is the one who is most deeply moved
she may cry but this time her tears will be happy tears welcome tears
its wonderful mateo
we should re release it
the important thing is to finish it
films must be finished
judit keeps crying
