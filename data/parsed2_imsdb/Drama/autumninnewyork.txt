screenplay by allison burnett shooting draft a couple moves down a walkway deep in subdued conversation
all around them trees explode with autumn color
their path is dappled with leafy shadow
to their left on the sunny meadow teenagers throw saucers and footballs smoke cigarettes and joints drink beer and soda savoring the waning hours of summer
he is wills keane late s to early s strikingly handsome impeccably dressed and supremely poised
at first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor
only a closer look hints at the toll of battle
his shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition
his eyes are touched by regret
the lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself
walking at his side is a woman attractive and bright
her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and if the past prevails so many will come after
she listens intently as wills finishes speaking and i could have waited to tell you but i wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding
well you certainly didnt
still talking quietly they pass into a more secluded area of the park no i see how you could feel this way
of course i do
but what i dont get is why youd want to announce it so quickly
i mean we just met
you dont even know me
yes i do
she is amused by his confidence oh really
the minute i laid eyes on you
its the saddest thing about getting older
you know people so quickly
i even knew youd end up hating me
well youre wrong
with a weary smile give it time
then he stops
he hears something
she hears it too
its a girls voice
he casually turns and looks squinting into the sun
he takes a few steps and there between trees he sees two dozen people sitting on the grass and on folding chairs most are middle aged or older with a
distinctly intellectual bohemian look to them
standing and addressing them is charlotte fielding fair willowy pale lovely in an unconventional way
she wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress
her bearing is upright her gaze warm and intelligent her voice rich with emotion and for weeks i sat by her bed and cried
i told her i loved her and i begged her not to leave me
all i could think about was what id lose if she died
and then one night
she was in really bad pain
i stopped thinking about myself for a second and i thought about her
fighting tears i stopped crying
i said goodbye
and in less than an hour ella was gone
the woman whispers in wills ear its so sad
but wills ignores her
he watches charlotte with keen interest touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion
i really think its possible to hold a person back
cry them back
thats what i did to ella and ill never do it to anyone else again
softly i hope no one ever does it to me
she looks out at the group many of whom are crying
a tear runs down her cheek
she smiles and wipes it away
the woman seeing wills interest in the girl whispers so what do you know about her
he knows a great deal
or at least he thinks he does
but his answer is nonchalant that shes just a kid
he takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away
he steals one last look back
charlotte returning to where she was sitting notices wills
their eyes meet and a charge passes between them
meanwhile an old man has risen from his chair i met ella at city college in
wills slowly turns and walks away
a swarm of pedestrians ascends the steps to the bustling street
find charlotte amid the swarm struggling with a load of boxes and shopping bags carrying an antique wood and wire she wears a peasant dress with a cycle jacket a
backpack and another eccentric hat
charlotte makes her way down the leaf strewn pathway
wheeling the mannequin by the neck she passes nyu students smoking laughing and chatting on their way to class
charlotte hauls the mannequin down the block
a young man offers her assistance but she politely and firmly refuses
charlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone street over the curb and up to the stoop of a charming but slightly dilapidated brownstone
charlotte opens the door into the darkness
she hits a light switch and nothing happens
she flips it back and forth shit
she dumps her boxes and bags then wheels in the mannequin
the bulb burned out
eight silhouettes are crouched in the dark room
the mantel is draped with a happy birthday banner
the coffee table is stacked with wrapped gifts
charlotte looks suspiciously at the living room door dolly
she tiptoes through the darkness and lays her ear against it
we hear chuckles and whispers of anticipation
an older womans raspy boozy voice growls my ass hurts
a few people chuckle but theyre quickly hushed
the door knob turns and the door opens
everyone leaps up in a blaze of light the mannequin bursts into the room teetering crazily wearing charlottes jacket backpack and hat
everyone flinches and screams
amid a chorus of laughter charlotte enters
grinning she wags a facetious finger see
an antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser
wills stands before a mahogany mirror buttoning a freshly laundered white shirt
lying on the cradle bed half wrapped in a sheet naked but for a string of pearls is tanya raven haired much too thin
she smokes a cigarette
oh wills please not again
its our third date and were already in a rut
but i thought you loved it
she stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it to the ashtray her ash falls on a new york magazine
on the cover is a photograph of wills standing next to a young chef in a fashionable restaurant
the caption reads the prodigal son returns
oh i do except for the fact that there isnt a single thing on the menu i can eat
with a chuckle sure there is theres just very little youre willing to digest
he slips in a cuff link
she affects a breezy indifference fine then
well go ill get big fat and horrible and itll serve you right
wills slips on a silk tie no it wont
because it takes at least a few weeks to get fat and by then you wont even be speaking to me
curiously why do you say that
he stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror because we have no future
all i can offer you is this
what we have right now
nothing more meaningful
until it ends
he goes back to tying his tie then adds softly i could have waited to tell you but i wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding
she stares at him speechless
its decor is exquisitely tasteful its ambiance warm and convivial
the night is in full swing
most of the tables are taken and the bar is packed
from amid the rush of traffic a taxi breaks free and glides to the curb in front of the restaurant
its facade is windowless
only a small brass plaque on the grey marble reveals that this is elysium
wills and eriko s japanese aloof and stunning emerge from the taxi elegantly dressed and move to the front door
two tipsy debutantes pass wills and eriko as they enter
one recognizes wills and smiles flirtatiously
wills stops and helps eriko off with her jacket
jesus the dashing cuban american maitre d superbly discreet approaches good evening mr
will you be dining with us tonight
we certainly will
table seven jesus if its available
wills hands erikos jacket to melissa the hat check girl how are you melissa
blushing fine mr
celia mid s the chipper blonde midwestern hostess arrives wearing a stunned glassy smile
good evening celia
and how with forced cheeriness just dandy sir thanks
this way please
celia barely making eye contact with eriko walks quickly away
wills is amused and a little confused by celias behavior
he lays a hand on erikos back ill be right with you
eriko nods and follows celia
wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurants manager john volpe a brilliant dapper tough as nails brooklynite stands listening to someone on the telephone
wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear hows it going
covering the phone chaos
the house specialty
easy for you to say ya prick
waltzin in here like you own the joint
wills laughs and takes a look into the bar
john gestures with his head in erikos direction so whos the new potential ex wife
i thought you were still wastin time with tanya von whats her name
we wisely agreed to cut our losses
wills exits into the bar
john smiles and shakes his head
follow wills as he glides along the bar
customers and staff greet him warmly
as he enters the main dining room diners spot him sprinkled among them are celebrities from every walk of city life
wills greets them stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks
suddenly celia the hostess red faced blocks his path look i have no right to say this okay
and you can fire me if you want but in the six weeks weve been open youve brought in six different women tonight makes seven and its really starting to
get to me
in what way
i have to greet them
its like working at a dog shelter
im afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because i know any minute they could be put down
i assure you its an absolutely painless procedure
shocked she cant help but sputter a laugh it is
beat especially for me
they both laugh
he moves closer lowers his voice and speaks with warm sincerity actually i appreciate your concern celia
the truth is im a little worried myself
ive been trying to do better
you know how it is
old habits die hard
so im not fired
in fact johns been looking for an assistant
tell him youve just been promoted
wills smiles pats her in the shoulder and moves on
she cant believe it
a waiter carrying a birthday cake blazing with candles and decorated with a womans hat made of meringue latticework passes by on his way to the rear dining room
from inside voices begin to sing happy birthday
wills his curiosity piqued follows
the waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table
theres a cheer and applause as the song ends
wills cannot see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view
just as wills is about to exit the room the waiter steps away
wills glances over and sees the birthday girl
at first he cant place her but then he does and his face softens and brightens
she wears a black velvet dress and a wonderfully eccentric hat
her eyes glow in the candlelight
through the chorus of voices urging her to make a wish she cries out you guys
let me think
charlotte blows hard and with a little more effort than you might expect extinguishes the candles
everyone applauds and cheers
to charlottes right sits simon loring late s english sardonic adoring
he gestures at her chest and says watch carefully everyone they ought to begin emerging any moment now
charlotte playfully slaps him very funny
actually any moment now youre gonna turn straight and fall at my feet
oh darling you know i would if i could
charlottes best friend shannon harris a spoiled but big hearted redhead drowning in curls mutters the only time he falls at your feet now is when he wants to borrow
your prada loafers
back to wills
he considers approaching charlotte but then he looks back and sees eriko sitting alone at their table idly stabbing at her drink with a straw
regretting his rudeness he takes a step toward her but then hears is that wills keane
he turns and sees dolores talbot blonde wig spindly frame weathered skin large sad eyes
she holds a mixed drink it sure as hell is and he hasnt changed a bit
im sorry do i you little fool its dolores talbot
his smile shows uneasy surprise my god it is
yeah i know times kicked my ass but good
come on romeo lets bury the hatchet
give me a hug
careful of the cocktail
as he hugs dolores he cant help but look over at charlotte again
so what the hellre you doin around here
last i heard you were out in earthquake country blowin the family fortune
actually i doubled it
good for you
she looks over
her view is such that she sees wills but not dolores
a faint blush creeps into charlottes cheeks
she pretends to listen as shannon tells a story and you know how bouncers get
hes like thats the worst fake i
ive ever seen
and im like yeah
well you have the worst dread extensions
and then just when noticing charlottes distraction simon whispers calmly to her are you feeling all right
you look positively green
charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips hes here
and hes staring at me again
both shannon and simon turn to look but like lightning charlotte grabs them both dont
to simon wait a few seconds then go to the bathroom
how will i know him
and much older
getting up if hes rich you might have a fight on your hands
charlotte watches furtively as simon rises from his chair and walks over
as he passes wills he flashes him a seductive smile
wills is confused by it
shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof vacant stare in wills direction
then she looks back at charlotte mouth agape hes as old as my dad
back on wills
he does his best to be attentive as dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face sure l
s okay if youre a cactus or a lizard but if youre a new englander your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf
it only took me twenty years to come to my senses
so whatre you doin now
you owned some restaurants out there didnt you
she sits listening to shannon and so after all that we pay our cover we get in and its totally heinous
nothing but losers and charlotte looks over and pales her eyes widening oh shit
dolores walks up hauling wills by the arm kids
i want you to meet an old chum of mine the owner of this fine establishment wills keane
the table greets him
wills slightly self conscious looks at everyone but charlotte
and that over theres the birthday girl my granddaughter charlotte
the news hits wills hard
but he does his best to hide it
he musters a casual smile not katie and jays daughter
she got her height from her dad
but her talents all katies
dolores indicates the hat that charlottes wearing made it herself from scratch
that one too
to shannon honey show im
shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat shes wearing
the table laughs
wills levels his gaze at charlotte impressive
try as she might to accept the compliment with grace charlotte cant help but grin
the wine steward stands at a station on which sit two bottles of champagne on ice
he reaches for one
wills stops him i think we can do better than that
the steward understanding nods and departs taking the champagne with him
happy birthday charlotte
under her breath twenty years old and never been
laughing shut up
amused he flashes charlotte his most dazzling smile
ill let you get back to your celebration
kissing dollys cheek a pleasure to see you again
wills turns to exit
simon returning to his seat murmurs seductively to wills as he passes by leaving so soon
wills looks at him confused again then continues on
as simon sits he mutters to charlotte be still my beating heart
beat or is that your heart
whisper to charlotte youre not really into him are you
charlotte turns to dolores who has just sat down
hey dolly how do you know him
uneasily from newport
old friend of your moms
dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake
a gentle breeze tickles a white lace curtain
a phone rings
charlotte standing in the small antiquated kitchen wearing flannel pajamas tenses when she hears the phone ringing upstairs
she snatches an apple from a bowl and dashes out of the room
follow charlotte running through the dining room
into the living room
into the foyer
and up a dark staircase
a startling clash of childhood adolescence and womanhood
everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to volumes of great literature
charlotte bangs in flings herself on the bed and grabs the phone okay bitch im ready
wills sits in his woolen robe holding a portable phone
amused he smiles into the morning sun for what
oh my god im so sorry
who is this
her heart stops
she sits up slowly her body tensed
who did you think it was
my friend simon actually
he always calls me the morning after to sort of
sum everything up
and how would you sum it up charlotte
kinda cool kinda creepy
anyway you wanna speak to my grandmother
with a chuckle i dont think so
olivia s wills jamaican cook and housekeeper enters
plump handsome and perpetually amused she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a new york times
wills mouths a greeting
she smiles back and sets the tray on a table
i called because im going to be attending a benefit
a black and white ball
and id like you to design a hat
for my date
its a gift
i dont have her measurements but shes about your size
whatre you a six
good then lets assume your hat size is also the same
but that doesnt necessarily its a risk well just have to take
charlotte runs over to her sewing table looking for a pen and paper
she finds paper but no pen her dress is a sheath
the hat must of course be black or white or both
she finds a pen but it doesnt work
she grabs an eyeliner and uses that any particular style
sipping his coffee no just plenty of it
how long will it take
a week or two
you have till thursday
ill need it here by seven oclock
im at the pembroke on central park west and th
whats your fee
faltering i dont really have one
i usually just make them for friends
hows five hundred dollars
his tone has abruptly shifted its intimately hushed
it both daunts and excites her yeah
you say wow a lot
it has to stop
youre a woman now
she clicks off the phone wilts into a swoon on the bed and breaks out laughing
wills still holding the receiver stares dreamily into the middle distance
he snaps to when olivia enters
her accent is as much queens as it is caribbean see now you got me worried
what do you mean
you slept alone last night
you must be sick or somethin
you want me to call a doctor
thank you no im fine
she throws him a sly sidelong glance then exits
wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee
from the next scene we hear the sound of squealing laughing surrounded by swarming parents and kids wills stands with john the manager of elysium and his wife sarah volpe
who gazing out of frame keeps a watchful eye on their kids save it pal
dont even bother
i may not have gone to a fancy school like bendover to sarah that would be andover
sure if his folks could have afforded it
but when wills keane comps three bottles of dom to a twenty year old girl then tells me he did it cause he likes the kids grandma i smell a
looking around oh is that what that is
i figured there was a dirty diaper somewhere
lightly okay i admit it she interests me
turning to sarah hes gonna do it
i dont believe it
he moved us back here for nothing
so much for that turned leaf
amused come on youre overreacting
is that what you think
buddy since we hit town i have done nothin but cut you slack
every week a new woman on your arm and i didnt say a word
cause i figured at least theyre in the right demographic
maybe by accident youll trip over something substantial
but this little girl
best she could be is miss rights daughter
uneasily i know
its just that theres something about her
and i just thought shes young
im on the verge of menopause
why not go for it
wills and sarah meet eyes
there wouldnt be much point in lying to you would there
sarah shakes her head
mommy daddy look look
molly and carla the volpes five year old twin daughters run up beaming each carrying a huge stuffed animal
hey theyre bigger than you are
john scoops both his daughters up in his arms and kisses them repeatedly
wills watches his eyes filling with a vague wistful envy
he sees sarah staring at him
she smiles sympathetically
the furniture is antique and dark
the white walls are tinged with yellow from years of cigarettes
in one corner the paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate
dolores sits on a worn out leather arm chair smoking sipping a cocktail watching a daytime talk show
in the background we see charlotte working in the adjoining dining room which she has turned into a lovely sewing room
closer on charlotte
she builds her hat on a hat block a wooden mannequin head
strewn all around her are the materials of her hatmaking bolts of cloth hat blocks a sewing table
shannon wearing sweats and a t shirt lies on the floor eating m ms and drinking diet soda while heavily marking up a text book with a yellow highlighter
charlotte stops and rubs her eyes then she glances down at shannon and smiles why dont you mark what isnt important
that way youll save ink
why dont you sew your mouth to my butt
that way youll stop annoying me
they both laugh
overhearing dolores croaks facetiously now now if you two kids cant play nice shannon rolls over onto her back god i hate school
charlotte pins a strip of black lace to the hat oh come on just last week you said you were on a roll
you loved it
well now im on the rag and i hate it
charlotte chuckles and sets the half finished hat on her head
still seated she wheels her work chair over to a mirror i think youre incredibly lucky
id love to be going to college
shannon rolls over and looks at her
suddenly her expression is inexplicably solemn am i the most spoiled brat in the world or what
spoiled brats dont even ask questions like that
re the hat what do you think
she models the hat
tears well in shannons eyes and she says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality that youre the most beautiful person in the entire world
charlotte smiles looks away and trying not to cry fusses with the hat
a cold autumn rain falls
the irish doorman michael s melancholy stoop shouldered smokes a cigarette looking up at the unburdening sky
a limousine pulls up
the passenger window glides down mikey
how ya doin
a bit early arent you
hey in this soup better safe than sorry you know what i mean
running footsteps approach
the driver looks too
its charlotte dressed in tattered jeans a light rain coat and sneakers dashing at breakneck speed down the street carrying something in a garbage bag
she runs right past michael michael works the shiny brass controls
charlotte winded hair dripping wet watches the numbers tick by overhead
michael smiles at her with paternal fondness hes goin to a fancy party tonight
charlotte nonplused by his lack of discretion smiles politely oh really
the elevator doors open
watch your step miss
she emerges moves to wills door and waits for the elevator to close
when it does she hurries back to a table over which hangs a gilded mirror
she takes a lovely old hat box out of the garbage bag and ditches the bag under the table
then she quickly checks herself in the glass
she doesnt like what she sees
she pokes at her sopping hair and squeezes it but its hopeless
remembering the time she hurries back to the door takes a deep breath and rings the bell
then she hears footsteps approaching
she realizes shes left the hat box on the table
she rushes over and grabs it just in time to get back to the door when it opens
olivia the housekeeper steps out wearing her coat and carrying her purse
her voice is low and gentle hes waitin for you miss fieldin
they exchange cordial smiles
charlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings carpeted with a persian runner and lighted by three antique sconces
she walks slowly terribly self conscious
the room is vast furnished with antiques decorated with the same masculine good taste
charlotte enters timidly then hears what happened
she looks and sees wills standing back turned before a broad set of high windows
city lights glimmer in the distance beneath them lies the vast gloom of central park
i couldnt get a cab so i took the subway
only it was an express and it didnt stop at you realize dont you that youre a full eighteen minutes late
im so sorry
i wills turns around
a magnificent figure expertly tailored tux every hair in place freshly manicured
and then he offers her an amused reassuring smile charlotte relax
whats the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isnt to keep your admirers waiting
in fact you disappoint me i was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense
flattered her face brightens i could leave and come back
nope too late
anyway i want to see the hat
he walks over to her
smiling she sets down the box unties the ribbon and gingerly removes the hat
its sublimely simple and elegant
she looks at him with hope
his face betrays nothing try it on
its all right
charlotte a little confused carefully sets the hat on her head
she steps to a wall mirror pulls the veil down and sets it at the correct angle
wills appears behind her and shares the reflection
she feels his presence hears his breathing
they speak in hushed tones its perfect
its like a tiny sculpture
i wanted it to be a tiny poem
their eyes meet in the glass
if only i had some use for it
off her look my date canceled a few hours ago
i dont know
she was vague
like to come in her place
charlotte cant believe it
she smiles at his reflection
the outfit i bought her is hanging in the guest room closet
anxiously its okay
are you sure
amused of course
he gestures toward the half open door on other side of the room
charlotte turns and biting her lip looks at the door then back at wills then back at the door
a spectacular affair is in full swing a benefit for the metropolitan museum of art attended by five hundred guests from high society dressed only in black and white
a large band plays everything from waltzes to jazz to swing
guests sitting in ornate boxes look down on the marble dance floor where a waltz is in progress
find wills and charlotte dancing together
charlotte looks sophisticated and beautiful beyond measure wearing a sleeveless black sheath with a fake fur wrap and of course her hat
youre very good
where did you learn
the woman whose memorial you crashed
so you did see me there
and the next time i saw you you were on the cover of new york magazine
and i had to pick a place for my birthday
it takes a few beats for wills to put it together
he smiles realizing that her presence at elysium wasnt a coincidence
she smiles back sweetly coyly
on the perimeter find two rich women s too thin too lifted watching wills and charlotte waltz
they stand with lisa unassuming fair haired simply dressed
of course he moved back
i mean hed already seduced every a and b list actress in town
what was left for him
lisa looks at her feigning naivety
the c list
but if what i hear is true and hes shopping for a bride i can tell you one thing hes barking up the wrong tree there
why do you say that
with an icy smile good wives are rarely found up cherry trees
the women share a laugh
lisa slightly discomposed looks back at wills and charlotte
wills and charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad
wills seems entranced by her easy manner of expression i met ella in the fourth grade
she was my teacher at the little red school house
we stayed friends after she retired
she taught me how to cook and sew
basically enjoy life have fun thats what she was best at
even when she knew she was dying
pause the most important thing she did was introduce me to poetry
she believed it was the highest form of art and that everything we say and do should aspire to it
wills is uncomfortable for a moment then ventures quietly it sounds as though in a way she took your moms place
my mom and my dads
after they died dolly was so devastated she pretty much gave up on everything
it was like if something that tragic could happen there was no way she was ever gonna care about anyone else ever again
she wasnt a horrible parent
she didnt abuse me or anything
she just ignored me
she was more like a weird landlady than a grandmother
charlotte smiles sadly
her eyes glisten in the light
im sure she did the best she could
for a long time i kinda thought that too and i made excuses for her but now i dont
i was seven years old and i needed her and she wasnt there
silence as wills somberly reflects
finally he speaks i remember when i heard the news about your parents
you know how after a crash they print a long list of names in the newspaper
well i grew up outside boston so i naturally started to scan the list
but casually not expecting to suddenly a swing song starts
wills smiles at the ironic change of mood then turns to escort charlotte away oh no come on
i love this stuff
didnt you grow up on it
how old do you think i am
holding his hand she starts moving to the music
wills laughs i have no idea what to do
she flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing
wills charmed senseless finally surrenders
a sequence begins during which we see wills and charlotte having an inordinately good time
wills maintains a modicum of reserve charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed
certain guests notice them
the reactions to their pairing runs from confusion to disgust to amusement
but no one watches them more carefully than lisa
finally in the middle of a song wills and charlotte make their way off the floor winded and laughing
wills heads off to the bar
charlotte turns around and watches the other dancers
then we notice lisa standing next to her
they smile at each other
lisa offers her a cocktail napkin
charlotte takes it and wipes off her brow
they speak above the music i had to come
i work at the met
whats your excuse
sort of a date
with wills keane right
you know him
just by reputation
a major womanizer right
thats what they say
beat im lisa
they shake hands
lisa looks away and sees wills making his way toward them with two glasses of punch
coolly covering lisa beats a hasty retreat anyway i should keep mingling
but it was nice to meet you
lisa smiles politely and walks away
wills walks up watching lisa melt into the crowd
his brow is furrowed
hes wondering if his eyes have deceived him
he hands charlotte a punch who was that
the name hits home
wills is flustered but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass lifting his glass heres to us
wills smiles slowly and they toast
the room is empty
theres laughter in the distance
the front door opens and shuts
we hear wills and charlotte both a little tipsy advancing down the hall toward us god you talk like youre a hundred and sixteen
thats usually how i feel
but not tonight
tonight i feel sixteen
and three quarters
wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls out a bottle of champagne already sitting in an ice bucket
he asked nonchalantly
wills laughs then opens the bottle as he picks up his previous train of thought you see charlotte the way you know youre getting older is that you start to
people start falling into types
pretty soon you know a person before youve even been introduced
and if its a woman before the romance even starts a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long its going to last
and the saddest the most tedious part of all is that that little voice is almost always right
popping the cork now what i like about you and i think thats actually what inspired this little lecture is that i find you completely unprecedented
and therefore wholly unpredictable
god it must be a relief
to finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to her
now wait a minute
no because coincidentally i am all those things you just said
wills chuckles shaking his head charmed but a little unsettled
im a unique
at least thats what my yoga teacher says
he says there are very few uniques in the world and im one of them
well hes a wise man
he hands her a glass of champagne
you on the other hand are what hed call a typical
and i can prove it
want me to
wills moves a few steps closer
wills walks even closer until they are just a few feet apart
no come on really close
wills cant believe his good luck
he nears her until their faces are almost touching
now watch very carefully
she rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from his
their breathing mingles
wills seems almost dizzied by it
and then very slowly he kisses her
she does not kiss back
finally he pulls away staring blankly breathing hard not sure what to say
charlotte whispers see
youre a typical
pause and for what you just did most girls my age would slap your face
or ask to be put in a cab
pause lucky for you im a unique
she smiles then kisses him deeply on the mouth
her arms wrap around his neck
cloaked in deep shadow set off against a rainy window pane we see wills his shirt off on top of charlotte whose blouse is open
he passionately kisses her neck and mouth
the room is bathed in golden light
charlotte lies naked under the covers asleep on her stomach
her brow is tense and one of her hands is slightly clenched
angle on wills standing in the doorway watching her his face a portrait of conflicted thoughts
finally she stirs
smiling and squinting into the sun she gets up on one arm and looks at him standing there in the doorway boy do you look guilty
charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast
wills sits across from her watching and worrying
didnt anyone ever teach you that its bad manners to stare at a girl when shes eating like a pig
wills chuckles then his smile fades and he clears his throat
listen uh oh
here it comes
thats right because look i could put this off but i genuinely like you
so i want to be clear
from the start so theres no chance for misunderstanding later
what i want to say you is
that all i can offer you is this
what we have right now
nothing more substantial
until it ends
she looks at him
lowers her fork
he adds almost reluctantly the truth is we have no future together
wills face reddens slightly
he shifts uneasily in his chair
a suggestion of a smile plays along his features what
what do you mean
what i said
nobody thought id even last this long
wills stares at her blankly not knowing what to think or say
i could have put off telling you but i genuinely like you so i wanted to be clear
you know right from the start
olivia enters takes her orange juice glass and leaves a full one
charlotte gulps down the juice
wills watches his mind reeling
wills sits across from a large desk beneath a wall of framed certificates and diplomas
the door opens and dr
paul sibley african american dour and forbidding enters mr
wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands thank you so much for taking the time
its my job sir
please sit down
he walks around the desk
sibley is all business but his brusqueness masks genuine regret now mr
keane on the phone you referred to charlottes condition as cancer
that isnt strictly accurate
neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy but it isnt cancer although it sometimes can be just as aggressive
sitting its most common in children
in young adults the condition is extremely rare
in charlottes case the tumor is located in her chest
its growing rapidly and has proved resistant to both irradiation and chemotherapy
and because of its proximity to her aorta surgery is out of the question
so then what treatment is she getting
wills shifts uneasily in his chair
eventually shell be treated for pain
in the end surgery could become an option but her chances of survival would be slim
right now charlottes against it
shes signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic intervention
a silence settles between them
sibley opens a folder on his desk
theres more here if youre interested but it wont mean much to you
wills shakes his head and rises from his chair
he turns to the door then turns back to the doctor how long
wearing her tattered jeans from the night before charlotte sits on the couch doing the new york times crossword
wills emerges walking slowly pensively as though in a trance
charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin a real charmer isnt he
wills doesnt react
he keeps walking toward her
unsettled she holds up the puzzle
how are you on cambodian money units
wills keeps advancing
are you okay old man
you look kinda woozy
jokingly calling out is there a doctor in the house
ignoring her wills sits down takes her in his arms and embraces her
at first she resists but slowly she surrenders and hugs him back
as the cab bounces down a cobblestone village street wills and charlotte stare straight ahead each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts
slowly charlotte steals a sidelong look at him
his face is tense ashen and unreadable hey
wills slowly turns his head
she smiles sweetly look on the bright side if i werent sick theres no way we could hang out together
off his look im serious
youd be scared of hurting me and id be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body
he cant help but smile
encouraged she moves closer and then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons
you know because im looking for a daddy substitute and youre looking for someone you can feel superior to so you wont have to confront how scared you are of
real intimacy and of course theyd be right and eventually wed break up
beat but since im so sick it doesnt really matter what deep seated weirdness has brought us together because theres no way we can possibly screw each other over
because that takes time
and i dont have much left
the cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone
she smiles archly savoring the irony so considering everything dont you think we should just sort of chill out forget im sick and enjoy what we have
until it ends
cause thats really all i have to offer
wills grimly appreciates the irony
think about it okay
but not too hard
she kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab
she skips up the steps of the brownstone then immediately turns around and runs back down to the open window
she leans in and mutters sexily last night was so incredibly hot
beat by the way it was my first time
and i picked you for the job
i hope youre flattered
wills is shocked
she turns and runs back upstairs
she sticks in the key then turns and waves at wills before banging open the door with her hip
okay pal where to
wills hasnt moved a muscle
from the next scene we hear the pop of flashbulbs and the whirr of shutters young fashion models of every race strut down a runway modeling a new line of
womens urban casual wear
find charlotte ignoring the show pushing through the crowd hurrying toward the side of the stage
she speaks to a guard at the entrance and he lets her pass
charlotte searches amid the chaos of models dressing and undressing
finally she spots them
find simon and shannon styling a black female model in a tank top and fatigues
he applies a finishing touch adjusting the tilt of the models baseball cap
shannon lacing the girls boots works as simons assistant
the threesome in high spirits bangs open a fire door
shannon is beside herself frantically half screaming i dont believe it
i dont believe it
i think what miss harris is trying to say is that youve strained her credulity
better put some ice on that
shannon lifts a hand to high five her girlfriend you are so incredibly cool
so ive been told
simon high fives her instead
the girls laugh
okay now tell us everything
dont leave anything out
from the next scene we hear okay then what happened
the restaurant is empty
john stands behind the bar taking an inventory of the liquor
in the background two bussers mop up
wills sits on a bar stool nursing a mineral water not much
i took her home and she pointed out an irony that fate was now offering us the very same thing that just this morning id told her was all i
could offer her a relationship with no future
chuckling a kid figured that out
shes not a kid
thats what ive been trying to tell you
nothings lost on her
im the kid
i dont know what the hell she is
muttering but i do know what she was
john looks at him curiously
wills glances over his shoulder at the bussers then leans in close a virgin
the busboys turn their heads
i had no idea
thats the only reason she had her party here so she could lure me into doing the honors
grinning she used you pal
the hangman got hanged
hows it feel
wills settles into a brooding silence
john goes back to work so what now
i end it
what youre endorsing this now
john continuing his work smiles sweetly i dont know when you talk about her youre not such an arrogant son of a bitch
you get all whiny and stupid
i like that
and since i dont see you gettin serious with any of your other victims i figure why not spend a little time together
because shes dying
i got bad news for you brother so are you
wills stares at him thoughtfully
wills stands stiffly at the door holding a bouquet of flowers
he stares at his own reflection in the porthole window
he straightens his hair tugs at the collar of his cashmere jacket
the door opens and theres dolores bleary eyed and disheveled
she smiles sourly well well
through the dark prism of dolores inhospitable wariness we catch glimpses of the high society hostess she once was shell be right down
shes upstairs gildin the lily
shouting up the stairs wryly do come in
they move through a doorway wills is surprised by the rooms run down state
excuse the mess
my maid died fourteen years ago and its been simply impossible to replace her
she did windows and spoke english
she chuckles to herself
wills hands her the flowers
well arent they loverly
she casually drops them into an empty blender at the bar
care for a cocktail
simon lounges on the bed
charlotte stands before a full length mirror trying on a dress
it really is uncanny
i tell you in that dress youre the spitting image of michel simon
flattered whos she
a french character actor long dead who was not only hideous and fat but quite male
so that would be a no
charlotte takes off the dress
wills looks around the room
dolores splashes her drink with vodka what can i say
times a thief
one day youre rich as an arab the next youre lucky if you can afford a god damn can of pistachio nuts
wills wanders over to the mantel where family photos sit in tarnished antique silver frames
he picks up a photograph of a young girl in tennis whites its charlottes mother katie
wills face is suffused with tenderness as he studies it
dolores walks over and looks how about that huh
that was the summer you two i know
whod have guessed what time had in store for her huh
look at that smile
eyes moistening dolores crosses to her armchair
her tone is slightly bitter then again time loves some people
like you for instance
oh times just wild about you
she plops down unsteadily and reaches for her cigarettes just as handsome and charming as ever
and still up to the same old tricks
wills sets the photo back on the mantel what do you mean
first time you came to pick up katie you brought me flowers
just like those
to herself flower the mother then deflower the daughter
but katie was too smart for you
dolly look abruptly aw why the hell dont you leave her alone
christ shes sick
but before wills can answer they hear footsteps on the stairs
charlotte enters wearing a peasant dress and felt hat looking pretty pale and excited
wills and dolores slowly turn
they smile at her then exchange a quick glance
charlotte catches it and becomes self conscious what
you look like your mom is all
charlotte looks to wills to see if thats indeed what he was thinking
he nods his agreement
she is pleased
charlotte full of energy hauls wills down the block by the hand
what do you mean you knew
i just didnt think it would take so long
two days is long
it is when youre sitting by the phone
you wanna know how i knew
i am but no its because of my birthday wish
but we hadnt even been introduced yet
i know but i wished that whatever happened
you know with my illness
id go out with a bang
a total adventure
charlotte jumps off the curb
he yanks her back just as a taxi horn blaring speeds past nearly hitting her
for a moment they both stand there hearts pounding breathing hard
then charlotte looks back at him and grins wow its getting exciting already
under a perfect blue sky the park swarms with autumn celebrants
charlotte and wills move together down a walkway
half joyously and half comically charlotte addresses the heavens with grand theatricality lord i do fear thoust made the world too beautiful this year
my soul is all but out of me let fall no burning leaf prithee let no bird call
we could go to a museum
no that would be a thing
i dont want to do any thing today
i want to do no thing all day
nothing at all
no thing at all
so a movie is out
ice cream at the plaza
high tea at the palace
what about shopping
she considers for a few moments possible
its not a thing
only when i have money
the sidewalk swarms with pedestrians
wills and charlotte emerge empty handed from the revolving door of a department store but all i gave you was champagne
thats not a proper birthday present
i agree and i promise ill let you give me something else but not today
but im warning you its not going to be anything material
then solemnly oh i see
because youre sick
because thats right but were not gonna talk about that
because its my rule
any particular reason
yeah because everybody always wants to talk about miracles or about some genius quack doctor or their friends friend who went into remission eating nothing but sunflower seeds
its boring and pointless
are you sure
i mean there are specialists who dont start okay
abruptly now what i would enjoy is taking you shopping
its quality not quantity you know
wills sits in a chair while charlotte looks through silk scarves at work you should look perfect but in everyday life you need to delight in disorder more
dont you know
a sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness
i think that goes without saying
it was true when that poem was written three hundred years ago and its true today
wouldnt it be fun to look wanton occasionally
its been a lifelong dream of mine
but will a scarf do it
but we have to be careful
i dont want you looking too young
nothings worse than an old guy trying to look young
ill remember that for when i get old
you know what i meant
that im old
wills walks a little self consciously
he wears around his shoulders a sloppily draped wrinkly silk scarf
he walks past other shoppers
among a group of women walking past him find charlotte who subtly checks him out as though he were a stranger
as she passes by she gives him a sexy look then not very subtly she spins around to look at his ass
finally she breaks character runs after him and throws her arms around his neck from behind
laughing he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to the door
wills and charlotte are in the middle of a candlelight dinner
wills refills her wine glass i dont know why but for some odd reason i feel absolutely compelled to tell you the truth about this
even at the risk of hey youre giving me the creeps
just spit it out
wills holds his breath for a moment then exhales and says it i never had a date for the benefit
my plan from the beginning was for you to come with me
charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together so i made the hat for myself
and you bought that dress for me
and you did all this just so you could sleep with me
i mean why me
wills settles himself then meeting her eyes speaks softly the eulogy you gave at ellas service was so
you spoke about her death
in a way that i could never have done
you understood life emotionally in a way that i didnt
whatever that understanding was i wanted to get close to it
and sex seemed like the best way to do it
and the most enjoyable yeah
charlotte sips her wine and considers
then she sets down her glass well first of all let me say you have great taste because that little dolce gabbana was to die for
and second dont ever lie to me again
there isnt a lie in the whole world id rather hear than the truth
wills stares at her solemnly
her expression just as somber she lifts a hand and points to her lips
he leans forward to kiss her
wills and charlotte kissing deeply tumble fully clothed onto the bed
as their passion builds wills reaches for the bedside lamp
charlotte watches curiously thoughtfully as he pulls the cord plunging the room into utter darkness
savoring the last sunny days of autumn wills and charlotte walk across the green of central park which swarms with happy healthy teenagers
at night wills and john and his wife sarah sit in box seats at yankee stadium watching the play offs
bernie williams hits a colossal shot
the crowd jumps to its feet
as the ball flies over the right field wall we see that charlotte sits next to wills munching a hotdog her nose buried in a book utterly uninterested
in elysiums kitchen wills watches on as charlotte wearing an apron over her clothes prepares bisque under the approving eye of the chef
she quickly and expertly pours a cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender
then she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron
just when she with a dramatic flourish is about to hit the start button wills interrupts and puts the lid on the blender
one morning charlotte sits up in bed doing the sunday new york times crossword puzzle
olivia sits on the chair next to the bed chatting and laughing with her
wills enters carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast
olivia looks up and gestures haughtily for him to set it down as though he were the housekeeper
at the metropolitan museum of art wills and charlotte wander amid the shadows of egyptian ruins
flipping through a stack of postcards he has just purchased wills waits for charlotte to come out of the ladies room
he idly glances up as a stream of tourists moves past
he is about to look away when his eye catches someone
it is lisa the young woman who spoke to charlotte at the benefit
around her neck she wears a chain bearing a met employee photograph i
she carries a take out coffee
wills follows her agitated and curious
he sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the watson research library
he hurries over to the doors just in time to see her disappear behind a bank of card catalogues
wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to the public
he hesitates then enters
he speaks to the first person he sees a rotund female librarian in her s
he stops and asks a question about lisa
wills is shaken by the answer
he stares into the middle distance wondering what to do his mind racing
the librarian a little nervous now reminds him that he is not allowed in the library
he snaps to thanks her and moves away
but then he stops takes out a business card and returns to the librarian
he is about to hand it to her but then he thinks better of it
flustered he thanks her again and exits
the librarian looks after him confused and a little apprehensive
wills sees charlotte at the end of the hall looking around for him
when she spots him her face brightens
she calls out facetiously as she walks to him i thought i told you to wait right there
i got restless
well i hope you didnt talk to anybody
not a soul
wills and charlotte stand disrobing in the near total darkness
they converse in whispers between kisses you know what would scare me right now
charlotte moves slowly through the darkness
she yanks a cord by the window
the blind opens and the room is flooded with moonlight
the room is still dark but she is far more clearly visible
her dress is unbuttoned down the front
she walks back to him and stops about five feet away
she releases the last buttons on her dress then slides it off her shoulders to the floor
she wears only her underwear
she crosses her arms over her breasts and smiles have i told you my latest motto
if its scary do it
im not sure i like that motto
im not sure that matters
she closes her eyes takes a deep breath then slips off her underwear
she drops her arms to her side
she stands before him entirely naked
her self consciousness is excruciating but she is determined to endure it
finally she opens her eyes and smiles with a hint of pride
wills eyes widen as he takes her in
he crosses to her and lays his hands on her hips
he kisses her neck
as their breathing quickens she begins to unbutton his shirt and pull it free of his pants
he takes hold of her hands stopping her and starts to ease her toward the bed
wills falters and she realizes something
oh my god
youre scared too
from his expression she knows she is right
for the first time since weve met him wills is utterly at a loss
but he sees that charlotte has no intention of backing down
he begins to undress
his hands are uncertain as he untucks his shirt and unbuckles his belt
when he is finished undressing he turns to face her his arms at his side
although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows charlotte can
she looks down at his naked body and studies it
he stares back with shy wariness
then she breaks into a crooked grin whats the matter old man
cant afford a gym
laughing he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed
she dissolves into paroxysms of laughter
wills and charlotte make love
as their passion builds charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest
she grabs his back her face twists
she holds her breath not wanting to reveal the incident to wills
she closes her eyes and exhales as the pain subsides
wills and charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the city glimmering in the distance
charlottes head rests on his chest
eyes closed he brushes his hand along her face as though he were a blind man committing every detail to memory
charlottes voice almost inaudible drifts up through the dark counting the beats counting the slow heart beats the bleeding to death of time in slow heart beats wakeful they lie
wills half asleep murmurs deeply so many words in that wonderful head of yours
if i could give you anything in the whole world thats what it would be
they lie in silence
dusk falls on the park
charlotte red cheeked and happy carrying shopping bags walks into a brisk autumn breeze
she smiles at a bunch of school kids dressed in halloween costumes being led on their trick or treating
wills sits at a desk reading the newspaper
john inspecting a king henry viii costume on a hanger shouts into the telephone oh no your boy made it
at ten minutes before close
all night i got a card announcing a halibut special only i got no halibut
now its sunday and i got three dozen cats lickin their chops in the alley
tony i dont wanna hear it
i dont wanna hear it
i dont wanna man he slams down the phone
his face is beet red
wills looks up calmly from his paper are you familiar with the phrase you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
are you familiar with the phrase mind your own god damn business
sure its from poor richards almanac
but the last time i checked no your business is to smile make friends and get rich
my business is the business
john heads out then stops abruptly and looks back
his tone is suddenly calm and curious whatre you doin here anyway
you got a girl
carve a pumpkin
we cant spend every waking moment together
john looks at him strangely with a hint of suspicion why not
pause no seriously
wills has no answer
john moves closer when celia his new assistant enters cheerily special delivery
she tosses him a paper bag he catches it
wills removes a pair of red plastic horns
john shakes his head with disbelief
you got no imagination
its a classic
a little spirit gum and voila
he holds the horns up to his forehead
young women are rendered helpless
i see a guy with horns growing out of his head and my knees go weak
of course its biological
they share a laugh
a flirtatious charge passes between them
she blushes slightly and exits
john looks suspiciously at wills
whats goin on
what do you mean
wills smiles at him as though he were insane nothing
were having a lot of fun
were very happy
from the next scene we hear charlotte laughing dont come in
a fire burns in the fireplace
still wearing his coat wills stands by the mantel sorting through a stack of mail im not even tempted
from another room ill be right out
olivia enters with a steamy mug you like hot cider
she carefully takes his coat off him as he sips the cider mmmm
charlotte made it
i just poured it in the cup
as wills sips the drink he sits on the leather sofa and continues to glance through his mail
suddenly shocked he stops on a letter
he sets his mug down
he hears charlotte making noise in the next room
he opens the letter and begins to read
his eyes dart down the page but he quickly sees that the letter is not friendly
his face shows disappointment
he hears footsteps in the hall
he folds the letter up slips it back into its envelope and jams it in his back pocket
charlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side ta da
she stands before him dressed in a white spinsterly victorian outfit with braids coiled at her ears
wills smiles with appreciation incredible
dont i look just like her
you have no idea who i am
give me a hint
hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul
was that the hint
only the greatest american female poet ever
she hugs and kisses him uncultured swine
the truth is out
ive lost you forever
she lays her head on his chest smiling contentedly
a subtle shadow of apprehension passes over wills features
eyes closed she asks when do i get to see your costume
a cardboard ghost hangs on the door
a jack o lantern grins in the window
a halloween party is in full swing
johns wife sarah dressed as queen elizabeth walks through the crowd picking up empty glasses and bottles
as she moves among costumed guests and their children we notice a few of elysiums customers and staff including celia dressed as glinda talking to the maitre d jesus dressed
as a cowboy no i think we make a great couple
a good witch and a bad hombre
that could make for some very interesting sex
wills stands off to the side wearing his devils horns sipping a drink watching an eight year old boy bob for apples while other boys and girls cheer him on
john wearing his king costume supervises as the boy wildly sputtering struggles to bite into a renegade granny smith
o ricky chill out
youre gonna get snot in the water
the boy laughs even harder
john facetiously grabs his collar thats it outta the pool
the boy choking with laughter plunges his face into the water again
sarah enters and calls out over the din wherere the girls
i thought you were tucking them in
we got a volunteer
sarah smiling curiously heads to the back stairwell
she sees wills standing there
watching the kids his eyes are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she noticed at the toy store she gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach
as she passes by and disappears upstairs
finally the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends
then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites out of it until he uncovers a silver dollar
wills laughs at the kids excitement
a moment later a womans gloved hands cover his eyes
wills feels her long gloves
ill give you a hint
you dumped me
she laughs and playfully strangles him
he turns and sees that its the woman from the films opening dressed as holly golightly
yup id know that throttle anywhere
sarah stops silently at an ajar door and looks inside
charlotte sits on a bed between the twin girls who are nestled up against her just one more
all right but this is the last last one
she clears her throat and settles herself
the twins listen with rapt attention as she recites from memory slowly as though it were a suspenseful bedtime story because i could not stop for death he kindly stopped
for me the carriage held but just ourselves and immortality
we slowly drove he knew no haste and i had put away my labor and my leisure too for his civility
charlotte looks up and sees sarah who face is beaming with affection
they share a smile and charlotte keeps reciting we passed the school where children played at wrestling in a ring we passed the fields of grazing grain we passed the
sarah eases the door shut and steps away
the camera makes a circuit of the thinning crowd
sarah blows out candles dumps ash trays and collects empties
charlotte rubbing a knuckle into her sleepy eye descends the stairs
she sees celia talking to jesus and walks over to them sweet dreams
i had no idea i was so tired
from across the room theyre down
looking around wheres lucifer
jokingly last time i saw him he was in the kitchen going pretty heavily with holly golightly
hey no gossip
hollys a valued customer
charlotte pretends to be fighting mad lemme at er
hell hath no fury like a recluse scorned
charlotte laughs and heads to the kitchen
john wipes down the table which is littered with bits of apple
hey shouldnt one of your minions be doing that
you know in my day you bobbed for the apple and sure maybe there was a nickel inside it and that was sweet but you ate the god damn apple
these little animals grab the coin and theyre out the door
off to buy crack
exactly my point
they share a laugh
seen beelzebub around
the prince of darkness
yeah he went upstairs
charlotte is puzzled
charlotte walks down the hall opening doors and glancing inside
she opens a bathroom and three cats dash out
she gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up
when she hears footsteps
she walks around the corner and sees a narrow staircase leading to the third floor
at the dark at the top of the stairs wills and wendy appear
charlotte smiles you lost your horns
hey looking for me
we were checking out the roof
johns got quite a set up
they arrive at the bottom of the stairs
wendy this is charlotte fielding
charlotte my friend wendy lister
they smile and shake hands
charlotte looks at them both carefully for any sign of uneasiness
there is none
actually i saw you at that memorial service in connecticut
your eulogy was beautiful
re her outfit betsy ross right
you guessed it
wills smiles and rubs his hands together is the party over
a town car speeds toward manhattan
wills and charlotte stare straight ahead each lost in thought
the lights of the city illuminate their faces in eerie flashes
finally wills glances over and smiles i have a strange feeling that youre upset with me
no i was just wondering if you had sex with that woman
no the answer to thats pretty obvious
i meant tonight
on the roof
wills breaks into a grin youre not serious
wills laughs to himself then glances up and sees the reflection of the drivers amused eyes in the rearview mirror
wills smiles back at charlotte of course not
why would i want to do something like that
thats what i was wondering
i thought were so happy hed have no reason to do it
and if he did do it hed at least look guilty wouldnt he
but he doesnt
he looks more relaxed than before the party started
well there you have it
but then i thought hes a womanizer thats what they say
funny word huh
sounds like some sorta machine
and how do you get to be a womanizer
obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it
sure except that let me finish
again wills looks up at the drivers eyes in the mirror
they seem more serious now
anyway theres something about being sick right here she touches her own chest
her voice trembles slightly that has made me acutely aware of my heart
nothing corny i mean literally
i feel every beat
i know how sensitive it is
it reacts to everything
she turns in her seat and lifts an open palm
if youre lying to me ill know it
beat did you have sex with wendy on the roof
he smiles at her as though he were indulging a child
she looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt
she slips her palm inside over his heart
still smiling he doesnt move a muscle
their eyes are locked
ever so slowly her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes
she shakes her head my god
oh my god
she slides away from him drops her face into her hands and begins to cry
wills looks down then glances up at the rearview mirror
illuminated in flashes the drivers eyes have taken on an ominous unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience
wills looks out the window
when he finally speaks his voice is calm and a little cold look i never pretended to be anything other than a piteous cry you hate yourself so much
wills is stunned
he looks out the window speechless his eyes small and frightened
the town car is stopped at the curb motor running lights on
charlotte and wills sit in silence this was all a mistake
right from the start
all of it
im a grown man and youre a child
beat anyway you have better things to do with your last with your time than spend it with me
distantly what about you
do you have anything better
wills has no answer
charlotte slowly gets out of the car
she leans back in her eyes narrow with disdain you know maybe youre right
maybe this is the best time to end it
because i was actually starting to love you wills and thats the last thing i ever wanted
she shuts the door
as charlotte enters we hear wills cab pull away
she moves to the stairs and sees a light shining beneath the living room door
dolores sits watching an old movie her eyes dulled by a cataract of boozy fatigue
the door opens
she looks up and sees charlotte in costume
well if it aint the belle of amherst
charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather ottoman
she looks blankly at the tv
she sniffles and wipes a hand across her nose
dolores glances over then back at the set
seen that face before
and for the same god damn reason
charlotte is confused but then puts it together but you said wills and my mom were just friends
sure but she was nuts about him
the only reason she didnt sleep with him is cause she was sentimental
she wanted a ring first
why didnt he give her one
cause he knocked up little millie tyler instead
at baileys beach
during the labor day clam bake
she chuckles grimly coughs and sips her drink
millie was your moms best friend from nightingale
you had to hand it to him
he sure knew how to make a point
she coughs again
charlotte struggles to make sense of it all
why did he do that
aw who the hell knows
cause the moon was full
cause lifes short
cause hes wills keane
ill tell you a little secret after that your mom hated his guts but your dad never made her smile like he did
pause course your dad never made her cry like that either
softly why didnt you tell me any of this before
oh i dunno
you never talk to me
you never try to help me
dolores eyes grow nervous
she swallows hard
christ look at me
im gonna tell you what to do
youre my family
youre supposed to take care of me
aw you wouldnt listen
thats the thing about people they just do what they want from the day theyre born till the day they die
she realizes her poor choice of words
she looks over and their eyes collide
charlotte begins to cry no thats you dolly
people who have given up dont listen to other people
people who want to die close off
thats not me
i wanted your help
i wanted to learn
charlotte drops her head dejectedly
anything you would ever have told me i would have listened to
fighting tears aw come on honey
i can throw a party and i can mix a gimlet
after that what the fuck do i know
she rises gives charlotte a nervous awkward pat on the shoulder then crosses over to the bar
wills stands in the center of the room looking around blankly
he disappears into the bedroom
wills enters and sees some of charlottes clothes folded neatly on the bed
a literary anthology lies open showing a he grabs the clothes and the book and puts them in a shopping bag that she has left on the floor
then he walks into the bathroom
we see him gathering beauty products off the sink
he walks back in and sets them into the shopping bag
he looks around and spots a nearly completed crossword puzzle sitting folded on the dresser
he drops that in the shopping bag too then sets it by the door
he feels a draft and spots an open window
as he crosses to it he notices something on his pillow
a blank envelope
he picks it up and rips it open
its a halloween card of a grinning jack o lantern
he opens it and inside is handwritten the scariest night of the year and only one thing haunts me that we might never have met
all my love xxx charlotte
wills lowers the card and heaves a deep breath
his jaw tight he walks over and drops the card into the shopping bag
charlotte emerges from the living room and shuts the door behind her
she climbs the stairs to her solitary bedroom
from amid the rush of traffic a taxi cab breaks free and glides to the curb in front of elysium
wills emerges with patty bosomy bright eyed pitched a little too loudly
wills seems stiff and tentative a shadow of his former self
an elderly couple passes them as they enter
wills stops at the coat check and helps patty with her coat
she admires the decor oh wills its beautiful
although his spirits are low he is effortlessly cordial thank you
it was designed by a team from so functional
is that stainless steel
actually no its velvet
she furrows her brow squints then laughs
oh my god it is
wills hands pattys coat to melissa the hat check girl and asks under his breath how are you
looking at patty melissa asks with deep sympathy how are you sir
before wills can respond patty takes his arm well if the foods even half as good as the moldings im in for a very special treat
jesus is surprised to see that wills is not with charlotte uhhh good evening mr
will you be dining with us
table seven if its available
celia approaches equally surprised not to see charlotte hello celia
sincerely how are you this evening sir
ive been worse
under her breath are you sure
the new hostess celias replacement arrives
this way please
to patty order a drink
ill be right with you
patty follows celia
wills moves to the reservation stand where john stands stone faced flipping through the reservation book where the hell you been
splendid how are you
deliveries on time
whos the broad
she looks like a holiday inn hooker from ohio
keep up the good work
wills walks away
dark smoky and boisterous
find charlotte standing with simon
she looks around disgustedly and shouts above the roar okay im chugging scotch gagging on smoke and losing my hearing
now why is this so good for me again
thats just it
the great spiritual benefit in leaving ones room is that it reminds one of how odious it is to leave ones room
follow shannon coming out of the ladies room
she makes her way through the crowd excuse me
she looks up and cant believe her eyes
simon shouting above the music speaks with difficulty theres one thing you dont know about mr
keane and his adultery and as painful as it is i feel that i should tell you
what is it
that woman on the roof
that was no ex girlfriend
in fact no woman at all
it was i simon loring master of disguise
willsy and i have moved in together
charlotte laughs and slaps him
shannon approaches hauling by the hand eric bales small beautiful long haired glasses
look what i found
charlotte cant believe it either eric
they hug and kiss with some slight awkwardness then shout above the music god long time no see
one night we show up to rent eraserhead and youre just gone
sorry about that
it was such a drag
you know having to actually start paying to rent movies
ralph said you moved to rockland county
yeah i got a job working for my moms new boyfriend
what does he do
he sells pot
i was a driver
i got laid off when he got busted
hes awaiting trial
so whatre you doing now
same thing pretty much
only for dominos
whoa i dont believe it
to eric she hasnt laughed in like a week
eric smiles quizzically at charlotte wondering why
wills sits listening to patty talk so everybody on the conference call starts introducing themselves
ned lewey paris office
takashi matsuo tokyo office
whoever the london office
and then someone says will the architect from the new york office please identify himself
and i pipe up and say well guys im not a him or an architect
im patty strauss and im head of east coast marketing
and theres like total silence
it was hysterical
wills smiles feebly
he looks away and sees john holding the telephone urgently signaling to him
alarmed wills jumps up im sorry would you excuse me
wills fearing the worst hurries to john who is it
john slams down the phone grabs him by the arm hauls him through the reception area and out the door
patty watches confused
john walks quickly down the block still hauling wills last time i checked i was your best friend
so after the party no thank you
i call you three times no call back
and for six days you dont even eat at your own god damn restaurant
what am i supposed to think
i was ready to call the morgue
relax im alive
well you sure dont look it
john walks as quickly as he can with wills struggling to keep up ill tell you why its my concern
because i had a god damn swimming pool
an ocean view
a fabulous lemon tree hangin right over my jacuzzi
and i gave it up for you brother
back to a life of concrete and dirt and sirens just so you could get your shit together
john walking a little more slowly now cannot believe his ears on my roof
you gotta be kiddin
not on my green chair
tell me it wasnt on the green chair
now how am i gonna clean that
john walks slowly now backward listening to an anxious wills look it doesnt matter that shes sick shes still a kid and theres no way we should be together
with disgust what the hell is that
some sorta shrink talk
look if she were just fun
just some sort of diversion
maybe i could justify it
but the worst part is that its becoming more
its embarrassing how much i like her
she gets to me
she affects me
he stops and leans back against a building
he looks around avoiding eye contact with john as tears rise into his eyes
and shes gonna be gone and
im not sure i can
i already think about her all the time
fighting tears her smile kills me
and the thought
that itll be gone
that ill never see her again
i dont know
i cant i dont think im that strong johnny
its too much
id rather have it be over
ill start missing her now
wills is still unable to look at him
john speaks softly buddy i hate to break it to you but in the real world
where i live
therere only two kindsa love stories
boy loses girl and girl loses boy
thats all there is
somebody always gets left behind
you try to avoid that youll end up an old man toastin yourself with egg nog in the mirror on christmas eve
youll end up dying in your own arms
wills lifts his frightened eyes
john pats him on the cheek
wills stands with patty in the driveway in front of the glass lobby
he is distracted and terribly anxious
she looks as though she expects at the very least a kiss thank you so much
i had such a great time
i want to be honest with you
right now from the start
so theres no room for misunderstanding
i didnt have a good time but its nothing personal
i just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much i miss her i asked you out instead
and its unfair
if i feel sad i should just feel sad and not try to use you
and your body
as some sort of painkiller right
beat anyway i think youre a warm and engaging woman and i wish you all the best
relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth he shakes her hand
patty utterly baffled doesnt know what hit her
the doorman michael smoking a cigarette sees wills walk up his expression pensive
keane good night michael
youve got a visitor
wills stops and turns who
shes been waitin almost an hour
in the lobby
off wills look a little surprise for ya
wills realizes that its charlotte
it must be
he smiles and hurries inside
wills bursts in and freezes
a woman stands across the way studying an oil painting
she turns quickly
she sees his excited expression fall
beneath her rather composed facade lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions sorry to disappoint you
not at all
you surprised me thats all
i didnt expect to see you
not after your letter
well i didnt expect you to show up at my job
i followed you in
i wasnt even sure it was you
all i have is an old snapshot
my boss thought you were a stalker
i didnt mean to run off like that
but you did
an awkward silence
so you got my letter
whatd you do
i saved it
i was just blowing off some steam okay
i think i have the right
so do i
look why dont we go upstairs
i didnt plan to come
he thinks its a futile exercise
but it turns out im pregnant
just a few months but lisa congratulations
his sincerity stops her
she softens slightly mustering a tiny smile thanks
anyway i guess it made me want to meet you
ive been a little sentimental about parent hood
is that what you consider me
in a lousy absentee sorta way sure
hows your mom
she moved to costa rica last summer
a guy what else
he owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors
i think he might be a gunrunner
for the first time lisa relaxes enough to take him in
you know youre much better looking in person than in photographs
i always assumed mom was exaggerating but she wasnt
youre not bad looking yourself
lisa smiles and much to her embarrassment tears come to her eyes
she shakes her head at how absurd she is treasuring kind words from a father she doesnt know
i should go
i really just wanted to meet you and
i dont know
gently what is it
she sniffles and looks away nothing earth shattering
maybe just to hear you say you were sorry
im very sorry
she stares at him long and hard waiting for some more palpable sign of remorse
it isnt forthcoming
finally she nods
she turns and walks away
his voice stops her can i call you
she turns around hesitates for a moment then nods
she continues to the door
but then she stops and turns before
when you came in
who did you think i was
you must like her an awful lot
she smiles simply and heads for the door
when she is gone wells slowly walks back toward the elevators but then abruptly stops in his tracks deliberating
the camera cranes down slowly from a view of the sun rising in the eastern sky to a taxi gliding over to the curb in front of
charlotte looking tired and a little pale pays the driver and emerges from the taxi
she makes her way up the steps
looking down from the second floor landing we see charlotte enter and walk up the stairs toward us
as she reaches the landing she feels a stabbing pain in her chest and stops walking
wincing she waits for the pain to subside
charlotte enters wearily drops her purse on the floor then turns and gasps
wills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed sound asleep
charlotte is offended by the intrusion
she hurries over to awaken him
but then she stops
her face softens slightly
she studies his face
touches his cheek with the back of her hand
traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip
smooths back a wisp of hair
finally snapping to steeling herself she jostles him hey
wills wakes with a violent start
when he sees her he drops his head back
he closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily where were you
i was worried
so worried you fell asleep
whatre you doing here
ive missed you
you have no idea how much
she crosses coldly to her closet and half shutting the door blocking his view starts to undress
howd you get in
he sits up rubbing his eyes in the morning light
we watched tv
she fell asleep
what time is it
i didnt know i had a curfew
where were you
none of your business
so what is it
what do you want
wills sits forward more alert now
he exhales heavily and begins to tell you that you were right
i do hate myself
but not so much that i cant see how stupid and despicable and cowardly
and cowardly what i did was
and even though theres no excuse for it i want you to forgive me
she turns and looks at him
she feels herself relenting
she turns away and continues undressing why should i
because for better or worse im falling in love with you and the thought of our not being together is unbearable to me
she stops then glances at him with a flash of pain and longing
determined not to surrender to her feelings she crosses to the bed and throws open the covers
she crawls into bed
in the morning well talk about what a gigantic asshole you are
wills relieved crosses to the bed and begins to undress
he asks casually so where were you
with shannon and simon and eric
an old friend who used to work at blockbuster
whatd you guys do
talked and drank
simon and shannon finally went home
eric and i hung out
thinking nothing of it wills nods
he slips into bed
her back is to him
he drapes an arm around her and pulls her a little closer
he smiles contentedly and closes his eyes
but then something occurs to him
he opens his eyes hung out where
well talk about it tomorrow
he closes his eyes again
a few beats later they open
talk about what
is there something to talk about
charlotte eyes still closed breaks into a sly amused smile
wills and charlotte collars turned up against the brisk wind walk together
charlotte wears a backpack
wills tries desperately to appear casual no honestly i think i have a right to know
and i honestly think i have a right not to tell you
youre being unreasonable
youre being nosy
they move down a winding walkway beneath barren trees you know in this day and age its not so outrageous a request
i mean i dont know this kid
i dont know where hes been
laughing incredulously youre worried about where hes been
give me a break
wills watches as charlotte laces up her figure skates it requires balance and i have lousy balance okay
oh come on whats the worst that can happen
beat well i guess you could break a hip
look im not in a sporting mood
im jealous okay
is that what you want to hear
are you satisfied now
she burst out laughing not even close
wills paces the bleachers furious while charlotte skates nearby all i want is a simple answer and youre torturing me
and i resent it
its cruel and juvenile
and i exploding her anger startles him
she skates over quickly and skids to an abrupt stop its not
and if you think its bad not knowing what i did well its even worse knowing exactly what you did
she turns and skates away
wills sits on the bleachers miserably brooding while charlotte gracefully glides by laughing and chatting with three young male skaters whom shes just met
they walk together in silence
wills is sullen
finally charlotte takes his hand and speaks gently but firmly do me a favor okay
never ask me again what happened with eric
just accept the fact that youll never ever know
and if that hurts then think about it next time you want to cheat on somebody
charlotte and wills are little more than silhouettes lying entwined in the rich darkness conversing in whispers i wish i were exaggerating but im not
i slept with every one of them
look through dollys old photo albums
or any movie magazine
visit aspen at christmas
i was on a mission
and until recently i really didnt think i had a problem
or if i did it was definitely the most pleasurable one i could imagine
my house in malibu burned to the ground
wills smiles with sad irony
i know it sounds funny
but it must have triggered something because the next thing i knew i couldnt sleep
id lie awake at night absolutely terrified
like a kid left alone in the dark
what were you scared of
how quickly time was passing and how adolescent i still felt
how meaningless all my choices seemed
how lonely i was
so i liquidated my portfolio sold my businesses and moved back here
to start over settle down start acting my age
beat you were supposed to be my one last dalliance with youth
well for your sake i hope i am
he thinks for a moment then smiles and kisses her brow
wills sits with john sarah and the twins at a plastic table overrun with food wrappers and squashed condiment tubes
sarah speaks to wills judge you
why would i
screw the age difference i like the new you
before charlotte came along do you have any idea how hard it was to get you to sit down for a happy meal
wills and john laugh
molly one of the twins chimes in uncle wills how come you dont get married
yeah how come uncle wills
i want to carla but im not carla
well molly i just havent met the right woman yet
what about charlotte
shes funny pretty
aside to wills it means funny and pretty
its their highest compliment
rising from the table shes also demanding
wherere you goin
shes decided she wants her birthday present today
wills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses
but that was last month
the dom didnt count
this is her real present
she chose it herself and its not material
now you got me curious
yeah what is it
wills shakes his head and smiles reluctant to answer
from the next scene we hear the sound of two dozen people on a slightly elevated stage hari singh an american sikh wearing a white robe and turban sits in
the lotus position before a lighted candle softly instructing the crowded class okay
breath of fire
now inhale deeply
hold the breath
let your heart lotus blossom
feel the energy rise
now peacock pose
hari rolls forward digs his elbows into his midsection and pops up so that he is parallel to the floor with his legs still crossed
angle on the class all moving into the pose
in the center of the class are wills and charlotte wearing sweats
his arms shaking wills is clearly in pain
he mutters when does the enlightenment start
when you realize that im god
a moment later charlotte winces and falls out of the pose onto the mat
hari looks over confused are you all right
charlotte sits up quickly smiling yeah
no big deal
cramp in the old fifth shakra
she glances over at wills
he sees that shes scared to death
he helps her to her feet speaking softly in her ear dont worry
youre gonna be okay
they move toward the door
but after a few steps her eyes flutter her body goes limp and she slams down on the mat unconscious
charlotte lies on a stretcher near wills and a paramedic its no big deal
i just hyperventilated
but then she gasps as shes hit by a stab of pain
wills throws a grave look at the medic and squeezes her hand more tightly
the building is brightly illuminated against the night sky
wills sits anxiously struggling with a half finished crossword puzzle
he hears the click of a lighter
a grubby little man standing by the coffee machine lights a generic cigarette
do you have an extra one of those
eyes narrowing you a smoker
not for years
well hell if im gonna be the one to get you goin again
dont mention it
wills looks up and sees dr
sibley standing in the doorway
sibley walks wills down the hallway the repeat mri and cat scan do show interval progression
uncertainly which means the tumors grown
yes it has
as for her loss of consciousness one explanation is a disturbance in her hearts electrical function
well be monitoring her overnight for any arrhythmias
if we find something well treat it
unfortunately the more likely explanation is that the tumor has begun to obstruct the outflow of her heart
if thats the case theres little we can do
we could be speaking in terms of weeks not months
they arrive at charlottes room
when she returns home well want her to stay active but dont let her overexert herself
off wills nod dont stay long
shes been sedated
charlotte lies in the bed with her eyes closed
an ekg monitor bleeps steadily in the corner
an iv drip hangs by her bed
wills enters and sits down at her bedside
he touches her hand
she opens her eyes and smiles drowsily hey
wills is terribly anxious
his speech is accelerated are you all right
how do you feel
ill let you rest
youll sleep and then touching his hand shhh
he nods and inhales deeply
his heart is racing
she murmurs you still owe me a birthday present
i do not
just cause i fainted is no excuse for you to bail on your peacock pose
she smiles sleepily
wills lifts a hand to her mouth and whispers it ought to be illegal
its too pretty
ive ruined you for other women
all part of my master plan
beat do you wanna hear a story
a bedtime story
shouldnt i be telling you one
once upon a time there was a woman on a ship crossing the atlantic and her little boy got sick
and she said whoever saves my boys life
ill name my next baby after them
well they got into port and they rushed her son to st
and they saved his life
and so the mother named her next baby edna st
beat and edna grew up to be as i am sure you know the second greatest female poet in american history
the first would be emily dickinson
youre a quick learner i like that about you
half to herself it may be when my heart is dull having attained its girth i shall not find so beautiful the meagre shapes of earth nor linger in the
rain to mark the small of tansy through the dark
her eyes drift shut i am so pretentious
wills laughs then clears his throat and looks suddenly serious charlotte listen i uh oh
i just think no
he considers for a moment then tears welling in his eyes he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it
wills sits across from simon who strokes shannons back as she weeps it just didnt seem real and now that it is i hate it
its so unfair
dolores sitting in her armchair mutters as though by rote fare is what you pay on the train to jersey
fair is the place that smells like manure where if youre real lucky you win a blue ribbon for your home made pickles
fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark
fare is food
what fair isnt is everything else
well i think i speak for all of us when i say that weve heard quite enough from dolores
simon continues to wills now correct me if im wrong but i believe what youre saying is that while the end may be in sight it has not yet arrived
the tumors begun to interfere with the function of her heart but she then why exactly have you called us here
wills falters looking at him incredulously
i cut short a lunch date shannons missing her low impact aerobics class and dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour surely you must have had good reason
i thought charlottes health might be of some interest you
you could have told me all about it on the telephone
i also thought it might be a good idea if we discussed ways to make her as comfortable as possible for the charlotte loathes comfortable
i never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well why should i start now that shes sick
wills stares at simon his face ashen and full of contempt tell me are you really so cold
or is it just a pose that youve cultivated
its a pose that ive cultivated
beat i chose it as a sort of smoke screen some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months
its quite all right
but honestly it shocks me how often you people forget
our phone books have as many numbers crossed out as written in
so that while death is certainly as painful to us as it is to you we do not find it nearly so
beat dont misunderstand me
i adore charlotte and when she dies i would
were it not already in that state
cry my heart dry
shannon looks at simon and burst into tears again
simon holds her even closer rubbing her back
wills emerges from charlottes brownstone hails a cab then decides against it
head down eyes desolate wills walks uptown
the roaring traffic dense crowds blaring music flashing neon the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him
he can think only of charlotte
wills walks down a dark block his jacket open to the cold night wind his cheeks and ears burned red
wills enters checks the tenant list then presses a buzzer
he speaks into the intercom and a moment later is buzzed up
follow wills running up the stairs
he arrives at a door cold and gasping for breath
he hears footsteps
the door opens but we do not see who is there
wills paces speaking desperately to someone
he seems on the verge of a total nervous collapse shes in the hospital now
she doesnt have long
weeks maybe and she
anyway i have something to ask you
i have no right to ask
id do it myself but i cant
he takes a deep breath to keep himself from crying
angle on lisa his daughter sitting on the couch listening her face unreadable what is it
i want you to find a surgeon
sibley told me
charlottes doctor told me
he said at some point when its hopeless surgery could be an option
heroic surgery he called it
i want to make sure that when the time comes a hero is performing that heroic surgery
do you understand
youll have to make calls
ill get names
sibley will give me names
fighting tears im sorry to ask you
i have no right
but you see she doesnt want it
ill have to convince her
so no one can know
and i trust you
youre my only family and i
beat you have every right to refuse me
after what i did
you were a child
and you needed me
and i was nowhere to be found
theres no excuse for that
im so terribly sorry
id be happy to do it
wills stunned deeply grateful allows himself a breath
dad im really sorry shes sick
almost inaudible i am too
i should be the one
it should be me
lisa flooded with compassion wants to go to him comfort him but she stays where she is
the darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze
shadows descend from the trees and towering rocks
an old man sits on a bench reading a newspaper
a nanny pushes a baby carriage past
wills and charlotte walk together bundled up again the cold
charlotte walks backward her breath shooting out into the cold air like smoke you never talk about my mother
beat talk about her
what do you want to know
all i remember is that she smelled like vanilla loved to read to me and was really good at cutting up fruit
i couldnt believe she didnt cut her fingers off
well i remember a little more than that
she was blonde
about your height ive seen pictures dummy
always ate her ice cream with a fork hows that
and she wrote great letters but couldnt spell at all
neither can i
she was a mcgovern democrat but also an incredible snob
she loved blueberries
she had the worlds worst backhand
her favorite singer was stephen stills
she was afraid of sharks
and considering the times she was pretty square
she only tried drugs once a lifeguard gave her a hash brownie and she threw it up all over him
and she laughed just like that
and she bit her fingernails
and she couldnt tell a joke
beat in short she was a unique
charlotte smiles happily
wills and charlotte lean down on the railing watching the water purl and eddy around randalls island
did you know she was in love with you
she told me
were you in love with her
because she was the only girl in rhode island who wouldnt sleep with you
thats how she got my attention its not why i fell in love with her
beat i fell in love with her because she charmed me senseless day and night for an entire summer
then why did you screw her best friend on labor day
wills looks at her darkly
she smiles and shrugs its just a question
wills sighs and looks away reflecting i have no idea
the summer was over
your mom was going back to smith
i was moving down here to work on wall street
it was our last day together
she was crying
she told me for the first time that she loved me
i said i loved her too
i promised to call and visit
a few hours later i was in a cabana with millie
beat when millie told me she was pregnant and that she wanted to marry me i escaped to l
and i never saw her or your mom again
wryly well done
i think its part of the reason i never came back
but whyre you like that
what is it
i mean you werent born that way
i might as well have been
for as long as i can remember ive always run off at the first sign of a woman wanting anything from me
relying on me in any way
she considers for a moment but i want everything from you wills
i rely on you in every way
so the only reason you dont dump me is because im sick
because you know that its all going to be over anyway
but it doesnt feel that way
beat it feels as though im not afraid anymore
she looks at him and smiles
he puts an arm around her and draws her close
wills looks out the window his arm draped around charlotte who lies nestled against him eyes closed
he suddenly sees something
checks his watch
his eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver driver
pull over here
charlotte a little sleepy comes to
she looks out the window and her face softens with happiness
on the steps of the old church a choir sings christmas carols
all around them a large crowd sings along
wills and charlotte get out of the cab
his arm around her wills pulls her into the crowd
they join the carol
wills sings well
charlotte is tone deaf
in between lines of the song she calls out i didnt know you could sing
i didnt know you couldnt
she laughs and continues to sing
the carols ends to cheers and applause
the choirmaster steps forward to a microphone well you all know what time it is
confused to wills no i dont
the choirmaster nods at someone in the distance
then holds up a hand fingers spread and begins to count down
the crowd joins in at that instant all the white christmas lights on the trees of the median from th street to th street pop on simultaneously an enchanted fairy
the crowd and the choir cheer and clap cars honk their horns
charlottes eyes are filled with happy wonder
as another carol begins wills wraps his arms around charlotte and kisses her
he pulls away looks deeply into her eyes and whispers with passionate sincerity i love you charlotte
for an instant her eyes flare as though she were surprised
then her eyes fill with tears
she tries to speak but she is choked by a sob
she buries her face in his chest and cries
wills smiles with warm almost paternal indulgence
he strokes her hair
she hugs him as though shell never let go
the restaurant is packed
john overwhelmed by the crowd waiting for tables glances angrily away when he hears the phone ringing and no one answering it
amid the pandemonium wills watches as charlotte teases henry the young chef as he lays the beet garnishes on a fish entree
you call that a rose
it looks more like a hand grenade
keane you get her outta here or i swear to god im gonna butterfly and stuff her
ill add it to the specials list
laughing no way
im too pricey
the door bangs open
john enters looking angry hello sunshine
you seen celia
whats the matter
the matter is i got a half hour wait and no help up front
you got a call on two
wills enters picks up the phone and hits a flashing button wills keane
lisas face is flushed with excitement ive got him
a town car is parked out front
michael the doorman chats with the driver
his names tom grandy
columbia medical school
hes at the cleveland clinic
i know i know
but dont laugh
its one of the best in the world
wills exits the building and gets into the car
the town car speeds down the expressway
he did his residency at the brigham in boston
his cardiac surgery training at cleveland
wills walks quickly through the terminal
he was so good they kept him on and within three years he was chief of the program
wills gets out of a taxi and heads inside he travels a lot
spends lots of time lecturing
i got you an appointment tomorrow at twelve thirty
dont be late
he only has fifteen minutes
tom grandy long hair small beard loose limbed wearing scrubs saunters down the hall wearing a vaguely goofy smile
wills watches him approach with some apprehension
the surgeon that recommended him said and these are his words not mine dont let his appearance fool you
hes brilliant and has balls the size of your head
wills listens to dr
grandy who speaks casually more like a benign hippie than a renowned surgeon
charlottes x rays hang between them in an illuminated view box listen im not gonna bullshit you
if she were a baby shed have a decent chance cause these sorts of tumors can regress like crazy but shes twenty and
i dont know man
ive never seen anything like it
pointing at the x ray i mean look
its wrapped around her vital structures like an octopus
sitting you know just once id like to get sent something simple
a cabbage a valve replacement
even a good old fashioned transplant
but it doesnt happen anymore
its the downside of being good at my job
they say theres no one better
i dont know
im like most people
i do the best i can
can your best save her
grandy and wills walk together in these sorts of cases its best if she signs a consent
covering no problem
stopping at the main entrance the last time charlotte passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately
the next time or the time after she wont
when that happens call me
handing him a card heres my service
theyll reach me no matter where i am
in the meantime ill coordinate with dr
i cant thank you enough
grandy smiles and pats him on the shoulder
i havent done anything yet
wills sits up wearing glasses reading a book
charlotte enters from the bathroom wearing a flannel night shirt by the way where were you today
what do you mean
when you called i assumed you were at the restaurant but when i called back later jesus said you hadnt been in all day
i was in montclair new jersey
playfully vague an opportunity
sexual or professional
i was considering opening a restaurant
but the rents are too high
he smiles at her
and she smiles back
charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest
she opens her eyes
the room seems strange
its the light
she rises up and turns around
her eyes narrow with curiosity
she crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks out
she cant believe her eyes
central park is blanketed by deep snow and more is falling
she calls out gaily hey
how do you feel about christmas
sleepily bah humbug
she runs back laughing and jumps on the bed rousting him
a sequence begins showing charlotte and wills during a day of holiday shopping
the deep snow has slowed the city to a crawl but filled everyone with good spirits
charlotte and wills move from store to store they buy wreaths garlands ornaments candles and finally a christmas tree and stand
wills starts to lug the tree but when its obvious that its too much for him charlotte spots a group of kids spilling out of a record store
the next thing we know the kids are lined up carrying the tree over their heads like a battalion of ants
wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in
theres no room for charlotte
shell take the lobby elevator
charlotte carrying shopping bags ascends in silence with michael
she has no interest in chatting
he as ever does
will you and mister keane be goin away for the holidays
i doubt it
ive seen so little of america
i dont care for airplanes you see and i have so little time to travel
beat did mister keane enjoy his trip then
why just yesterday
i wouldnt really call that a trip
but ive never been to ohio myself
they say parts of it are quite lovely
charlotte goes pale
the elevator stops and he opens the door
charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing and laughing
each holds a five dollar bill calling out all right you little hellions
get in here
charlotte wanders in
the tree stands erect
wills on all fours tightens the screws on the stand
he crawls to his feet and studies it
then he sees her grave expression and freezes
i thought we had a deal
im sure we do
beat you were in ohio yesterday
wills stares at her for a moment then explains without apology i met with a heart specialist
hes willing to operate
for an instant she is surprised but then her indignation takes over but you know i dont want that
you know ive signed papers that well maybe i want it
it isnt your decision
of course not but if youll hear me out no
i told you right from the start how i felt and you went behind my back
you lied and exploding oh christ knock it off
youre such a god damn saint so above it all but youre scared to death
you do want to live
and if you were as honest as you say you are youd let the doctors do whatever they can to help you
her face shuts like a trap
she walks toward the bedroom door i wont give people hope when there isnt any
maybe we want hope
or maybe we just need to know that we did everything we could
maybe i need to know that
if im going to be able to live
to go on without
without suddenly a sob catches in his throat
charlotte on her way to the bedroom stops and slowly turns around
she speaks matter of factly without judgment or feeling
now i know why you hurt so many women
because you always knew if you held on to one of them youd never let go
she turns and exits coldly to the bedroom
wills sinks into an armchair
in grey afternoon shadows charlotte lies on her side fully clothed under the covers with her eyes open thinking
she hears something and looks back
wills stands in the lighted doorway
she gestures for him to come
he walks over and lies down next to her
she turns her back to him so that hes spooning her but she takes hold of his hand pressing it against her chest and squeezing it like a doll
for a long time they lie in silence
finally she murmurs almost inaudibly when we met i was so lonely
but i didnt even know it
id been alone so long
so had i
but now we have each other
beginning to cry oh what would i do wills
what would i do if you werent here
where would i be
fighting his emotions determined to stay strong for her he holds her close
you dont ever have to worry about that
ill do whatever i have to
ill tear up the papers
whatever you want
tell the doctor
i really do want
i dont want to leave you
the dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs
wills closes his eyes holds her even tighter and rocks her in his arms
charlotte still fully clothed lies sound asleep
she slowly awakens and sees that wills is gone
she gets up on one elbow wills
she waits hears hurried steps then wills sticks his head in yeah
how long was i asleep
a couple of hours
and im still tired
thats all right
charlotte senses something odd in his tone
her eyes narrow with suspicion
whatre you doing in there
she laughs and starts to get up liar
just one more minute
he closes the door
wills runs back into the room
the tree is fully decorated now
he dashes back and adjust some lights along the base
from the bedroom whatre you doing
he runs over inserts the plug and the tree lights up with little white lights but for the star at the top
you were just going to tire yourself out
he grabs a chair and fiddles with the bulb inside the star
this ive gotta see
just hold on
the star lights up
he jumps down and puts the chair away
then he runs over and dims the lights finishing touches
he runs over and adjusts a garland
he runs back to the dimmer and adjusts it again almost
he runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open
he looks into the room and freezes in the doorway
he backs up a step then crying out lunges into the room
charlotte lying unconscious on a stretcher wearing an oxygen mask is rushed into a waiting ambulance
wills beside himself with panic is gently barred by a medic from jumping in with her
in the reflection of a projected slide a hand offers a cellular phone to dr
grandy standing at a lectern in front of a group of doctors
he stops his lecture and takes the call
the ambulance rushes light flashing sirens wailing downtown
charlottes stretcher is rushed into the emergency room at the same time that wills cab pulls up
grandy is rushed into a medical helicopter
wills looks up and sees dolores and shannon arrive
grandys helicopter speeds toward the city
wills comforts shannon
dolores looks up and sees simon standing in the doorway
then a coronary care nurse appears
she asks to speak to wills
grandy looks out the window as the helicopter swoops down toward the lights of lower manhattan
charlotte lies semi conscious on a gurney
wills appears in the doorway with the nurse
the helicopter lands and grandy jumps out
wills sits down next to charlottes bed
he touches her hand
her eyes open then close again
her breathing is heavy and labored
wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow then whispers half to himself time cannot break the birds wing from the bird
bird and wing together go down one feather
no thing that ever flew not the lark not you can die as others do
charlottes eyes open dreamily
she shows a faint smile at the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly what have i done to you
ruined me for other women
i saved you for them
her eyes close
wills takes her hand and presses it to his cheek
is she type n cross for six units
wills turns around and sees grandy standing in the doorway
whatre we waiting for
just you doctor
then lets move
the nurse rushes over to the gurney and in an instant charlotte is gone wheeled with a bang through swinging doors into the operating room corridor
everyone is there now john sarah celia simon dolores and shannon
wills enters silently
he walks to the new arrivals and greets each one with an embrace
charlotte lies on the table
grandys eyes visible above his mask are fiercely focused on his work
shannon lies with her head in sarahs lap
dolores ignoring the sign smokes a cigarette
john and celia sit side by side in silence
wills stands at the window
he looks over and see simon standing close by
simon looks at him his eyes sad but eerily calm
wills shakes his head it happened so quickly
wed just talked about the surgery
she agreed to it
but i thought thered be time
ive had friends who werent expected to last till morning who lived another seven years
another ran a marathon and died the next weekend
its all so terribly random the way life actually works
i take nothing for granted
a light enters wills eye
he smiles as he remembers you know its funny the first time i saw her i but then wills hears something
he turns and theres grandy at the end of the long hall walking toward the waiting room
simon looks and sees him too
wills looks at simon with alarm
how could grandy be finished so soon
wills looks back at grandy
grandy moves with long strides down the corridor
one by one as they notice charlottes loved ones react to the sight of grandy
shannon rises from sarahs lap looks at the doctor then covers her face with her fists holding her breath
dolores crushes out her cigarette her expression falling
celia touches johns back as he rises and walks over to wills
simons face turns to stone
john reaches for wills but wills advances a few steps toward the corridor almost defiantly his eyes riveted to grandy
grandys head is down
then ever so slowly grandy lifts his head and in one decisive move yanks off his surgical mask and throws it close on wills face as he realizes
his mouth opens wide as though to cry out but no sound comes
wills stands in the center of the room wearing his overcoat
he is pale exhausted his face expressionless
john stands also wearing his coat in the hall archway unsure whether he should stay or leave
wills looks at the christmas tree whose lights still burn
he slowly walks over and pulls the cord from the wall
the lights go out
a couple walks down the same walkway
they are deep in subdued conversation
all around them spring is in full glory
trees exploding with green
the man is wills keane but he has markedly changed
his dress is not so impeccable his hair has gone grey at the temples
his face though still beautiful has gracefully turned the corner into middle age
walking at his side is his daughter lisa now well along in her pregnancy actually to be honest peters more than a little freaked
i mean how could he not be
hes twenty six
his first child
a baby girl no less
nothing really prepares you for it
i guess not
he said its the first time since we got married that hes actually realized what marriage is
that its forever
that he cant just pick up and run away to nepal or something if we have a fight
that hes part of the cycle of things now
that hes gonna die some day
that its the next generations turn to take the stage
wills and lisa walk together in silence enjoying the perfect afternoon
then lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder so what about you mr
you ready to be a grandpa
wills looks over at the spot where he first saw charlotte
he smiles with wistful confidence then a little awkwardly puts his arm around his daughter
she is surprised at first
but then slowly trustingly she rests her head on his shoulder
and they walk
