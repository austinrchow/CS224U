b if window
href b b to sleep with anger gideon a strongly built elderly black man is sitting at a table
on the table is a large bowl of fruit
a crocheted tablecloth hangs over the side of the table
gideon is dressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well polished wing tip shoes
his hat almost covers his eyes which are two points of greenish coals
the fruit in the bowl is engulfed in flames
the flames look as if they are dripping from the tablecloth to the floor
gideons shoes start to smoulder
his shoes burst into flames which spread up his pants leg
his head falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep
he twiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle
he crosses his legs as if to get comfortable
the camera moves to a close up of his burning shoes
the image of his feet begins to appear through his shoes the flames fade the background changes as we gideons bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth
gideon is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a bible resting in his hands
his house is a small neatly painted bungalow in south central los angeles
corn tomatoes other vegetables grow in the yard
chickens scratch around
he slowly awakens his hands are trembling
he looks around and sees the chickens
he looks up at the sky and sighs with some relief
sunny gideons grandson five years old has been watching him from the back window of the house
he leaves the window
sunny peeps in the workroom
through the crack in the door a woman waves to sunny
the room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their husbands
suzie gideons wife late s or early s a picture of health is giving a last bit of instruction before the class ends
some of the people are already preparing to leave
remember especially you men that working together now will already have formed a bond before the child arrives
the woman is very sensitive
somewhere in the room a male voice booms out
tell me about it
there is a bit of laughter as all start putting away their things
gideon looks over at the chickens scratching around in the garden
he calls to them but they dont respond
he puts his shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house
entering the house he stops and waits inside the door peeping out
in a sort of devilish manner he talks to himself
spoiling the little foxes that spoil my vines
shot of the backyard
suddenly with the grace and suspicion of alley cats kids jump over gideons back fence look around timidly and start climbing up his fruit tree
gideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep voice
he turns the water on and walks over to the tree trapping the kids
dangling legs hanging from the tree try to scurry up the tree to safety
gideon sprays the tree with water
wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap the fence
gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off his hands
he is quite pleased with himself
one of the wet kids is watching gideon as he goes back inside the house
the boy signals the others who slowly follow in single file
they jump the fence and climb back up the tree
they let their half eaten fruit fall to the ground
suzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out
suzie looks at the picture before reading the letter
she tries to find a place for it among the other baby pictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser
gideon comes in and starts to undress
my mind plays tricks on me
is it okay if i take a bath now
everyone is gone
rhonda is in the bathroom
rhonda gideons granddaughter years old comes out of the bathroom
i was looking through my trunk and i cant find my toby
it is a charm that my great grandmother made me
everyone notices the worried look on gideons face
it will show up
if my daddy calls tell him i walked home
you be careful and thank you for looking after sunny
sunny is asleep on the sofa with a half eaten apple ready to fall out of his hand
babe brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation
i hate to be mean to people but picking sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end
now im going to ask him how come he couldnt be at your birthday
dont bother the poor boy
it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are
i dont know how two brothers can be so different
skip baker who is thirteen crawls out of his pigeon cage holding two birds that he throws up in the air
he climbs upon the garage roof and throws rocks at the birds to keep them flying
he whistles and yells at them
as the birds circle skips house they do backward rolls and death grips
skip throws more rocks to keep them flying
the rocks land on gideons roof
the sound of a person trying to learn how to play a trumpet breaks the pleasant sounds of the pigeons popping their wings and flying in circles over the house
rodney baker is about nine
he stands next to a shaded window trying to finger the right valves on his trumpet
he tries to hit a high note but only succeeds in making an awful screeching sound
a group of kids walking by rodneys window shout insulting things about his horn playing
go help your mama wash dishes
suzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor
the screeching sound of the trumpet from next door is interrupted by the doorbell
suzie cannot decide on what to do to clean the egg up or answer the door
the doorbell keeps ringing
two uniformed police officers stand impatiently at the door
suzie invites officer scott and officer davis in
both men are white and are in their mid twenties
officer davis does most of the questioning
we have a complaint from one of your neighbors about a rooster crowing in the mornings
gideon is shaving with a straight razor and humming to himself obviously in a good mood
suzie sticks her head in
the police are here to talk to you about the chickens
the good mood that gideon was in dissolves quickly
gideon wipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down
gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe
gideon comes in still adjusting his bathrobe
what can i do for you officer
suzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor
officer scott keeps her in view
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock
i always had chickens ducks and whatnots
not anymore not in the city
we grow most of our own food
the money i get from social security my pension and my wifes work keeps us living on the edge
what choice do people like us have
well you just have to move further out
now how far would further out be
im not here to argue sir
you guys dont make anything illegal do you
like what may i ask
you might have a distillery pumping out barrels of moonshine
suzie looks at scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen
gideon is about to lose control
davis heads off the confrontation
look just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day
gideon stands in the doorway watching the police go down the steps
ill be damned if i get rid of my chickens
i ought to get some hogs and put them out there
there is soft knocking on the door
suzie enter frame wearing a robe
who is it
suzie opens the door
babe brother gideons youngest son about handsome wearing an expensive suit comes in beating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him
it gets cold at night
this doesnt make any sense you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air
he will be alright
the camera follows babe brother
he passes gideons room where gideon is asleep snoring loudly
suzie and babe brother enter the bedroom where sunny is sleeping
suzie gives babe brother a blanket to wrap sunny up in
thanks for taking care of him
i will try not to be so long next time
babe brother gives his mother a good night kiss
gideon comes to the door
what time is it
do you think you can just treat us like your slave
its after one
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late
thats a lie
let us settle this tomorrow
dont try to get ahead by riding our backs
shouts i pay my own way
he reaches for babe brother but suzie comes between them
take sunny home please
she pushes babe brother away
babe brother walks away staring back at his father
gideon is lying in bed
suzie gets in beside him
your feet are cold
go back to sleep
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes
you all act like two roosters
im not going to let him get away with murder
you and babe brother are so much alike
he aint nothing like me
how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart
you ought to stop protecting him
youre always taking his side
im trying to make him a man but you keep babying him
youre going to find yourself on the floor
the bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and paintings by barns
babe brother wakes up with sunny standing in the doorway looking at him
it takes babe brother some time to fully wake up
finally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and sunny comes over and sits next to him trying to get his weary father interested in his remote control
i want you to be the richest man in the world so i can be the richest father in the world
i dont want to be rich
i want to work on the railroad like grandfather
son if you are going to have a family you cant always choose a job just because you like it
beat i dont want you to shine anybodys shoes or be a porter
you let somebody else carry your bags
sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room
babe brother having showered but still wearing his pajamas drags himself to the kitchen table where his wife linda has a huge coffee mug with the inscription im the boss
waiting for him
linda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like her husband
she is wearing a conservatively cut business dress
sunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty cup
babe brother is about to pour him some of his coffee when linda objects
sunny pleads with her in silence but linda refuses to yield
he wouldnt want any if you didnt try to keep it away from him
linda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down at her husband
because you were spoiled dont try to spoil sunny
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it
every summer the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddys farm
we would get up with the chickens
every summer the fence had to be repaired
the barn needed a coat of paint
we had to pip all of big mamas hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday
for big daddy calluses and sweat were the mark of a man
sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had but he needs discipline and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and
you allow him to get out of it
what is a sip of coffee going to do
coffee is bad for anybody especially for a child
i dont see you crying about my drinking it
how old are you
gideon is raking out the chicken coop
he puts the rake down and walks over to the garden and watches suzie plant seeds for a while
instead of standing here doing nothing i better give those chickens some scratch before they start cackling
old john is pushing his cart up the alley
old johns face is washed so clean that it shines
his pants are dirty and his cart is full of odds and ends of no value
he looks to be about seventy and fit
old john throws a sack on gideons fence
suzie is bent over a plant that she is tying to a stick
she looks up and sees the sack on the fence
a smile appears on her face
she goes over to the fence
old john is about to take up his journey when suzie sticks her head over the fence
how are you
i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses
it is so considerate of you
gideon sticks his head over the fence
well well look who is taking up all the sunshine
brother john how are you doing
im still here
suzie leaves the two men talking
tell me something
how do you get energy to stay on the move all day
you couldnt sit on your rump under my daddys roof
if you couldnt outwork his mule you wasnt worth the salt you put in greens
you had to wake up looking for something to do
i was raised as a mule and now im a rolling stone
suzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red tomatoes to old john
i didnt mean for you to pay me for that
i know you didnt but you have been so thoughtful
but when your sunflowers come up ill pay you for them
i planted a row just for you and you dont owe me anything
off in the distance a man is cutting his lawn
gideon and suzie are working in their garden
other couples working their gardens
two young men are working on their car which is creating a lot of smoke
a group of girls are sitting on a porch trying to sing while one of the smaller ones is trying to learn a step
skip is on the roof with his radio listening to rap music while his birds circle over head
from time to time he throws a rock at them
it is hard to see the woman giving birth
there are people blocking the view of the camera
suzie is facing the camera and the woman has her back to the camera
dont push too fast
the hard part is over
you can see the top of the head
scream its tearing me
father give her a hand
hey this is too much
you do your part
can you tell what it is
its a junior
ah i wanted a girl
suddenly the baby begins to scream
a sack appears on gideons fence
the sound of old johns cart is heard rattling off
suzie gideon junior gideons elder son years old and dark skinned pat juniors wife who is expecting about and rhonda are all seated next to one another in the same
the preacher is knee deep in water
he is baptizing a group of young people
the members of the church are singing take me to the water
an elderly man who can hardly walk without help is being led down to the pool
suzie gideon junior pat and rhonda are all seated at the table eating
babe brother is standing up
he looks in the pot but doesnt find it to his liking
junior is irritated at his brother
when are you going to find time to help me fix the roof
you all dont believe me when i tell you im afraid of heights
you used that excuse to get out of the army
you always got something to say
your mother asked me not to mention it but your mothers birthday was last week
i hadnt forgotten
i ordered some cloth but it didnt come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that i just stayed at home
what did your wife get her
we got the same thing
junior laughs at babe brothers story
boy go tell your wife to come in
babe brothers car a new audi is parked out front
linda is in the front seat reading a magazine while sunny is asleep in the back seat
babe brother sticks his head in the window
why dont you come in for a while
i would like to finish reading this
what would i talk about
i havent read this months almanac
i dont care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes
they pride themselves in making life hard and thats not my cup of tea
suzie gideon junior pat and rhonda are still at the table eating
you know babe brothers wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them
babe brother is a poor boy
you all should have been hard on him like you were me and he wouldnt be the way he is
everybody got the same
i breast fed him like i breast fed you
junior you are wrong
just for a minute
a dirt rock hits the front windshield
linda lets out a little scream
babe brother looks around
skip is on top of the roof next door
i didnt mean to hit your car
i was throwing at my birds
gideon is looking at the price of laying mash
he digs his hand into a barrel of scratch
sunny also digs his hand in the barrel
suzie is looking at new young plants
she gives the vegetables a thorough going over
gideon is standing in line waiting to place his order
i need about five pounds of laying mash and you better give me about the same of scratch
while at the counter gideon turns and looks around at the prices of different items
suzie brings her plants and puts them on the counter
when are you going to have a sale on weed killer
you missed it
we had a two day sale last week
what kind of a sale is a two day sale
i thought sales last a week or two
every day we have something different
todays sale is hay
if you have a horse or cow youre in business
sunny looks at the little girl in the next car she has her mouth pressed against the window
she is missing a tooth
gideon is behind the wheel while suzie holds her new plants up to the sun carefully looking at them
sunny seated in the back pokes a hole in the sack of feed
the mash trickles to the floor as if from an hour glass
suzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars
each jar has a shoot and is half filled with water
gideon is on his knees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet
sunny is sitting almost under him listening to him tell stories
sunny has a coffee can full of marbles
all of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another
they were way down in the basement cause they figured no one would hear them
one of the preachers said it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad i have been
you know them young gals that sit up in the first row
i can look at them and forget my text
im just lost when it comes to women even them middle age sisters
then another preacher said i dont think i can tell you what my sin is cause its bad
another preacher said brother we all amongst friends
tell us whats troubling your soul
clear your conscience
gideon takes a sip of water
so the preacher said we all got a bond cause we confessed to one another
so let me tell you my sin is corn liquor
i just acts a fool behind that spirit water
i loves it more than preaching
now aint that a sin lord
so all the preachers went on confessing each one worst than the last
finally they came to the last preacher who had been very quiet and listening to every word that fell
one of the preachers said to him its your turn
confessing will lift you burden brother
bare us your soul
the last preacher said no my sin is the worst among all of you
one of the preachers said ah go on man and stop all this suspense
so the last preacher said like i told you my sin is the lowest
beat my sin is gossiping and i cant wait to get out and tell what i heard
sunny does not get the humor of the story
he is more interested in picking up his marbles that gideons foot kicked over
you oughtnt tell him stories like that
tell me another story
ill you a story about the terrapin and the rabbit
no you tell me a story
once upon a time my mommy and daddy lived in this big house that i bought for them
i got them this big car
a strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the china teapot knocking it to the floor
suzie stops sunny from trying to help pick up the pieces
you stay back
you might cut your fingers
suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot
i looked everywhere for my toby
the trees are barren which gives them an unfriendly look
as we look at the ground a mans distorted shadow stops in the frame
a shadow of a man appears on gideons porch
the camera tilts up to harry mention a very dark looking ageless old man carrying several boxes held together by a cord
he looks exhausted from his journey
he looks in his address book and satisfied that he reached the right house he rings the doorbell
suzie comes to the front door she recognizes harry right away
she invites him in
harry stumps his feet on the porch several times and then enters
harry i cant believe it is you
gideon look who is here
gideon comes in wiping his hands
sunny carrying the broom follows behind
harry good god almighty man
its been what thirty years or more
suzie we havent seen harry since we left home
harry is more interested in the boy but sunny doesnt want to come near harry
it is gideons arm that is keeping him within close range of harry
this is my grandson sunny
he is my youngest sons child
he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age
sunny playing with the broom accidentally touches harrys shoe with it
harry hides his anger about being touched with the broom
harry takes the broom from sunny and spits on the bottom of it
boy that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom
he knows better
sunny apologize to harry
what are you doing in these parts
i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland
the bus stopped in los angeles
i had to get off and take a rest
ill catch the last bus leaving at midnight
im just too tired to go on
why didnt you catch a plane
my feet have never been on anything that wasnt directly attached to the ground
stay until you feel better
i would like to hear all the news
im worn out but wont you feel like you are taking in a stranger
stranger my foot it was my grandmother who helped you into this world
well i dont want to put you out
man put your boxes down and stay as long as you like
we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out
well if youre sure i wont be a bother
oh i dont sleep on no spring mattress
i always make myself a pallet on the floor
the bedroom door to harrys room is cracked open
peering through the cracked door we see harry asleep on his pallet
his back is turned to the camera
it is dead silent
there does not seem to be any sign of life
on the floor is a plate that has water in it
it looks like it is for a dog
suzie is peeling potatoes and gideon is ironing
poor old harry he really must have been worn out
he has been asleep all day
without anyone being aware harry has been standing in the doorway for some time
it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary
you should go back and rest
no if i rest any longer i wont sleep tonight
may i use your bathroom to wash up a bit
man act like this is your home
thats awful generous of you
i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome
one can tell you are from back home
these people nowadays dont know what manners are
where we come from you had to know how to act right
you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir
you had to know your place
you had to tread softly
the doorbell rings and gideon goes to answer it
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person
you remember that boy who lost his mind joe
you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark
he wouldnt miss a one
make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe
he would pick up a brick and say go on in there brick and hit somebody and it would find its mark
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him
all those places that us coloreds lived that we used to call bottoms have all been changed to drives and heights
everything is in what you call it not in what it is
gideon comes back with junior pal and rhonda
harry i would like for you to meet my oldest son his wife and daughter
pleased to meet you
so youre from back home too
harry and junior shake hands but rhonda gives harry only a nod of her head and a smile
pat who is pregnant attempts to shake hands with harry but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach
this boy must be turning over
oh he just kicked me again
junior feels her stomach
pat again tries to shake harrys hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach
she finds a chair to sit down in
the sound of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look up
its the boy next door throwing at his birds
im just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window im going to wash up now
you all please excuse me
harry is wiping off his face with a washcloth
he stares at himself in the mirror for a long time
the sudden sound of the boy next door starting to play his trumpet startles him
he smiles at the trumpeters efforts
he wrings the wash cloth out
a reddish oil like liquid drips into the face bowl
a few of the houses have lights on
suddenly gideons rooster starts to crow
a dog starts to bark and a garbage can is knocked over
bedroom lights in almost all the houses in the neighborhood pop on
the voices of neighbors complaining are heard
harry is just waking up
he listens to the voices of suzie and gideon as they get ready for church
gideon is paging through the bible as he stands by the door waiting for suzie who is watering her plants
harry comes in
you ought to come hear our preacher
remember old cat iron
well our preacher is just as strong
next time when i feel a little better perhaps
i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner but time got away
oh i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you
i havent wrung a chickens neck in a month of sundays
you know folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs
that used to be my trade from time to time
well i would appreciate that
gideon and suzie are stepping off the porch
harry is standing behind the screen door
gideon and suzie get in juniors car
junior pat and rhonda wave to harry as the car pulls away
harry looks through gideons and suzies private things
he looks at the baby pictures that fill the mirror
he reads suzies letters that are dated years ago
in one of the letters he finds a picture of a man standing behind a plough
uncle joe after ellas death is written on the back
a picture of a mule holds his interest
he looks at it for a long time and carries it with him as he continues his search
harry slowly walks along the rows in suzies garden
he stands by the chicken cage
suddenly the chickens start to run about and cackle as if a dog had gotten in
harry turns from the chicken coop
he stands still
sunny is hiding behind a bush
sunny steps around the bush
harry looks at sunny with such concentration that sunny takes a step backward as if getting ready to defend himself
baker a black woman in her early thirties comes out on the back porch
she shakes out a rug
she stops shaking the rug and stares at harry
harry becomes aware of mrs
he comes to himself and smiles at her
harry and babe brother are playing cards while linda watches and sunny plays by himself on the floor
in the sink is a newspaper full of bloody feathers
a small flame is under a pot on the stove
harry looks at the chicken in the pot and sits back down
you dont act like the rest of gideons friends
they believe if you are not hard at work you are hard at sin
oh im more modern in my ways
i dont believe in sin though there is good and evil
beat and evil is a thing you work at
harry takes his knife a crab apple switch out
it has a rabbit foot attached to it
harry cleans his fingernail with the knife
sunny is interested in the rabbit foot
he reaches for the knife
not you mustnt touch
your mama might not like you handling knives
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago
whats a toby
you dont want to be at crossroads without one
its a charm that old people teach you how to make
i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child
beat in my travels i misplaced it
i have been looking over my shoulder ever since
i thought you werent old fashioned
in some things
when we were children there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didnt have something on you that didnt make a
harry is aware that babe brother is interested in the knife
after cleaning his last fingernail he hands the knife to babe brother
harry looks at the cards in his hand
he smiles to himself
did you have your child at home
i had my child at cedars and sinai
and that aint no county hospital
you have to have cash or check before you come in the door
some folks take that natural stuff too far
juniors wife kept her afterbirth in the refrigerator
thats why i do not eat over there now
country people got so many strange ways harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling
did you ever have to use this thing
that is called a crab apple switch
its for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog
now i dont know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folks stories but i seem to recall that i
had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home
i was up in memphis working on the railroad like your daddy who had an easy job
he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track
anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon
sure enough it was emory
my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it
got in a blues band and what not
he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town
emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face
bad luck i would say
he got to drinking that corn liquor
we went to his girls room and he wouldnt stop drinking
he started talking about the old days and he went mad
he pulled his knife and i got to mine first
the lights went out
linda picks up a card and looks at it
there is a naked woman on the back
dont pick up the cards if you are not in the game
did he die
i dont know what happened to him
he just ran out into the streets
beat i got some old records i want you to hear
i like the blues sung simply man and a guitar
or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life
dont ever let anyone tell you his lifes story if it is of a weary life full of sadness
when i was a boy a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and ill be damned if the same thing didnt happen to
sunny is busy playing in the curtains
the sound of gideon and suzie arriving makes them scurry to get the cards put away
harry puts his knife away just as suzie and gideon enter
linda feels a little embarrassed
how was church
gideon and suzie are surprised to see linda
they dont know what to say
rodney walks around in the yard blowing his trumpet as loud as he can
the sound of the trumpet frightens skips birds
gideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl
harry is leaning against the door
how often is your wife called to help delivery
it was slow
now it seems like everyone is having births at home
gideon takes the pipe off
it has rotted
gideon cannot believe it
what could have caused this
i just changed this damn thing
everything these days is made overseas
you and babe brother hit it off so well
course it is your business but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior
everyone has to follow his own plough
a man doesnt have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays
city people dont give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays
you dont plant old ways
beat but at the end you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you
beat its when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they dont want it
you sell it to a stranger
you worked your whole life for what
beat i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm
all what weve experienced has no meaning
youre suppose to teach your children what you know
junior i dont have to worry about
babe brother is a different story
you still call him boy
you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son
my daddy called me boy up to the time he died
i was always boy to him
course you could be right
your sons are alive
all my sons are dead
off screen rodney starts to practice on his horn
babe brother is sitting with sunny by the screen door blowing giant bubbles
the bubbles drift past linda who is sitting at the table with real estate papers all over the table
she is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to stop disturbing her
babe brother sends more bubbles floating by causing her to shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first time buyer
it has three bedrooms one and a half baths
well yes that means two toilets and one bath
yes by appointment
call me back if you decide
she hangs up the phone
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does baths mean
will you still get the money from your father
i told him we might not need it if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property
pops put big daddys farm in rhondas and sunnys name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work
i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways its like talking to a brick
but if there is a way
babe brother is lost in his thoughts
he stares down at his hands resting on his knees
he picks up the telephone
junior is on the phone with babe brother
pat crosses in front of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner
babe brothers voice is just audible
you want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours
you know the last time we went into something together daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street
why are you always afraid to get somewhere
this is not a good time to take chances
your best friend robert an accountant lost his home and is out on the street
we see him from time to time
he comes down to church for a free meal
this is what it is all about trying to keep from being out on the street
robert asks about you
when are you going to do something to help him
maybe i can get down there next week
junior turns to his wife who is off camera
babe brother always acts like a gambler who is in the biggest game of his life and dont know about playing cards
harry and gideon are walking along a railroad track
the sun is blinding
the heat makes the asphalt appear to turn into a lake off in the distance
gideon appears exhausted beads of sweat continually form on his forehead
he fans himself with his hat
harry is unaffected by the hot temperature
i can sit here and look at train tracks all day
we laid enough of them didnt we
so many memories are stretched along tracks like these
gideon looks down the tracks
a bowl of dust stirs off in the distance
the hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid
the tracks begin to twist and bend
off in the distance faint images of men laying track to a song
gideon is standing with his hat in his hand
his posture is that of an extremely old man
in weather like this you cannot walk around bare headed
he wipes the sweat from his hat band
well go a little farther
the walk will do us some good
suzie is peeling apples while sunny standing next to her catches peelings in his mouth
pat is sitting next to the window
she is uncomfortable
she loosens her pants giving her stomach more room
rhonda is leaning over the back of the chair with her arms around pats neck
they are in silhouette
did you do your homework
can i name the baby
suzie knocks on the door
harry comes to the door still buttoning his shirt
i have someone i want you to meet
ill be right there
gideon in the background in the kitchen washing off the vegetables
suzie and hattie are sitting at the table
harry comes in and is surprised to see hat tie
hattie is in her late sixties but looks well
she makes a conscious effort to dress plainly
i couldnt believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here
how have you been
girl do you still sing and dance
no im a different person now harry
hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from time to time
gideon comes in from the kitchen
havent the years been good to hattie
it hasnt been the years its been the men in her life
harry thats not nice
im in church now
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone
i remember when you werent saved
that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road
some people grow up and change their ways
i know your mother aint still operating that house of hers
my mother passed on years ago
slams the door to his car and hurries up the steps leaving herman in spite of his bad condition to get out of the car the best he can
the car door almost knocks poor herman over
seems rather youthful because of his energy and awkwardness
he is a large muscular man
herman is a dried up man with nothing not even a shadow
he has a racking cough
gives gideon a bear hug lifting him off his feet
on seeing suzie he drops gideon and rushes over to lift her up off her feet
herman is still trying to get out of the car
lifts suzie off the ground twice
he runs over to hattie who does not want to be handled tries to withdraw but m
forces her to her feet and gives a big bear hug
hattie has a series of squinting attacks
squints in return
you still aint house broken
good god almighty if it aint like a parade of people from out of the past
where did you come from
i live here
there is a tapping on the door
thats old herman
harry what did you do rob the graveyard
herman hobbles in and after a minute of coughing a smile forms on his face
suzie gideon and hattie are seated at the table while m
bounces from one end of the table to the other
one moment he is on his knees and next moment he is leaning over someone to flick his ashes in the ashtray on the table
hattie hates it when he comes near her
harry and herman sit together in the corner chewing on starch
hattie do you still dance
im in church
what does that got to do with it
suzie you still have joes number
i will have to look for it
none of your business
that is a boy from home lullas brother
suzie is surprised
harry you know everything
you got to know everything do everything and be everything
gideon brings a fresh pot of coffee
gideon tries to signal m
to stop harassing hattie
leans over hattie again to use the ashtray
harry is helping herman to his feet
herman starts to cough
they come over and join the rest of the crowd at the table
harry seats herman next to gideon and pours herman a cup of coffee
he puts the sugar and cream in the coffee for herman
suzie comes back with joes number and hands it to hattie
im worn out
you ready to go
if you are tired go sit in the car
suzie do you have any swamp root
no but i might have some indian chief tonic
i havent heard anyone mention swamp root since button up shoes went out
you can certainly tell how old you are my dear
hattie is angered
you know the saying your heart is in your left hand
now i was trying to be nice to make conversation since we go back some
i was quoting from the bible
if the shoe fits wear it
out of weariness i spoke to my own heart to leave it all and to die
and i gave my heart to know madness and folly
you aint going to win playing the dozens with harry
you all ought to get along
harry you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life
when i heard you were here i made a special effort to come and see you
i see you are still a pile of wet chicken feathers
my sister women can get away with so much
i dont have any enemies cause i dont live in the past
as pushkin you dont know him said in the hope of glory and good i look without fear ahead
harry has got your number
an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you tappy head you aint worth the salt you put in greens
speaking of tappy heads we ought to have an old fashion fish fry
i dont have too many fish fries left
we can have it here next week
is this your house
gideon what do you say
well its up to suzie
it would be nice
in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog
i already have my dear
take me home
the children of the women in suzies natural birth group are huddled together singing ashiine ca chew
the voices of the women in the next room are audible
the kids go outside to sit on the porch
most of the women have their newborns with them and are engaging in talk about how their other children had to adjust and etc
a young white mother rebecca wilson with both her children a four year old and one just a few months old talks with a deep southern accent
no one in my family ever been to a hospital to give birth
my sister has four children and all were born at home
my mother and her mother it just goes on and on
a mother leaves with her baby wrapped in a blanket
the kids surround her wanting to see the baby
pat is looking at a book of baby names
harry passes the door and stops
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days
well you and your husband are special
ya gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor
pat beams with joy because harry recognizes the important work she is doing
how many people do you all feed
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals
good god almighty bless your bones
pause but the problem grows
week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger
we cant feed all the hungry
of course not
have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people
no you aint
pause you have to take just one and fatten him up
when you spread help too thin you you just nickel and dime the situation
if you try to save all all die but if you save one life life goes on
you just have to remember medicine that works leaves a bitter taste
harry looks at the baby picture pasted over the mirror
he takes the picture of his children from his old black dusty wallet and compares the faces of his kids with those on the mirror
he talks to himself more than to pat
you just take one you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground
pat watches him and loses herself in what he is doing
she responds automatically i dont know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times
oh i wasnt pointing my finger at you
hey you have to think of yourself
a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep
there are too many bad people out there
junior is taking the back door off to paint
harry helps him carry the door and lay it on a saw horse
i appreciate you lending me a hand
that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me
well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance
dont take me wrong but you cant judge people by how you act
youre a caring person
he should be caring
that is not too much to ask
ya but you cant do the shuffle with one leg
you and your wife in your spare time work with the less fortunate
now im not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love
to be near the dying
all the people working with us are really doing it cause they hate to see suffering
you never know whats in the heart and just because you can cry doesnt make you human
rhonda is in the background washing dishes
pat and junior are sitting at the dining room table arguing
we cant really bring another family in here with us
harry says thats the only way to do good
when did you talk to harry
gideon and sunny are in the garden digging for worms
the chickens i think we have enough
so now tell me a story
gideon is sitting on a rock by the lake
his image is reflected in the lake
he is asleep
sunny is putting new bait on one of the reels and with a whip of the pole he casts to the center of the lake
he leans against a tree
sunny looks at his sleeping grandfather
gideon has his pant legs rolled up
his socks have lost their elastic
his head is resting on his chest
sunny goes near the water
be careful of the water
sunny looks back at his grandfather who appears to be asleep
there is one fish in the bucket
gideon and sunny are sitting next to each other
the lake reflects the sky a deep red
the eerie sound of a long train whistle breaks the silence
harry babe brother and linda come in after staying out all night
linda looks as though she is about to fall asleep standing up
she awakes and looks at harry
there is dislike in her stare
suzie and gideon notice linda fading away
are you feeling well
ive never been so tired in my life
where is sunny
he is getting his things together
babe brother you ought to take your wife home so she can get some rest
in a minute
sunny comes in carrying his night clothes folded neatly
he stands next to linda
harry in a mild but demanding way ushers babe brother out of the door
take your wife and child home boy
babe brother seems all too happy to obey harry
after harry closes the door behind babe brother he turns with a wide smile
i got a surprise for you tonight
harry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off
this old buffalo has been in the sun too long
suzie and gideon are getting the food ready while harry wearing a shirt that looks like it is made of shiny snakeskin sits in a darkened corner of the room
cutting his fingernails with his knife
the door bell rings and harry slowly walks over to answer the door
suzie puts the punch bowl down and hurries over to meet the first guests fred jenkins an elderly black man whom she hasnt seen in years and esme jenkins his
suzie you havent changed and you gideon if you dont look like john henry
oh this is my wife esme
my first wife lulie died
more people arrive bottle necking the doorway
gideon helps the jenkinses to a chair
hattie comes with her brother marsh who is not too pleased to see harry
okra tate an elderly black man with dark circles under his eyes comes in limping badly with an old polaroid camera hanging from his neck
babe brother linda junior pat and rhonda who is holding sunnys hand all come in together
drags herman through the door coughing
flim anderson and his son doug are followed by the twins william and loviray norwood who are in their late s
babe brother leaves linda standing by herself to be next to harry
zenia dent an elderly white woman with a strong southern accent arrives with her husband howard dent a black man who is in a wheelchair
the twins and howard are the center of attention
okra comes over and whispers into harrys ear
okra leaves through the front door
okra comes back in with a bag
harry babe brother m
and herman follow okra to the kitchen
okra sets the bag on the table and steps back to allow harry to unveil the bottle of corn liquor
what is that
boy that is the real south
that is real corn liquor
a crowd starts to gather around
what is in the bottle
it aint geritol
starts to hand out tea cups while harry pours everyone a drink
there is a fight in every bottle
you tappy heads better not tear down my house
an attractive woman in her younger days a knockout puts on a record and starts to pop her fingers to the music as she moves towards the center of the
floor dancing by herself inviting anyone bold enough to join her
a group of men who havent seen each other in years are asking questions about news of old friends
okra is trying to get his camera working
herman is following m
through the crowd with his hand resting on m
s shoulder as if he were a blind person
his racking cough is frightening
an older couple dancing attract the attention of the crowd
the man is wearing stacy adams shoes polished to see ones face in them
he gives expression to his moves as if he and the woman are talking with their bodies
junior and pat try to bring in something more modern to outdo the older couple
herman corners hattie trying to get her to sing
look you better get out of my face before i slap the living daylights out of you
harry stops the music
you folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past our own nightingale
if you had any good times in your life you remember hattie
she use to keep those juke joints steaming
if ma rainey and bessie smith were the stars she was the sun
lets get hattie to sing something from the old days
hattie has started her nervous twitch again
she is so mad that she bites her lip to keep from exploding
harry always tries to be the king fish
i told him im a new person
harry signals an old man percy to start playing his guitar
percy starts to play but hattie doesnt join him
he looks to harry for a sign of what to do
hattie walks away
percy starts to sing by himself but someone puts a record on interrupting his singing
people are back to dancing
a younger woman is dancing with an older man with such vigor forcing the old man to try to keep up that people grow concerned
people near him try to make him slow down but his pride forces him to be ridiculous
linda sits with sunny and rhonda watching tv
the noise has gotten louder everyone talking at the top of his voice
gideon is busy going around to everyone seeing if everything is okay
gideon and suzie have worked up a sweat trying to attend to everyones needs
linda rejoins the party
she moves through the crowd and sees babe brother standing next to harry
she is disappointed and stays at a distance
harry is with a group of people
marsh tries to get harrys attention
harry you will not remember me but we go back quite a ways
im glad hattie told me that you will be here cause there is a matter that has been troubling me all these years that maybe you can help me clear
harry stares into marshs eyes then looks him over from head to toe
man i cant talk to you now
im filling in the gaps with these folks
harry turns his back on marsh
marsh stands there looking at harrys profile
he turns and walks away
the record ends
the younger woman and the older man wait for the next record
how do you manage to keep in step and move around so like one of them young boys
get yourself a pace maker like me
linda is standing by herself
she watches babe brother and harry walk towards the kitchen
pat comes to talk to her
these old folks can dance better than i can
get rid of that long face
get one of these old farts to show you how to do the black bottom
okra holding his camera all of the attachments in one hand and a glass in his other hand tries to offer hattie a drink
dont be so stand offish
hattie pushes him away
the drink spills on him
she turns and walks away
he follows her
marsh sits in a chair opposite harry
babe brother stands behind harry
harry knowing that marsh is going to bring up unpleasant things of the past feels the need to get rid of babe brother
son you havent danced with your wife all night
babe brother is reluctant to leave but harry gives him a nudge
he goes looking for linda
there is something that i always wanted to know
tell me how did those boys die
now who are we talking about
miss claras boy emory to start with
the johnsons hocker was another one
wasnt hocker lynched
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched
now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree
what difference does it make if its persimmon oak tree or huckleberry bush
gideon babe brother and linda go outside
the sounds of the party drift out from the house as gideon linda and babe brother talk
tell me how come me and suzie have to be mother and father to your child
you never take the boy to the park circus or anything
if we did not take him to church he wouldnt have any sense of religion
i think forcing him to go to church when he really doesnt understand is not saving his soul
when he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion that will be better
it will be his intellectual decision
is that the way your parents raised you
why you dont want us to bring him over
no its that when do you have time to be parents to him
you guys dont pick him up until nine ten at night
you are into yourselves as the saying goes
spend some time trying to be parents
take him to the mountains fishing
you ought to let him get to know nature
well you are his grandfather
he is supposed to spend some time with you
youre supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that
junior spends time with his child
oh here we go with that
okra is trying to get enough light for his old polaroid camera
takes a shade off a lamp and holds it next to the twins nearly blinding them
hurry up and take this picture
if it wasnt for the nra colored people would have been the lost tribe
remember what they use to call the nra
negro raggedy ass army
is still holding the naked lamp while okra tries to take pictures
hockers death almost caused a race riot
a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that
strange as it may seem it might have cleared the waters
sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason
gideon babe brother and linda are just standing facing one another
suzie comes out on the porch
do you want your coat
its cold out here
no im too hot now
you better be careful
youll get a stroke arguing
i wouldnt care if i drop dead if he learn something from it
beat son you make me wish i was dead
gideon dont say things like that
why does he always pick on me
he is just being like all parents concerned about the ones they love
i dont need that kind of love
and i dont want to be reminded all the time that big mamas grandmother was born in slavery
if you really care about me just tell me how i can make money
babe brother im going to take my hand and hit you across your mouth
he doesnt mean what he says
let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son
before anyone moves you two shake hands and dont carry it any further
linda gives babe brother a jab with her elbow
his hand reaches out to gideon
and herman put the unshaded lamps next to hattie so okra can get a better picture
percy starts to play his guitar
herman stands behind percy
dont make me say something nasty now
percy starts to play an old religious number and hattie starts to sing
everything stops for a moment as her voice fills the room
then most of the guests pick up and join in
moves the lamp next to percy so okra can take his picture
marsh and harry are getting quite loud in their argument
it has become a kind of controlled anger
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick
chick was outright killed by a mob
he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the
hills back to town
those boys never did have good luck
you damn right they didnt especially emory my cousin
emory had made a lot of enemies
he had a big mouth
and okra come in wanting to take pictures
marsh is pretty mad about them intruding
sets the naked lamp in front of marsh on the floor almost between his legs
before okra can get his camera set to shoot marsh leaves
harry smiles as if he had won a major victory
herman flops down in the empty chair and starts to cough
suddenly suzie and gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins loviray
they carry the twin towards hermans seat
herman is slow to react
herman gets up very slow
finally they are able to seat the twin
whats the problem here
she has a fish bone caught in her throat
could all of you go in the other room
gideon get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil
the twin is holding her throat and panting like a fish out of water
she is in a lot of pain
william the twin brother is standing at the door with a tragic face
gideon is trying to get out of bed
he sits on the side of the bed and starts to cough
harry has his back to the camera sitting in a chair facing a wall
he is naked from the waist up
an empty plate is placed not too far from where he is sitting
he is cutting an apple
he licks the blade of his knife
babe brother is asleep
linda is dressed to go to work
she throws his suit on the foot of the bed
are you going to work or sleep all day
he snores louder
she opens the window and pulls back the cover
the cold air makes him draw up
on walking out linda says in a rather hurt voice remember you promised to take sunny to magic mountain today
babe brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart is bothering him
gideon tries to put his pants on
he is too weak and sits back on the bed with his pants only up as far as his knees
suzie gets up to turn off the coffee kettle
when the kettle whistle dies away the sound of gideons voice is heard calling suzie for help
the sound of his voice frightens her
suzie bursts into the room and then moves very slowly to gideon who is sitting on the bed out of breath
im worn out
just stay in bed and rest
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up
you stay inside
i will see to them
i will appreciate that
suzie and junior are sitting at the dining room table
harry looking like he has just gotten out of bed drags himself in
how is everybody
how did you sleep last night
there is obvious hostility in juniors tone
harry senses juniors hostility and chooses to ignore it
ah you young folks dont know how it is
how is gideon today
he wasnt able to get out of bed today
i hope that its nothing serious
he has never gotten rid of the malaria
he is usually up and at it the next day
im going to make him fresh chicken broth
let me earn my keep
ill go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot
try to make him some cow tea next time
junior stares at harry
harry returns juniors stare and junior finds himself embarrassed
junior looks down at his pants leg and attempts to fix the crease in his pants by making a wedge with his fingers and running his fingers along the old
as harry walks towards the back door he looks back at junior
the pigeons take to the air like an explosion
the chickens start to cackle and run about as harry reaches for one with his cane
the sound of the boy next door practicing with his trumpet adds to the bedlam
suzie is standing on the steps shouting to harry
the noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out suzies voice
not getting harrys attention she hurries down the steps
harry has caught a hen that is screaming her head off
he looks around and finds suzie hurrying towards him
can you watch gideon for a while
one of the girls is going into labor
junior is going to drive me over
you just run along
ill fix him his soup
he will be all right
suzie and another woman who will be helping her are asleep
suzie is in the chair and the woman is asleep on the floor
the woman who is in labor is reading a magazine and seems somewhat bored
harry opens the door and slowly walks in
gideon is asleep
harry picks up gideons pants from the back of the chair
gideons false teeth fall to the floor
there is a flurry of activity the woman is contracting
the untouched chicken broth sits on the night stand
gideon is talking in his sleep
morning light filters through the window shade
the room takes on a brownish tint
gideon has dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged considerably
harry is reading the bible
he runs his finger over the print of the bible
after reading the passage he stares at the empty plate on the floor for what seems like a long time
he claps the bible shut causing a loud noise to echo through the house
suzie is walking slowly up the steps
suzie raises the window shade and is shocked to see the state that gideon is in
oh my lord
the room is crowded with people
suzie is putting gideons shirt on
harry is leaning against the door
after having put his shirt on suzie puts his house shoes on and directs babe brother and junior to hold him up while she tucks his shirt in and puts
on his suspenders
it takes almost everyone to hoist gideon
linda and pat push the bed and night stand out of the way as babe brother and junior struggle to lift gideon
they almost stumble at the door
harry is left standing in the room alone
harry okra and herman are trying to catch another chicken
herman is coughing badly and okra is out of breath
you think old gideon is going to live to see this month out
when i came upon the valley of bones the serpent said make this your home
dry as my soul be heaven is lost to thee
we all got to make way
harry puts the rooster face to the ground and draws a straight line
harry lets the rooster go but the rooster stays motionless unable to move
a chicken hates to see the preacher coming to dinner
herman hands harry the ax
harry is poised over the chicken with the ax appreciating the moment
harry raises the ax
the sound of rodney starting to practice his trumpet brings the rooster out of the trance
before harry can react the rooster jumps away
herman you will have to catch the next one cause im out of breath
if i have to chase after one we wont eat
a sack drops over the fence
okra limps over to see what is in the bag
he uses a stick to open the bag
he doesnt like what he sees and throws the bag back over the fence
suzie junior and pat are standing around gideons bed
he is in a room full of old veterans who are apparently nearing the end
two old veterans one white and the other black sitting opposite each other wearing medals sit in silence staring into each others eyes
a nurse empties an old mans urine bag
the old man doesnt show any embarrassment about his predicament
gideon looks at how the patients are treated
i dont want to stay here
beat where is babe brother
is sitting on the bed reading the job section of the paper
herman is putting vicks vapo rub in a bowl of boiling water
he covers his head over the bowl with a towel
okra is sitting at the table examining his gun
he points it at the floor seeing if the sight is straight
harry is sitting at the table with babe brother
harry is showing him how to cheat at cards
never play with someones elses cards
you always get a new deck
look at this card
it is just a regular card
son i can take everything you got with that deck
it is marked
now im going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere
a moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats over everything
suzie turns out the kitchen light and then turns out the dining room light
she goes to her room and closes the door leaving the room dark
a car headlight passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the wall
the light reveals harrys presence standing in the hall doorway
gideon is being helped up the steps by his sons
suzie is holding the door open while gideon is carried in by junior and babe brother
gideon is led to a chair
he still looks awful
doesnt he look a whole of lot better
well you look better than you did yesterday
next time i dont care how sick ill be dont take me back to the veterans hospital
harry comes out of the bathroom having just taken a bath
harry seems delighted to see gideon again
boy i thought you were about to cross the river
i tell you i feel like a ghost
harry signals babe brother to come over to him
son would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom
my hand is too weak
and would you do me another favor
i dont like asking this but would you clean the tub for me
i have trouble bending over
anytime you need someone to do something for you just let me know
harry flops down on the couch
suzie sets a cup of coffee on the table for gideon
harry looks up from sharpening his knife on a hand sharpening stone
he spits on it
that smells like fresh coffee
let me get you a cup
only if you can spare it
junior stands over harrys shoulder looking at him sharpening his knife
harry feels uncomfortable with junior standing behind him
harry looks up at him
son would you get me an old piece of newspaper
suzie sets a cup of coffee in front of harry
lord if you aint an angel
junior hands harry the newspaper
harry puts the paper under his foot and trims his toenails with it
harry is aware of junior standing over him
i will leave you something in my will
junior looks in but babe brother is too busy trying to clean the bathtub to notice anyone
babe brother complains to himself
what in the hell
gideon and suzie are in silhouette against the window
the sound of the boy trying to play his horn next door startles gideon
gideon turns to look out of the window towards mrs
its good to be able to hear that
you must have been really sick
how is the garden doing
i need to get out there and get those weeds out
how is that hen doing
i was meaning to pip her before i fell sick
he takes a deep breath and blows it out
im going to lie down
take my hand and help me up lest i fall
suzie helps gideon to undress
gideon loses hit balance but catches himself on the side of the bed
oh i couldnt have last another day in that hospital
you get weary being in the old soldiers home old soldiers and war stories
they wait to tell you their last story the next morning the nurse pulls a sheet over their face
junior is putting up a new light fixture
pat hands him a tool
rhonda is washing dishes in the kitchen
he just leeches off your parents
he is a master at wearing out welcome
harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock
where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends
they all smell of moth balls
junior slips on the ladder and the wires touch
there is a big spark
all the lights in the house go out
linda is standing over the stove sweating as she stirs a hot pot of boiling soup
babe brother and harry are seated at the table playing cards
sunny is on the floor near his mother
every time she move he follows her
harry notices sunny has his shoes on the wrong foot and adds in a sarcastic way how old is that boy
babe brother looks at sunnys shoe
linda how come you dont see that sunny puts his shoes on right
why in the h
close to tears she turns and with exaggerated care puts the spoon down and gently puts sunny in a chair
she starts to untie his shoes
sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping her eyes
lets give dry bones a call to see if he is coming or not
okra likes to exaggerate keep you waiting all night
harry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to use the phone
linda watches him go
she is deep in thought
babe brother attempting to cut the roast before it is ready is pushed aside by linda who is almost out of control with rage
why dont you wait
babe brother attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast slings lindas arm away
his hand accidentally hits her in the eye
linda grabs the fork poised to strike but gains control of herself she looks like a person who is on the verge of having a breakdown
she goes back to putting the shoes on sunny
babe brother feeling sorry doesnt know what to do
he automatically picks up the fork and washes it off
linda picks up sunny
linda is standing at the door with a red eye welcoming harrys friends which seem to be a long line of sickly people
linda is busy serving everyone running in and out of the kitchen bringing more things and removing used plates etc
lindas eye is swollen and discolored
the guests look at lindas eye and then cast a naughty boy glance at babe brother
linda stops serving to pay attention to an elderly man who deliberately bends one of her spoons
she catches another man putting a fork in his pocket and an elderly lady putting a cigarette out in one of her plates
as she is about to confront the man about pocketing her spoon a peal of laughter forces her to turn around only to witness a lady knocking over a glass
filled with a green drink with her elbow
the stain spreads across the table cloth in an even manner like a single wave
she watches it move from one end of the table to the other
harry is seated in the middle
the composition hints at the last supper
linda is reading a book to sunny who has his coffee can of marbles emptied on the bed
the noise from the party in the next room is clearly heard
every time she hears something crashing to the floor she wrenches
babe brother comes in and stands in the doorway
lindas eye is still swollen
go back to your friends
babe brother closes the door and leaves linda reading stories of brer rabbit to sunny
she stops reading to look at him playing marbles on the bed
five weighty women dressed in church robes and the preacher walk up gideons steps
suzie invites the church members in
sister weve come to see how you were doing
we came to ask if we could pray over gideon
gideon is asleep
the church members gather around his bed
the preacher puts his hand on the foot of the bed and discovers that there is something strange under the covers
suzie looks at him and lifts the covers at the foot of the bed
gideons feet are resting on dead leaves
i put some plummer christian leaves under his feet to draw the fever out
what else have you been giving him
i crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea
suzie i would think you would depend on prayer rather than these old fashion remedies
let us read from the bible
the preacher opens his bible and reads silently
the choir hums and begin to sway
gideons snoring is very competitive
the choir becomes louder
gideon starts to talk in his sleep
suzie is alarmed
a lady steps upon the stage which has different backdrops
she is the same lady in a photo that gideon has hanging in one of the kids rooms
the photographer who is off screen asks about the background
what scene would you like in the background
we have plantations
the woman shakes her head
natchez cotton fields harlem sunflowers the mississippi river
put the river behind me
a large picture of the mississippi appears behind the lady
it changes from a painted backdrop to a moving picture
there is a storm developing off in the distance
the sound of thunder is heard
the picture in the background then changes to a boy on a mule
the boy on the gray mule doesnt have a shirt on
a light mist like rain covers him
gideon walks along the picket fence towards the boy on the mule
ahead of gideon seems to be a puddle but as he approaches he discovers that it is an abyss
the boy and the mule on the other side fade away
everything fades to black
the preacher turns a page in the bible
gideon has his mouth open like a fish trying to get air
the choir continues to sing
the preacher gets down on his knees and holds gideons hand he bows his head
the choir stops singing
the bessie smith recording of muddy water is coming from somewhere in the house
the preacher looks around
suzie is more puzzled
she goes to find where the music is coming from
suzie knocks on the door
no one answers
she peeps in
no one is in the room
the preacher and the choir all have their hands on gideon
suzie enters the room
i dont know where that music is coming from
junior and pat are helping linda carry her baggage inside as sunny reluctantly follows
it is obvious that linda has left babe brother
i want my daddy
boy hush that noise and get in this house
i want my daddy i told you
rhonda drag him in here
if you be nice i will take you to disneyland
pat linda and junior put the suitcases down
now you dont have to say anything if you dont want to
i want to hear what happened
my brother is a jackass and a damn fool
the both of you have been as scarce as hens teeth
linda looks down embarrassed
rhonda take sunny in the backyard
take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries
sunny will enjoy it
rhonda and sunny leave
pat turns on junior about talking bad about babe brother and linda in front of sunny
you shouldnt talk about the boys father in front of him
this is family business and we have to pull together
whether the boy hears it or not the man is still a jackass
everyone should have some mother wit
something just took control of him
he stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money
its probably harry but i hate to mention his name because every time we say something about him something bad happens
rhonda and sunny are looking under a strawberry plant
sunny has strawberry stains around his mouth and on his shirt
rhonda is putting her strawberries in the bowl
after getting a bowl full they lay on the grass eating strawberries while looking up at the clouds slowly drifting by
babe brother is driving along a country road while harry sitting in the front seat next to him yawns
harry is tired
let us walk awhile
i grow weary when i sit still too long
babe brothers car stops in an orchard like area
babe brother and harry get out of the car
they walk on a path that takes them under low hanging tree limbs
it gets darker as they go deeper into the orchard
babe brother finds the going rough and loses his footing
give me your arm lest you fall
harry has to help him stay on his feet
babe brother finds it necessary to take harrys arm
babe brother stops and harry walks a few more steps ahead and waits for babe brother
just ahead sitting on a branch is a huge white owl camouflaged by tree branches
i could swear i heard my son call me
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there
i heard his voice as clear as day
i better get back
maybe something is wrong
babe brother turns and starts hurrying back before harry can object
he walks slowly after babe brother who is doubling the distance between himself and harry as he runs through the orchard to his car
harry stops and looks around
pat linda and junior are seated at the table
the suitcases are in the middle of the floor
i told babe brother that if harry sets foot in our house again im taking sunny and leaving
just as i said that here come harry and his old resurrected friends hobbling up the steps
is that how you got that black eye
dont ask that
no this was an accident
it was unintentional
babe brother reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable
he wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains
there was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches
the phone rings and junior goes to pick it up
lindas and pats attention is focused on the phone
junior hands the phone to linda
its that nut of yours
linda hesitates but pat takes the phone from junior and puts it in her hand
what do you want
nothing happened to him
sunny and rhonda enter
linda turns to look
sunnys hands and face look bloody from eating strawberries
she puts the phone down and examines his dirty face
pat brings linda a wet towel
baker a well built black man in his late s is making a new fishing pole
he is very involved
baker is standing beside him with her arms folded
she stares at him
baker glances at her
what are you doing
counting the gray hairs in your head
counting the what
what does that have to do with the price of butter
i was just trying to make conversation
where is skip
he is in his pigeon cage
im sorry he got those birds
you know the man next door is near death
baker doesnt answer
he pauses for a moment of thought
baker sees that she is not going to get a response from her husband
she picks up an eyelet and mr
baker looks at her as if to say keep your hands off
she gets the message and lays the eyelet back on the work bench
he must have gotten rid of those chickens
you dont hear them crowing anymore
i kind of miss it now
baker admires his pole
he looks very closely at the details of his work
rodney comes in polishing his horn
bakers expression changes as he watches rodney out of the corner of his eye
baker gives rodney a motherly pat on the head
rodney puts the trumpet to his mouth
dont blow that thing in here
you blow that thing when im at work
there is a man lying on a bus bench with his belongings
a spotted dog is standing guard next to the bench
the dogs reflection is caught in a puddle of water
the dog has circles and sixes painted over his body
old john taps on the bench with his pipe
the man lying on the bench stirs and gives old john a wave to indicate that he is alright
old john slowly gets his cart moving again
babe brother drives around the block past juniors house
junior is at the window looking out
why doesnt he just park his car and come in and apologize
babe brother sits in his car with the windows up
junior tries to talk to him but babe brother will not roll down the windows
he just stares at junior who is getting angry
roll down the window and let me talk to you
babe brother only stares at him
junior gets more violent and starts to shake the car
pat calls from the doorway
stop it junior
a woman is in a squatting position
suzie and her aide are holding the woman by the arms
rhonda is painting her fingernails
sunny watches her
she looks around to see if any adult is watching
she tries to talk sunny into letting her paint his nails
he refuses but she tries to pull his hand towards her
he fights his way free and stands up and kicks the bottle of nail polish over
mama come see what sunny did
suzie is sitting in a chair her head is bent forward
gideon is talking in his sleep
she awakes and nods off again
harry sticks his head in
how is he doing
as long as he keeps his throat clear he is able to get some rest
i made a fresh pot of coffee
okra and i thought you need a rest
ill stand guard
okra wants to talk to you anyway
harry helps suzie to her feet
okra is painfully standing on his bad feet
he is in his security guard uniform holding a bouquet of greens
as suzie comes in okra tries to stand upright at attention
i brought you these greens and some salt meat
that is very thoughtful of you
i havent had time to tend to my garden like i should
suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter
she squeezes okras hand as a thank you
she pours him a cup of coffee
okra eases down into the chair
he crosses his legs and starts massaging his feet
suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him
she stretches and tries to hold back a yawn
okra looks at her in a slightly desirous way
you know gideon and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother
you are very sweet but gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him
he has a policy
if you become a widow you will need someone around to fix the whatnots
we like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge
i know gideon aint gone yet but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line
i just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal to be first in line so to speak
suzie keeps herself under control she tries to find words to say
she stands up
i have to go feed my dog
she turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits the back door
okra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet
harry is sitting by the bed just visible through the window
he seems restless
there is only one hen left in the coop
the garden is full of weeds
the sunflowers are bent by the force of the wind
a bag is thrown over the fence
the shadows of pigeons flying overhead race along the ground
two shadows on the wall are facing each other
the shadows are the heads of two women suzie and hattie
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt
and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog
i remember harry always trying to help someone
he got lullas daughter out of trouble
he was always running to the store for someone who couldnt leave the house
harry always shows his good side and like the moon the other side is black
back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman
im telling you harry is nothing but evil
im warning you you cant keep a wild animal as a pet around children
harry has a plate of food in his hand
he stands facing himself in the mirror staring at himself while he eats
he opens the door to leave but sunny is in the hallway with his back turned sweeping
harry stares at him and decides to go back in his room
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening
rush your mouth girl
no he didnt
he cannot be that big of a damn fool
i asked harry about it
he didnt own up to it
he said he didnt know what got into okra
hes just raffish
harry put him up to it
before evening sun sets i would have his belongings back on route that old fox
i cant accuse him just dry long
everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes
what must i do
if it was left up to me i would poison him
harry sees that it is safe to leave
he sees sunny sweeping in gideons room
gideon is sound asleep
sunny is sweeping around the bed
harry comes in and hattie and suzie stop talking
harry is aware that he was the subject
the sound of the boy next door playing his horn is heard
good afternoon ladies
good afternoon to you
harry waits for hattie to respond but it is obvious that hattie isnt about to speak to him
im going to check on gideon
harry moves out of her way to let her go by
hattie doesnt even give him a glance
harry continues to look at her as she disappears into gideons room
as god is my witness i have never done anything to that woman
you must have done something to her
since she has repented all she does is throw stones
hattie is a different person now
i dont make no bones about where im going to spend eternity
i have always been wild and you know that
if you are made to feel half a man what do you think the other half is
im glad you brought that up as to who you are
i have to know who is in my house
you invited me
only if you are a good man a friend
are you a friend
harry takes his time in looking for an answer
like that boy next door playing that his horn
if he was a friend he would stop irritating people but if he stops practicing he wouldnt be perfect in what he does someday
hattie enters harrys room
she goes through his things
she reads one of his letters
as she walks over to the window reading his letter she steps on the plate cracking it
i want you to leave
harry looks sad and suddenly a lot older as if what she said has taken away some of his life
and herman want to go back home with me
beat suzie im not a bad fellow i just like to have a good time
is coming by to pick me up tonight
ill come back to get my things
well i hope gideon recovers
you know i have an extra picture of one of my sons that i would like for you to put with those baby pictures over your dresser
its better than being in my dusty wallet with addresses and names of people who are no longer on this earth
suzie takes the picture
she seems as if she has doubts about having asked harry to leave
ill say my so longs to gideon before i leave and i truly wish that he will get well
suzie continues to look at the picture
hattie is reading harrys letters when he appears behind her
hattie turns but is not surprised or concerned about harry
she hands him back his letters looks at him for a moment and goes
harry looks down at the cracked dish
and herman are packing
okra is all dressed up with a pair of stacy adams shoes that make his feet look exaggeratedly long
babe brother and harry are sitting at a table playing blackjack
okra picks up one thing at a time making the packing much harder
there is a stack of old dusty record okra trying to step over the records kicks over a box of mothballs that roll across the floor
okra has to step over boxes of toilet paper
why did you buy so much toilet paper
i got that on the job when i was a janitor
they didnt pay me
harry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens
dice shotgun shells some spent
slugs and an old rusty knife a crab apple switch land on the floor
harry picks up the knife
whose old piece of knife is this
that was my brothers knife
harry gives the knife to babe brother and signals him to put it in his pocket
the sound of the thunder has an unreal violence to it
i dont want to wear out welcome but you can stay in someones heart longer than you can stay in their house
come with us boy
we are going to have a good time
this would be a bad time for me to leave
we are going where the action is
aint that right okra
then back to babe brother lets play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up
beat what would you give to be rich
babe brother humps his shoulder
babe brother looks at his hand
had moms and pops given me my share of what was mine i could have been rich by now
linda and i had it all worked out
harry wins the first hand
i know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal
you want to get your wife back get another woman one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat
harry wins another hand
and okra are still packing while herman is eating argo starch
double the stakes
babe brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere else
harry studies his hand and looks at babe brother he puts down his hand
babe brother wins and is quite pleased
the next series of hands are won by babe brother
you ever heard of a real man having one woman
when one woman puts you out you have another to take you in
you dont drive around without a spare tire do you
the more mules you have hitched the easier it is to plough
harry loses another hand and babe brother suddenly has a pile of money
herman let me borrow a few bucks
herman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off several
herman is standing behind babe brother singing to himself
in the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole
now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree
now there is a hole in the ground a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the hole
let me share something with you
harry stops and thinks for a while
hattie is a snake
that woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right
okra is taking several shotguns out of the closet
these damn things are unloaded aint they
its important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire
as amos and andy might say we is the outgoing fire
come with us son
well show you some steaming hot juke joints steaming hot women
a pot full of chitlins and a good time
let me go by the house first
we will wait for you as long as we can
i got to get my things from your mothers house
babe brother hurries out
herman and okra flop down in chairs and on the bed and look at their watches
harry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and whistling very softly to himself
suddenly harry sees that babe brother left the pile of money on the table
a look of concern comes over his face
it is raining hard
babe brother gets out of the car
running to get out of the rain he slips and falls he tries to get up but slips and falls again
he gets up and walks slowly up the steps as if he doesnt care whether he gets wet or not
suzie helps him to take his wet coat off
she goes into the kitchen puts his coat in front of the stove
the knife falls out
she picks it up and looks at it like she would throw it away but babe brother takes it
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage
im going back home with harry
ive heard some foolish things in my life
harry is coming to pick me up
have you lost your mind
have you thought about your wife and child not to mention your sick father
and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling
dont make me raise my hand to you
you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction
cant i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong
the world is not black and white
show me one perfect person
if you cant dont ask me to be
i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start
you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough
forcefully you sit right there with your no manners self
junior is carrying a roll of roofing paper
pat rhonda linda and sunny run to the porch to get out of the rain
junior stacks the roofing paper in the corner of the porch and stamps the mud off his shoes
junior pat linda and rhonda come in to help suzie move the bed from under the rain dripping through the hole in the ceiling
sunny stands in the doorway watching his father sharpen his knife that he got from harry
babe brother is unaware that his son is watching him
where is babe brother
brother is in the kitchen
how come you didnt ask babe brother to help you
he said he was busy
he is mad cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with harry
linda has a surprised look on her face
so he is busy
babe brother is preoccupied sharpening his knife with a sharpening stone
he is almost in a trance
junior comes in rather angrily
sunny goes and sits in the shadows in the dining room
why in the hell didnt you help mama
i told her i would if she would give me time
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof you would have rebuilt the whole damn house
you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son it is always you so you fix the roof
that is a damn lie and you know it
every time father asks you to do something you either half ass do it or run off and hide
mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her with your smart ass self that you werent a farmer get junior to do it
every time someone asks you to do something you always say tell junior to do it
boy you ought to grow up
i told you about calling me boy
i aint no boy
see you and dad got a bad habit of calling me boy
you call me boy in front of my wife
you think im going to fix the roof
i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain
i ought to break your damn neck
sunny is sitting in a chair listening to his father and uncle argue in the kitchen
a car outside passes and the lights from the car form a crochet like moving pattern on the wall behind him
sunny is only lit for a moment
babe brother starts gathering up his things to leave
im leaving and dont even call me when the shoe falls cause all he did for me was to try and run my life
im tired of people saying babe brother this babe brother that
whats my name
you dumb ass its babe brother
my name is sam
babe brother attempts to get up but junior pushes him down
babe brother hits junior on the jaw driving him backwards causing the overhead lamp to sway violently
suzie pat and linda hear the noise coming from the kitchen and rush to see what is going on
babe brother and junior are both reaching for the knife
junior is on top of babe brother who is stretched out on the table trying to reach the knife
junior grabs the knife first and babe brother flips over to defend himself
babe brother grabs juniors wrist as junior tries to push the knife against his throat
suzie comes in and grabs part of the knife with her hand and juniors wrist with her other hand
pat and linda try to pull the two men apart while pleading with junior
blood drips from suzies hand to the table forming a pool under babe brothers head
look what you are doing
babe brothers eyes are rolled to the back
juniors eyes are huge he has an animal look on his face
the sound of struggling people breathing heavily is amplified
the pool of blood on the table grows larger
junior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body relaxes
he calmly releases the knife
junior takes his mothers hand
someone get some lard out of the ice box
pat attempts to get the lard but pain in her stomach forces her to sit down
linda gets the lard out and hands it to junior
babe brother raises himself
the blood from suzies dripping from his head
rhonda is trying to hold sunny back
junior holds his mothers hand under the faucet
it is a deep cut
the bleeding wont stop
pat is sitting at the blood stained table unable to move
she is panting sweating and holding her stomach
linda is caught between trying to help suzie and attending to pat
babe brother helps to make a wad of cloth to press in her hand to stop the bleeding
you are going to need some stitches
we better take her to the emergency hospital
babe brother is shamefully calm now and very humble
ill drive her to the hospital
we will take her
you all stay here and watch dad
what about pat
im okay now
suzie attempts to go see gideon but babe brother and junior turn her to the door
going through the kitchen door junior intentionally turns his back to babe brother
babe brother stares at juniors back as he walks ahead
the automatic doors open and junior babe brother and suzie enter
there is a long line of people waiting at the registration window as well as groups of people filling out forms
other patients are seated and waiting patiently to see the doctor
suzie finally gets to the registration window
a nurse white with extremely long fingernails that curve back around is surprisingly sympathetic
what sort of emergency are you here for
i cut my hand
let me take a look at it
suzie puts her hand through the window
the nurse stands up to get a better look
the nurse takes the wad out of her hand
the bleeding has stopped
the nurse takes a deep breath
the nurse glances up to notice the blood stains on the back of babe brother head
are you all together
the bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches
you will have to fill out this form
how will this be covered insurance cash or check
dont worry about it
it will be paid
just let her see a doctor
i have medicare
the nurse hands suzie a form but babe brother takes the form
the nurse looks again at babe brothers head
do you need to see the doctor too
no just my mother
babe brother fills out the form with suzies help and hands the form back to the nurse
they find a seat all together
the room slowly fills with people and babe brother and junior offer their seats to those there for medical care
two police officers bring in a man handcuffed to a bed
the woman officer carries a shotgun
the male police officer carries a clip board
the prisoner is obviously in no condition to escape or cause trouble
they are allowed to go directly to the emergency room without waiting
more injured people come but in spite of their condition they are told that they have to wait
there is only standing room
junior and babe brother are standing next to the wall
on the other side of the room suzie is looking quietly at them as if she is in deep thought
junior walks over to the reception desk
why is it so crowded
well it is friday night and a full moon
junior whispers to babe brother
they both start to laugh
suzie looks up and finds them in a fit of laughter
a faint smile appears on her face
gideon is slowly getting up
he looks around
he calls for suzie
he slowly gets to his feet
suzie im hungry
he walks by linda pat rhonda and sunny who are sleeping in chairs on the floor and on the sofa
gideon opens the refrigerator and starts taking out bowls of food and placing them on the table
he puts on a pot of coffee
gideon is busy eating almost everything in sight
a group of mystified and sleepy faces appear at the door
pat linda rhonda and sunny are all looking rather dumbfounded
everything is wet from the nights rain
the garden looks more like a graveyard
moisture drips from the sunflowers
gideons nervous looking rooster jumps the fence and starts to crow
skip is out early throwing rocks at his birds
the rocks land on gideons roof
babe brother and junior help suzie out of the car
she has her left hand bandaged
they are extremely exhausted
they walk up the porch to find harry holding the door open
i cant believe what i heard took place
on seeing suzie sunny jumps up knocking the can of marbles over the kitchen floor
he runs to give suzie a hug
sunny wants to touch her bandaged hand but linda stops him
how is gideon doing
he is asleep now but he was up all night eating
as suzie goes to gideons room she comes face to face with harry
she doesnt say anything
i came to pick up my things
gideon is snoring loudly
on the night stand is a plate with food left on it
suzie feels his forehead
harry sadly gets up
he looks at babe brother
linda steps in front of babe brother
you ought to go see how your father is doing and then wash that blood off you and change shirts
babe brother is surrounded by linda and sunny who has his eyes fixed on harry
they move as one heading for the bedroom
harry seems a lot older
he sadly walks towards the kitchen with his coffee cup
low angle shot harry is slowly walking towards the marbles that are scattered over the kitchen floor
pat linda junior rhonda babe brother sunny and suzie are all standing around waiting for gideon to wake up
gideons only response is to snore louder
how long is harry going to hang around
babe brother is in a corner all by himself
he looks down when pat asks the question about harry
a loud crashing sound comes from the kitchen
harry is trying to raise himself from the floor
he pauses for a moment and then collapses
harry is in a lot of pain
harrys body contorts and then remains still
babe brother junior pat and linda suzie run in
suzie tries to see if he is alive
babe brother tries to give him mouth to mouth resuscitation but linda pulls him away
junior tries to push down on harrys chest
babe brother stares down at harry and then goes slowly back into the living room
pat is on the phone dialing the paramedics
everyone stands around harry
two paramedics work on harry
one of the paramedics is a young asian
the other is white with red hair
they listen for a heart beat and shake their heads in a negative manner
they pack up their medical case
the asians accent is very difficult to understand
there is nothing we can do for him
the paramedics start to leave without the body
well arent you going to take him with you
if he had died in our care we would be required to take him
since we found him dead you will have to wait for the county to pick him up
how long will that take
that would depend on how busy it is
harry is stretched out on the floor
a blanket covers everything except his shoes
hattie marsh okra herman and m
all come in
marsh looks cheerful
he slipped on some marbles that were on the floor
then his heart gave out
to sunny i told you to always put those marbles up and not to leave them just anywhere
the poor thing is not to blame
rhonda take sunny for a walk
marsh hands rhonda several dollars
here go around to the store and buy what you want
would anybody object if i take a look at him
i dont think harry would like it
hattie goes over and pulls the blanket back
and herman hurry over to take a quick glance
they huddle behind hattie peeping over her shoulder
i never noticed how big his eyes were
linda is helping babe brother wash suzies blood out of his hair
she dries his hair with a towel
sonny hands babe brother a clean shirt gideons shirt
he puts it on
gideon is sitting on the edge of his bed looking through the scraps of leftovers on his plate
he puts his pants on
as he moves about his joints snap and pop
he picks up the empty plate
babe brother is on the phone with the county morgue
he gets into an argument with the people on the other end of the phone
excuse me for cutting you off but we pay taxes too
we should not have to pay you to take a hour lunch break
babe brother hands the phone to linda
the coroner said that he was out here and knocked on the door and no one was here
junior steps over the body holding a pot of coffee in his hand
the preacher is sitting with suzie talking in a low voice
pat rhonda and sunny come in with boxes of chicken snack
linda hangs up the phone
he doesnt know when he will be out this way again
somebody downtown is going to hear about this
they just do that in the colored neighborhood
if he had been white they would had him on his feet and out of here
i got white meat and i got dark meat
i know it sounds cruel but we have to eat
gideon comes in walking very slowly holding his plate out
everyone is shocked
gideon is completely unaware of the period that he has been sick
what are you having another party
you better come sit down
you are still sick
gal youre talking to john henry
when was i sick
you have been out for almost three weeks
the preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes gideons hand
we had long conversations with the lord about you
didnt we sister suzie
i said we need him down here lord
gideon smiles in appreciation
he pushes his plate out to pat indicating that he wants it filled with chicken
gideon is about to bite into the chicken when he notices harrys feet sticking out
he points with the chicken in his hand
he has a mystified look on his face
thats our friend harry
not our harry
i wish it wasnt
gideon seems to weaken for a moment
what happened to him
he dropped dead
hattie you can be so mean
how long has he been dead
since this morning
what happened to your hand
i cut it on an old rusty knife
gideon is deeply concerned
what did you put on it
its healing now
gideon looks over at his two sons as if to ask them about it
i hope you will take care of your mother better than that when im gone
junior and babe brother both have their heads down
linda and sunny move closer to babe brother
babe brother is that my shirt that youre wearing
how come youre not wearing my shoes
theyre too big
gideon stares at babe brother and then looks around towards harry
when is the undertaker coming
they cant say
ill try calling them again
hattie moves closer to herman and speaks so only he can hear
why dont m
and you drag him to your house
herman moves away with a look of disdain
harry didnt have any relatives living did he
harry was in the world by himself
somebody has to take responsibility for him
why dont you look through his things to see if you can find a number
okra marsh hattie herman and m
go to harrys room leaving suzie and gideon sitting opposite each other with the door to the kitchen separating them
junior the preacher and pat are eating chicken
linda is on the phone trying to get through to the morgue
how do you like that
they hung up in my face
ill fix them
ill show them just how mean i can get
she rapidly dials the number
there is a busy signal
this has been a nightmare
and marsh are going through harrys boxes
they take out old blues records books a big bible and books on dunbar
these are letters to his son
hattie reads the letters in a corner by herself
she stops reading for a moment
i still dont know if i was right about harry
she seems frustrated with herself not being able to come to terms about who was harry
a crowd of people are standing around looking at gideons house
the preacher is sleep in his chair snoring loudly
babe brother and linda are sitting together talking in almost a whisper
sunny is asleep in his lap
babe brother is finding it difficult to apologize for his recent behavior
i have more sense than to give up everything my family you and sunny
it wasnt me i mean the real me inside my body
im glad its over
its like a veil has been lifted
like a veil has been lifted
its like ive been swimming in muddy waters
like muddy waters
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like
you were in hell
i couldnt believe the things i was doing
it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body
do you think you won
it was nip and tuck
and what lesson have we learned from all of this babe br
i mean samuel
i guess it proves you really care about me
you hung in there
linda looks at babe brother for a length of time
when are you boys going to fix that roof
soon as i rest a bit
beat i meant as soon as we are back to normal again anytime
here i am thinking about myself when poor harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen
harrys body lies there motionless
the preacher is snoring violently
babe brother is asleep on the floor
sunny is asleep sitting on lindas lap
lindas feet rest on babe brothers chest
junior and pat are looking at the baby pictures
pat is holding her hand across her stomach feeling the baby kick
rhonda is asleep in a chair
suzie and gideon are sitting at the dining room table
suzie is cutting the dead leaves off of a small potted plant
it feels like a storm has passed
hattie read some of harrys letters to a woman he had a child by
the child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort
hattie didnt know that deep down at the bottom of harrys hate there was some love
the sound of rodneys trumpet is heard but is no longer irritating
did i ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell
he didnt want nobodys opinion but his own
suzie doesnt pay any attention she is involved with her potted plant
gideon looks over at the preacher who is still asleep
hes going to check out heaven first
he gets a round trip ticket to heaven
he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home
people dripping with sweat working in the fields hardly surviving
he asked a man who was getting a drink of water i thought the streets were paved with gold
they are but you wont see them he said
boy you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness
so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell
he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back picking their teeth
man this is a dream
he asked whats youll doing
they all hollered back sinning
the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said please to meet you
he asked i thought youll was supposed to be burning in fire
someone said man aint no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins
the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth
i dont want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell
youre being irreverent
im almost finished
im about to come to the punch line
i dont want to hear any tales about colored people
but these are white people anybody
i dont care to hear any jokes about people being in hell
this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at
its only a tale
the rattling of pots and dishes starts suddenly
harrys body starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up
everyone is frozen
babe brother and linda remain asleep
the rocking caused by the earthquake doesnt wake them
herman okra and hattie and marsh enters the dining room
harrys feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying
is that an earthquake
babe brother wakes in a sweat and sits next to linda like a child needing protection
i need to get out into the sunlight
what is it noontime
i wonder how they going to bury this man
plant him in potters field
he doesnt need a marked grave
hattie your true colors are unbearable
you got some mean ways
dont worry about the boy getting a burial
he still has some friends left on this earth
his winter has come and gone and i know right now he is answering for a lot of things
okra and herman move away from hattie
it is my job to pray for his soul and i would like to do that
rhonda is sitting next to sunny on the front porch
she has an angry expression
sunny is trying to please her by offering her his airplane
he pushes the airplane near her and she pushes it back with a violent shove
he persists in offering her his airplane
a crowd of people is still standing around in front of gideons house
hey boy you still got that dead man in your house
sunny and rhonda dont respond
a middle aged woman virginia one of gideons neighbors passes sunny and rhonda knocks on the screen door and goes in
i know you all havent had a chance to cook or do anything with that dead man in your kitchen
you must be starved to death
some of your neighbors have got together and we set up a picnic table in my backyard with food and everything to feed all you all
virginia that is so wonderful of you all
if the dead wagon comes we ought to leave a note telling them well be down the street at a picnic
gideon comes back in with suzie who is helping tie his tie
they all line up and file out the front door with suzie and gideon leading the way
pat is holding her stomach with a thoughtful look on her face
i think we better be ready
junior looks concerned as he follows pat out the door
sunny follows rhonda who is still mad at him
babe brother and linda are the last ones out
babe brother takes a long look in the direction of harry as linda pulls him out
she slams the door
harrys body lies on the floor
on the kitchen sink are suzies jars of cuttings which have developed a maze of roots
