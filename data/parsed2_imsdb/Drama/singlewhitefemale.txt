screenplay by don roos adapted from the novel swf seeks same by john lutz on a black screen the words without capital letters in front of the words columbia pictures
presents and then a film by barbet schroeder we dont know if its day or night
we see a little girl aged around eight putting lipstick on her lips
she is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand
she moves forward and we see another girl about the same age
the first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl
both girl are smiling
more credits still without capital letters
the camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl
the two girls appear to be twins
the first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girls cheeks
the two girls look at themselves in the mirror
the camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror
the first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl
the title of the film appears on the black screen
the camera moves and we see appearing on the right hand side of the screen this building is actually allisons building but we dont know it yet
credits resume on the screen
the camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows
the building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls
the camera moves backward giving us a full view of the building
as the camera comes back forward we hear two voices speaking one male one female
they are the voices of allison allie jones and her fiance sam rawson
sam voice over so how many kids do we want
allison voice over i dunno
whats the statistical norm
sam voice over you and your statistics
allison laughs sam voice over one point two
allison voice over okay then i want two point two
fade to sam and allison are lying on the bed partly dressed
sam is holding allison next to him
they are both about thirty years old
allison has short red hair and sam has brown wavy hair
behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony
the light is very dim in the room lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles
we hear allison finishing her last voice over sentence
and i want them to look like you
end of credits
so if i got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow ill buy you that ring
so is this gonna be a real wedding
she moves a bit away from him and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor
as opposed to a fake one
you know what i mean sam
youve already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people
that was the fake one
this is the real one
you can have any kind of wedding you want
in and out of a steam room in the wild
allison goes back into sams arms
its going to have to be a small one you know
ive not been in new york long enough to know very many people
oh youre invited
and my friend graham upstairs
it wont be long before you know half the people in new york
people like you you know
but i found you first
youre the only friend i need
youre the best thing that ever happened to me
they start kissing very tenderly
fade to two seconds of black screen
and then we see sam and allison asleep in the bed
they are naked but covered with the sheet
the phone rings
allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset
hold on a second
she bends down to take the telephone set
sam its your ex wife
she gives the receiver to sam
still half asleep sam takes the phone
sam puts the receiver to his ear
we hear vaguely lisas voice but not precisely enough to understand the words
im hanging up now
he puts the handset back on the telephone set which allison had put on the bed
she shouldnt call here
its where you live
the phone rings again
allison moves up to pick up the phone
dont answer it
the phone keeps on ringing
then the answering machine starts with hi its allison jones
but the rest of the message is covered by sam and allisons conversation
why does she do this
talk to her now
youre already up
ill get that
we hear the beep at the end of allisons message
allison is walking naked in the hall
would you pick up the phone please
please dont do this to me
sam voice over lisa
sam ive been sitting here since you left this afternoon
allison is standing up in the dark not moving
we hear sams voice partly from the bedroom and partly from the answering machine which gives the voice a sort of echo effect
sam voice over yeah
can we talk about this tomorrow
you cant come over here and sleep with me and then
close up on allisons face in the dark
she looks very shocked by what she hears
sam voice over and yelling allie allie i dont know how you shut that thing off
you said you were going to call
allison shuts the machine off
close up on sams face
he picks up the phone and puts the handset to his ear
we hear lisas voice saying hello sam huh huh
allison grabs a night robe and presses it on her naked body
sam voice over okay
sam is seated on the bed
he puts the phone back on the set
i take it back
shes not entitled
close up on the ancient looking ventilation system in the bedroom
the air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill as can be found in old new york buildings
sam voice over i didnt go over there intending to sleep with her allie
i swear to god
allison voice over oh well i fell a lot better knowing you can talk now
close up on the same air vent in grahams apartment
we can hear the conversation going on in allisons bedroom with a slight echo effect in the sound which makes some words incomprehensible but still well enough to get the
general idea of the conversation
sam voice over from the air vent shes very depressed ok
its the anniversary of our divorce
she heard we were getting married
she has been drinking
slowly the camera moves from the air vent to grahams bed
graham knox is about thirty years old and we shall learn later that he is gay
he is lying in his bed perhaps naked but we see only his chest the rest of his body being covered by the sheets
he was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system and is half raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation
allison voice over from the air vent i dont want to hear this
sam voice over from the air vent i feel bad for her
im moving on feeling guilty
it wont happen again
allison voice over from the air vent a few words incomprehensible i am supposed to trust you now
graham is listening with a worried look on his face
fade out to two second of black screen during which we keep on hearing the conversation through the ventilation system but without understanding the words
and then allison rings the bell of grahams apartment
it says on the door
a corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to the ceiling
graham walks along the corridor zipping his pants
he is bare chested
allison voice over through the door its me graham
graham opens the door
allison is just wearing a night robe and her face is full of tears
i told him to
and i cant be alone tonight
so i came up here
graham takes allison by the hand and brings her inside his apartment
graham closes the door behind allison
a nice room with pictures on the wall
allison is sleeping in a large bed
through the shutter less window we can see the other buildings
graham dressed in a black t shirt and kaki short pants enters the room and sits on the bed
he takes allisons leg through the bedcover
allison stands up with a start
allie i let you sleep
what time is it
oh my god allison jumps from the bed in a hurry
ive got a meeting
its really important
graham still seated on the bed watches her leave the room
allison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk
she comes to a shop and looks through the window
she combs her hair with her hand
a nice restaurant in new york
paintings on the walls
a waitress is talking on the phone
allison enters the restaurant and crosses the room to a table where a man who was sitting alone stands up when she comes to him
the man is mitchell myerson allisons appointment
im sorry im a little late
they shake hands
no no its worth the wait
they sit down
the man takes his glass
a little later
they have finished their meal
allison has put her laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard
on the screen of the computer we see models of womans dresses changing color and appearance each time allison presses a key
you can redefine your product on screen without going to an expensive designing concept
this is allison jones software and its a marketing tool no one else has
who do i get to run it
i stay to be the person to speak
thats included in the quote
thats the one thing i havent seen
best for last
she gives him a printed paper
i think youll find thats reasonable
as a ballpark
heres where i was thinking of playing
he takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document allison gave him
then he hands back the document to her
she reads it and seems surprised
it makes sense for you
you see after our last meeting i made some phone calls
to your former partner for one
no i wouldnt rely much on what she says
it was not a friendly split
and i did all the work
she took all the credit and she didnt like me telling her so
well i was more interested in the settlement you made
you walked off with the hardware and a rent controlled apartment
which means your overhead is minimal as is your client list
i could improve that if youre as good as you say you are
he points to what he wrote on the document allison is still holding
but that is the only way to prove it
well i could go for something
the waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table
no no please dont embarrass yourself
thats my final offer
now of course if you would like to think about it
allison takes the bill from the tray and tears the tab off the bill
ill get this
youll see it on my first expense report
i look forward to it
they shake hands
the front door opens and allison gets in and closes the door
she drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door
she goes to the answering machine and presses a key
the machine beeps
allison starts tearing the sheets off the bed
her movements are very nervous
and eventually she drops on the sheet less mattress and starts crying
we hear the first words of grahams sentence on the previous image of allison crying on her bed
allison and graham are working on their respective laundry on a table
we see washing machines working in the background
what is this
a song cue
youre nobody till somebody loves you
its just living alone you know
i thought about buying those books like cooking for one
its just too depressing
there are worse things than being on your own you know
maybe its all a sign i should go home
you came here for a reason
sam has nothing to do with that
no guy does
you think id let some guy interfere with my acting career
assuming i had a career
or a guy to interfere with it
youll find someone again
maybe i will
but the point is if i dont
i know that
i can do it on my own
ill just get a room mate
you could always call him allie
not if i have a room mate
an apple computer screen certainly mac os or even mac os since the film was made in
the window is titled comlink fax tm
on the window itself we can read when we first see the computer screen only swf seeks female to sh is written
we hear the clicks of the computer keys as the rest of the ad is written
the computer screen fades into a newspaper clip after professional pref is written
we see a newspaper clip where allisons ad has been highlighted with a felt pen red rectangle
it says swf seeks female to share apartment in west s
non smoker professional preferred
around this ad are other ads all about apartment renting or sharing
allison voice over the managers couldnt really know you want to live there
the previous voice over sentence ends on a close up of the folded newspaper with a red felt pen lying on the newspaper
the camera moves up from the desk on which the newspaper is lying to allisons face who is speaking over the telephone
around her we see other desks with people working
oh yes thats a promise
rent stabilized so you couldnt come on the lease
a young butch woman wearing a leather jacket and a black and white bandana around her head bangs her fist on the walls of the kitchen
she enters the kitchen where allison is sitting at a table
behind allison a nice white stove
the butch girl is carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand
in the credits the butch girl is called mannish applicant nice
you could really open em up
i cant wait to get in here
are you proper with tools
a young very pretty woman dressed in a short brown dress moves around the room and then looks at allison with a seducing eye
allison who is holding some papers in her hand looks at the departing applicant with an amused eye
later in the same room
another applicant is walking around the room
shes wearing large glasses and never stops talking
while she is walking we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera flashlight across the room
im an incest survivor you know
i havent remembered the instance yet but i know its there somewhere
i just have the sense that i survived something
all my therapists think so
she goes out the room in the hall
allison is shaking her head behind her back
oh god a kitchen
i hate kitchens cooking cleaning anything feminine
i mean its probably my mothers fault
while the applicant is going into another room allison is writing something on a pad she is holding in her left hand
underneath the pad is a polaroid camera certainly the one we saw the flashlight coming from
a nice clear room with a comfortable vintage looking couch
a young woman is standing in the middle of the room wearing a white blouse and brown large pants looking very discreet
i think this could work
and if you feel the same please give me a call
allison takes her picture with her polaroid camera
close up on the pile of application forms
on the top of the pile the one concerning the woman we just saw with her picture stapled in the left top corner of the form
allison is sitting on the couch looking through the files
she has the file of the last woman in her hand
she stands up and walks to the kitchen
allison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last applicant whose form is still in her hand
then she sees sams picture on the fridge door
she puts the form on the top of the fridge
close up of sams picture
allison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing again
hello sam rawson
allison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall
she sits down on the floor crying and still holding sams picture
she crumples the picture into a small tight ball
we see a pair of foot underneath a long light grey dress walking in the hall
allison is still crying
the woman knocks on the kitchen wall
allison stands up with a start
we get a full view of the unknown visitor
its hedra carlson
she is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair
she is carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest
she looks very sweet and nice
the front door was kind of open
are you allison jones
oh im hedra carlson
we spoke on the phone this morning
she looks at allisons face where we still can see shes been crying
are you sure youre okay
you know what
would it be all right if you came back tomorrow
hedra starts taking her arm and then moves away inside the kitchen
why dont you just
no im fine
ill make you some tea
i dont think i had lunch thats all
hedra tries to get some water at the sink but just gets a strange noise
its only this one
the one in the bathroom works
she comes to the sink and takes a wrench lying by the sink
i use a wrench
she squeezes the water faucet with the wrench
hedra puts her bag on the floor
allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her wrench but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls
hedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink
the girls are both all wet
im so sorry
close up on hedras dress and allisons jacket drying on hangers near the open window
hedra voice over if you need a reference you can call them at rizzoli
hedra gives some papers to allison seated on the sofa
hedra is wearing a red t shirt and black pants certainly borrowed from allison
allison looks at the papers
i got terrible nicknames growing up which im not telling you
like hedy lamarr
well i wasnt that exotic in grade school
as opposed to now right
while allison is reading the documents hedra gave her hedra feels the clothes hanging by the window
she picks them up gets them off the hangers and gives her jacket to allison here
sams crumpled picture falls on the floor from a fold in the jacket
hedra picks it up oh
you can just toss that
i was just cleaning up
hes the reason why im looking for a new room mate
she sits down on the sofa next to allison
do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things up
i do not want to move in and catch you being bound again and then have things change
it would just be awkward
well nothing going to change it except for
maybe that my faucets will work
when can you move in
she looks very moved by what allison just said
she takes allisons hand
allison and hedra are walking along a corridor in the basement
allison is wearing a black sleeveless t shirt and beige pants
hedra is wearing a red dress with white small dots
allison is carrying two suitcases and hedra a very large box
they all must be empty the way the girls are carrying them
ive got one friend
he lives just upstairs
oh not like that hes gay
so anyway its not a real friendly building but at least theres no problem with privacy
cause i mean you just close your door
ill leave you alone you know
i mean whatevers good for you
theyve come to a row of stocking rooms all protected by partition and doors covered with chicken wire
they look like cages and thats exactly what the tenants call them
the two girls drop their parcels on the floor
allison takes a key out of her pocket to open the padlock of her own private cage
hedra crosses the corridor
on the opposite side from the row of cages a door that says incinerator room and stuck on it a sign that says use prohibited by law
by this door a pile of junks probably left by a tenant
hedra picks up an old rusty metal lamp
hey look allie this could be good huh
a few moments later
allison has resumed her tour of the basement walking along the corridors
hedra is carrying the metal lamp she found
they pass by the laundry room where weve seen allison earlier chatting with graham
inside a lady is working with her laundry on a table
i dont go in there at night
its a bit creepy
its okay in the day but still lock yourself in
hedra looks at a key she is holding
no thats mail key
theyve come to the elevator
an old machinery enclosed in a chicken wire cage is working with a loud noise
allison presses the switch of the elevator this is creepy
oh its not bad its just kind of old
the elevator door slides into the wall and the two girls get in the cabin
allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin but it does not want to slide back into closed position
sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver
she takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin
with it she works on the door lock and succeeds in moving it
while she rolls the inner telescopic door shut she discovers that another tenant has come into the cabin behind their back
he doesnt look very friendly with his bow tie and his small mustache
he is holding a newspaper
when the inner door is completely shut the outer door slides automatically into shut position
the elevator is moving up
eleven the tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door
the tenant presses another button
hedra plays with her keys and smiles to allison
allison and hedra move a table out of the room
the table is covered with various objets and has apparently been used as a desk
when they try to squeeze the table through the door they upset everything that is on the table down on the floor
they scream and laugh
allison turns the water faucet on and it seems to be working perfectly
hedra is kneeling by the sink looking at the cupboard underneath the sink
she stands up with an oval metal dish
look what i found
hedra is kneeling on the floor cleaning the dish she has found in the kitchen
it shines so well that she can look at herself in it as if it was a mirror
close up on the dish
beside hedras face we see allisons face coming to join her
hedra just wearing her underwear is talking on the phone
im not sure
hold on ill check
sitting on the floor allison is painting the old lamp hedra has found in the basement
an electric fan is working next to her
hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver and whispers
allie its sam
allison shakes her head no
busy street with shops and people
allison and hedra are walking eating ice cream cones
allison is very elegantly dressed
hedra is more simply dressed and is still wearing her old black hat
where do you guys learn to dress like that
i mean its just so new york
i think you look very comfortable
yeah i never know what looks good
hedra comes out of a dressing room wearing a very elegant red jacket
i think that looks nice yes
but i found this
she gives her a red dress on a hanger which she was holding out of our view
i think youd look great with that
okay hedra takes the dress and looks at it
we see only allisons feet and legs
she is sitting on a chair trying on some high heel shoes
we see hedras feet coming toward her
she is also wearing high heel shoes
what do you think
i think you should take them
allison takes off the shoes she was trying on
oh god you like them
we now see both girls faces
hedra is taking off the shoes she was wearing
well i think they go great with that dress
you take them she gives her shoes to allison
ill just borrow them when i want to
a full view of allisons building in the new york night
actually its not full night yet because there is still some dark blue light in the sky
the room is all dark lit only by the street light coming from the window
allison walks into the room with a lampshade in her hand
she puts the lampshade on the lamp by the bed
then she switches the lamp on
apparently it is the lamp hedra found in the basement cleaned and painted
allison looks at the books on the night table
she then moves across the room puts her handbag on the bed and takes a medicine bottle from a small table
she puts it back and takes a perfume bottle
she takes the plug off and sniffs the bottle
with the plug she puts a bit of perfume on her neck
she puts the plug back on the bottle and the bottle back on the table
she then takes a pair of earring from the table
she holds them on her ears and looks at the effect in a mirror
in the mirror we see hedra entering the room behind allison
allison turns quickly around
hedra is wearing a light night robe and her hair is wet god
i didnt know you were home
lying on the bed there are a shoebox with a rubber band around it a key on a keyring and a piece of paper
apparently allison has not noticed them
quickly hedra throw the bath towel she is holding on those items for allison not to notice them
god im sorry
you havent even been here two weeks and im already in your room
ironically i was just about to go through your drawers
allison puts the earrings she was still holding back on the table
that smells nice on you
oh i hope you dont mind
i always wanted to try that
oh god no
anything you want
she takes her night robe off
allison seems embarrassed to see her naked
she turns her eyes away from her
share and share alike
i dont really know about that
im an only child
do you have
a big family
hedra puts her nightdress on
theres just me
she sits on her bed
well i was supposed to be a twin but she was stillborn
oh thats so sad
i grew up like a part of me was missing
she turns around sees the new lampshade
she stands up to have a better look at the lampshade
what do i owe you
she walks toward the little table
its just a little housewarming
its like that
hedra picks up the earrings from the table and gives them to allison oh no no
she puts the earrings on allisons ears
they look beautiful on you
but i cant take these
allison looks at herself in the mirror
thanks theyre great
the phone rings
she goes out of the room
while going out she bumps into hedra
allison picks up the phone
we only hear a few words of what he says
sam voice over on the phone talk to me
sam voice over on the phone why not
no its not a good time
hedra takes the shoebox from her bed goes to a closet inserted in the wall of the bedroom and puts the shoebox on the top shelf of the closet
allison voice over from the corridor im not ready to see you
youre just going on something thats over
allison is still on the phone
no theres nothing to talk about anyway
sam theres somebody here right now
we see hedras face peeking through the door of her bedroom
she puts the phone down
hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom door
why dont we order some chinese
allison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the telephone and then smiles and shakes her head yes
through the open door of the bathroom we see hedra kneeling by the bathtub and apparently washing something in the bathtub
the phone rings
hedra rushes out of the bathroom
she is wearing a orange t shirt a very large red boxer short and white slippers
hi this is allison jones

while listening to the machine hedra picks up a box on the telephone table takes a sweet out of the box eats it and puts the box back on the
table allie are you there
allie pick up
please please call me back
this is torture for me
i know you need me as much as i need you
i love you
ill do anything for you for us to get back together just call me
a click meaning the end of the call
hedra presses a button on the answering machine to erase sams message
we hear some yapping coming from the bathroom
hedra turns her head toward the bathroom
close up shot of hedra kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big puppy in her arms
she is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from the bath
oh yes youre a good clean boy
youre going to cheer her up are you
youre going to cheer her up
so shell let you stay
while rinsing the puppy she hugs and kisses it
she hears the front door opening and turns her head around
she says shhh
to the puppy and whispers some other incomprehensible words to it then puts it back in the bathtub
close up of a paper lying near the sink over hedras key ring
the paper is a bill from a shop called pet express in new york
it was paid in cash and the date is
it reads hedras hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste basket underneath the other items already in the basket
allison enters the apartment
she is wearing a silver colored raincoat
she closes the front door
through the open bathroom door we see hedra going from the waste basket to the bathtub
she takes a towel and wraps it around the puppy still in the tub
allison puts her keys on the shelf by the door puts her handbag on the floor and presses a button on the answering machine
a beep and then no messages
behind allison we see hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the puppy wrapped in the towel
allison turns around sees hedra with the puppy and stops in her tracks
she doesnt seem very happy almost angry in fact
i know i shouldnt have but they were just giving him away
in the market
but they said i could bring him back to morrow
well i hope they meant it
hedra sits down on the floor
his names buddy
i had a dog named buddy when i was little
she gives a kiss to the puppy
she then looks up at allisons face which doesnt seem very friendly
allison walks away taking off her raincoat
we hear the puppy yapping
hedra is sitting on her bed in the dark
she stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the door
close up at hedras peeking through the ajar opening of the door
the puppy is still yapping
the door of allisons bedroom opens and allison comes out
she is wearing a light pink nightdress
she slowly opens the kitchen door bends down and picks up the puppy
reverse angle shot of allison picking up the puppy
she then goes away presumably to her bedroom with the puppy in her arms
through the open kitchen door we see across the corridor hedras bedroom door closing itself
hedra wearing pajama looking pants and a sleeveless loose shirt comes in the room carrying a tray
there is a mug on the tray in which hedra is pouring honey from a plastic bottle
she comes to a table where allison is working on two computers
the puppy is sitting on allisons laps
hedra stirs the mug with a teaspoon and puts the tray on the table
youre working so hard
close up on the screens of the computers
they show women dresses designs
allison voice over myerson better refers some clients to me
hedra voice over he will youre the best
hedra and allison are lying on allisons bed with the puppy between them
hedra is wearing a pink t shirt and red short pants
the tv is on and we hear its sound faintly without really understanding the words
god hedy thanks
i never wouldve got it done without you
hedra is playing with a portable battery powered fan
she puts it down to play with the puppy
i love helping
she tries to move the puppy who wants to move the other way
allison takes her polaroid camera to take a shot of the three of them
allison takes the snapshot
later in the night
there is a black and white movie on the tv
i lived a few weeks while you loved me
the camera moves away from the tv and we see allison and hedra asleep on allisons bed with the puppy between them
hedra moves slightly in her sleep
allison and graham are walking on the sidewalk of the street graham pushing his bicycle
he has a canvas bag strapped over his shoulder
grahams first sentence is actually heard in voice over the previous sequence
ready to kill her yet
no no its a lot of fun having a girlfriend again
i can tell
i was worried for a while that you were so down
you were starting to look like a kennedy wife
they enter the lobby
we can see that allison is carrying some shopping bags
a lady is going out with a dog on a leash
you were great graham
i just had to spend some time with her
she needed a lot of help moving in
plus ive been working like crazy
i promised im not avoiding you
they enter the elevator
two ladies are coming out
allison has to use the screwdriver to close the inner door of the cabin
oh ive got you cornered now
ive been meaning to come down and see you
i was on my way to ask you something
the cabin is moving up

you were leaving the building
then i thought it was you
i chased her down
but it was someone else
someone very nervous
i really freaked her out about people knowing shes living in the building
i wouldve had you down to meet her
but shes shy
the elevator stops
the outer door opens
allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags
she opens the inner door and takes the keys graham is giving her
thatll be great
ill make dinner when i get back
allison closes the inner door
reverse angle shot of allison closing the elevator inner door
the outer door closes automatically
allison walks along the hall toward her apartment
the front door opens
allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags and enters the apartment
the front door closes behind her
she drops her keys on the little shelf by the door
she sees hedra in the doorway of the living room
her hair is in a bun
hey i thought youd be at work

hedra looks down at her belt
she seems embarrassed by something
listen i have to talk to you
you have to see these

theyre so great
can i just talk to you for a second
sam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms
i tried to let you know
sam puts the puppy on the floor
what are you doing here
but no dont blame hedy
its not her fault okay
hedra goes out of the hall into the living room
i kind of forced my way in here
i had to see you
hedra comes back in the hall
ive got to get out of here now
unless you need me
she looks back and forth to allison and sam and gets just a no head shake as an answer from allison
hedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her
why cant you just leave me alone
allison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen
youve got to talk to me baby
you just cant pretend i dont exist
allison puts her bags down on a table
easier that way okay
is that so hard to try to make it easier on me
but people screw up
people do something wrong
and i was wrong i admit it
and you just

a large room in a typical old new york apartment
large windows going almost to the ceiling
through the windows we see roofs with water tanks on them
the room is empty save for a ladder and a few tools
the real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand
sam and allison are coming towards him from the other side of the room
but this is half the size for twice the price from your apartment
its easier this way believe me
and this could be nice
they walk away toward the exit of the apartment
the agent remains standing on the same spot
can you imagine going from the victoria to this
a busy street in new york with small shops with goods for sale on counters on the sidewalk
sam and allison are walking down the street
do you think we can smoke her out
this is such a mess
i just cant do it right now

one of them points his finger to the upper stories of the building
allison and sam are running toward allisons apartment door
allison opens it
allison rushes into the apartment followed by sam
allison yelling hedy
she runs past the kitchen door
we see hedra sitting at the kitchen table
she stands up when she sees allison
allison stops in front of the window
the window is open and the broken piece of wrought iron on which sam was working earlier in the morning is missing leaving a gap in the balustrade a gap
wide enough for a puppy dog to go through
allison screaming and crying hes dead
sam climbs on the balcony
close up on the gap in the balustrade
hedra seems genuinely surprised
she still has the earphones of her walkman around her neck
allison crying you left the window open
how could you do that

i know you fixed it this morning
sam is still on the balcony looking at the balustrade
i thought i did

allison rushes out the room
sam voice over allie
sam runs out of the room after allison
hedra walks to the balcony and slowly slides the window down
allison is lying in her bed with the sheet up to her neck
sam bends over her and gives her a light tender kiss on the lips
then he stands up
we hear him leaving the room and closing the door
allison turns her head with her eyes still closes
hedra is sitting on the floor in the dark leaning on the wall
she is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her
hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy we understand she is putting the puppys stuff away
sam comes out of allisons room and walking in the hall in front of the kitchen open door stops and looks at her
thanks that pill helped

we can hear repressed tears in her voice
then she starts crying for real

sam kneels down
sam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying
he slowly stands up still holding her in his arms
he leads her to her room
outside hedras room
sam is in the doorway
hedra moves slightly away from him and then hugs him even stronger
gently he pushes her away from him
they almost kiss on the mouth but sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her room where she stays
he closes the door behind him and she holds his hand on the doorknob
then she moves her hand away and the door closes
we hear her sobbing behind the closed door
allison is asleep on her bed dressed with a short black slip and black panty hoses
the phone rings
allison wakes up slowly and with her eyes still closed feels around on the night table to find the phone
she eventually picks it up
she raises her head
she looks at the clock
no im just
im just running a little late
she picks up the pill bottle on the night table and looks at it
i didnt forget
just hold them till five okay
she puts the phone down
she gets up and goes into the dressing room
she starts looking for a dress
she rapidly goes out
through the open door of the bathroom we see allison looking for a dress
she then goes out of the bathroom crosses the hall and open a closet in which more clothes are hanging
she picks up three hangers with clothes on them
she enters her bedroom carrying the hangers
she throws one of them on the bed and goes with the two other ones back into the dressing room
she picks up a hanger with a light brown jacket and compares it with the one on the hanger she brought from the closet in the hall
they are exactly the same
then she picks up a red dress and compares it with the one she brought from the closet in the hall
theyre both the same
she looks a bit worried by what she just discovered
close up on an apple computer screen showing dress models
the file is called fontana fashions

he puts the glass on the top of his head something simple
he gives the glass to allison who takes it
she walks to a table with an apple computer on it puts her glass on the table and sits down
mitchell comes behind her drinking his glass which he then puts on the table
he bends down behind allison who starts typing on the keyboard
you know this is just the mickey mouse stuff but it does come in handy
close up on the computer screen
the fontana fashions file is on
we see the outline of a model then a small window appears on the model
it says are you sure you want to quit
and below two choices cancel or ok
allison chooses ok
fontana fashions file disappears replaced by another window that says search by vendor and in the bottom of the window enter vendor name with an empty box underneath
mitchell voice over huh huh

mitchells head is just behind hers
enter the vendors name
he bends over allison to type on the keyboard encircling her with his right arm

not till i give her the word
allison turns to him and seems not to like his strange smile
well i hope youre satisfied with what ive done
he walks away from her and goes to the champagne table
but this is it
i mean there aint much more
just maybe a little fine tuning thats it
i have some free time now if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues
using a napkin he is drying a bottle of champagne he just got out of its bucket
i was thinking that maybe i want to keep you all to myself
he throws the napkin on the floor and comes back toward allison with the bottle of champagne
he puts the bottom of the bottle on allisons bare shoulders
what are you doing
he puts his other hand on her shoulder
then he puts the bottle on the table and starts massaging her shoulders
thats just that youre so tight
mitch please dont
he grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms
he kisses her neck
ive been a good boy havent i
and youve been a good girl
we have nothing to prove any more
he keeps on kissing her neck and puts his hand inside her dress to reach her breast
allison seems to be on the verge of tears
this is your last chance to play before youre an old married lady
let me turn around okay
she has a strange smile on her lips
he stands up
just a second
while she slowly turns around on her swivel seat he starts unzipping his pants and lets them fall on his ankles showing his white trunks
allison still seated is now facing him her face at the level of his crotch
he takes her head to guide it toward his private parts
allison looks up at him and then with both fists and all her might she hits him very hard between his legs
she jumps from her seat and runs out of the room
he falls on the floor holding his private parts with both hands
close up on allison still in her black dress and holding a glass of wine
hedra voice over here
we see hedras hand giving some pills to allison
she then replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water
i cant believe i didnt see it coming
its just so humiliating
hedra voice over youre too nice thats the problem
men are pigs
i dont care how nice they seem
you always fall for that
but what i did
it was like something inside taking over
it was scary
we see hedra standing near the mantlepiece
she is wearing an orange t shirt and a red skirt
no allie dont turn this around
youre the victim
he should pay for this
she kneels on the floor in front of allison
i set up all my programs so they have to eventually
im not talking about getting paid im talking about getting even
you dont understand
its the contacts more than the money
when i just took the job for the word of mouth and now thats gone
its just like hes put me back to square one
only if you let him
but you wont let him will you
what can i do
she opens allisons purse and takes her address book
of course sams away
i didnt want to say anything
how he could go on that trip the day after buddy died
she walks to the telephone table in the hall flipping the pages of the address book
especially when it was his fault
since the bedroom door is wide open we can see hedra in the hall
she picks up the phone and starts dialing
may i speak with your husband please
who are you calling
she gets up from the sofa on which she was sitting
yes i know its late

high angle shot of the building taken from the roof of the building across the street

she takes allison by the hand and drags her to the door of the shop
allison tries to resist hedra
itll be fine come on
they enter the shop
allison is seated in front of a large mirror
an attendant is taking the protection garment off her shoulders
she seems happy and puts her hands through her hair
suddenly she stops and the smile disappears from her mouth
she looks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the upper level of the shop
she makes the swivel chair turn around to have a better look at the staircase
close up on hedra going down the stair
her hairdo is so much like allisons one that she almost looks like a twin sister of allison
back to allisons thunderstruck face
youve got to be kidding
allison and hedra are walking in a busy street
if hedra was not a bit shorter than allison one could think they were twins
allison seems angry
you just shouldve asked first
well i wanted it to be a surprise
they stop at a newspaper stand
can i have the consumer market please
the attendant picks up a magazine from a rack and allison picks up some other magazines at random
this feels so good on my neck
i didnt think youd mind
allison is paying the attendant
hedra seems to be worried by allisons very cold reaction to her surprise
she seems even a bit sad
allison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet
hedra voice over im going to take a shower
allison walks out of her room into the hall
through the open door of the bathroom we see hedra turing the water faucet on in the shower cubicle then taking her belt off
she closes the door of the bathroom
allison stealthily runs into hedras bedroom
allison enters the room and looks around
she walks to the closet and starts looking through hedras clothes
suddenly she notices the shoebox on the shelf above the clothes
close up on the shoebox and then on allisons hand picking it up
allison opens the shoebox
she sits down on the bed and starts looking through the content of the box
she takes several papers out of the box and looks more closely at them
close up on the documents allison is looking through
several photographs and then a black and white photograph of two twin girls with a puppy between them
the twin girls are the one we saw at the very beginning of the film
allison looks very attentively at the picture
she puts the documents she is holding into the lid of the box and starts looking at the rest of the documents

allison is reading the letter which was with the keys
close up shot on the letter
it was written on a hotel atherton stationery

suddenly she hears some noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the noise
the bathroom door is opening slowly allison puts the letter back in the envelope the envelope back into the box
she then puts everything back into the box closes the box and puts it back on the shelf
allison comes out of her bedroom picks up her handbag and starts unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door while through the open bathroom door we see

getting no answer she knocks on the door
getting no answer again she walks away from the door
allison is going down the stairs
she opens a service door and hidden by this door watches hedra waiting for the elevator
allison rushes back to the staircase
high angle shot of the whole staircase with allison running down
this is the street outside allisons building probably seen from the entrance of the building or very near it
hedra coming from behind the camera crosses the sidewalk towards the street
she raises her hand to stop a taxi cab
allison also coming from behind the camera hides behind the corner of a wall to watch hedra
a yellow cab stops and hedra climbs in it
as soon as the cab is gone allison rushes from her hiding spot and runs to the street with her hand raised
we are inside allisons cab
in front of us through the windshield we see the back of hedras cab driving in the heavy traffic of new york
allison voice over dont lose her
reverse angle shot on allison seated in the back of the cab
allison bends slightly to speak to the driver
its very important
she has something of mine
compared to allisons neighborhood this is a very quiet district
almost no one in the streets
hedras cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a fire escape
hedra walks out just as allisons cab stops at the corner of the street
allison walks out of her cab
both cabs drive away and allison starts following hedra from a distance
medium shot of allison following hedra
hedra reaches her destination another grim building and goes down a stairway starting from the street and going down to the basement of the building
a strong man with a ponytail and glasses is guarding the entrance
but he lets allison go down the steps
other people follow allison
allison goes down the last steps to the basement which actually is a sort of night club
we hear some religious sounding music with drum rhythms
the place is quite dark but flashes of light enable us to see that all the customers are very smartly dressed men wearing elegant suits and neckties and women wearing
they seem to be watching some sort of a show
a young woman wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black leather gloves notices allison and comes towards her
do you want to play
allison walks away followed by the young woman
she passes near a cage inside which we see a middle aged man
the man gets his hand through the bars of the cage and strokes allisons cheek
allison jumps rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage
behind allisons back we see the young woman who was following her coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside
from where she is allison can see whats going on at the bar without actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along the bar
reverse angle shot on the bar itself and more precisely on hedra seated on a stool with a man seated on another stool stroking her cheek
come on jim
the bartender a bald bare chested young man turns toward hedra
hearing her name allison starts and looks at the bartender the bartender voice over hey allie
regular or diet
hedra turns towards the bartender
a flash of light enable us to have a better view of hedras companion the man she called jim
he looks a bit like sam
allison is staring at the couple hedra voice over yeah you look like my sisters boyfriend
we hear the first sentence said by graham in voice over the previous sequence
jesus allie what is it
graham is opening his front door to allie who enters the apartment but stays near the open front door
god youve got to help me graham
youve got to tell me what to do
hedra opens the front door and enters the apartment
she closes the door and locks it
she drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the hall
the camera moves into the living room
through the open door to the kitchen we see hedra crossing the kitchen to go into the living room
she seems slightly drunk and doesnt control her movements very well
before entering the living room she takes a blue bag in the kitchen maybe something to eat and drops it on a table
but being a bit nervous she actually drops the bag on a small bowl containing various objects and the bowl falls on the floor and breaks into pieces
hedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the debris
the bowl has fallen near the air vent
it is exactly the same as the one which earlier in the film had enabled graham to hear sam and allisons conversation
hedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl
we hear a faint voice
hedra raises her head trying to find out where this faint voice comes from
first we dont understand the words the faint voice is saying then it becomes clearer
its allisons voice speaking to graham in his apartment
allison voice over from the air vent its like looking at myself
and she lies
i found a shoebox in her room
hedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent and she moves closer to it
allison voice over from the air vent nothing she told me is true
the twin that she said died at birth
it was in an accident when she was nine
hedra moves a brass knob on the air vent to open it wider and to have a better understanding of the words
graham and allison are sitting on a couch
graham has a glass in his hand and allison a cup
and she stole a letter that sam wrote me
i have to do something
graham gets up from the couch
get rid of her
hedra is still kneeling on the floor with her ear close to the air vent listening to the conversation between allison and graham
graham voice over from the air vent call the police if you have to
if she steals thing you have to get her out of the place
we hear steps
hedra looks up at the ceiling and then slowly stands up
graham is pouring something we dont see in a glass
ill tell her tonight
allison gets up from the couch with her cup in her hand
i cant just throw her out on the street
i mean she obviously needs help
she is a lunatic allie
shes got to go
do it tonight
close up on the front door
the door slowly opens and a hand covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door
we hear the conversation going on between graham and allison
allison voice over its just that i feel responsible for her somehow
im the only one she has
someone like her parent
back to graham and allison
allie either shes gone by saturday or i go to the police okay
that was very impressive
i can be butch when i have to
i got it from my mother
the room is very dark and only lit by the street lights through the window
a shadow moving in the dark
we hear the conversation coming from the living room
graham voice over look if you worry about her ive got a friend whos a shrink
maybe he can help her
the shadow moves away from the dark corner where she was hiding it is hedra who starts walking cautiously in the room
allison voice over oh god
maybe after i talk to her she just leaves
graham voice over do you want to sleep here tonight
allison voice over oh dont tempt me
no i just needed to talk it out
allison and graham are both standing in the middle of the room
she walks to a table to pick up her purse
sensing that allison is going to leave hedra walks back into a dark corner to hide herself
allison voice over shes not going to chase me out of my own place
graham voice over whens sam coming back
graham is carrying his cat in his arms
allison picks up her purse and they start walking towards the front door
they walk along the corridor graham still with his cat in his arms
oh this is a little embarrassing but since were letting our hair down
those old air vents between our apartments carry sound
its a weird acoustic thing
theyve stopped walking
what do you hear
he does not answer but he makes a face and then laughs which is a good answer to allisons question
she puts her head down in her hand feeling a bit embarrassed
i am sorry
i shouldve mentioned it sooner
im so sorry
youre sure you want to go down there
shes my problem
ill handle it
she starts walking again towards the front door
graham follows her
allison opens the door
thank you for the tea
ill see you tomorrow
allison goes out and graham closes the door behind her and then locks it
high angle shot of the staircase
allison is walking down the stairs
the apartment is all dark
the front door opens and allison walks in and closes the door behind her
she puts her keys on the shelf by the door
she walks around the hall looking in all the rooms
we hear a little noise and we see allison turning her head
close up on a mirror covered door opening slowly
at that very moment we the spectators do think we are still in allisons apartment
but actually we are in the door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise
we hear grahams voice talking on the telephone in the next room
graham voice over this is serious its a lot more serious than i thought
no i know you cant diagnose over the phone
the camera moves away from the door then looks into the living room where graham is sitting in the dark only lit by the street lights coming through the window
and talking in the telephone
i dont know
i dont even know what hyper vigilant is
no ive never met the woman
she could be infantile or paranoid whatever
i dont know
close up on the air vent
we see allisons hands sticking pieces of large adhesive tape on the air vent
we hear the faint voice of graham still talking on the telephone but we dont understand the words
larger shot of allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces of tape on the air vent
graham is still talking on the phone
i tell you what let me go downstairs
if i call you from there will you talk to my friend
she can tell you better than i can
we hear some noise in the background and graham turns his head towards the noise
quick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living room door
it looks empty and quiet
back to graham on the phone
so all right
so so you might hear from us
love to jack
and youre not charging me for this
he puts the telephone down on his set on the table turns his head again in the direction where he heard the strange noise and gets up
he thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle voice
he gets out of the room into the corridor
graham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat
he suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him
he turns his head
we see hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front door
since we see only the back of her head she can easily be mistaken for allison
she doesnt turn her head and just wave her hand
she has almost reached the front door when graham realizes that something is queer about the girls attitude
she turns around
she seems very panicky suddenly
she starts fumbling with the locks of the door and drops the safety bar on the floor
hey wait its okay
take it easy
we just want to get you some help
hedra is kneeling down fumbling with the fallen safety bar
i didnt do anything wrong
graham is walking slowly towards her
okay take it easy
im sorry i didnt do anything
hedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both hands
she strikes graham first in the stomach then as he doubles up with pain she strikes him again on the shoulder
graham falls on the floor and she gives him a final blow on the head leaving him unconscious on the floor
allison is standing by the desk talking on the telephone and holding the telephone set with her other hand
we hear a beep
besch you dont know me my name is allison jones
i think my room mate hedra is your daughter
im not sure really
shes been under a lot of stress lately
i really really would not get into this on the answering machine
could you please give me a call
im sure you have the phone number
the front door opens and hedra comes in
allison voice over still talking on the telephone ill really appreciate ill really
dont say i called
allison still on the phone turns her head towards the front hall
oh thank you
she puts the phone down
hedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall allison voice over hedy
hedra enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her
allison is standing near the window apparently not knowing exactly what to do next
hedra is sitting naked under the shower
she is playing with a jewel ring and humming softly some musical tune
we hear several knocks on the door
hedra doesnt react at all
allison voice over hedy
hedra answers without moving her head
apparently hedra has not spoken loud enough above the noise of the shower because allison knocks again on the door
allison voice over hedy are you all right
i cant hear you
she has spoken with a very soft voice and apparently allison hasnt heard her because she opens the door and walks slowly towards the shower its okay its just i
was starting to worry
youve been in here so long
im making some tea
do you want some tea
hedra turns slowly her head towards allison and smiles
thatd be great
she turns the shower off and stands up
she picks up a towel
allison turns her head apparently feeling embarrassed to see her naked
close up on the basin full of water and where hedras clothes are soaking
the water is red with what looks like blood
hedra voice over im not feeling really well
hedra wrapped in a large bath towel has noticed that allison has been looking at the blood in the basin
mine always comes when im wearing something nice
she walks slowly across the bathroom
when she passes near the basin she notices that a small part of her clothes are not inside the basin and she moves it back inside
still wrapped into the bath towel hedra walks slowly out of the bathroom followed by allison
are you crampy
sometimes tea helps
we could talk
hedra has reached her rooms door and she turns around
hedra walks into her room followed by allison
about sam and i wanting this place for ourselves
hedra has not switched the light on in the room
the room is just lit by the street light coming through the window
its just crazy keeping two places like this
hedra sits on the bed
she is wearing a night shirt and a large sweater over the night shirt
note this could be considered as a continuity goof
apparently hedra has been able to change from the bath towel to the night shirt and sweater in less than a second
i thought you wanted a long engagement so you could make sure you can trust him again
well frankly i think thats my business
im sorry but it is
hedra cracks her knuckles
its me isnt it
ill change allie
i can change
no thats not it at all
youve been a good room mate
this is the man im going to marry
i want us to start our lives together
he will cheat on you again thats a promise
and when he does dont come running to me okay
ive had it with you
youre so fucking weak
suddenly she has a very menacing face
allison still standing up looks down at her with a very hard stare
hedra seeing that stare calms down and laughs
im so sorry
the phone rings but allison who is still looking down at hedra with her very hard stare doesnt move
hedra turns her head in the direction of the phone
hedra now has a very sweet look on her face
she gets up and out of the room
hedra picks up the phone from the little table in the hall
allison enters the room from hedras bedroom
is it sam
we hear a male voice over the phone
we quickly understand its hedras father
hedras father voice over on the telephone ellen is that you
talk to me or your mother
honey we miss you
we want you to come home
hedra with a deep menacing voice dont call here again
hedras father voice over on the telephone ellen listen
well stop sending the cheques if you dont come
i promise no doctors this time
hedra puts the telephone down
she doesnt move for a couple of seconds then looks at allison trying to look more casual than she actually is
she has a little nervous laugh
obscene phone call
the phone rings again
hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on the table
then she presses on a button on the telephone set to cut off the communication
find someone else jerk
allison walks to the telephone table
im expecting a call from sam
he might be coming in tonight
just for a little while okay
sam will call back if its busy
hedra hugs allison
im sorry allie
she moves away from allison looking falsely casual
its no big deal
ill find some other place
you know i just
i dont want you making a mistake
hey well still be friends
well keep in touch
allison walks away to her room
hedra picks up the telephone set from the little table without putting the receiver back on its hook
we hear several short beeps coming from the telephone
with one nervous movement hedra tears the cord off the wall socket
then she walks slowly into her room
a little later
hedra is lying in her bed writing something in a notebook
she is humming a song
her other hand is resting on the telephone set on the bed
the phone rings
hedra picks it up immediately not to let it ring more than once
hedra whispering hello
sam voice over on the phone allie
no its hedy
sam is lying on the bed still dressed in his suit and necktie
he is talking on the telephone
hedra voice over on the phone where are you
where are you
i just got in from the airport
is she asleep
hedra voice over on the phone yeah
hedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table
its after two
do you want me to wake her
sam voice over on the phone no tell her to surprise me
hedra voice over on the phone okay
hedra voice over on the phone okay ill tell her
she slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it
close up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels shoes
the heels clicks on the sidewalk and we see the figure of a woman walking away from us and towards the entrance of the hotel
no one else is in the streets at this time of the night
the woman is wearing a grey raincoat
the woman enters the hotel
sam is sleeping covered by the sheet up to his waist and apparently naked underneath
the door opens slowly
the woman in the grey raincoat enters the room
we have already guessed she is hedra
she closes the door and puts the key on the night table
she remains motionless for a couple of seconds looking at sam then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off
she is completely naked under the raincoat
she slides under the sheet of the bed close to sam
sam moans in his sleep
he turns slowly towards hedra who starts kissing him on the chest
sam sleepy voice allie allie
what are you doing
hedra goes down sams body still kissing him
when she gets between his legs even if the room is very dark we understand she is performing oral sex on him
sam moans with pleasure
suddenly sam realizes that something may be wrong
he gives an anxious look at hedra
hedra raises her head from sams private parts
no not allie
she resumes what she was doing
sam would like to push her away but he is so close to his climax that he cant do it
he has his orgasm with hedra not moving away from between his legs
she only raises her head when she is sure it is over
she gives him a light kiss on the pubis and smiles
then she moves up in the bed her head finally resting near sams one
sam is breathing very hard
hedra strokes him on the chest and kisses his cheek
then she gets up and off the bed and puts her raincoat back on
she picks up a half full glass on a table and drinks from it what looks like beer
then she eats something from a plate on the same table
sam breathes normally again and moves slowly on the bed
he lies on his side facing away from hedra
with the glass still in her hand she walks to the bed hey sleepy guy
she puts the glass on the night table and kneels on the bed
she start stroking sams shoulder
i knew it
i told her
guys like you dont change
you cant be faithful
and now shell know
while talking she keeps on stroking his face
sam doesnt react to her caress
shell know what
he switches on the light on the night table
he then turn around to face her
that you came up here and pretended to be her
my god what is this hair
what is this supposed to mean
youre in her clothes
youre wearing her perfume
for christ sake
he jumps out of the bed and starts putting his clothes on
hedra remains seated on the bed drinking her glass
you knew it was me
you knew and you didnt care
well i think she should know that
you think shes going to thank you for that news do you
well i dont expect you to understand her friendship
she puts her glass on the night table and gathers her shoes to put them back on her feet
she cant stand you for christ sake
thats not true
she shakes her head no
youre too needy
youre always cleaning
youre constantly in her face
she needs me
who was there for her when her boss almost raped her
could you care of her
you were off on a business trip or screwing someone
she never said a word to me about that
after his pants sam has put his shirt back on
hedra gets up from the bed where she was still sitting
thats right she told me
she sits back on the bed
dont try and make me think that were not close
we lean on each other and we
we protect each other
were best friends
youre nuts you know that
i think youre out of your skull thats right
yeah well sticks and stones
he comes near the bed and bends down to pick up something
hedra rushes on him
he pushes her away from him
dont touch me
she sits back on the bed
look i know you want to save face
i wont tell her okay
just pick up the phone and call her and tell her youre going back to your ex wife or something
and i wont say a word okay
well you wont have to say a word sweetheart because im going to tell her myself
he walks to the night table and picks up the telephone
she throws one of her shoes towards him
the shoe hits the wall just above his head
hedra yelling no
he rushes towards her ready to hit her
but before he reaches her she strikes him very hard in the face with her other shoe
the stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left eye and behind the eye certainly enters his skull and his brain because instantly after the blow sam falls heavily on
his back on the floor where he remains motionless and unconscious
with her bare foot hedra touches his cheek
hedra softly hey
close up on hedras feet walking on the rug
shes wearing both of her stiletto heels shoes
hedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk
the same hotel clerk that we saw earlier in the film when sam and allison came together into the hotel is talking on the phone
he is talking in a soft voice so we cant understand exactly what hes saying
but when hedra walks in front of his desk he puts his hand on the receiver microphone and says in a louder voice goodnight miss jones
without turning her head hedra waves her hand
close up on the clock on the night table it says
allison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment
allison comes out of her bedroom wearing a long sleeveless pink night shirt
she seems to be naked underneath
she walks around the room looking in every room which door is open
she eventually finds her in the living room vigorously cleaning the mantlepiece
hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red rubber gloves
allison remains at the door of the room
hedra looks up at allison but doesnt stop her cleaning
i hope i didnt wake you
i got an early start
no hedy i didnt mean for you to move out today
hedra looks around the room
oh there i think thats it
she goes out of the room into the hall
i hope you dont mind
im storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs
she resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall starting with the small shelf by the front door
that way i wont have to bother
you see what i mean
allison has come near hedra
sure thats fine
look im really sorry it didnt work out
hedra has stacked her stuff near the front door
she picks them up a red suitcase a cardboard box and a large paper bag
she has taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand
well id better get this stuff out of here
allison walks to the door
she opens the door
we can have breakfast when you get back
hedra walks out of the apartment
allison closes the door but remains behind it lost in her thoughts
hedra is rapidly walking along a corridor carrying her stuff
close up on the open red suitcase
inside all the clothes that makes hedra look like allison
hedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the open incinerator
then she sprays some lighter fluid over the clothes
close up on hedras hands striking a match on the side of a matchbox
she throws the match into the incinerator and long flames immediately start on the clothes
allison is fixing breakfast
she has cut some fruits into small pieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender
we hear some music from the tv in the background
allison walks to a cupboard on the wall to pick up a spices jar
the door leading to the living room is open and the tv is on
allison gives a quick look at the tv on her way back from the cupboard to the kitchen working bench
allison puts a bit of spices from the jar into the blender closes the lid and starts the blender
male tv reporter voice over from the tv set and now morning news break
the rest of the words of the tv reporter are lost covered by the noise from the blender
but the voice of a female reporter being slightly louder can be heard over the blender noise female tv reporter voice over from the tv set police found the body
of a man brutally murdered early this morning
allison shuts the blender off and walks to the open door to watch close up on the tv screen showing the reporter standing with her microphone in hand near the
entrance of the atherton hotel
female tv reporter voice over from the tv set identification of the victim a white male of around years of age is pending notification of next of kin
reverse angle shot of allison standing in the doorway and peeling a banana
female tv reporter voice over from the tv set a witness i spoke to just right here said
reverse angle shot on the tv
female tv reporter voice over from the tv set he heard the sound of a struggle emanating from room
reverse angle shot on allison
female tv reporter voice over from the tv set around four oclock this morning
allison suddenly realizes that the room number is sams one
she rushes to the telephone set on the wall near the refrigerator
allison dials very nervously a number on the phone
hotel clerk voice over from the phone atherton hotel
sam rawsons room please room
hotel clerk voice over on the phone im sorry theres been an accident
i think you should speak to the police
she doesnt even wait for the end of the sentence and drops the phone letting the receiver hang on its cord
she rushes out of the kitchen
hedra is leaving the room carrying her stuff
behind her the incinerator door is wide open and we see a bright fire inside
across the corridor from the incinerator room hedra reaches allisons private cage
she drops her stuff and opens the padlock
allison is bending over the toilet bowl and vomiting
in the cage hedra takes a boot out of the cardboard box
then she takes a sock out of the boot and delicately takes a black hand gun out of the boot
she puts the gun in the paper back above some clothes
allison is still vomiting in the toilet bowl
she slowly raises her head from the toilet bowl trying to catch her breath
she sees hedras pair of stiletto heel shoes
underneath one of the heels there are some traces of blood on the tile floor of the bathroom
kneeling on the floor allison takes the shoe to look at it more closely
then she screams and throws it away knocking the other shoe down on the floor
she is still kneeling on the floor crying when the door opens and hedra enters the room
allison raises her head to look at hedra
hedra sees the stiletto heel shoe behind the toilet bowl where it has been knocked away
what are you doing down there
allison remains kneeling on the floor just supporting herself on her arms
i just suddenly felt sick
it was the funniest thing
i hope im not pregnant
hedra walks towards allison to help her stand up
let me help you
allison stands up
oh thats all right im fine
ill get some water
hedra walks to the basin but wraps her hand in the bottom of her dress before touching the water tap
allison walks out of the room
allison stops at the door and turns around toward hedra
close up on the mirror above the basin showing hedra and allison standing next to each other
allison takes the tooth glass and drinks
hedra strokes her shoulder
allison puts the glass down and shakes her head yes
hedra strokes the back of her head
i can go out for a while
i feel much better now
allison walks out of the bathroom followed by hedra
i thought you said breakfast
allison has reached the front door and she starts unlocking the door
oh its in the blender
ive got to go out
hedra looks at allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles
dressed like that
im just going to go upstairs and see graham
he called while you were out
hedra looks at allison with a very strange expression on her face
she can see the tears on allisons face
well still if youre not feeling well you should wear more than that
maybe youre right
she walks away to her room
hedra puts her hand on her face
allison enters her room coming from the hall
hedra voice over from the hall leave the door open so we can talk
allison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on
hedra enters slowly in the room carrying the large paper bag where she has put the gun
allison takes her night shirt off
she is now naked from the waist up
but she grabs a sweater and puts it on
you know why i think youre sick
while talking hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down on the floor
youre upset about sam
slowly hedra puts the black gloves on her hands
you know sams dead dont you
allison turns around to face hedra
yeah we dont have much time
she picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers
she puts the bag on the floor and opens the top drawer
allison crying you didnt
you didnt do it hedy did you
hedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer allison crying you couldnt have him
she falls down sitting on the floor and crying
allie he came in my mouth
then he tried to beat the shit out of me because i wanted to tell you
she slams the drawer shut and opens another one
you know it was an accident
but he deserved it
she claps her hands
okay come on
the police will be here soon
allison doesnt move and remains seated on the floor
but you shouldnt run
thatll only make it worse
i know you werent yourself when you did this hedy
i was you
she points her gloved finger to allison and then looks at herself in the mirror
who is this hedy anyway
she turns around and walks away from the mirror towards allison
no ones seen her
shes not on the lease
theres not even a fingerprint of hers here
ive been cleaning like crazy
you have to come with me allie or theyd put you away
hedy itll never work
people have seen you
we just cant tell
well go to a lawyer or a doctor and theyll explain it to the police or something
hedra who is now very upset knocks everything that was on top of the chest of drawer with a long sweeping movement down on the floor
she bends down and takes the gun out of the paper bag
why are you making me do this
she snaps a cartridge into the chamber of the gun
were friends allie
you could be in a lot of trouble without me
but im not going to leave you
she walks to allison and kneels on the floor besides her pointing the gun to her head that wouldnt be right
i wont leave you
okay lets go
she slaps her face
hedra leads allison along the hall
she is carrying her paper bag in one hand and the gun in the other hand
she still has her gloves on
allison is carrying a small plastic case
go go go
they reach the elevator and allison is ready to press the call button but hedra moves her away towards the staircase
no no up to grahams
no no hes already involved
they climb the stairs
hedra is pushing allison with her gun
they reach grahams front door
allison rings the bell waits a couple of seconds and turns around
hedra takes some keys out of her bag and gives them to allison with the gloved hand that is still holding the gun
come on come on hurry up
allison takes the keys and unlocks the door
he must be sleeping
we were up late last night
hedra seems very nervous
while allison is unlocking the door she keeps looking around her and pressing allisons back with her gun
allison opens the door and enters the apartment followed by hedra
he cant hear you
hedra closes the door behind them
low angle shot of the building taken from street level
hedra voice over wait till you see me
hedra comes out of the bathroom with a dark towel on her head
the cat crosses the corridor and enters the bathroom
hedra puts her towel down her hair instead of being red like allisons is now dark brown
your color was beautiful but i cant go around looking like you any more can i
hedra enters the living room
okay now allie dont laugh
she walks in front of the window and makes a couple of dance steps
reverse angle shot on allison tied up in an armchair with duct tape
each one of allisons arms is tied on each armrest of the armchair
her legs are tied on the legs of the armchair and her chest is tied on the back of the armchair

she grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps allisons face in it
she pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the wall all the way to the emergency staircase door in order to prevent it from being opened by anyone
coming from the staircase
then she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed
we supposed it is the emergency switch of the elevator and that she also wants to prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the elevator
