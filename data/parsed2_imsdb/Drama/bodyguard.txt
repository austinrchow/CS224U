written by lawrence kasdan clean shooting draft february in the darkness we hear dripping water the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps
there is the sound of a sudden quick scuffle a heavy fall of bodies
three booming gunshots
two from one gun one from another
so fast and close theyre barely distinguish able
the sound of the shots echoes against concrete walls and dies away
mid to late s peers intently over a smoking gun
he is the bodyguard
dead on his feet leans against a car
a gun drops heavily from his hand
his life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car door to his knees then falls forward face down on the cement floor
a slow pull back reveals that frank is lying on top of klingman
protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor of the garage
klingman a handsome year old arbitrageur gasps in barely controlled fear as his armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil
there is no movement
the two men are lying near the right front fender of a black limousine
blood spreads from the body of the hit man a few yards away
klingman starts to raise himself up but farmer keeps him pressed to the floor still alert for any further threat
a beat and voices are heard o
farmer wheels snub nosed
aimed at them
a uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks
farmer lowers his weapon and speaks
calm but an order call
camera has craned up to a high almost frozen wide shot of the scene
it tracks away into darkness
passing traffic reveals the storefront of a tv showroom
inside behind the reflections of the city lights all the tv sets are showing the same picture the glittering image of a woman singing
we will recognize the woman as rachel marron
we cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines
through the city noise comes the sound of her song i have nothing
a battered old desk
scattered across the top a pile of blank white paper a jar of glue a stack of magazines a pair of scissors a tv remote control softly in the b
a tv is playing the same image we saw in the store window the same song
they open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves
carefully they put the gloves on
the snapping of the rubber is the only sound
the hands pick a magazine off the stack screen stars
they put the magazine down and pick up the scissors
a headline on the cover reads rachel marrons greatest triumph
the scissors start to cut
meticulously they excise the name rachel marron from the page
with the care of a surgeon
a tumultuous crash of screaming pushing bodies
arms stretch out cameras flash sunguns flare microphones are thrust forward
a deafening cacophony of rachel
this way rachel
we cannot see the object of this frenzy
we catch a brief glimpse of an attractive well dressed young woman nicki exiting with the other celebrities as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the mass of
surging fans and media
her face is calm and impassive as she watches from the sidelines
in a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint ings that reflect klingmans success as an arbitrageur he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with farmer
your hands ever shake frank
its just adrenaline
how did you know
i saw him washing the car
i saw him
they dont wash cars on the parking levels
he hands a glass of brandy to frank who looks at it
you know id like you to stay on
he passes a small sealed envelope to frank
im not good in permanent positions my feet go to sleep
the two men smile at each other
they raise their glasses in a joint salutation klingman drinks
the rubber gloved hands are glueing the word time onto a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom note
each word has been cut from a different page and is in a different typeface
the note is being assembled with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance and is quite easy to read
it reads a blur of hands and faces
pieces of paper autograph books notes are thrust forward into the camera
again a mass chanting rachel
hands of rachels entourage accept some of the proffered items
in closeup we see rachels hands signing best wishes
rachel marron on an out stretched open palm
in the midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper a be ribboned black doll is thrust forward bearing the legend slam of a car door
frank gets out of a cab with two suitcases
his house is a modest stucco affair on a small lot
he goes up the walk and puts down his suit cases
he looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass
supermarket circulars cover his doorstep
he picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket
a curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain
as the door opens we are aware of a further pile of mail inside
franks feet push the letters aside and go inside
the door shuts
farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook
a bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it
at the stove he stirs and flavors a boeuf bourgignon and reads a time magazine
he adds a splash of wine
he lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat
at the table he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat
finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine
lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room
theres a loud buzz of excited chatter
hands are stack ing flowers good luck messages cards and cables by the mirror
through the blur and bustle we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message rachel we love you
hands casually move it to one side among the flowers resting on the small portable tv set
on the screen is an image of rachel performing on stage acknowledging applause bowing
the doll explodes shattering the tv the mirror and the the screen goes black amid shouts screams and
frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree sun glasses on a glass of iced tea by his side
strains of dont walk away renee come from a beat up transistor an old fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass
throwing knives lay scattered nearby
a wooden post is sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard
bill devaney fiftyish a distinguished looking black gentleman stands nearby trying to engage frank in a conversation that up to this point hasnt been going well
hes rachels personal manager
so you wont protect rachel marron just because shes in show business
i dont do celebrities
but the biggest moneys in show business people
frank says nothing
his eyes are closed behind the sun glasses
devaney picks up one of the throwing knives
he holds it carefully by the blade and throws it
it misses the post by three feet and clatters against the fence
frank opens his eyes sees whats going on and closes his eyes again
picking up another knife do you really do these things
isnt she the one who collects dolls
this is enough to distract devaney from his knife throwing
exasperated farmer rachel marron is one of the most famous people in america
shes won every music award invented
shes got the number one song in the country right now and shell probably be nominated for an oscar in her very
and you want to know isnt she the one
christ man whereve you been
you mean she doesnt collect dolls
she collects dolls
i thought i knew who she was
devaney tries to size up whether frank is kidding him or not
franks face betrays nothing
devaney gestures with a knife
youre probably deadly with these things arent you
frank doesnt move
why are you resisting this job
bucks a week
there are several good men available for that kind of money
have you talked to fitzgerald or racine
portman was interested
he senses an opening and sits down beside frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk
but were told youre the best
theres no such thing
farmer were talking about a very frightened lady
seven year old son
believe me i wouldnt be here if i didnt think this was for real
long pause farmer she begged me to get you
frank sits up finally and looks at devaney a long time
he picks up five throwing knives and stands up
ill come and ill look the situation over
if i take it its three thousand a week
you must be very deadly for three grand a week
frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post
he throws one of the knives
it misses the post and clatters against the fence
devaneys face drops
frank examines the next knife
mumbling i know its something like
the second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from devaney
devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind frank
frank raises his hand to throw again then stops and motions devaney off to the side
better not stand right behind me
devaney smiles weakly
frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion
the knife sinks an inch into the center of the post
franks hand arching again
throwing the remaining knives
both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one
frank stops his nondescript chevy across the quiet street from the closed unmanned gate at the bottom of the marron driveway
as he looks over the gate the wall the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond
note the use of the term franks pov is not to be taken simply as a camera direction
rather it re presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way frank sees
frank lives by constant vigilance heightened awareness
it is his genius and his burden
the audience must be put in the position of looking searching scanning with him
he has a curious sense of being watched a kind of prick ling on the back of his neck
as he looks around a black toyota x parked some way down the road drives rapidly off too fast to get a clear look
he watches it go
frank pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car
he grabs a bar of the gate and pulls
the whole gate rattles
frank gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom box at the side of the gate
a mans voice crackles out of the box
transmission is terrible
frank farmer to see miss marron
alexander graham bell to see miss marron
obviously has not heard have you got an appointment
the atomic number of zinc is
there is a loud buzzing and the gate swings arthritically open
as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land scaped grounds
plenty of potential hiding places
the mansion is at the top of the hill
the grounds behind the mansion fall away
the mansion is huge
on and on it goes
frank drives past the garage area where henry the chauffeur is polishing the mascot on the limousine
one of his arms is bandaged
henry peers at frank puts down his cloth and walks toward the entrance where frank is parking
frank gets out looks around
a painters truck is parked nearby two painters unloading equipment from it
can i help you
are you the man on the intercom
can i help you
my name is edison
i have an appointment with miss marron
and that was arranged by
go right ahead mr
what happened to your arm
looking at his arm a doll
he goes back to the limousine
frank rings the doorbell although the door is not shut
emma a fiftyish housekeeper appears
a man in cover alls comes out past her carrying a length of timber
henry ford to see mr
come in please
frank steps into the foyer with emma
she is a warm matronly woman who does a fine job running the house without standing on custom
ill tell you quite honestly mr
ford i dont know where mr
did he say hed be here
then he probably is
let me look
she leads frank into a large unused formal parlor
there are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being repainted
on a number of tv screens scattered around rachels latest video the one we saw in the opening titles is continuously playing
the sound of the song itself i have nothing comes softly from concealed speakers
please make yourself at home
can i get you anything
frank demurs and emma disappears back through the foyer
frank watches her go then moves off into the house in the opposite direction
its obviously undergoing a major redecoration
painters decorators and designers come and go oblivious to franks presence
the deeper frank walks into the house the warmer and more lived in rooms appear
frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area
one wall is all glass
on the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of rachel marrons career a tony award three grammys gold and platinum records other statuettes and plaques
among the framed photo graphs of rachel accepting awards etc
is one of her and
her small son fletcher dressed in a tuxedo
both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection
frank looks down at the pool
dwarfed by the pool the only person in sight is seven year old fletcher the little boy from the photograph dark haired and fragile
he is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot long speedboat which is cutting across the water
a nanny sits some way off embroidering
franks attention is distracted
a heavier bass musical beat comes from somewhere nearby in the house another rachel marron number but this time up tempo and bouncy
frank follows the sound
frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from
it is large and comfortable with plenty of seating a bar a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth
it is packed with people props and video equipment
there is lots of activity a general air of barely organized chaos
music blares out
a group of six dancers is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video directed by their choreographer rory
sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room
a video cameraman circles them taping the rehearsal which appears on a large screen tv behind them
in one corner a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video
several people are stand ing around tending to the video and playback gear
all the chairs face the far end of the room and it isnt immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions
as frank sits on the barstool at the back a large swivel chair turns to reveal devaney
he waves to frank and makes his way over to him
on the other side of the room a brawny heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at frank
he has a twenty inch neck
devaney signals to him that everything is all right
the brawny man looks at frank a moment more then sits down
frank looks around the room
a shelf laden with vitamins
guitars of various makes
a gold record being used as a coaster
people smoking and chatting through the rehearsal
in one of the chairs a pretty woman in her mid thirties nicki the woman we saw at the premiere is knitting
she glances occasionally at the dancers
a man sits next to a phone busily discussing a contract with someone at the other end of the line
the music climaxes and abruptly stops
the dancers hold their dramatic final poses for a second then relax again
the clapping from the front sofa is loudest
from elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the video playback everybody
rachels voice comes from the sofa
come here rory
the choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from sight
sound of kissing laughter
the video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather round it expectantly
sugar thats gonna be great
i love the ending
devaney moves to the front of the room
the playback starts behind him
there are several overlapping conversations going on
nicki howd you like the number
you like the end routine
you wanna see it back from the beginning or just the ending
nicki responds to rachels question
it was just great rory
but rachel is already replying to the video director
i wanna see it all
ill bet tony loved it
the brawny man tony shrugs and stands to look at frank as he speaks
dont worry rory
tony doesnt appreciate great art
the pinned up girl has been brought forward for rachels approval elbowing devaney a little to one side
showing the costume what do you think rachel
rachel frank farmer is
devaney do you think this is me
not looking its terrific
devaney is now facing the unseen rachel
rachel frank farmer is here
devaney nods in franks direction
nicki looks at frank
getting no response the bodyguard
i think rory should be my bodyguard
to dress designer lets see the back again
rachel raise your butt out of there and meet this man
rachel marron finally rises from the sofa
its a bit of
a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old
a young woman
not beautiful not ugly
unique only in that she is immediately interesting
well im up
rachel and frank look across the room at each other
frank comes forward
frank farmer rachel marron
rachel offers her hand and they shake
rachel looks him up and down
you dont look like a bodyguard
what did you expect
i dont know
tough guy maybe
this is my disguise
smiling well his timings good
this is nicki rachels sister and personal secretary
nice to meet you mr
indicating tony scibelli
tony nods but makes no move to shake hands
rachel dismisses the dress designer
to designer the backs still not right
spector still on the phone offers a perfunctory wave
sy spector rachels publicist
can we get you a drink
nicki goes to the bar
rachel sits and motions for frank to sit opposite her
rory ill be with you in a second
rory gets up and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video
listen this whole thing is bills idea
this sudden obsession with protecting me
tony has always handled my security and weve done just fine
into the phone yes ill hold but not long
rachel you want to run through your steps before we go again
ill be with you in a second
nicki hands frank his orange juice
she looks at frank as she speaks
i think bills right rachel
its time you took more precautions
spector enters the conversation
one hand covers the phone nicki im sure mr
farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time rachel is on the cover of a magazine
not like this
an assistant hands rachel a small sheaf of phone messages some papers for signature and a pen
rachel checks through them and signs as she talks
relax guys i said id do it
you see what im dealing with here
im willing to go along as long as we all understand each other
im not going to let this alter my life one little bit
to assistant who was this
overlapping devaney oh
that was clives office
they called three times
honey thats not going to be a problem
to frank rachel runs a very informal household were all on a first name basis
spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in
and im sure youll blend in just fine
you can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house
some kind of improved security for the gate
what else rachel
rachel stands and starts to wander over to rory and the dancers
frank looks at devaney
devaney doesnt like the tone this is taking
i think im safe when im here at the house so i guess the main thing will be when i go out
tony will be able to fill you in on all that
you two will have to work something out
i dont want both of you falling all over me everywhere i go
the most important thing is this i will not allow fletcher to be affected by this thing
rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion
punching phone i was just going to cover that
well have to tell the child you have some other function
i dont want him to think hes in prison
so the house and grounds must not be altered in any way
he shouldnt be aware that youre here
is that clear
frank looks at her a long time glancing up at devaney once
theres been a mistake
if youll show me the quickest way out well save each other a lot of trouble
franks on his way
someone brings a silver headpiece on a stand to rachel
she ignores it still looking at frank
you can go past the pool
shut up tony
nice meeting you
farmer will you wait a minute
bill i dont think we should be begging this guy for his services
sy im handling this
rachel looks on coolly as frank slides open the glass door
farmer will you wait a minute
frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall down the slope
devaney is scurrying to keep up
farmer will you wait a minute
i should have told you more
im sorry but i was afraid she wouldnt go through with it
i thought id let the two of you work it out
come to an understanding
frank starts to walk off
devaney is grasping at straws
shes not a bad person and whether she knows it or not she needs you
a beat youve come this far
would you just wait here for one minute
i want to show you something
devaney runs back to the house
fletcher happy to have someone to talk to walks up to frank with his remote control speed boat
frank would like to walk away but fletcher blocks his way
frank looks at fletchers frail little nut brown figure
the watching nanny continues her embroidering some way off
continuing to walk hi
how are you today
wants to keep walking all right
how bout yourself
oh im fine
do you like boats
frank gives up
hes not going to get out of here
i dont like boats
oh i dont know
sure you do but you dont want to tell me
frank considers him then slips out of his sport coat
he crouches down so that he is eye level with fletcher
youre a smart kid
ill tell you
one time i was stuck on a boat with some people for four months
a big white yacht
do you know what a yacht is
thinks about this yeah
my mom rented this huge yacht once and we took a trip
it was great
everyone threw up except me
i love em
standing to leave well nobodys perfect
fletcher squints up at him the sun in his eyes
youre the bodyguard arent you
frank is surprised
what do you know about it
ive got ears
ill remember that
devaney trots into the pool area out of breath
he is holding a bulging manila file
as he sees fletcher he holds the file casually at his side
frank sees fletcher looking at the file
how are you fletch
to frank im glad you waited
lets go over here
to fletcher nice meeting you
fletcher looks after them silently
devaney slides the file across the table at frank open ing it
inside are letters of every size and condition
repeatedly throughout this scene franks gaze is drawn to fletcher who has started his boat again
this is just in the last six months
looks at the pile have you ever tried having these professionally assessed
devaney shakes his head no
frank begins to look through the letters flipping them by the corner of the page
from many different sources some are scrawled some typed some assembled from cutouts
many are soiled and torn others immaculate
occasionally one will have a photo of rachel with crude markings on it
spector enters sucking on a popsicle
he comes to stand over franks shoulder peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters
devaney says you were in the secret service
frank goes through them quickly with an expert eye
he sometimes pauses to read one more carefully
a few he removes from the stack and places in the center of the table
ever guard the main man
i was two years with carter and four years with reagan
frank sets another letter in the center pile
he stops smiling at it
this is a little old lady in akron
shes written to everybody ive ever worked for
he continues to turn until something stops him
several letters are paper clipped together
they are the pasted up type we saw being assembled on the desk top
reagan got shot
his chatter is beginning to annoy frank
not on my shift
spector emits a gratuitous laugh acknowledges the joke
frank goes back to his letters
he taps the stack in the center of the table
at first glance these dont bother me
but keep them
you never know
he separates one letter from the others
this could be something
devaney searches franks face
you think it could be the same guy
the one who rigged the doll
i dont know
did you tell miss marron about it
does she know about the doll
devaney and spector exchange looks
this is evidently a sore point between them
we said thered been some electrical problem while she was on stage
look she doesnt need that kind of worry right now
it would upset her
what about the police
there was no reason for the police
no one got hurt
what about the chauffeur
it was nothing
it was just our people there
frank turns and watches fletcher by the pool
devaneys eyes are still on franks face
sy i think we should show him the room
frank follows spector and devaney into the room
he glances around taking in the murals the decor the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the pages of a tabloid layout
is this her bedroom
she sleeps in a room next to fletchers down the hall
sy had this done for a magazine layout superstars in their boudoirs
did you see it
rachel never liked it
she didnt have to like it
devaney gently lays the cut out letter on the bed
we found the letter here
somebody was in here
somebody broke in and
masturbated on the bed
and she doesnt know about this either
devaney shakes his head
are you kidding
this would really freak her out
what do you think
someone penetrates the house gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed id say that qualifies as a problem
what kind of problem
agitated of fuck we dont need this now
this house is wide open
i said this house is wide open
and you people have no clue what real security is or what it takes to achieve it
does a quick read on frank frank i totally respect what youre telling me
tell me how you want to work and ill accommodate you
look i cant protect her
i wont be responsible for her safety if she doesnt know whats going on
ill talk to her ill make her understand
i can do that
ill talk to her
spector exits the room in a huff
frank emerges with devaney and crosses toward his car
she wont give you any static frank youve got my word on that
frank is still focused on fletcher
sure she will
so what jobs perfect
youre a bodyguard arent you
slowly frank faces him
as they reach the car devaney is relieved
he dares a perfect smile
devaney if you ever lie to me again ill take you apart
henry dupres is leaning against the doorjamb
the room is comfortable a guest bedroom
frank flops one battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it
he pulls open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away his clothes
whyd you say your name was edison
i wanted to see how hard it was to get in
and it wasnt was it
henry unconsciously flexes his fingers easing the muscles in his hands
frank notices and pulls out a small tube of ointment from a pouch hes unpacking
he hands it to henry
put this on your arm
itll help the ache
henry takes it but is noncommittal
ill bet you can fill up a whole day just washing the cars and driving rachel marron around town
thats my job
were adding to your duties
youre my new assistant
frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as henry watches
henry ive spent a lot of time guarding people all over the world
and ive found one thing to be true
no matter how incompetent the assassins no matter how much they miss their target by theres one person who always gets hit
the cocky black chauffeur
henry considers this for a moment and smiles
over scenes we hear the voice of cnns martin grove from showbiz today
its oscar time again folks and with academy members marking their ballots today for this years nominations some canny tipsters in vegas have announced their picks for the awards
echoing the prevailing buzz in hollywood the vegas hilton is gambling on one sure thing at least
newcomer rachel marron is tipped at to to lead this years best actress runners
the sultry singer made a notable acting debut last fall in queen of the night singing the hit song i have nothing
the lady may end up eating her words if she takes home that statuette march th
the fortification of the estate begins as frank and henry walk the grounds
frank talks and points henry takes notes on a pad
frank gestures at the stonework of the gate points at the top of the stone wall along waverly lane
at the tall hedges which separate the estate from its neighbors frank gestures to take in the entire length of the hedged border
henry stops in amazement
frank keeps walking
fletcher stands at the edge of the terrace staring down across the rear grounds
frank and henry are down there conferring about the fence
appears beside fletcher looks down there too then leads her son purposefully away
fletcher isnt happy about it
frank tours the house with emma and henry
frank opens various doors fidgets with locking mechanisms
emma finds it all exciting
a small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre
a stereo plays exercising music
nicki dressed in leotards is doing pre aerobic stretch ing exercises
frank appears outside the window
nicki waves him in
unseen by frank a huge st
bernard lays in the front of the door
he muscles his way in the dog never moves just slides along the floor as frank pushes the door open
frank looks the room over
unusual tactic for a guard dog but effective
nicki smiles gesturing him in
you can look around if you like
frank indicates it wont be necessary
nicki stops working out
im sorry to disturb you
thats all right
its an excuse to rest
its my private place
im the only one who works out around here
frank glances at photos on one wall
most are of nicki from years ago some show her performing with a band
my own ego wall
no platinum records
frank spots a picture of two girls
you and rachel
when i was a kid i put a little band together
we played high school dances stuff like that
then rachel joined the act
as you can imagine she was quite a little entertainer
even then she had a way of stopping the show
so i kind of quit
you never went back
it was pretty obvious who the star in our family was
frank looks back at the picture
frank and henry walk toward the closed garages
that depends on what you call a hint
i dont want anyone on the street to be able to look at the cars and know who owns them
henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch
the three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence
i dont think theres anything here youd call a hint
one at a time the doors go up to reveal first garage the cadillac limousine weve seen earlier
license rachel second garage a gray mercedes
third garage a jaguar xke in an outrageous pink
no other car in the world is this color
license rachel frank looks at henry who is laughing and shakes his head
he walks toward the jag
frank releases the hood
he looks inside for a moment then reaches into the guts of the engine
he fiddles for a second then stands up holding some wires and slams the hood shut again
he gestures toward the other two cars
get new plates for those two
the fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to clear away the stonework around the entrance
sitting beside henry frank teaches him how to spin the limo in a degree skid turn sending up clouds of dust
a group of roadies watching bursts into spontan eous applause
fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house watching the activity with delighted interest
he turns as he spots something beyond the hedge
workmen put up a seven foot cyclone fence
across the road a black toyota x is stopped
it slowly pulls away
we cant see inside it
one worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a crowbar
his partner picks up the rock and tosses it on a small pile of rocks
the boulder bounces down the backside of the pile
rachel looking out her window at fletcher and the work men sees the rock stop a yard from him
fletcher scrambles away much as a kid might dance back from a
wave on a beach
the sight disturbs rachel
back in here
as she speaks some workmen test the remote control on a window shutter
it descends in front of rachels face
she is not amused
fletcher passes frank on his way to join rachel
he mutters almost under his breath
i think hes got a black x
could be a chevy
more like a toyota
frank stares at fletcher then looks back to the street
the room is dark
an opaque projector throws an image onto a screen it is a letter threatening rachels life
we hear voices
one is franks the other two belong to special agents ray court and terry minella
the letter is one of the pasted up threats we saw being assembled earlier
it reads reading as fast as possible we pick up some vicious threats and obscenities but we dont have time to read it all before we
illuminated by the screen
this is another of the ones we think are worth pursuing
lots of work went into it
were doing lab work on it
it could be nothing
is illuminated above the projector
this is the one you think is tied to the doll
thats what her manager thinks
this i have nothing business is a natural with the record and movie and all
the projector light goes off and the room light goes on
the room is practically bare
ray court a prematurely white haired career civil servant raises the window shade
sunlight streams in
on courts lapel is a tiny p
terry minella a slight dark year old offers frank a cigarette frank declines minella lights up
i sort of lost track of you after washington
hows the private stuff
big money i bet
court looks at minella knowingly
minella and court walk frank to the lobby
i knew it
it is big money
you need an assistant
im ready to get out
ive lost my tolerance for assholic behavior
you should see the jerk were covering now
hellfire henry kent
somebody wants to pop him
which isnt exactly surprising considering what the shitheads
do everyone a favor
he coughs ironically as you know were nonpolitical these days
the three men laugh easily together
they have reached the lobby doors
to frank well put this stuff through washington
behavioral sciences should have something in a few days
a pause ray
why am i getting all this cooperation
shes a big star
important people care about her
politics and show business are practically the same these days
got any crowd photos we can use
im trying to keep her away from crowds
lots of customers arriving leaving and seated at tables
waiters criss cross the terrace
near the entrance rachel is saying goodbye to a middle aged woman
frank stands nearby with nicki
the woman says something to rachel who turns and looks at frank
rachel whispers something to the woman and they both laugh
they kiss and rachel moves toward the entrance
an afterthought phony goodbye nicki
so great to see you
nicki waves and follows rachel
frank stays very close without seeming to walk with rachel
a little girl darts into their path and approaches rachel
rachel glances at frank who has stopped with her then she signs an autograph for the girl
the girls mother close behind her hands a small camera casually to nicki to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with rachel
frank watches nicki quietly comply
rachel spector and frank all reach the front entrance together and frank slips out first glancing around
rachel comes out and passes within inches of him
im surprised you didnt plug them
rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby
as they reach the limousine frank continues scanning the street
tony stares at him uncomprehending
impatiently hey lets go
frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat next to tony
across tony o
henry lets go
tony looks at frank eyes narrowing
from across the street we see the limo pull away
as the shot clears the dark shape of another vehicle appears slowly moving into frame over the top of the camera
frank sits beside tony next to the door
tony speaks to him in a near whisper
let me set you straight on a few things
for starters i love this lady
what i do for her i do for
im not some hired fuckin gun who is out to make her life miserable
while tony speaks franks eyes dart to the side mirror his gaze never leaves it
appears in the rearview mirror
i do things the way she likes
her happiness is everything to me
frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror
id like to know how you handle things tony
i handle things fine frank
you watch me and youll learn something
to henry turn left
is that him
frank shakes his head hes not sure
hey whats going on
as the limo turns the x follows them into the turn
whispers to henry
slow down very slow
you want me to do a one eighty
no just slow down
the car slows
they look up from some papers
why are we stopping
are we here
behind them through the rear window the x can be seen
sensing something it makes a sudden tire screeching left turn disappearing behind them
the limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a large fence
frank speaks to henry
take them to the house
frank jumps out and jumps a hedge racing toward the lawn and work area
as the car pulls away they see frank running wildly across the property
whats with him
as frank comes through some bushes he suddenly catches a glimpse of the x through the trees
it starts to accelerate
as it pulls away it is too far to record the license number he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property
leaping hedges frank crashes through tropical vegetation
crashing through a bamboo forest he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below
the x can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off
a retaining wall about feet high rises from the road to the slope
without a pause as the car speeds beneath frank leaps and drops the full distance to the road
the x roars past just missing him and turns a corner
hitting hard frank allows his knees to take the force of the fall deliberately rolling once before he springs into a crouched upright position
but the x speeds around a corner and is gone
the fortification continues as workmen tighten screws install electrical wiring test alarms
as frank watches over the work we see him show henry how to wear a surv kit communications system
keep this loose
fletcher comes to take a look too
he peers up at frank expectantly
tell me about the car
four wheel drive
fletcher looks pleased
one snag though
fletchers face falls
of them in los angeles
nice work though
shrugging well nobodys perfect frank
gesturing to the can i try that
rachel has been watching fletcher and frank down the hill
now she leans back on the chaise lounge where she is sunning trying to listen to a new song on a walkman
there is the screeching howl of a drill on metal from the direction of the house
rachel jumps up and yells toward the house
shut up you assholes
a mild looking old locksmith is working on rachels window
rachel walks in from the pool starting to peel off the swimsuit
she stops startled as she sees him
this is the last straw
she blows up
clutching the swimsuit you
out of here
terrified the old locksmith drops his tools and begins backing out of the room
im a real fan of yours miss marron
still angry but disarmed rachel makes a face
then you can take your tools with you
she turns to the window in what she imagines is franks general direction and like a little girl suddenly sticks out her tongue
in a big closeup on a black and white tv screen we see devaneys immaculate convertible mercedes sl as it roars up the drive
frank henry and fletcher watch in the newly erected guard house
the area is greatly changed
there is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of switches lights and phones at his command
there are several tv screens one of them shows a series of endlessly panning shots from cameras at the rear of
on the other the mercedes kicks up dust from the last few curves in the drive
fletcher shakes his head
hes seen it all before
is that devaney
to frank shes got him by the short ones doesnt she frank
frank squelches a smile at henry
where did he learn that
yeah she makes him nervous
they watch as devaney screeches to a stop gets out and hurries inside
nicki is cutting fruit at the bar
rachel very tense is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink shes making in a blender
rory her choreographer stands behind her massaging her neck and shoulders
spector is perched on a bar stool like a vulture
devaney hurries into the room nicki gives him a look
i want him gone
what is it now
he told rachel no sunday brunch at charlies
no sunday brunch
thats why you called me up here
that is not it
its my money and my life and i want him out of here
where is he
nicki indicates through the glass door
devaney walks over to it
on the patio
hes through messing with my life
rachel im getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes
leaning out the glass door farmer
would you come in here a minute
devaney walks back toward rachel
did you know he was nuts
do you know who couldnt get past the gates yesterday
robin leach thats who
rory sniggers into the back of rachels hair fighting off a laugh
rachel has difficulty keeping a straight face too
spector glares at them as frank enters from the sliding door
you think thats funny
the man talks to million people and he cant even get in here
did he have an appointment
devaney turns to him
farmer what is this about brunch at charlies
rachels been going there every sunday for the last five years
i dont want her doing anything shes always done
mimicking him i dont want her doing anything shes always done
the guys a fanatic
so are the guys hes protecting you from
excuse me if i dont faint
think of fletcher rachel turns on the blender drowning out nickis voice
frank looks at rachel coolly
she stares at him petulantly then turns off the blender
do you know hes got the phones bugged
oh jesus bill
maybe he gets off listening to my calls
all that heavy breathing
interrupting what do you want from my life
i want some peace around here
devaney looks at frank imploringly
were almost done
and i want to be able to eat brunch with my friends
go on tuesday this week
spector looks at him as though he were a martian
stretching it out tuesday morning brunch
where did you find this guy
rachel turns on the blender and stares at frank
rachels limousine is parked opposite the shop
its a decidedly downscale area
a little way off a group of unemployed youths hang around eyeing the limo with interest
henry sits at the wheel
tony stands by the open window leaning against the car
looking at the youths i wish rachel didnt keep coming here
it makes me nervous
cept im not nervous cos i got you with me
screeching as its slid along a metal rack
rachel is shopping for bargains moving along racks of discarded clothing
louise youve got too much great stuff
from the back of the shop laughing take it all darlin
frank leans casually against a wall not watching rachel but watching the shop watching the street outside
rachel finds something she likes
let me try this on
she flicks a glance to frank hes not looking at her
she pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing booth then stops dramatically
to frank indicating the open booth farmer do you want to come in here with me
just to be safe
frank glances at her then resumes his surveillance of the shop
rachels head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes
you probably wont believe this but i have a reputation for being a bitch
frank says nothing
he gazes outside through the store front window and sees henry and tony horsing around next to the limo
a few small boys stand around the car
one of them is climbing onto the hood
i didnt used to be
but you get known for being a certain way a way people think you are and pretty soon you get like that
cant help it
frank smiles knowingly
you dont think so
youre such an expert on famous people
ive seen a few
and you disagree
very flat you can be as you choose to be
its an act of discipline sometimes but it can be done
rachel stops in her tracks
then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror
also reflected in the mirror is frank
that why you never stay with one of your clients
they too undisciplined for you
or is it youre afraid youll start to care about them
without interest thats right
rachel turns to frank
cant you answer straight just once
why dont you talk to me
im not such a bad lady
youre too clever for me
i cant keep up
frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze
rachel steps closer to him
look at me farmer
frank turns and looks at her
you dont approve of me do you
disapprovals a luxury i cant afford
gets in the way
dont like emotions getting to you huh
never mix business with pleasure
its a stand off
after a moment rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him
grab that would you
frank takes a beat
looks out the window
im here to keep you alive
not to help you shop
fuming rachel sizes things up then grabs it herself whipping the curtain shut behind her
a smile plays across franks face
we see a mans hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve
the cover reads rachel marron the hits
the cassette is gently eased into the slot of the video player
rachels image appears on the screen singing softly intensely passionately into the camera
we track into the image as if a little hypnotized by it
frank sits alone in his room lit by the glow of the tv dressed in a business style blue suit and tie
hes watching rachels videos
scattered around the video player are a collection of other rachel marron cds tapes and videos
frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap
some of the phrases are circled
as he watches we see a subtle change in his expression
it is as if he really were looking at rachel for the first time here watching her sing
for a second she seems to be singing to him alone passionate and vulnerable
he opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled russian orthodox type cross
he fastens the clasp checking that it holds then looks back to the screen
rachels song plays over the moonlit estate
the room is surprisingly bare and simple almost empty apart from rachels collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed
rachel is getting dressed for the evening
a hairdresser stands behind her fussing with her hair
rachel hears the music coming from outside and moves to the window
the hairdresser moves with her still busy with the brush
gazing across the garden she sees the light in franks room and hears her own voice singing out from there too
frank is showing henry how to check the underside of the limo with an angled mirror on a stick
both are crouched beside the vehicle
a noise makes them look up
rachel dressed to the nines and looking very sexy emerges from the house with spector and devaney
spectors carrying a videotape
tony follows as they head for the car where
frank and henry are waiting
fletcher stands in the doorway flanked by uniformed security guards
he waves at frank
to henry i thought it was dinner
to spector are we going somewhere else
the mayan frank
whats the mayan
spector starts to climb into the limo
its a club frank
come on henry lets go
spector youve got to tell me about these things
i just did
he disappears inside the limo
rachel tugs at franks lapels looks him up and down brushing something off his shoulder
nice suit frank
rachel is about to get in
he removes something from his pocket a small enameled cross
i want you to keep this
rachel looks at it both flattered and confused
its fitted with a radio transmitter
when you close the clasp it sends a signal
if theres ever a problem and were separated just press it and ill know you need me
rachel doesnt know how to respond
shes stuck for words
spector pokes his head out impatiently
okay she knows how it works lets get going
rachel manages a quick smile to frank as she gets in the back
frank gets in the front beside tony
the limo pulls out
frank rides beside tony in the front seat
the radio plays softly in the b
in back rachel spector and devaney are drinking champagne
tony burps smiles at frank
youre listening to k
the rock of l
and yes we have
we told you wed crack the case of the mystery guest
and if you are one of the few who hasnt heard its rachel at the mayan
franks turns up the volume
rachel marron tonight appearing as billy thomas very special guest
but if you dont have a ticket you can forget going down there
police are asking us to ask you to stay away
so everybody please stay cool stay tuned and well try to get you some interviews after the show
remember you heard it here on k
the station that delivers
frank looks back at spector who silently mouths
it wasnt me
the car turns a corner and there it is the mayan only fifty yards ahead a mob of fans spilling out of the club off the sidewalk and into the
spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of the limo
frank stares ahead in disbelief
the noise of the crowd can be heard as they pull up front
the mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage
faces of the fans are at the windows leering at rachel
many are grotesquely painted
some go into a wild frenzy as rachels limo pulls up
there is a punch up and a man is beaten back
someone has a video camera
its quartz light shines in through the limo windows
everybody squints at the glare
as rachels car pulls up the beaten man dances weirdly at the curb with blood streaming from his nose
a pair of security guards try to hold them back
as her limo stops a chant begins
we want rachel
others join in as the mob presses forward
the instant she exits the car her expression goes public a wide show biz smile
sandwiched between spector and devaney with tony in front and frank at the rear rachel makes her entrance
a young man breaks the barrier moving toward rachel
frank grabs him by one of his belt loops gracefully guides him all the way across and slips him under the opposite cordon into the arms of a security guard
rachel steps into a room set for a stars arrival
flowers are on every surface that will hold them
one huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed on the
frank checks them all with a magnometer wand before letting rachel sit down
he goes out closing the door watchful
franks eyes search the crush of people milling around outside the dressing room
a few feet away spector talks to a journalist whos carrying a tape recorder
and this is my exclusive
i swear i thought shed talk to you
what can i say
frank is checked out by a strange looking women in vampyra drag
rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver headpiece we saw earlier
she notices a small spray of lilies of the valley among the floral arrangements
an envelope marked rachel is attached to it
she reaches forward and opens it
we see the note as she unfolds it
we see the shock in her face
spector frank and devaney are there
rachel seems dazed unfocussed
devaney hands the note to frank
he sent another one
rachel immediately picks up on this
what do you mean another one
frank quickly shoots a look at spector
they didnt tell you
tell me what
there were some letters before rachel
same kind of thing threats oddball stuff
we didnt want to worry you
and somebody got into the house
starting to panic someone was in my house
lets not get hysterical
lets get her out of here
someone was in my house
it was weeks ago
you were out of town
while fletcher was there
listen fletcher is okay
the house is like fort knox now
we should get her out of here
theres no way anyone could
no way anyone could what
look everybody calm down
lets just see how she is
to rachel how do you feel honey
someone comes through the door with some flowers
frank eases them out and gently closes the door
i cant protect her out there
do you think hes out there
devaney cant answer
she turns to frank
hes here isnt he
he might be
we dont know that
frank we dont know that
rachel is enraged
but you know he was in my house
oh my god
lets go home sy
well have to make an announcement
fine you make it theyll tear the fucking place apart
a lone mike stands onstage
the crowds growing im patient
a rhythmic clapping begins
devaney walks timidly onstage
hes not happy to be there
he reaches the mike and taps it with a finger
ive got an announcement to make
im sorry but
due to circumstances beyond
a groan begins
a chorus of boos fills the room
he raises his hands
frank guides rachel toward the stage exit
a roar from the audience begins
it grows louder as they near the exit
rachels expression is a combination of fear and humiliation
when they have almost reached the exit she stops
dont do it
its not worth it
cutting him off no fucking freak is gonna chase me off stage
she pulls away from him
farmer starts after her closely followed by spector
im afraid that
a great gush of applause from the audience
he doesnt see rachel walking up behind him
rachel wont be able
rachel stands beside him beaming
claps back to her fans
rachel gestures in his direction
bill devaney ladies and gentlemen thank you bill
isnt billy thomas the greatest
hes asked me to sing a song
i hope you dont mind
the crowd roars its approval
frank nervously scans the room
rachel smiles and moves along the stage
music starts in the b
masking obvious fear she starts to sing
as she takes one hand from the microphone her fingers tremble
she clasps it again to hide her anxiety
shows her alone and vulnerable bathed in light center stage
rachel snatches a quick glance at frank then looks back to her silent audience
he scans the audience intensely face to face
rachels limo stands waiting
camera pulls back to reveal a black toyota x parked among the other cars
rachel approaches the end of her song her voice coming ever stronger
spector comes up to frank in the wings positioning himself combatively between frank and his view of rachel
are we having a communications problem here
spectors presence is a distraction
frank steps to one side for a better view of rachel
spector moves too
apparently i didnt make it clear to you how things go around here
you told me you were going to tell her
and you didnt
i didnt think she could handle it
but she handled it fine
frank continues to peer past spectors shoulder his vigilance undiminished
soothed and nurtured by the obvious admiration of her audience rachels fear is beginning to vanish
the song is taking over
spector changes tack becoming confidential man to man
frank i know what youre saying
i know you want to do whats best for her
i understand that
you have a job to do here
but you have to understand that rachel has a job to do too
and thats what shes doing out there
shes working frank
thats what she does and thats where she does it
shes hot right now
this is the time for her
if she doesnt get out there shes dead
forget about crazy death threats if she doesnt sing shes dead anyway
look handled properly this thing could be good for a million dollars worth of free publicity
frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a wall of curtain ropes
it could clinch her the nomination
one word in print about any of this
spector nods half gasping
frank tightens his grip
franks attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the crowd
trouble with you is you dont understand the sympathy vote
rachel scans the crowd spread before her like a surreal mural
camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare
the thundering adoration is like a stimulant
she darts a look to frank and gives him a fierce naughty girl smile
turning back to crowd you like that
would like to hear another
from the wings billy thomas gives her the nod to go for it
it seems to be alright with everyone
the band starts playing a dance beat
on the prowl i think my feet are trying to tell me something
wanna see a new video
the crowd explodes
they know what song is coming
they start to move with rachel
dancing talking i want to dance
she skitters to the other side of the stage baiting her fans
her new video explodes across the video wall behind her
the crowd surges forward
two security guards nervously tense up watching the crowd
when one fan tries to climb onstage frank reaches out and unbalances him so that the man falls back into the audience
another man climbs the stage on the other side
one of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance
the crowd is getting even more excited pressing closer trying to touch rachel
the security guards move in but rachel gestures for them to back off
franks task has suddenly become impossible
a forest of hands and faces start to engulf rachel
anyone could be the killer
franks eyes dart over them all his gaze intense as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower
looking offstage at frank
his frustration is almost intoxicating to her
she struts over the lip of the stage
a man leaps up from audience to join her
frank starts forward
rachel gestures to him to hold back waving him off
spector stands well out of franks reach staring at rachel onstage
he catches franks attention yelling back defiantly
look at her fucking great
rachel dances erotically with the man bumping and grinding sinking to her knees
the crowd roars approval
frank quickly sizes up the scene
he speaks into a surv kit microphone in his sleeve
across the room we see henry listening pushing an earpiece to his ear
henry quickly scurries to an exit
frank starts moving toward the stage
at that moment the lucky man rachels dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully like the dance partner she has been pretending to be
one of security guards rushes forward to extri cate her
the spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on rachel
she flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans
the audience goes wild
this is the kind of thing rachel was famous for when she was starting out
the scene resembles a rugby scrum
with rachel the ball
frank sees rachel being passed over the heads of fans deeper into the audience
her dress is ripped and torn apart
the silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd
fear fills her face
shes gone over the edge literally and figuratively
shes lost control
tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her slamming bodies out of the way
in the b
the video continues on its serene uninterrupted way
he spots a fire extinguisher in the wings
frank grabs it and heads to center stage
he aims the extinguisher at the crowd between rachel and the stage
the chemical foam does its job scattering fans
frank leaps onto the floor kicking a wild eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights his way to rachel taking her in his arms
tony runs ahead of frank knocks a fan off the stage and waves for frank to follow
tony not there
ill take care of this
he heads for the door
just follow me
he turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull
tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a swath through the crowd
rain beats down
make way here
outta the way
a burly street regular gets a shove from tony and comes back hard
the crowd immediately sides with him yells encouragement
but tony is the better man and sends him sprawling
the rest of the way to the curb opens up
at the parking area tony discovers there is no limo and turns in bewilderment to rachel
but she is not there
a couple of people laugh
rachel and frank emerge from the darkness between two garbage bins and get into the limo henry has waiting there
the car moves out with a screech of tires narrowly missing spector as he staggers out of the building
what the fuck
come back here
the limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the street leaving spector in helpless fury apoplectic and speechless
frank turns and looks at rachel
she is diminutive doll like alone in the center of the large limousine seat
her hands rise to her face and her body begins to shake with sobs as she sits there alone in the tattered remains of her dress
frank turns away to avoid staring at her but he feels
henry senses what is going on and speaks softly
never done that before
its been a long night
the crowd is thinning out
a dim worklight is burning somewhere backstage
the auditorium is a mess the cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the riot
footsteps approach walking pausing as if looking for something
lying on the floor in big closeup we see a small fragment of rachels dress
the footsteps stop by it
a hand picks it up gently and lifts it out of frame
we hear the sound of a deep lingering inhalation of breath
the feet move on
fletcher is asleep in his bed
frank waits as rachel glances in
then she moves away
opening the door to her room she steps back allowing him to enter ahead
frank moves quickly into the room checking the window and french door
rachel waits silently by the door
all is clear
he steps back to the door
as he approaches her she begins to tremble
he gently reaches out and takes her in his arms
slowly holding her he leads her to bed moving aside some of rachels dolls laid out on the pillows
her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it
frank gently does it for her
she willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them
as she sits naked still trembling he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed
as he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand
he looks down stroking her forehead like a childs
arent you going to ask me why i behave like that
i know why
frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen care fully cutting and eating a peach
the door at the other end of the room slams open and tony stalks in soaking wet
he has just made his way home from the mayan and he is boiling
he sights on frank and moves toward him fast
frank just watches until tony is almost upon him
as tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt frank spins low out of his seat
tonys legs are knocked out from under him
he lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at frank who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on like a lion tamer a leg
strut pressed against tonys throat
frank looks down at him question ingly as if to ask had enough
tony scowls and nods
frank lifts the chair away
tony stands up and faces him
frank turns away and tony throws a punch at his head barely catching him as frank ducks and moves in under it
he hits tony twice and throws him against a cabinet
tony gets up slowly looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall
he holds it in front of him threateningly
frank shakes his head
hes getting irritated
he picks up the knife hes been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so hes holding it by the blade
with the same fluid motion weve seen earlier he throws it at tony
it sticks in the wall an inch from tonys ear
tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade
frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink
he glances at tony
i dont want to talk about this again
frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man sion
the grounds are quiet beautiful misty
we see him from behind some foliage as if hes being covertly observed stalked
a twig snaps and he turns sharply
shes dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him
the suit softens her appearance she looks lovely
her manner too has altered she is charming friendly and very girlish
gotcha didnt i
youre probably wondering what im doing
as frank nods you didnt know i jogged did you
frank shakes his head
whats the matter
fraid ill get picked off in my snazzy running suit
im afraid ill have to jog with you
they both smile
i guess i cant do it
rachel stops pumping gasps for air and for one moment rests a hand on franks arm to support herself
she removes it quickly
will you walk with me a little
frank nods and they cut off across the grounds
hard for her i know this is kinda late but thank you
im really glad youre here
she looks at him im going to try to cooperate
that would be good
they walk in silence for few moments
when rachel finally speaks she sounds genuinely unsure of herself nervous
its very appealing
and if its an act shes a terrific actress
i have this problem
this minor little problem
you see id like to go out for an evening
just me and a guy
makes a funny face like a date
but i cant go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute
i mean what if he invited me up to his place afterwards
are you going to come too
a beat so the only thing i can figure is for you to take me out
thats what i was wondering you know
what do you think
but only if you want to
frank is bemused
only if you want to
im not so bad
looks at him god this is embarrassing
im gonna run up ahead there
she runs up the hill to the pool area which is now above them
he walks up after her
nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of the mansion
fletcher peers out with her
sandy harris is on the phone
rachel and frank look up
tell her shell have to wait babe
im getting fixed up here
she watches frank and rachel her expression neutral
she turns away
fletcher continues to watch his mother with frank
the sound is deafening
a wet car comes out of the tunnel of machinery
in the distance glimpsed through the spinning brushes henry talks to a couple of workers as he waits for the limo to be cleaned
hands appear with a large chamois cloth moving easily and fast over the hood and windshield
a black in his early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car
a second pair of hands appear
white hands in rubber gloves
they open the drivers door and push a vacuum suction hose inside
the hands switch on the car radio loud
loud enough to hear over the din outside the car
the hose works its way over the front seats
and heres another biggie from a lady very much in the news these days miss rachel marron
we see the owner of the hands
it is the young blond man frank kicked aside at the mayan
his name is dan
his face is impassive
the hit song from the movie
queen of the night
i have nothing
the song begins and rachels voice fights the din
in the back of the car dans hose probes around nosing into all the crevices of the upholstery
it sucks up a crumpled pre signed photograph of rachel from the gap beside the rear seat
the hose is switched off and the gloved hands retrieve the picture
tight shabby facilities
dan opens the combination padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo inside
as the hands remove the rubber gloves the inside of the locker is revealed
pasted over every inch of the locker are pictures of rachel marron
one tabloid shot of her dancing with the word whore scrawled across it
taped to a single sheet of white paper in the center like a holy relic is the torn scrap of rachels dress from the mayan
the hands pin up the newly acquired photo next to it
special agent court is seated next to a white coated technician
the technician is leaning over one of the neatly pasted up death threats we have seen earlier
with a scalpel he lifts the word whore from out of the message
he sets it on a white sheet then brings the blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on the letter
frank and rachel exit with a small crowd
rachel wears a scarf and tinted glasses
the combination goes a long way toward disguising her
they pause at one of the dis play windows
inside is a poster for the movie yojimbo a large picture of toshiro mifune looking scruffy and fierce
well he didnt look like he wanted to die to me
theres a big difference between wanting to die and having no fear of death
they walk down the sidewalk
and because he had no fear of death he was invincible
what do you think
well he sure creamed em all in the end
yeah it was a good movie
they walk off down the sidewalk
how many times have you seen it
its a bit of a dive but the food is good and the atmos phere is great
your kinda place
your kinda music
as she smiles absolutely
you figure no one can get by you here
if someone is willing to swap his life for a kill nothing can stop him
what do i need you for
he might get me instead
and youre ready to die for me
thats my job
rachel looks at him
and youd do it
i cant sing
maybe theres some glory in saving a president or something but just anyone
you mean like you
its a matter
of conditioning and discipline
i dont trust discipline
at the crucial moment id cop out
but not with you fierce frank
have you ever liked anybody
what do you mean
like me a girl
frank knows what shes driving at
but hes not at all happy to relinquish this information
a long time ago
do you mind if i ask
do you mind if i dont answer
i dont want to pry
frank smiles at that
begins to laugh cant help herself she didnt die did she
you werent like
protecting her and she got killed
frank is silent grim
rachel looks stricken
oh my god
thats it isnt it
rachel is taken aback
oh frank im sorry
nice try though
pause it was less dramatic than that
she didnt love me anymore
can you imagine such a thing
frank puts a smiling spin on this last its pretty charming
rachel looks at him
no not really
a song comes on the jukebox what becomes of the broken hearted
frank smiles as rachel begins to sing
so is this a full service date frank
im just asking you to dance
frank and rachel navigate a tiny dance floor
frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this close to her
rachel hums softly picking up the words to the song
as we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head
you like this
a beat then rachel bursts out laughing
trying to compose herself im sorry
its just that
its so depressing
now theyre both laughing
grinning it is isnt it
suddenly a dish drops to the floor
frank still dancing makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between rachel and the noise
his head turns to locate the source of the noise
dont worry ill protect you
they drift back into the music rachel singing frank watching
franks car is parked in the driveway
a light goes on in a basement window
frank hangs back drink in hand as rachel explores the basement
frank has fitted it out as a combination gym target range weapons workshop
the place has a kind of unfussy order about it a simplicity
almost to herself its very quiet here
she walks to some shelves a random selection of books football and karate trophies framed citations and other memorabilia
she glances at a dusty framed photo of a football team
reading west virginia university football
god look at you
she looks at frank quizzically
whatd you play
were you tough
rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall
she looks at it peering closely
you some kind of a samurai too
they said you were in the secret service
what made you get out
frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall
rachel looks around at franks modest home
i can see your tastes are extravagant
she looks at frank and then back at the sword
she reaches out to touch it
rachel takes it off its mount carefully unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off
rachel slides the scabbard off
the naked blade is breathtaking
rachel holds the sword out before her
she walks toward frank then stops and looks over the blade at him
youre a hard one to figure frank farmer
he stares at her
she steps closer so the blade is only about a foot from his face
it seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace
frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest
he reaches out over the blade to rachels neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there
one hand draws the scarf away
the other hand lingers for a moment on her neck then lifts away
he has raised the scarf over his head in the space between them
with two hands he spreads it out and then lets it go
slowly billowing the scarf floats down over the blade and is cut in two
these two pieces float slowly to the floor
frank takes rachels wrist and moves the sword away to the side
they are both holding it as rachel presses her body against franks and they begin to kiss
their lovemaking is intercut with slow motion black and white images of samurai warriors from the movie yojimbo
they lie nude under a sheet
ive never been this safe before
no one could get by you
right now it might not be so hard
rachel laughs kisses him and buries her head down into his shoulder
frank stares across the bed at the samurai sword lying on the floor
some of rachels clothing is draped in a heap across it
the torn pieces of her scarf lie nearby
hold on franks look
the roller blind is raised with a sharp snapping sound
frank is moving around the room getting dressed
is still in the bed behind him woken by the noise of his activity
what is it
what are you doing
frank keeps moving looking for his shoes
rachel i dont want to get confused about what im doing here
im not confused
frank finds his shoes
you pay me to protect you thats what i do
rachel sits up
have i done something wrong
then what is it
she lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it
do you want me to beg
no i want you to do without
whats going on frank
i want to keep it straight in my head what job im doing
and what is that exactly
making me feel like shit
no im sorry
this is my fault
dont apologize for godsake
just tell me what i did
im a big girl
you didnt do anything
it was me
i involved myself with my client
rachel picks up on the word
i made a mistake
you dont find me attractive anymore
ive told you why
i cant protect you like this
thats it for me
i dont believe it
he automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the holster
you can live with that or you can fire me
but i cant fuck you
frank turns and looks at her
this is hard for him too
i dont believe this
im asking you
let me tell you
she stops suddenly and with a roar of combined frus tration humiliation and rage she lurches from the bed in search of her clothes
frank shuts his eyes in morti fication and pain
a nanny sits in the early morning mist embroidering
frank is kneeling with fletcher beside the pool
hes putting new batteries into fletchers boat
fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the batteries much preoccupied
watching him shes real mad at you isnt she
frank stops what hes doing and just looks blankly at the batteries in his hands
theres a beat of silence
she told me she doesnt understand why youre so shitty to her
franks shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible sigh
he gently resumes fitting the batteries still not looking at fletcher
in the quiet of early morning its almost like a confessional
ive spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do
its my job
but it doesnt always work fletcher
it doesnt always work
i dont think i understand
looks at him im an old man compared to you pal and i dont understand either
and im starting to get the feeling i never will
theres a crunch of footsteps behind him
he looks around
with a big flourish a copy of daily variety is put down in front of us front page upwards
frank takes in that its nicki then glances at variety lying on the concrete beside him
splashed across the top the headlines announce the days news of the academy award nominations
rachels name is among the best actress nominees
the hollywood reporter follows
frank picks up variety and stares at it
nicki stands beside him with the mornings mail under her arm
looking at him thought youd like to know
everyone said she was a sure thing
of course you know all about that
she raises an eyebrow gives him a look
frank looks steadily back at her
she drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines
several letters and a small packet
shes embarrassed by franks gaze
that was out of line
its none of my business
heres todays question marks for you
she turns and walks briskly back to the house
frank watches her go then looks slowly down to the pile
from across the pool fletcher watches silently then pushes his boat out into the deep water
frank is investigating the small packet with a surgeons precision checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector sniffing at it
it has been addressed in the normal way except that rachels name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address
he begins carefully slicing away the wrapping
inside is a cardboard box
the contents are still hidden by packing paper
he picks it away with tweezers
suddenly there is a loud buzzing from the box and movement in the paper
frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags
the movement slows and stops
frank extracts the item it is a wind up mechanical beaver with a hand painted sign hung around its neck the beavers teeth click in franks hand
we see franks face
this may just have taken years off his life
he holds his hand out straight palm downwards
and looks at it
spectors voice suddenly shouts from the next door office
get in here
the office is filled with congratulatory balloons and flowers heralding the mornings news
spectors secretary is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the b
two assistants are struggling in through the door with a large basketed floral arrangement
spector confronts frank across his desk
put together a list of your expenses
your total billing
let me have it in one hour and ill see that a check is cut
dont you ever say whats on your mind
spector cannot believe hes being so addressed especially in front the staff
the assistants stop in their tracks and look
almost shouts whats on my mind is that youre fired frank
she missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date
do you realize she stood up barbara walters
first you fuck up her career
behind spector out of his line of sight rachel and devaney appear in the doorway with more cards
they also stop and listen
and now youre fucking with her head
thats between us
you think so
you forget who signs your check
you dont understand the role i play around here
spector stiffens then decides not to take this one on
get your shit together and be out of here by noon
spector looks round sees that devaney and rachel have been listening
rachel is silent
with a curt nod of his head spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room
devaney weighs in
with this high a profile rachel needs protection now more than ever
if he goes you can forget miami
shes signed the fucking contract bill
you want me to read it to you
rachel is watching them both
fuck the contract
if he goes shes not singing a note
its too dangerous
fuck the contract
why dont you let rachel speak for herself
i think she has some say in this
flatly frank stays
spector considers her for a beat then looks at the others
the secretary interrupts from the back of the office
schiller calling on line one
spector ignores her still holding his look at devaney rachel and frank
well i guess this is democracy in action
spector turning to take the call flashes her a little boy look
i gave in
thats not easy for me
dont i get a hug
rachel is stone faced
spector covers by picking up the phone
into phone yeah
sure put him on
ben how are you
frank and rachel look at each other in silence
what the hell are you trying to pull ben
rachel always gets the presidential
i dont care what you thought
devaney leans to frank as spectors conversation continues in the b
do you know the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach
how does the ambassador suite compare to the presidential for us
frank thinks only for a moment
its on the twentieth floor in the south wing
theres a service elevator right there
mainly ocean windows
should be no problem
into phone im aware of that ben but let me just remind you people that you invited us
frank turns toward the door
to frank hang around farmer
we might need your vaunted expertise
she reaches forward and hits a button on spectors desk throwing the call onto a speaker
sweetly hello ben honey
rachel congratulations you must be thrilled at the
across him ben
i hear youve got me in the annex next to the kitchen
we come streaking in over the ocean toward the towering white fontainebleau
on the soundtrack we hear john teshs voice filling the viewers in on the latest hollywood dirt
its off to sun city today for best actress nominee rachel marron
rachels giving two aids charity concerts this week at miamis fontainebleau hotel
a thousand a plate no less
and rumor has it that the lovely lady has unseated the governor of florida himself
seems there was a showdown on wholl get to lounge in that big fontainebleau penthouse tonight
as we circle the top floor we see a tiny figure on the balcony
well sleep tight in the presidential suite rachel
who says a nomination isnt as good as winning
frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down
over the edge and around the corner
he leans slightly against the wrought iron railing
it sways precariously
frank catches himself
frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to the cement balcony the cement crumbles around it a weld joint is broken on the side
thuringer the hotel security chief joins frank on the balcony
frank shakes the railing
ill get someone right on it
frank walks quickly across the living room of the lavish suite
two uniformed security guards are making a sweep of the room with police dogs
frank checks the drawer of a side table and then seals it with a peel off security tape
thuringer is waiting near the entrance hall
frank nods to him
this is a semi private corridor several hotel employees are steam cleaning the carpet
frank looks at them then thuringer
its okay theyve been cleared
he shows his clipboard to frank
as the two men walk along the corridor the guest elevator opens and a twelve year old boy in a bathing suit mark katz steps out accompanied by his nanny
in the background hotel security men are checking fire extinguishers and closets
to frank the katzes of st
come every year
an elderly couple and three grandchildren
a nurse and a maid
they pass the little boy as he reaches the door of the katz suite with his nanny
frank smiles and nods to the nanny
to frank theirs is the only suite on the floor
the two men reach the service elevator and the emergency exit door at the end of the hall
frank opens the stair way door and goes inside
as you asked the rooms below have been kept vacant
the doorway closes behind the two men
frank tries it its locked
they continue down the stairs
frank and thuringer walk into and along the edge of the busy kitchen
frank walks ahead of thuringer
he looks around and pauses at the edge of the stage
then he steps out on a stage
a piano tuner is at work in the corner
as he looks out at the mammoth room
frank stands center stage and looks around
the naked ess of this spot gets to him
he shakes his head and looks at thuringer
what a silly job this is
behind the glass doors that lead to the pool bright quartz lights clock on
a camera crew stands waiting
someone mimes a were rolling sign with his hands
inside rachel waits with spector and ben schiller the tough fat fellow who owns the place
frank is at her elbow
is this really necessary
quit bitching farmer
this is the part you do get paid for
rachel sweeps out the door
the camera crew hurries to keep up with her
this place is crowded with hundreds of guests basking on chaise lounges
a sea of sun baked faces virtually as far as the eye can see
the sight of the crowd and the presence of the news crew seems to push rachel to a whole new adrenaline level
rachel walks among them moving swiftly evaluating the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions playing to the camera
oh my god
look what theyre wearing
mother hide your eyes
heads turn to look
i couldnt wear that suit
honey youre naked
of course if i had a body like that
there is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests
she pauses to shake a hand and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that rachel marron is among them
people stand on chairs scramble for pens and paper run
to get a closer look
lounges collapse drink glasses are broken flower tubs are trampled
a lot of pushing and shoving starts too much for the video crew who abandon the filming attempt
they got what they needed
lets get back inside
frank increases his pace to keep by rachels side gently easing a path for her
schiller scurries behind in franks wake
rachel turns suddenly as a tall good looking lifeguard appears in the throng
she eyes him appreciatively
to lifeguard you look like a man of good taste to me
come to my party tonight
to schiller ben make sure this boy gets to my party
rachel glances at frank making sure he gets the point and then shes off again
the throng gets tighter
franks having to work harder steering her towards the door back into the hotel
the familiar chant starts up rachel rachel
its starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene
this time amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward
a child starts crying lost in the mess of legs and bermuda shorts
a distraught mother tries to reach him
someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again
amid the chaos whistles and scattered applause
rachel drinks it all in
over her shoulder thank you
come tonight and give till it hurts
with a final surge frank makes it to the door with his party
the door closes shut behind them
a mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass
the party walks on briskly
to spector im beginning to wonder about your judgement sy
why do i have to keep paying my dues if ive already arrived
very fast kick me beat me
whatever makes you feel good
but lets not pretend you dont like it
were too close for that
whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place
rachels eyes lock with spectors theres a real connec tion and understanding here that she spends a lot of time denying
frank sees it as clearly as spector whose tone becomes almost soothing and its nothing to be ashamed of either not for a second
its a gift
and only a handful are given it
many call but few are answered
dont fool with the blessing rachel
the magic is sustained through its use
now youre going to tell me about magic
give it a rest will ya
not another word
a crooked smile i know you like to be reminded sometimes
rachel looks away
hes good at his job
in the spotlight all alone rachel marron works her magic
she sings as it was meant to be sung i have nothing
one person does not look at rachel
he stands in a corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows
his eyes continually scanning
picking up every movement
fireworks explode over the water
in the living room the first night party is in full swing
fireworks burst outside the windows
a mixed bag of upscale partygoers women in party dresses men in open shirts etc
a black pianist is playing
two bars at either end of the room
waiters work the room with platters of canapes
tony sits in a chair watching tv a drink in his hand oblivious to all
the lifeguard shuts rachels door be hind him and makes his way down to the party
he pauses at the head of the stairs checking out the party and grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
frank catches the movement the two men briefly lock eyes
the lifeguard responds with a knowing smile
thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all guests are passing
as they get off the elevator they walk up to a desk manned by one of thuringers uniformed guards
when their names have been checked off a master list they walk past another guard wielding a metal detector
no one likes it but they all do it
most of the local tv stations have sent camera crews
the handheld cameras move among the guests their bright lights flaring
its a local media event
frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face
a tall fit athletic looking man raises his arms is cleared by the metal detector
he is greg portman
portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar
his eyes scan the suite
his gaze settles on frank checking out the people who filter in
portman appears next to frank
buy you a drink
its been awhile
you on the job
nods technically im off duty but the governor may show up here later so i thought id give it a light check
smiles someone else is covering him right now
how old is she
rachel makes her entrance and poses self mocking on the landing above the crowd accepting applause
she has succeeded in under dressing everyone in the room
she is a star
frank nods in her direction
thats his client
impressed no kidding
id call that a step up from the president
probably sings better too
youre so right
i want everyone to have a good time and drink as much of ben schillers liquor as you like
rachel descends into the crowd laughing and blowing kisses
franks look says if you only knew the half of it
i heard you had to take someone out in new york
i lost track of you after the reagan thing
it wasnt your fault farmer
you werent even there
i got a call a couple of months ago
that guy you were covering in new york
he said youd recommended me
smiles i never doubted your skills
laughs good natured no
only my qualifications for the priesthood
you were always clear about that
anyway i appreciate it
i had to turn it down but i appreciate it
portman notices rachel looking at him as she makes her way to them
rachel takes franks orange juice and sips
makes a very funny face
thats orange juice
rachel gives portman an approving once over
who are you
i take it youve met my bodyguard
we used to work together
suddenly more interested ah
well well well
and what do you do now
same thing as farmer
looking between them two samurai eh
frank and portman eye each other
to portman are you working now
not right now
she takes his arm cause im the only one in the room who needs protection
she gives frank a look and leads portman into the crowd
rachels taking a breather on the balcony drinking cham pagne talking to portman and another couple
everybodys high and happy
rachel leans into portman heads together they whisper intimately
rachel laughs then for a brief moment turns her head to look directly at frank
her look is petulant defiant
portman does not see this
tony helps himself to a handful of canapes he turns at the sound of a commotion out on the balcony
someones horsing around spraying champagne from a bottle over everyone
a woman screams
frank bolts for the balcony
rachel and portman are poised precariously halfway over the railing
franks hand shoots out grabs rachels wrist and tugs at the pair of them
portman regains his balance first and pulls rachel back from the edge
looking at portman thank god i had a bodyguard here
she grasps the railing and looks over
staring down twenty stories of distance between her and the pool area
way way below her her champagne glass hits the tile with a muffled shattering sound
its a long way down frank
to portman you saved my life
frank eyes the newly welded anchor fixture
it has held
rachel takes portman by the arm
the front of her dress is stained with champagne
maybe someone will keep an eye on me while i change
she leads portman past frank and up the stairs toward her bedroom
frank and portman lock eyes
portman shrugs he feels badly for frank
frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass
he looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees rachel and portman in the hall outside her bedroom
she turns her head to look directly at franks reflected face
assured that frank is watching she takes portmans hand and leads him into her room
frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it with orange juice
a stunning woman in green glides down the bar and stands very close to frank
ive been watching you all night from across the room
why dont you go back there and keep watching
frank looks at rachels doorway sipping his juice
rachel and portman are kissing with some heat
portmans hands are starting to explore her body
frank still looks at rachels doorway thinking
after a moment he walks across the room to the sliding doors that lead to the balcony outside
frank steps outside
no one there
the moonlight re flects off the ocean
the surf sounds a steady beat
it is peaceful and quiet
on the katzs balcony forty feet away little mark katz is leaning against the railing staring at rachels suite
frank smiles at him
softly go to sleep
frank looks out at the ocean
after a pause in the background mark slips inside the katz suite
rachel and portman are still locked in the clinch
realizing what shes doing rachel suddenly pulls back
im not doing this
still holding her i think you are
she steps out of his embrace
i said i was grateful
thank you and good night
she looks to the door that leads back to the party
the sounds of celebration continue outside
she starts to cross to the door
cool please go now
portman moves toward her as she opens the door reaching for her arm
then he sees through the doorway tony standing in the hall talking to a woman
tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both
rachel slips quickly out of portmans grip
portman was just leaving us tony
portman hesitates then smiles at rachel and tony and with a quick peck on rachels cheek slips past them back to the party
rachel briefly scans the party crowd over tonys shoulder but she doesnt see frank
the door closes leaving her alone in the room again
she reaches for a bottle of scotch and raises it to her mouth drinking straight from the bottle
frank looks out at the ocean
echoing on the soundtrack we hear the song what becomes of the broken hearted that rachel and frank danced to
it sounds slow and sweet and a long way away
frank stares out at the ocean
totally divorced from everything in the suite behind him in the world around him
there is only the moon and the ocean
one moment his guard is down
a chambermaid is hoovering the floor
rachel steps out of her bedroom
she looks terrible
hungover she is wearing sunglasses and a loose smock
it is noon of the following day
frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich
behind him in the dining room a cuban maid has set a place with breakfast
she is pouring orange juice as rachel walks in
rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had been a terrible effort
she looks at the breakfast with distaste and picks up the coffee
frank continues to eat
rachel looks at him
nasty what the hell are you looking at
pause you probably never had a heavy night in your whole goddamn disciplined life
frank looks at her continues to eat
you know farmer youre a self righteous son of a bitch
frank has to smile at this which makes rachel even angrier
dont laugh at me goddamit
and dont you dare judge me
give me a break will ya
i didnt tell you to fuck everybody in the hotel
special agents court and minella are watching the general manager of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge canister marked industrial detergent
the general manager lifts the lid to reveal white powder
he talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse
court listens nodding
minella spoons some of the powder into a plastic bag and seals it
over this we hear courts voice filtered as on a telephone line
it matches the traces in the glue frank
were getting to him
were gonna nail this fucker
frank is on the courtesy phone
yeah well dont take too long ray
its good money isnt it
frank hangs up
the elevator door opens and frank steps out
he walks toward the entrance to the suite and is immediately alarmed by what he sees there is no uniformed guard by the front door
he unlocks the door and goes inside
frank comes in and looks around quickly
looking over living room hallways balcony
no one in sight
devaney comes out of rachels bedroom a panicked look on his face
they face each other across the gulf of the living room
where is she
i dont know
i thought you were with her
frank is at the telephone he punches out three numbers
into phone thuringer this is farmer
wheres your man on the door to the suite
listens well get someone up here
frank hangs up the phone looks at devaney
he doesnt know
they look at each other worried
frank walks out onto the balcony looks round and down comes back in
he heads for the front door
where are you going
frank is almost at the door
we hear laughter
a key turns in the lock
rachel and tony come through the door in high spirits their arms full of shopping bags and packages
frank stops dead and watches
rachel glances at him and goes into the living room
tony looks at him meaning fully and follows
frank reflects for a moment then pulls the front door closed oh so gently
rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar pours herself a drink
tony takes some packages to rachels bedroom
rachel where the hell have you been
tony and i went over to bal harbour
did a little shopping
tony comes back a smile playing across his lips
frank watches near the entrance
we were worried
looks at frank talks to rachel you know youre not supposed to do that
frank and rachel look at each other
farmer you work here
do you understand that
you work for me
frank turns and heads for the door
devaney looks at him anxiously
farmer where are you going
im gonna check the route
he opens the front door
a uniformed guard is standing outside
frank goes out and closes the door
did fletcher call
devaney staring after frank shakes his head no
franks face shows the tension and the anger
the ele vator descends
frank walks along the edge of the kitchen looks over the workers
a kitchen worker is in franks path
he looks up sees franks face and scurries out of his way
frank walks along checking the corridor
at each door way he stops looks inside
one room is dark
he flicks on the light
near the door is a pile of wooden crates placed unnaturally out from the wall
frank walks over and looks inside
they are discarded vegetable crates
frank goes back to the door and yells toward the kitchen
he waits impatiently
no one comes
two quick steps and he is back at the crates throwing them violently into the corner where they clatter loudly to the floor
frank walks on along the corridor
he stops noticing something around the side
an enormous cuban is sitting on some boxes in the shadows
he doesnt bat an eye when he sees frank
what are you doing
is none of you fuckin business
the enormous cuban gets slowly up from the boxes
he towers over frank
shove it up you ass motherfucker
frank has had enough for one afternoon
he hits the cuban low and hard
the man crumples forward hurt but manages to enfold frank in an awesome bear hug
his weight carries them backward in franks direction
the cuban continues moving in that direction but frank is no longer in his grasp
instead incredibly frank seems to have passed through the mans body and flicked him into the corner of the stairwell
the cuban hits the wall hard
jarred but not lost he comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a baseball bat
frank steps in and under the mans long arms and hits him four times around the chest and jaw
each of franks hands lands twice their movement is barely visible
the solid thudding tells the story
frank strikes both
the cubans ears simultaneously with cupped hands
the cuban goes down stunned
frank his expression fierce is upon him immediately
franks arms entwine the cubans and he begins to lift him roughly
at the end of the corridor a woman screams
dont hurt him
frank looks up
a hotel cleaning woman carrying her purse is running towards them tears already on her face
dont hurt my husband mister
he not up to nothing
frank lets the cuban down gently and stands up
dis gusted with himself
breathing hard he leans back against the wall
the cleaning woman falls to her knees and hugs her husband protectively
frank steps away rubs a hand through his hair tries to collect himself
hes standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes
he looks up and sees a marquee
rachel is seated at her dressing table applying her makeup for the evenings performance
the telephone rings as she begins to work on her hair
baby is that you
its mommy honey
eerily distorted guess again whore
fuck you and fuck miami
im coming for you
i know where you are and im coming for you
rachel is paralyzed by fear unable to hang up the phone
frank comes in the front door
hes had it
devaney who has been sitting alone in the living room stubs out a cigarette and stands to meet him
frank doesnt pause
ill get you back to l
and thats it
the guy with fletcher can cover you till you get a replacement
she got another call while you were downstairs and she answered it herself
it was him frank
moving toward balcony i dont care
farmer it really shook her up
she thought it was going to be fletcher calling her from l
i think shell be reasonable now
across him save it devaney
the people who hire me dont have to be convinced to save their own lives
frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony
call me when shes ready to go down
farmer frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed behind him
frank looks out at the ocean
the breeze washes over his face
a huge brightly lit yacht is sailing by close to shore
frank looks at it reflectively
he senses another presence and looks to his right
rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair
the bright moon light illuminates her as she looks out to sea
she is wearing one of her spectacular show gowns her hair has been brushed and her stage makeup has been applied
but tonight it hasnt come together
it doesnt work
she holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing
this is the only time weve seen her smoke
nothing thats happened between us matters
i understand now
youre going to have to believe me because im not going to beg
she takes a long drag on her cigarette
it wasnt what he said
it was the way he said it
he was so
her voice cracks
she stops and tries to compose herself
i need you
and i hate it
i hate my fear
a beat please protect me
if anything happened to him
frank looks at her
tears are destroying her elaborate stage makeup
she wipes them away with her hand
i cant protect you like this
the odds are on his side
ill do whatever you say
this is the first time frank has ever heard rachel say that
he studies her then looks out at the ocean
i want to take you away for a while
somewhere people dont know about
she nods again agreeing
no spector or devaney or tony
he looks at her reading her face for any hesitation
there is none
if you cross me up this time ill kill you myself
rachel smiles weakly but with obvious relief
a large old two story house sits at the top of a slight rise surrounded on three sides by thick rolling woods
sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards away is a broad expanse of lawn
snow lies on the ground and in the trees
at the edge of the lake a dock and boathouse
an entrance road cuts out of the trees
a little terrier skitters to the edge of the drive a van emerges from the trees tires crunching through the snow
franks father herb steps onto the front porch
hes in his mid s lean tan and fit
hes wearing a plaid shirt jeans and cowboy boots
the van stops in front of the house
frank steps out from the drivers seat and eyes his dad
lakes a little low
fill up soon enough when she thaws
glancing at the van they all in trouble
herb squats on the floor with fletcher
together they are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier
fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face
henry brings the remaining luggage through
rachel and nicki stand with frank near the archway
all eyes are on
fletcher herb and the dog
rachel eyes the dog skeptically
thats going to protect us
hes a trained noisemaker
i dont like big dogs
they dont know who theyre eating
herb stands beside a butcher block cutting vegetables for the evening meal with a practiced hand
rachel watches drink in hand looking around the kitchen
it has been neatly organized
katherine had this place organized just the way she wanted it
seeing her questioning look franks momma
theres the cough and sputter of an outboard motor from outside
rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees fletcher and frank in the small skiff by the dock
fletcher tugs again on the starter cord
at the third tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat
fletcher doesnt swim well
i guess hed better stay in the boat then
his smile puts her at ease frank tells me youre a singer
im afraid were a little out of touch here
rachel waves this off
you must be very successful to need frank
rachel smiles and looks out of the window
its so quiet here
frank came back and stayed six months after the reagan thing
rachels questioning look encourages herb
frank wasnt there the day he was shot
he never got over that
a long pause we buried katherine that day
rachel looks out again at frank and fletcher in the boat
fletcher rachel and frank are chugging across the golden water in the skiff
fletcher sits at the back operating the outboard controlling the movements of the boat
he wears a life vest
rachel watches him proudly
fletcher locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it for a laughing moment with a look mom no hands gesture
rachel looks to frank and smiles the wind blowing her hair
camera is down at water level by the lakes edge
in the distance the small boat skims across the surface
a light mist is coming up
henry helps fletcher tie up the boat for the night
it is much foggier now and almost dark
i dont want anyone going out in it until youve checked it over first
in the distance rachel and fletcher have just reached the house where nicki scoops up fletcher and spins him round and round in a circle
she hugs him close and kisses his hair
after a few moments fletcher squirms free and runs to catch up with rachel
rachel munching on a raw carrot browses a row of family photographs
the sounds of dinner being prepared come from the kitchen
we see the history of the family in the pictures frank as a ten year old baseball player with a younger herb herb as police chief of bend oregon being
given a civic award frank as a college football wide receiver herb and katherine farmer all dressed up and being introduced to jimmy carter by frank the picture perfect family home in oregon with katherine tending flowers
rachel notices a photo of a smiling henry kissinger talking to some female reporters
there standing shoulder to shoulder with him are frank and portman
portmans also smiling at the women flirting
frank is in a familiar pose alert unsmiling vigilant
rachel looks at the two of them for a second
frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a drink for rachel in his hand
he watches her for a moment as she studies the photo
she turns and sees him
they lock eyes for several seconds
she smiles as he hands her the drink
inclining his head toward the photo portman sometimes had trouble remembering what his job was
we can see from rachels face that she feels embarrassed about her behavior in miami
the meal has been enthusiastically consumed
fletchers manhandling a chicken leg his face covered with crumbs and drippings
rachel shakes her head laughing
and i never hit him
to this day
to frank thats true isnt it
to rachel thats very unusual for my people
so what happens
when hes ten years old he complains about it
can you believe that
oh for chrissake
im going to tell her about the time you stripped in court
frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen
to frank i dont care
im proud of that
to rachel anyway hes ten years old and hes just started playing tackle football
he comes to me and tells me hes afraid of getting hit right
and he thinks its because i never hit him
why dont you ever hit me
he says to me
frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen
back over his shoulder if youre lucky maybe hell tell you about my first jockstrap
as he speaks he peers out through the window at the lake
we hear herbs voice continue from the other room
he got over it turned into a helluva wide receiver
he couldnt stand being afraid
when he found something that scared him hed just do it til the fear went away
his mother was the same way
rachel smiles at him thinking then looks through at frank in the kitchen still peering out of the windows
nicki watches rachel
herb delicately lifts a chessboard from the top of a cabinet and walks it over to the table a half finished game
he leans over and blows on the pieces sending a small cloud of dust into the air
come on son you can run but you cant hide
herb pulls up a chair and smiles as frank appears from the kitchen a bowl of popcorn in his hand
frank takes a place across from his dad by the fire
the others gather round
frank studies the board
rachel lowers her head into a cupped hand fascinated
how long has this game been going on
frank picks up a knight thinks sets it back down
nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it beside fletcher
fletcher peers intently at the board as he chews on a handful
he had me on the run there that first year
frank picks up his rook scratches his forehead with it
he turns to fletcher
what do you think
fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn wipes his mouth
knight to king four
frank herbert and rachel turn in synch and stare at the boy
herb pats his leg gesturing to fletcher to take a place on his lap
come over here fletcher sit by me
fletcher goes over and joins him
well thats it for me im going to bed
frank follows her up the stairs
nicki watches them go
frank stops at the end of the hallway checking the lock on the window the little terrier is at his heels
rachel pauses outside the door
frank gestures for the dog to stay
the dog sits in the middle of the hallway looking from one to the other
for a few seconds neither speaks
good night rachel
rachel accepts this
she smiles in return and touches him on the arm very tenderly
good night frank
rachel turns goes to her room and closes the door
details are barely distinguishable in the fog
we hear the gentle lapping of the lakewater against the dock
fletcher is asleep snuggled on herbs lap by the fire
herb is also asleep
frank fetches a blanket and gently
covers them both
he puts out the light
frank steps quietly into the hall
nicki is standing in the shadows
she watches as frank goes through the ritual of locking the front door several ways
softly youre very thorough
frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first floor checking windows and doors
nicki tags along
whats happening between you and rachel
frank glances at her
one minute shes got magnetic hands the next she hates you
i cant figure out what it is now
you follow all her moves this closely
smiling its a living
no it isnt
he moves away into the next room
she hesitates a moment then follows
you think my life is pretty sickly dont you
frank steps into a tight dark little window alcove checks the windows
why dont you change it
is it that easy
frank turns from the window to find nicki blocking his exit
she moves close to him and kisses him her hands on his shoulders
the kiss ends and they look at each other
youre a lovely woman
but you dont want me
franks look affirms it
nicki is embarrassed angry
thorough fellow like you
why stop at one sister when you can fuck them both
i make my mistakes
but you didnt say no to the boss
she starts to turn away from him but his hands are on her now holding her close refusing to let her turn away
their faces are very close
it is tight and near here
with force no dont go away nicki
dont leave me with that
tell me about it
tell me how long youve been second
tell me how she has a child and you dont
tell me something
but dont turn away and try to stick it on me
nicki twists in his grip
he holds her tight
i dont need this from you
maybe i need it
im fed up with people telling me they have no control over their lives
if you hate your life so much turn it around
its not so simple
yes it is
you can walk out that fucking door anytime you want
ill unlock it for you
nicki looks up into his face
tears start in her eyes
let me go
he releases her looks at her
its not my business
he moves away out of frame
we hold on nicki a long time
frank and his father walk along the lake shoreline stooping here and there to finger animal prints in the snow and mud
their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house
nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by the porch
ive never heard church music in the middle of the week before
nickis soft voice is joined by rachels strong harmony and the two men watch as rachel comes out to join her sister on the porch startling nicki
both sing for a moment together
then nicki stops embarrassed
rachel gives her a hug
herb and frank are about to return to the house
they stop short
there at their feet is a line of human foot prints from heavy snow boots leading away into the trees
frank looks at herb suddenly alert
henry appears at the porch of the house carrying a fishing rod as he comes out
at that instant the sound of the outboard motor crackles through the air
franks head snaps toward the boathouse
henry in the distance looks quickly at the boathouse then to frank
but frank is already moving leaping from the porch and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse and dock
rachel turns to look
the skiff appears out of the boathouse fletcher at the motor the boats lone occupant
the boat moves slowly away from the boathouse parallel to the dock
frank is running toward the water with everything hes got his face contorted
the sound of the outboard drowns out his voice as he yells
fletcher intent on his piloting neither hears nor sees frank running down the lawn behind him
the boat is approaching the end of the dock
frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to sprint after the boat
his weight rattles the boards as he runs
fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the throttle a little twist
frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives directly at the rear of the moving boat
franks body flies out over the boat
he knocks fletcher out of his seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff
he cant swim
frank holds the terrified shaking fletcher in his arms
fletcher begins to cry
frank paddles with him toward the dock
the empty boat swerves then continues out toward the center of the lake
henry and rachel are already at the end of the dock
nicki and herb are running toward it
rachel is livid hysterical
henry peers out at the boat which continues to bounce innocently across the water defining a broad curve
are you all right
fletcher spluttering is handed up to rachel by frank
rachel hugs fletcher to her
herb bends down to check hes breathing properly wrapping the boy in his jacket
hes all right
henry helps frank up out of the water
frank sits on the end of the dock breathing hard
what are you doing
you out of your mind
to fletcher youre all right baby
back to frank you could have drowned him
frank and henry look out toward the boat which has come to a stop out in the middle of the lake
i got careless
henry looks at frank
he feels terrible about not checking the boat
frank im sorry
i should have
its okay henry
herb puts his hand on fletchers head
you all right now son
fletcher nods his crying ends raggedly
frank begins to stand up
how do we get the boat back
out in the center of the lake the boat blows up
every one on the dock jumps
frank sits down again
he shakes his head
on an impulse he stretches out his hand palm downward
its trembling slightly
rachel and nicki hurriedly pack their bags
fletcher hovers nearby
frank slides out from under the van
the hood is up
henry stands nearby
frank goes to the drivers seat
to henry back off
henry moves away from the van
frank inserts the key in the ignition
herb comes out of the house fast
his eyes scan the woods as he heads towards the shed
henry turns and motions to herb to stay away
frank takes a moment then turns the key
the van is dead
henry and herb watch
frank gets out of the van
he walks to herb
someones cut the phone lines
it could be anywhere between here and town
both the cars are dead
and i cant see how it was done
frank and herb exchange a look
who could know were here
this place has nothing to do with her
maybe it has to do with you
frank looks at him
we cant walk out of here at night with them
frank shakes his head
well button down tonight and walk out at first light
there is a light ground mist
the moon shines down down brightly but the house is totally dark
the terrier dog listens in the upstairs hallway
herb watches from an upstairs window
rachel lies in bed clutching fletcher tightly
frank has been sitting in a chair in the center of the living room for two hours
now we listen
at first it seems silent but slowly we become aware of a subtle symphony of sounds
an old house sur rounded by woods
there are lots of noises
but they are regular innocent
frank is aware of a new noise a gentle sobbing coming from nearby
he picks up his gun from the table beside him and goes into the kitchen
nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen table sobbing
theres a nearly empty bottle beside her
frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign
crying i was an idiot last night
there is a long pause
what do you think about today
gently i think this is no maniac
he knows what hes doing
there is a long long silence
nicki continues crying
finally youre right
tell me about it
she doesnt reply
who is it nicki
he almost got fletcher today
how do we stop him
my darling fletcher
who is it
i dont know
i dont know
frank goes to her treats her gently like a doctor
you can call him off
shaking her head he doesnt even know who hired him
he doesnt know who i am and i dont know who he is
howd you do it
she seems on the edge of hysteria
frank takes her face in his hands strokes her hair brings her back from the brink
i went to a bar in east l
i asked around
i talked to a man
he arranged it
thats all i know
is it all paid for
nods and then some
till its done
he keeps going until he kills her
nicki nods again lowering her face into her hands
whats the name of the bar
im not sure
i was very stoned
how bout the letters
desperately no no
you dont understand
the letters came first
i dont know whos sending them
but theyre reading my mind
those were my thoughts
i hate her
it made me think i could do it
but i could never hurt fletcher
begging him youve got to stop it
you and me
tomorrow were going back to l
were going to find the bar were going to find armando
he starts to rise
she stops him
dont you even want to know why
you told me
she has everything
frank stands up and begins to move across the room
nicki puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment
suddenly frank freezes listening
what if we cant frank motions her into silence
we strain to hear what frank hears
silently frank goes to the door crouch ing
there again is a distant growl from the dog upstairs
frank lifts his gun from the table turns to nicki
nickis face shows true terror
frank is out the door
frank runs up them fast
two at a time
frank travels close to the wall very quickly
he stops listens
the terrier looks at frank but still growls
frank throws open rachels door
rachel gasps in surprise and clutches at fletcher
frank hears a noise behind him whirls round him and drops to a knee weapon ready to fire
its herb stepping out of his room carrying a police issue pistol
rachels voice comes from her room
the terrier suddenly starts barking loudly
were in someones pov moving along the hallway
nicki steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in terror toward the camera
im the one who
frank and herb spin around
rachel calls from her room
a gunshot blasts nicki against the wall her hand still delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint
franks head spins to rachels doorway then immediately back to herb
he starts to move towards the stairs fast
to herb stay with rachel
henrys head appears round the doorway of herbs room
frank is rapidly down the stairs gun in hand
frank finds nickis body slumped against the wall
he checks her
the door beyond is open
the wind blows in
outside its foggy
stay with rachel
the dog continues to bark upstairs
frank sees a slight movement outside and window to his right
a split second moment of decision
he heads off rapidly down the hall away from the open door
the fog is thick
frank swiftly emerges from the back door and stops dead still listening
there is only the rustling of trees
herb is by rachels bed
suddenly he hears running footsteps a body breaking through the bushes
frank heads off towards the sound at a run
the move fitfully through the eerie beautiful scene
in and out of the fog
stop listen wait go
two wary interchangeable animals
frank disappears into the fog
when the figure reappears frank is moving faster closing the gap
the figure seen in closeup for the first time is wear ing a dark colored ski mask
his breath billows out of the mouth hole whitening in the cool march air
he hears frank approaching and points his gun in the direction of the footsteps
he does not fire
frank stops and rests on his haunches
listening he hears the intruder move
the sounds have stopped up ahead
the figure peers into the fog gun up
hes ready confident
frank from his crouch does something brand new
he raises his gun into the fog in a two handed grip ready to fire
he holds it easily
and then he does something really strange frank closes his eyes
after a beat we hear movement
frank eyes still closed swings his gun degrees and fires two blasts
the man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder
his eyes are wild behind his ski mask
frightened he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction
there is another shot from frank very close to the man
herb is at the window
there is anguish on his face as he hears the shots
he wants to go to his sons aid but knows he cannot leave rachel
rachel and fletcher are huddled in the bed terrified
fletcher clutches at the dog which is still barking
henry stands by the bed gun in hand
frank moves quickly through the woods passes the splintered tree
we stay with him and hear the engine of a car roar to life and tires peel out of the dirt
frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a bend
he empties his gun at it
we hear glass shattering but the car keeps going
snow is falling
in the b
we see the flashing lights of a police car
frank is on the phone to minella
but frank this doesnt make sense
what do you mean
we already got him
minella is talking with frank on the phone
hes looking into an observation room through a one way window
here last night
you should see his locker frank
the guys obsessed with rachel marron
youre sure its him
forensics say its percent positive i
and hes got a black toyota x
rays with him now
sitting in the observation room at a table talking to ray court is dan
he looks frightened and confused
well whoever you got down there wasnt here last night
this was a professional
this is crazy
what do you want to do frank
how long can you keep him
well technically all hes done is write some letters
you know the deal
rachels black limousine moves slowly up the winding drive followed by a black mercedes limousine
behind the cars the gates close on a large press contingent gathered outside held back by a large number of police and security guards
a light drizzle is falling
the two cars pull up to the entrance henry at the wheel of rachels
frank gets out of the front and opens the back door
devaney and spector help rachel and fletcher out of the car
they are all dressed in black
a few other mourners including emma get out of the mercedes
rachel red eyed and weary takes fletcher under her arm and goes inside
she does not look at frank
a hand takes a pitcher of orange juice from the refriger ator and pours some into a large glass
they uncap a bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into the orange juice
it has grown very dark in the family room
frank is sitting all alone perfectly still in one of the over stuffed chairs the vodka bottle on a table next to him
he stares off into space
a small voice comes out of the darkness
you okay frank
frank acknowledges fletchers small presence standing to the side of the big chair
he doesnt look at him directly
yeah fletcher im okay
how bout you
i couldnt sleep
it was so scary just thinking about it
he looks at frank
do you feel scared frank
yeah fletcher i do
frank puts his hand gently on fletchers head but he does not look at him
everybodys afraid of something flethcer
thats how we know we care about something when were afraid well lose it
what are you afraid of
i think you should try to go back to sleep now pal
tell me frank please
is it the man who killed nicki
are you afraid of him
finally frank turns and looks at fletcher
frank is pretty far gone
he shakes his head no
he realizes that that kind of fear had never occurred to him and recognizing that fact sets him back into his thoughts
what are you afraid of
frank doesnt have the will to resist anymore
he lets his hand drop away from fletcher
of not being there
fletcher stares at him uncomprehending
do you want me to take you back to your room
fletcher shakes his head no just barely
then he disappears
frank silhouetted moves toward the stairway to the main level
there is light up there
frank begins climbing the stairs
when he has gone a quarter of the way up rachel appears at the top and begins walking down
at first she doesnt see frank when she does she hesitates a moment then continues down
they meet and try to sidestep each other but twice they go in the same direction unable to get around
rachel already emotionally ravaged cracks
she begins slapping frank hard about the face and torso
one of the first blows knocks the glass from his hand it smashes loudly against the wall
he raises his arms in a half hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught
she cries as she hits him
hysterical you you you
you brought this pain into my house
now youre here
where were you then
why didnt you save her
it was your job to protect me and she died doing it
it was me they were after
and you let them kill her
she gasps for air she never did anything to anyone
as she loses the strength and the will to hit him her blows become sloppy weak
she sinks to the steps sitting on them sobbing
she never hurt anyone
she was good
she looks at him entreats him you saw her
she never wished anyone any harm
frank looks at her shakes his head no
rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments her crying slows
finally quietly she never hurt a soul
long pause i didnt love her well enough
i didnt take care of her
a beat she gave me only love
she sits quietly on the steps in the gloom
frank watches for a long moment then softly continues on his way
its bright sunshine
fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids
his nanny waits patiently at the side towels at the ready
at one side of the pool rachel sits lost in thought mourning her sister
at the other side sits frank also thoughtful
he too is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility
the shouts and laughter of the kids continue
the guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi nated in the distance
the guard patrols at his station
inside the t
screens flicker and glow
perched on the top of a slight hill frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree
he gazes down at the gate house his face lit softly by the glow from its lamps
all around him the rest of the estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight
after a moment another silhouetted figure slowly ap proaches and stands beside him
i guess youve heard whats happening
mind if i sit down
frank shakes his head
they sit side by side for awhile both lost in thought
rachel seems very calm
it isnt over yet is it
frank shakes his head
he knows he still hasnt got you
so hell come again
rachel takes this philosophically
she tugs at the grass thinking
when i was back in squirrel hill i started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday id win an oscar
you can understand how important it is that they see me up there if i win
she looks at him and smiles
if everyone of those pikers comes through it could add up to a lot of money
i think its very dangerous
but i cant stay up here on my hill forever
they are silent for awhile
rachel lies back on the grass stares at the sky
i didnt get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time
as frank nods how bout you frank farmer
out there on the edge
did you ever do something that didnt make too much sense except maybe inside you
in your stomach somewhere
something that wasnt smart
looks at him ill bet you have plenty
ill bet you do
nobody gets really good without it
and youre good
i know that
she sits up beside him
i dont know why all this has happened to me
a beat but i do know that none of its your fault
i hope you can hear me because this is how i say im sorry
im going to go see if i win an oscar
and i wont worry about it at all
because ive got you to protect me
frank almost smiles
he looks at her a long time then takes her in his arms
he kisses her and lays her down
his body moves over hers
like a bodyguard protecting her from the night
the chaos and razamatazz of oscar night
crowds limos cameras searchlights
the limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red carpeted entrance to the pantages theatre
frank and tony sit in front with henry
in the back a spectacularly gowned rachel sits flanked by devaney and spector both of whom like frank are wearing tuxedos
up ahead they can all see the hubbub at the entrance tv cameras lights photographers arriving guests two bleachers full of fans
the glare from the arc lights is almost blinding
well go straight back to the green room
got that tony
tony knows what hes doing
tony looks at frank surprised and not a little pleased with the unexpected support
i wish you boys would relax a little
nothing bads gonna happen out there alright
the old rachel unless i lose the fucking award
she looks around at the men all are tense
jesus what a crew
rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the panel in front of her and checks her appearance
the limo moves up
im through worrying
when your numbers up its up
the limo is almost at the red carpet
frank slips out the front door of the moving limo
more quartz lights click on
the tv cameras all focus on the door of the limo as frank steps out of the way
as he surveys the busy scene
a microphoned m
peers into rachels limo and walks toward it
miss rachel marron
on tv camera monitor we see rachel wave to the crowd
everyone wishes you the best tonight rachel
frank leads the small procession down the red carpet
fans reach out asking for his autograph
as his glance darts around high into the bleachers ahead in the distance to the door to the side at photographers nodding to the massed security men with their walkie
rachels smile is convincing lovely professional
spector devaney and tony look strained
as they enter a wide shot from across the street shows their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up
the camera tracks sideways to reveal the rear fender of a toyota x parked in the foreground
it is large and has been fitted with a bar and buffet
formally dressed presenters and hosts mill about laugh ing and talking
many greet rachel
a tv monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner
on it the academy awards continue
an elaborate dance number is just concluding
the audience applauds
beside the monitor a large clock with a ticking second hand
a harried associate producer skip thomas comes up to rachel settled in an armchair
tony stands nearby frank leans against a far wall
i need to get you straight on your responsibilities
skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand and gives it to rachel
he consults a clipboard as he speaks
there laid out minute by minute is the order of the evenings events
each one has a precise time printed beside it including those that involve rachel
now its best sound then another song then you

rachel is deep in a giggling girlish conversation with another actress
skip thomas approaches rachel again
one more song then you
rachel nods goes back to her conversation
frank steps up to tony
im going to have a look around
ill come back for her
tony nods watches frank go
frank moves down the hall from the green room toward the stage
stagehands technicians performers speak in hushed tones
tv monitors are mounted throughout the area
on screen a distinguished looking actor named reardon is serving as temporary master of ceremonies
frank walks along checking the route looking up into the flies
he rounds a corner and is face to face with portman
what are you doing here
im on the job
portman points at a nearby tv monitor
on screen reardon is introducing the next song
on tv screen my mother has always thought i was the star of every movie ive been in
you remember night of the stranger
you probably dont remember me in that
my mother can tell you about it
to this day she thinks its about a desk clerk at the hotel where whats his name is hiding out from the cops
now its time to hear the final nominated song from the film queen of the night i have nothing
and here to sing it for us the multi talented miss sandra castle
during the above short term gig
but quite profitable
listen frank im sorry about miami
you know nothing really happened
i felt bad for you
i wanted to say something but you disappeared
note i have nothing fanfare
dancers onto stage
first section of song commencing with shortened chorus then first verse total minute reardon walks off the stage ten feet from where frank and portman are standing glances at them
and moves off down the hall
back to work
ill probably see you at the governors ball
portman walks off after reardon
frank watches him thoughtful
on tv monitor sandra castle sings i have nothing with great feeling
the lyrics recall the text of the death threat
no rational cause
something in the air
rachels face as she watches sandra castle on the monitor
she is at a makeup table
music is loud
the celebrities in the green room are impressed with sandras performance
there is spontaneous applause
rachel turns to the room
i want that broad run out of town
frank calls tony on his surv kit
tony you there
tony ive got a feeling this is the night
i think hes gonna go for her in front of all the cameras
the kind of thing only a lunatic would do
thats how he wants it to look
except he isnt a lunatic
hes very clever
i need you to help me
im with you frank
theres no more competition between them
three sound technicians appear at franks side very agitated
to frank you cant use that thing back here
the breakthroughs killing our radio mikes
well have to disconnect you
reluctantly frank disconnects his earpiece
tony fiddles with his earpiece
technicians approach tony too
big finish of song and dance number total seconds
applause and dancers off
frank walks past tony
tony holds up the earpiece in frustration
he walks over to rachel
he seems tense and she senses it
and like a tangible thing his anxiety is passed over to her
she is frightened
spooked whats wrong
skip thomas appears at her side
lets go okay
clive healy comes over
rachel must tear her eyes away from frank
tony floats up behind them
skip regards him with irritation and turns to frank
indicating tony really
must we have everyone
we have our own men at the door
skip looks at rachel for a response
i want him
clive takes rachels arm
come rachel let us brighten the firmament
rachel forces a smile but her eyes follow frank as he starts to lead the way out of the green room
on an impulse she reaches for something from the makeup table and presses it into her hand
its the russian orthodox cross
she clutches it like a talisman and follows frank
tony brings up the rear
the group moves down the hall from the green room past the stage right wings
behind the scenery to the back of the stage
in blue celebrity guests technicians
his eyes examine each curtain corner and recess
he looks above him
closeup on rachels face as she looks around nervously
is tense on clives arm
clive pats her arm soothingly
try to relax rachel
i know you must be very excited
skip leads them to a set of temporary stairs behind the scenery they lead to the center of the top tier
production aides with clipboards and headphones wait up there
pointing rachel youll go in there and clive you over there
youll meet on the landing
they both nod but rachel is distracted tense
watch your step going down
someone spilled some water
clive and rachel climb the stairs
rachel turns once more to look anxiously at frank
she clutches the cross but he doesnt see
frank watches them ascend
he signals tony to stay there until rachel goes on
frank moves off toward the stage left wings
on tv monitor we see reardon acting as master of ceremonies doing the introductions
on screen i used to have an outfit just like that
and to present the best song award we have our debonair friend from england and the lady who has everything clive healy and rachel marron
a red camera light clicks on
music up applause as we see clive and rachel make their entrances on the tv monitor
frank swiftly adjusts his position so he can still see the stage
as he does he glances under the scaffolding that supports the set
rachel and clive reach the podium
clive is all smiles
rachel is trying but is obviously distracted
as the applause dies away we see what they see tv cameras an orchestra in the pit the huge audience and the bright glare of the lights
at the front of the podium is the transparent plastic of the teleprompter their lines can be clearly seen printed out and moving vertically
reading from the prompter well rachel i know that you only came tonight to present this award and youll want to leave as soon as were done
rachels lines appear on the prompter but she does not start reading them immediately
they stop moving on the screen
rachels face her eyes darting about
there is an awful silence
on the nearest tv camera
the teleprompter now showing clives lines
a man in the first row of the audience
close on her hands as they squeeze the cross
over the course of the evening weve heard five smashing songs and the names of the artists who created them
frank watching rachel hears the barely audible clicking start from the tiny receiver on his belt
his eyes dart to rachels hand and he sees the cross
he knows what shes going through
her hand is shaking
clive supports her as discreetly as he can smiling out at the audience
from behind clive and rachel we watch as clive picks up rachels lines from the prompter ad libbing to make them fit
and i know that no matter what anyone thinks you have no personal favorites
the audience is starting to sense that something is wrong with rachel
the best song nominees are clock on the wall from the dining room table by dana s
lee and sara spring
give me your trust from out of the gloom by david siegel and barbara g
i have nothing from queen of the night by nancy garbor
maybe soon from maybe soon anne trop and ben glass
and reflections of my heart from hot and cold by leslie moraes
an usher near the wall shifts his weight
the orchestra conductor turns to look at her
a musician turns his sheet music
the dark at the back of the balcony
as he alone hears the clicking monitors her distress and fear
blurting her prompter lines all right clive lets find out
the teleprompter operator has been thrown off and now takes a moment to get it moving again
reading lets find out who the winner is
rachel shall i do the honors
work at the envelope tearing freeing the flap
his fingers work to pull out the contents
the clicking is almost deafening like a heartbeat
the second hand ticks in enormous closeup
on a trigger
drifts lazily towards us out of the muzzle of a gun in ultra slow motion
bring out one of the pasted up death threats with the familiar opening lines marron bitch you have as clive pulls the card out of the envelope
it reads music by rachel gasps stifles a scream
and the winner is i have nothing
from queen of the night music and lyrics by nancy garbor
rachel loses control backs away from the podium and runs off stage right
the audience applauds the winner
this is so exciting
i cant begin to describe what it feels like to stand here with this
first i want to thank rachel marron
without her support encouragement and determination to help get an unknown songwriter heard i wouldnt be standing here
a lot of people talk about how theyre going to help others once they make it themselves but rachel really follows through
id also like to thank helen pollak a wonderful producer who never got fed up with me
frank sees rachel run off the opposite side of the stage and heads over there around the back of the scenery
clive the professional stands holding the envelope
he glances off after rachel mystified
a cluster of people surround rachel comforting her
frank comes up
he does not try to force his way through to rachel
people begin to move away the cluster thins
two stars move off toward the back of the stage
i always said she was nuts
ive always said that
clive healy comes up
is she all right
he is assured that she is
clive goes out to his seat
in the audience
as the people move off rachel becomes clearly visible to frank
tony is standing next to her but another man has his arm around rachel comforting her
rachels face is tear stained and she dabs at it with a handkerchief
she is recovering fast
past her fear she is now very embarrassed
her voice is strong
christ what an idiot i am
what the hells the matter with me
frank moves up closer and exchanges looks with tony who is confused by rachels behavior
rachel turns toward frank and in so doing brings the man comforting her around to face frank
it is reardon
farmer youve made me a raving lunatic
frank barely hears rachel so struck is he by reardons presence
frank looks around them quickly for portman
rachel looks at frank with irritation and turns back toward the green room
a production aide signals reardon
to rachel i have to go back out
are you okay
thank you for your help john
rachel walks off toward the green room with tony
reardon starts to walk out toward the stage
frank stops him
reardon is irritated
breaking away never heard of him
reardon walks out on stage
frank is left standing alone
all the weariness comes back all his senses start to hum
frank looks around then moves off toward the green room
rachel sits at a makeup table
skip thomas approaches clipboard in hand
rachel im sorry but if youre going to be in your seat for the best actress award youve got to do it now
skip im moving as fast as i can
for chrissake go twitch somewhere else
skip backs off
spector and frank join the group
honey everythings fine
no one noticed anything
everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves
bullshit you saw me
farmers made me a raving lunatic somethings going on you should know about youre making her crazy
youre making us all crazy
rachel i know who it is
hes here tonight
i think hes
this is the last straw
she throws down the powder and stands up fast makeup and purse flying
the powder com pact bursts over the cross lying on the table
everyone in the green room looks at her
hissing at him shut up you maniac
you never stop
now youve made an ass of me in front of a billion people
and you wont quit
they stare at each other and everyone else stares at them
rachel walks swiftly out the door of the green room
frank sits for a moment then stands up
the bodyguard follows his charge to the door
he whispers hurriedly at tony as they leave
tony its portman
the guy from miami
spector grabs tonys sleeve pulling him back
after tonight youre back in charge
he knows nothing about show business
tony squares off with spector
you are an asshole
reardon is just introducing tom winston the actor who will announce the best actress award
reardon back on stage to applause reardon linking material maybe gags
reardon intros winston
play on winston to applause
presenting the best actress award we have the man who last year received the top honor an actor can achieve for his performance in south of waco
ladies and gentlemen tom winston
frank watches his eyes scanning searching the vast theatre squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare of the klieg lights and the cameras
thank you john thank you academy
it brings back some great memories to be standing here again
last year i figured something out
while it is a great honor to be nominated actually winning caps the evening very pleasantly
on stage speaking and then listing the nominees
in their seats up the aisle toward the back of the theatre high into the gloom of the balcony
tonight we give this award not to the best actress but to the best performance by one of five exquisitely talented artists
franks face searching
tv camera focused on the audience
its red light goes on
rachels face expectant nervous on the screen
rachel would have to take to the stage the steps to the stage the faces of the ushers near the stage the conductor ready to play theme music
and the nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are constance simpson for hot and cold
frank slips through the curtained doorway that leads to the backstage
ellen pearson for maybe soon
frank comes up swiftly
he stops behind a curtain six feet from the path the winner will take
tony is there
frank speaks to him and as he does he puts a hand on tonys arm
they both look across the stage past winston into the wings on the other side
in the wings of the opposite side of the stage half hidden by a curtain a tv cameraman is hoisting his lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder
his back is to us
rachel marron for queen of the night
tony i want you on the other side
and check out that guy
hes not supposed to be there
tony trots off quickly
the cameraman half turns toward us peering past the curtain into the audience
for a split second we glimpse his face
then someone crosses quickly in front of him and hes gone
dean for i dream of peace and evelyn gardner for the harper plan
frank draws his gun
he glances quickly to tony but tonys already on his way trotting round the labyrinth behind the set
frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to tony then realizes his communications are useless
he tries to see where portman has disappeared to but he darent lose sight of rachel
and the winner is
rachel marron for queen of the night
he looks past the curtain to rachel
deafening applause in the main auditorium
a stunned rachel stands
devaney and spector kiss her
people nearby reach out to touch her
rachel walks along her row
the orchestra plays i have nothing
a mass of drapes and flats
behind them the cameraman is fixing something to the side of his camera
his back is to us
tony comes up briskly behind him unable to see his face
what the fuck you think youre doin back here
with amazing speed the cameraman portman wheels around simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers from his free hand straight into tonys eyes
tony cries out his hands flying to his face
portmans hand moves swiftly again jabbing to a nerve behind tonys ear tony drops like a sack
glancing rapidly around portman sees all other eyes on the auditorium
he pulls the curtain around tonys body obscuring it
he then removes his own security id and fixes a laminated press id to his lapel
frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and several guards
the music and the applause drown out his words and we do not hear them
the guards rush off backstage and into the auditorium
rachel walks along her row
hands reach out to her
some people stand in their seats around her
a crane mounted tv camera swoops down between frank and his view of rachel obscuring her for a brief instant
desperately scanning seeking
suddenly his face freezes
as rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk toward the steps there in the far aisle his face almost hidden is portman the camera hand held on his
shoulder moving level with rachel feet behind her
frank raises his gun
rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps
tears in her eyes
security guards in the side aisles look around in all directions
they cant see anything
tight on portman now almost completely obscured behind the members of the audience as more and more of them stand to applaud rachel
along the side of the camera
rachel keeps appearing and disappearing behind the heads of the audience
desperate to get a clear shot at portman but unable to fire without hitting a bystander
as she approaches the podium steadily controlling herself as she mounts the steps
the outline of her body becomes difficult to see against the glare of the foot lights and the lights at the side of the auditorium
his eyes squint against the dazzle
rachel approaches winston
the applause and music is
he cant see portman past the glare
he cant fire into the audience
he knows rachel is now at her most vulner able
there is only one thing he can do to protect his charge
frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through the air at rachel twisting his body as he does
rachel turns her head sees frank leaping at her and gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror
the silenced pistol taped to the side of the camera fires
frank and rachel tumble over on the floor
the podium topples
there are screams from the audience
pandemonium breaks out
men run on stage from all directions
guns are drawn
everyone is shouting
tv cameras whip pan in all directions security men shout into walkie talkies
chaos on all screens
what the fuck
go to commercial
totally calm and as he gambled invisible in the commo tion
camera still on his shoulder he slowly backs away from the scene
ushers and uniformed security men rush past him towards the stage
people leap from their seats
a woman screams piercingly behind him
portman doesnt blink
dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around frank and rachel
rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees as hands reach out to help her the blood on franks shirt
he has taken the hits for her
but hes still on the job gaze alert
without taking his eyes from the audi torium his left arm stretches out with some pain to push rachel back down
the right arm gun in hand sweeps the auditorium
where is portman
frank cant see past the mob
ushers fall on frank in a heap trying to disarm him
security men try to pull them off
rachel shouts trying to make herself heard above the noise
hes my bodyguard
get off him
a series of swift low angle shots through legs and faces
one brief glimpse that could be portman
a cameraman turns
frank is desperate pushing away a helping arm
the chaos mounts
sirens wail outside
he turns away from the stage as four cops pound past him
he walks away
suddenly for one brief second his face loses its composure as he looks to the side door
hysterical audience members jostle for the exit screaming and shouting
its like a football scrum
cops and secur ity men pushing and pulling
his escape route is blocked
briefly glimpsed through blurred frenzied f
still seeking his target biting his lip in pain
cool again he turns back to the stage seeking an alternative escape route camera still providing cover
a lumbering figure blood streaming from one eye his drawn and outstretched
its tony staggering to the edge of the stage straight towards his attacker
frank and rachels heads swivel in unison at the sound looking towards the far aisle
against the side wall at the front portmans eyes desperately scan for the source of the voice
he sees tony his pistol takes aim
for a split second two running figures f
pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to portman
franks bullets hit home
the first slams portman in the chest knocking him against the wall
the second hits the camera on his shoulder exploding it around his face
blood spatters her white armani dress and the shirt front of her escort
portmans body slumps forward in her lap pinning her back in her seat
his pistol drops onto a pair of shiny black leather pumps
frank holds his aim steady reluctant to look away
he half turns to rachel wincing with the effort
he has fulfilled his promise to her
rachel throws her arms around frank and hugs him tears streaming down her cheeks
frank farmers face
sad and weary
his guard is finally down
nothing more can happen
he slowly lowers the gun closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his chest
in the midst of the commotion of medics security men police and ushers spector bends down and gently retrieves the gold envelope and the card bearing rachels name
there are splatters of blood on it
he tries to wipe them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket
a chaos of press and public ambulance and police lights flashing sirens wailing
police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher it is frank rachel walks at his side clutching his hand as he is rushed to an ambulance
tony a dressing over his eyes is also helped out by paramedics
among the gathered crowd we focus in on one face
it is dan pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is happening
he slowly turns and walks away
camera cranes to a high wide shot of the scene
a buffed out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as the last pieces of equipment of rachels band are loaded aboard from a truck
a limousine pulls up and rachel gets out with tony and court who is clearly acting as her bodyguard
she greets some members of the band and others who will be part of her entourage
a roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane
devaney is trying to hurry her on board
spector is conspicuous by his absence
as rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane tony wearing a dark leather eyepatch reacts to something o
frank approaches from the nearby parking area
he is pale
under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is still taped
he smiles as tony
their handshake becomes a quick abrazo
indicating eyepatch hows it going
but it wont be the same
tony fakes a glancing blow to franks chin
over by the plane fletcher spots frank and tugs at rachels dress till she turns to look
fletcher runs up to frank and hugs him around the knees
rachel approaches and tony moves back toward the plane
devaney waves in franks direction tapping his watch to indicate they are late
frank waves and smiles
rachels surprised to see frank but clearly happy
fletcher is ecstatic
you shouldnt be here
there is a pause
so youre quitting show business
you had talent
what are you going to do
i thought i might hole up with my dad
pats bandaged torso finish that chess game
rachel nods approvingly
get him when fletchers not around
ruffling fletchers hair thats the idea
rachel starts to cry
so hows the new guy
hes got white hair frank
hes very good
whyd you have to get me an old man
i dont trust you
well give me a kiss and lets get this over with
frank gives her an awkward hug
rachel turns quickly
she almost runs up the boarding ladder
frank remains watching her
fletcher looks back over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane
rachel takes a seat beside fletcher
devaney leans over the aisle
that wasnt so bad
he sees her tears you okay
rachel is in her own world
devaney passes the word to get moving
the engines warm up
rachel turns and sees frank still standing there looking at her
the pilots hand pushes forward on the throttle
the nosewheel starts to taxi
the plane moves forward
rachels face at the window
the steps start to fold down out of the plane but not fast enough for rachel
she jumps the last six feet staggering slightly as the planes jet wash hits her whipping her clothes and hair
without pausing she runs to frank who takes her in his arms
they embrace and kiss
they kiss again and again
finally slowly rachel draws back her eyes are filled with tears
remember when you said youd risk your life for me
frank tries to break in but she wont let him interrupt
i didnt really believe it then
nobody means what they say
but you did frank
you did it
you laid it all on the line for me
frank tries to speak she puts her hands to his lips
dont wreck this for me
i dont want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job
you did more than save my life frank
you showed me a way to be
and i love you for it
a beat there i said it
looks at him ill never forget what it felt like to be under your eye
smiles i wont be forgetting you either
she presses something into franks hand
i want you to keep this
if you ever need me you just put this on and no matter where you are i will find you
she gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane her eyes holding franks
frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross
as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out
the roar of the plane becomes applause
rachels face in full frame bathed in light and the applause of a huge audience
now i want to sing you an old song but its a new favorite
as the music begins rachel stands alone in front of the band mike in hand
you know this song used to make me feel sad
but it doesnt anymore
the audience is still
now it just reminds me of someone very special
this is for him
rachel begins to sing the song what becomes of the broken hearted slow and sweet
its the song she and frank danced to
as a verse it is a rotary dinner
the camera tracks along the front of the head table which runs from one side of the room to the other
our speaker this evening the honorable congressman from the fifth district galen windsor has been a lone courageous voice
he alone has challenged those who have linked organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state
still tracking we see the rotary president as he nods to a distinguished looking gentleman one seat to his right
on the wall a sign identifying the hotel and a club banner which reads the rotary club of iowa city
the camera continues to track and the rotary president goes out of frame
but first our benediction will be delivered by reverend phillip hardy of the first presbyterian church
still tracking we see the reverend get up as the men around him bow their heads
heavenly father please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty
still tracking as we reach the end of the table
and lord whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take let them never be without your sanctuary
the camera stops
standing against the wall behind the table is frank
as the reverends prayer goes on all heads are bowed to receive the benediction
all heads but franks
the camera moves in tight on his face
for all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death you are with us
guiding and protecting us
the reverends final words segue into rachels song
franks searching gaze around the room is arrested for a moment as though reacting to rachels voice
rachel ends a phrase
she dabs at the corner of her eye as she continues the song that still binds them together
his expression so intense in the opening scene of the film is softer now
rachels voice continues as frank carefully scans the room
