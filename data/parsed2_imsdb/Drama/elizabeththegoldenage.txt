painted images of the elizabethan age a world divided by religious hatred
the new protestant faith is spreading
bodies burned on a pyre men writhing under torture a momentary half recognisable face gaunt and staring the most powerful ruler in christendom philip of spain has sworn to return
all europe to the catholic faith
images of rival monarchs philip and elizabeth in court paintings stiff formal imperious
only england stands in his way a weak impoverished nation ruled by a woman
finally images of god in judgement as if speaking to his chosen servant
philip prepares to obey the will of his god
bn ascetic looking man dressed in black kneels in a small plain chapel in virtual darkness
philip ii king of spain bows his head low abasing himself before his god
scorial palace spain
now slowly he raises his head
his eyes open and we see there the glow of a new certainty
god has spoken to him
my lord and my god

philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory
on his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission
silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by
through the hallway to a grand salon
courtiers fall silent and bow as he passes
so into the grandest salon of all where his magnificent court is gathered among them his year old daughter the infanta
as he enters all kneel
his eyes scan his ministers and courtiers all kneeling heads bowed before him
his gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a jesuit priest robert reston the face we glimpsed in the opening montage
he speaks to all
god has made his will known to me
the time for our great enterprise has come
the jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but disciplined satisfaction
he murmurs softly to himself
cathedral bells ring out
the cheers of a crowd are heard through the open windows
the king passes out onto the salons first floor balcony
philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side as the bells ring out and the crowd in the plaza below wave their hats and
the infanta is by his side
his ministers cluster behind him
lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of armed soldiers a formidable reminder of the kings power
philip does nothing but his presence intoxicates the crowd
as their cries swell wave upon wave the kings eyes glow and he breathes in deeply feeding on his peoples adoration
a ripple of light on the water
a blur of approaching colour

the royal barge is gliding towards us slowly taking shape its hull gaily painted its canopy adorned with colourful fabrics its banks of oars rising and falling casting bright shards
of shining water in the sunlight
eople passing on the river bank point and wave smiling cheering
they see the queen now
they call out
two young men walking arm in arm stare more intently than any but they do not cheer or wave
theres something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the queen
they are babington and savage
over this an insistent voice why do you go among the people majesty
i tell you plainly you will be murdered
every catholic in england is a potential assassin
an agitated group is gathered in this room where the business of state is transacted
we catch glimpses of the queen in their midst preparing to leave as her ministers try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation sir christopher hatton s an
ambitious courtier lord howard s a weathered old campaigner and standing back from the rest watching from the side lines sir francis walsingham the queens veteran friend and adviser
be warned by the atrocities in france
god fearing christians murdered by papist cut throats inflamed by hatred of the truth
we know the catholics take their orders from spain
the spanish speak openly of mary stuart as queen of england in waiting
sharply mary stuart is a queen cast out by her own ungrateful nation
with respect majesty a catholic queen
your loyal protestant supporters dont understand why mary stuart lives under our protection at our expense very considerable expense mary stuart is my cousin
she is our guest
and she is under our control
but while she lives majesty she is a beacon that draws our enemies eyes and hopes
while she lives
she is the poison at the heart of england
the poison must be cut out
youd have me make a martyr of her
what is her crime
the londoners on the river bank cheer and wave as the royal barge goes by
all catholics are traitors
their loyalty is to the pope of rome
how many catholics are there in england sir
immense numbers majesty
we believe half the nation clings to the old superstitions
what would you have me do
cut out half the people of england
we must act majesty
our inaction is taken to be weakness
if any of my people break the law they will be punished
until that day i wish them to be let them alone
until the day they rise in rebellion
majesty we have proven reason to fear every catholic in the land fear creates fear sir
i will not punish my people for their beliefs
only for their deeds
am assured that the people of england love their queen
my constant endeavour is to earn that love
londoners on the river banks wave and cheer
elizabeth seated on the royal barge sees them with satisfaction
she gives an occasional slight inclination of her head in acknowledgement
elizabeth sits with her favourite seated beside her her youngest and prettiest maid of honour bess throckmorton
walsingham sits facing them looking sourly at the cheering spectators
the people are agitated
your bishops are preaching that god is showing his displeasure the queen being still unmarried some are saying infertile what nonsense
mary stuart has a son why does everyone torment me with mary stuart

elizabeth contd its not her fault that shes next in line to the throne
to bess dont hide your face
she leans over to brush a stray lock of hair from besss face
so long as you have no issue
elizabeth looks back at wsalsingham

isnt it customary to obtain a husband before producing an heir
to bess we shall have to look out a husband for you soon bess
not too soon my lady
there are husbands to be had
to bess dont you want to be married
ill want the marriage if i want the man

an honest man
with friendly eyes
may blue draft to walsingham thats where you and i differ walsingham
i find the impossible far more interesting
to bess and good legs
youll want good legs
and sweet breath
so that you can kiss him without choking
to walsingham there must be any amount of princes in undiscovered lands across the sea
find me an honest one of those
the royal party enters the cathedral
elizabeth and walsingham advance into the wide empty nave followed by the queens ladies and the guards
bess is now back in her place among the ladies
ship builders are being recruited in spanish ports at double wages
the sea wall at dover is cracking
theres no money to rebuild our defences
i dont need advisers to tell me my business
they care for your safety majesty
the threats to your person are real
and they know very well that if i fall they all come tumbling down after me
she goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar and kneels to pray
as she kneels she holds out one hand behind her not looking round
bess steps forward and taking her hand kneels and prays with her

her ladies are putting her clothes away
bess begins the process of stripping away her make up

with that she smiles and sees besss answering reflected smile

her smile fades
she gazes at her now naked face vulnerable in the mirror
the royal bed immense and ornate
elizabeth lies here small awake and alone
the angels weep for you elizabeth
why do you close your ears to the voice of your loving god
foresters at work felling great trees working rhythmically in pairs
from all round echoes the same sound of axe on timber
you are leading the souls of your people to hell
marry me and save england
i spoke to her just as i speak to you now
ow we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest accompanied by a mounted entourage
in the carriage the king philip ii the infanta and father robert reston
but she did not listen
she made me a speech about the virtues of virginity
she has brought this on herself
hilip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a shudder
every tree that falls hurts me
i lose a part of myself
i am cursed with sensitivity
i feel too much
we dont yet know what the felling of the trees portends
but reston does
to him its a glorious sight
your majesty has a merciful soul
may blue draft p
i sacrifice my countrys forests to save the souls of a lost nation
that is true mercy
england is lost to darkness father
i bring light
wide now we see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill and there is revealed an awesome sight the forest has been felled as far as the eye
great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape
everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees
wagon teams haul immense trunks away
fires burn stacks of lopped branches and the smoke rises up into the empty sky
n the carriage on restons face as he stares at the fires
he speaks half to himself out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty
the light of purifying fire
he turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze
my time has come majesty

establishing wide shot of chartley hall
a small yapping skye terrier is barking at a laundress who is handing over a letter folded small to a sharp faced middle aged french ladys maid annette
the laundress curtseys and leaves
the terrier scampers ahead of annette to its mistress mary stuart who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat
she is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid thirties
round her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a chaplain
this is so pretty im inclined to send it as a present to my dear cousin elizabeth
she holds up the delicate work to show her ladies
may blue draft p
it is an intimate garment of course
but even elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment
annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her holding out the letter
mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her and reads it for herself
our friends write to give us hope
low soon englands true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper elizabeth and slit her throat and throw her down to hell
thats enough annette
but she loves it
slit her throat
and when the bastard usurper is dead my lady will be queen
the chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning
the warden of chartley hall sir amyas paulet enters the room
he is soberly dressed but has charming manners and is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward
mary turns to him at once with a teasing smile
heres my noble jailer come to smack my hand
she holds out one hand to be smacked
the other hand holds the letter out of sight
have i sinned again sir
no no my lady
unless beauty is counted a sin

paulet contd kissing her hand i come to pay my respects
oh you jailer
i dont trust you
not jailer my lady please
you are the queens guest
mary signs to her ladies
one of them brings her the embroidery discreetly receiving in exchange the hidden letter
see how i pass my time in my lonely prison
she holds the intimate garment against her body
paulet seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being duped
such a pretty undergarment
but for whose eyes

a pistol is being loaded a fiddly process involving a powder horn wadding and an iron ball the size of a hazelnut
so whats it for my young friend
not for shooting rabbits im guessing
we live in dangerous times
we do indeed
savage moves close as if to study the loading process
we see the two of them talking from outside the window
very low the conspiracy gains strength
tell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court
the armourer nods
he hands the pistol to savage
savage takes it and leaves
immediately after a man enters and walks up behind the now seated armourer
the armourer turns round
i ask for your forgiveness
moving with speed he seizes the armourers head twists it to one side and snaps his neck

babington moves forward easing his way to the front of the crowd
nearby there stands another young man who is watching not cheering ramsay
a woman wth a baby pushes her way almost to the queen holding her baby before her

babingtons pov the queen stopping to bless the little baby smiling putting out her hand to touch the babys head
the mother bobs a curtsey
the queen moves on with her entourage
a sudden scuffle in the crowd
babington turns to look
a cloak sweeps through frame dropping down to the ground revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of raleigh directly in r the path of the queen

no sign of any puddles

unaware that hes meant to kiss the queens hand manteo takes it and shakes it

again don guerau tracks his every move
he takes out a tobacco leaf
you breathe its smoke
now don guerau realises hes being laughed at on all sides
he draws himself up with angry pride wrinkling his nose
forgive me majesty i find the air has become stale
i am sensitive to the smell of open sewers

with a broad smile raleigh gestures forward the third basket
this one really is full of gold
he takes out a gold coin and presents it to elizabeth

elizabeth examines the fat gold coin with its image of philip of spain
she tries not to smile
courtesy of a spanish ship that found itself unable to complete its journey
elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket

babington takes the pistol from his hand
make your peace with god
savage stares and suddenly realises what babington means to do
terror overwhelms him
dont kill me
i dont want to die
now hes blubbering with fear
babington is shaken by this and cant shoot
reston begins to pray aloud

theyre listening to a young austrian make a formal speech of love
the austrian ambassador stands to one side mouthing the words to prompt him
the archduke charles is still a boy sixteen years old slight pale trembling with shyness
he struggles through his rehearsed speech
your majestys beauty is dazzling to my eyes
your learning is famed throughout europe
i see before me perfection in human form
how blessed am i to stand in your fabled presence warmed by your greatness as by the rays of the sun
to speak your name is to hear celestial music
may that sweet sound guide me through my life to come elizabeth
i have travelled here to this illustrious court in the hope that our two great nations might be joined in love
but now that i am bathed in the radiance of your glory i am overwhelmed
i am conquered
only your love great elizabeth can restore me to life
ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts

your highness does me great honour

it should prove almost as restorative as my love

a sunk ship is of no value

calley listening rolls his eyes
elizabeth at the table with the archduke by her side glances towards raleigh and sees him flirting with the court ladies
then back to the young archduke who has hardly touched his food
i think youre not as accustomed as i am to eating in public
i have a secret
lowering her voice i pretend theres a pane of glass eine glasscheibe between me and them
he moves one hand before her face indicating an imaginary pane of glass
as she looks she sees bess staring at someone follows her gaze and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also raleigh
they can see me but they cant hear me or touch me
you should try it

no man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a queen
lizabeth speaks so only he can hear in german
you play the game very well my young friend
but dont you sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what youre really thinking
the archdukes eyes open very wide
he glances at elizabeth and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile
i darent even think what im really thinking
youre thinking perhaps that you would far rather be home
youre very wise madame
hes grateful to her and his shy face shows it
raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies
i adore the natives you brought back with you
i dont suppose you could get one for me
theyre not dangerous are they

it seems youve presumed after all
it seems youre determined to think the worst of me
tell me what it is you really want
what every man wants
in that order
each leads to the next
the money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the new world
the success of my infant colony there will make me famous
the fame will bring me love
it seems rather a long way round
there are benefits along the way
it is something after all to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city
which you will no doubt name after yourself

b well then
i am answered
may i ask a question in return
how am i to win the queens favour
why should i tell you that sir
ive little enough to offer i know
but whatever i have to give ask and its yours
bess thinks for a moment
my advice to you is say what you mean to say as plainly as possible
all men flatter the queen in the hope of advancement
pay her the compliment of truth
she gives him her hand
he kisses it
i dont even know your name
a second elizabeth
everyone calls me bess
he goes back to the queen as elizabeth is rising to leave
she speaks to the company
his highness the archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him
he will retire to his private quarters to rest
this causes much amusement
don guerau sneers openly
the archduke rises
the archduke bows solemnly to the queen and leaves with his entourage
elizabeth beckons to walsingham and speaks low to him
hes a sweet boy
i dont want him hurt by your schemes
bess is reading to elizabeth
elizabeth watching her her mind elsewhere
i suspect him of being a professional charmer
am i right
he is certainly charming my lady
there are duller professions
and what is it he hopes to gain by his charms
he hopes for glory in his new world
he dreams of building a shining city
which im to pay for no doubt
beat you like him dont you
its refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court
so it is
we shall let him come again
mary stuart holds her pet dog in her arms listening to annette who kneels before her
may blue draft p
on whose orders
she looks up at the laundress who stands red eyed and snuffling with a guard by her side
do stop snivelling
the warden my lady
as she speaks sir amyas paulet enters
marys voice becomes seductive
what have you done now you bad man
sent away my laundress
how am i to have clean clothes
or do you want me to go about naked
paulet smiles at the notion of mary naked
that was not my motive maam
much though thinking better of it your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing
not her job i think
how am i to send my intimate letters
and you will read them
with respectful admiration
am i to have no privacy
beneath the charm steel
you disappoint me sir
may blue draft p
the queen orders these measures for your protection
am i not a queen too
what if i wish to write a love letter
is elizabeth to be sent a copy
is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine
the queen grieved when your husband died maam
as she grieved when your second husband died
and the third
if there is a possibility of a fourth tormentor
is that elizabeths order too
that you torment and mock me
she turns to go but stops before leaving the room bitter haughty not deigning to look back
they say shes a beautiful woman
is she so very beautiful
i dont presume to comment on the queens person
shes called the virgin queen
why is that sir
can it be that no man will have her
mary changes mood again thinking it more politic to keep the warden under her spell
she waves annette and the laundress away
my friend forgive me
you are my friend are you not
i am your servant maam and your admirer
i shall send no more letters
i shall stay here quietly in my prison
may blue draft p
the same crowd of petitioners wait in vain for access to the queen
the same door keeper
raleigh enters and this time the door keeper bows and ushers him through the open doors
over this we hear raleighs voice telling of his adventures it begins with a journey
you must cross an ocean
elizabeth listens attentively her eyes looking far away into the distance as raleigh tells of his adventures
can you imagine can you feel what it is to cross an ocean
for weeks you see nothing but the horizon
all round you
perfect and empty
your ship is small tiny a speck in such immensity
walsingham is talking to elizabeth about matters of state
we are on her face and we can see that she hears nothing of what he tells her
her mind is all on raleighs voice
you live with fear in the grip of fear fear of storms fear of sickness on board fear of the immensity
what if you never escape
how can you escape
theres nowhere to go
so you must drive your fear down deep into your belly and study your charts and watch your compass and pray for a fair wind and hope
now elizabeth is with raleigh again listening as he goes on speaking to her now directly
may blue draft p
pure naked fragile hope when all your senses scream at you lost
day after day staring west the rising sun on your back the setting sun in your eyes hoping hoping sir christopher hatton enters
majesty the archduke and the court are waiting
sharply let them wait
to raleigh go on mr raleigh
you were hoping
hatton bows and leaves frowning
at first its no more than a haze on the horizon the ghost of a haze the pure line corrupted
but clouds do that and storms
so you watch you watch
elizabeth dances with raleigh
as they dance his voice continues over and elizabeth seems to be listening to him
then its a smudge a shadow on the far water
for a day for another day the stain slowly spreads along the horizon and takes form until on the third day you let yourself believe
you dare to whisper the word land
the music ends and the dance finishes
elizabeth is seated now its later in time
raleigh is speaking intently to her and she is captivated
the true adventure
coming out of the vast unknown out of the immensity into safe harbour at last
that that is the new world
may blue draft p
a short silence
elizabeth is absorbing what he has told her
the queen does not have a private life
elizabeth is on the throne
the archduke charles and his entourage face her
the court fills the room
elizabeth makes her formal response to the young archduke
the queen lives for her people
you will therefore forgive me sir if after much thought and prayer i decline your offer of marriage
the archduke barely able to conceal his relief turns to the austrian ambassador
can i go home now
elizabeth inclines her head trying not to smile
go home my friend
dont be in a hurry to grow old
youth is so very precious
elizabeth rises and takes the archdukes arm as they start to leave the chamber
bess in her wake finds an opportunity to speak softly to raleigh
are you satisfied with the queens favour
she listened as if she understood me
then i shall expect some gratitude
r what do you want
their eyes meet both aware of the current of mutual attraction
may blue draft p
i expect ill think of something
bess hurries after the queen
the austrian entourage is just leaving as the queen turns
elizabeth and raleigh walk together around the perimeter hallway dwarfed by vast murals
i like your immensities
your ocean is an image of eternity i think
such great spaces make us small
do we discover the new world mr raleigh or does the new world discover us
you speak like a true explorer
i like you mr raleigh
and i like you
she stops and turns to meet raleighs eyes
shes not used to such direct replies
bess is watching them
you know of course that when i like a man i reward him
i have heard that
and what have you to say about it
r reward my mission majesty not me
is the mission not the man
leave me free to like you in return
that can be my reward
i think it must be hard for so great a queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself
this is a little too close to the truth
now you become dull
horses racing hoofs pounding over the grass manes flying two riders hurtle between the trees down a woodland ride neck and neck elizabeth and raleigh are racing against each other
faces glowing laughing abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment
raleigh is winning now first by a head then by a length
at the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk
elizabeth shakes her head unable to speak
out of breath you have the stronger horse
ours carries the lighter load
the queen does not give way to others
raleigh stops his horse
elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him
raleigh secretly spurs his horse
the horse springs forward ahead of her
at elizabeth reigning in the horse forgive me majesty
my horse doesnt know his place yet elizabeth looks at him amused intrigued
have you ever known your place mr
she urges her horse forward forcing raleigh to catch up
im surprised youre not married yet
im a sailor majesty
and can sailors not be lovers
with a smile must lovers be husbands
ah i see
you like love better than marriage
that i understand
your majesty is not eager to be married
when i marry i marry for my country
looking at raleigh when i love i love for myself
pause you have had many loves i think
with a smile some
youve yet to meet your equal
she understands him
i would want someone who knows me as i am
now it is elizabeth who hesitates
he understands her as well
you want a friend not just an equal
you want someone to share your joy when youre happy
double blue july p
b elizabeth contd someone to cry with when youre sad
someone to talk to when theres nothing to say
someone to find by your side when you wake in the night
someone who remembers what you once were when youve grown old
she turns to him with a smile
i know all about it
im rested now
she turns her horse around in the direction from which they came
we can be something to each other i hope mr
she spurs her horse and suddenly shes racing away back across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers and queens ladies including bess
raleigh spurs his horse to follow also fast but this time careful to keep a distance behind
as they near the courtiers raleigh splits off
bess watches as elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides away
bess creeps out of her bedroom pulling on a cloak
bess makes her way down the dark palace corridor stepping over sleeping courtiers as she goes
margaret watches her from the shadows
cloaked and hooded bess passes quietly down an alley stepping over more sleeping forms
she finds a door checks a note she holds glances round to be sure no one sees her knocks and enters
a man closes the door behind his visitor
bess shakes off her hood
its george throckmorton one of the conspirators
double blue july p
is your father alright
he wont live long now
thank you for coming dear bess
i was worried
you must send me no more letters
you know what would happen if i was caught
i need your help
do you need more money
my father is a tired old man
we dont want to hide like this anymore
we both want to get back to court
you are known papists
the queen loves you
speak to her
i cannot betray the queen
you are not betraying her
my father and i will embrace the new faith
bess is suspicious and starts to leave
dont put me in danger like this
cousin bess weve known each other all our lives
i would do nothing to harm you
if they catch us they will kill us
our lives are in your hands
double blue july p
d a group of the queens ladies make their way down the hallway bess among them
the others are gossiping in low whispers as they go
bess is silent with anxiety
then she looks ahead and her face fills with fear
walsingham is coming down the hallway towards them
the ladies curtsey
he nods and throws a glance at bess
the ladies move on
bess looks back
walsingham is also looking back and seems to be watching her
bess hurries ahead of the others through the privy chamber to the queens private quarters
ess passes ladies organising the queens wardrobe
she finds the queen laughing with raleigh not alone but unusually informal
dont tease me mr raleigh
theres nothing id like to do more
so why dont you
he blinks caught by surprise
you dont want me on your ship at all
turning towards bess youre a liar
elizabeth now takes in bess
green revision may p
would you like to go to sea bess
im afraid thats not possible
women bring bad luck on board ship
oh do they
lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room for months at a time men have needs
a beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad
amused men have needs
nce again elizabeth meets raleighs eyes
then she breaks away feeling the contact is dangerous
then let them stay on land and see to their needs
to bess mr raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony bess
we must persuade him to stay a little longer mustnt we
raleigh is leaving
walsingham has been waiting for him
he falls into step beside him
a word of advice
the queen chooses to show you favour
you naturally wish to take advantage of that
beat dont ask for too much
you think all i want is money
i hope all you want is money
buff revision th june p
a you think im a cynical adventurer with little breeding and less education
im a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education
i begin to see why the queen likes you
a soft knock on the door
francis throckmorton goes to the window and looks out
throckmortons pov in the street outside a woman with her head covered
he unbolts the door
two men burst in and seize him
they are agents and
beyond the woman not bess is hurrying away
a single sharp blow and he folds to the ground
multiple images of elizabeth naked
strange misty refracted glimpses of her face her body
a bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the queens private quarters and screened by mirrors
the queen is in the bath being washed by her ladies
ess throckmorton has the job of holding the queens hair out of the water as shes washed
she strokes the soft tresses as she holds them unaware that elizabeth can see her in the mirror
then she looks up and catches elizabeths eyes and stops in confusion
no dont stop
i like it
bess returns to her gentle caresses and elizabeth to her thoughts
is it true bess
that ive never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself
i hope you believe that i like you for yourself my lady
is anybody ever liked just for themselves
i doubt it
men like you because youre pretty
and because you have the ear of the queen
may blue draft p
no doubt my lady
he likes you because he wants my favour
you do realise that
yes my lady
and the other thing too of course
but all men want that
male desire confers no b distinction
ess strokes elizabeths hair in silence
then she sees elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror
i envy you bess
youre free to have what i cant have
youre my adventurer
dont be afraid
its all over so soon
a man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick lunch
hes the torturer
nearby on a blood stained bench lies a huddled half naked figure trembling uncontrollably
its francis throckmorton
hes neither manacled nor guarded
his body is so broken its not necessary
the torturer jumps to his feet
walsingham goes to throckmorton
he gazes at him shaking his head
hes getting too old for this dirty business
still nothing to tell me mr throckmorton
throckmorton struggles to lift his head
my soul will go free soon
i know about the enterprise
i need names
but if you wont help me perhaps your father will
he signs to the torturer
the torturer goes into an adjoining cell
orchid revisions june p
hes been questioned as you have
i do have to know you see
the torturer and a guard enter dragging between them the broken but living body of old throckmorton
old throckmorton looks up eyes blank with suffering
you want a name ill give you a name
walsingham comes close to hear
throckmorton chokes out something we dont hear but the torturer hears and his eyes open wide
orchid revisions june p
elizabeth passes down a hallway at a brisk pace hatton by her side her ladies hurrying behind her
another letter has come from mary stuart majesty
asking to meet you
filled with declarations of love
if she wants my love let her deserve it
elizabeth enters her private quarters now moving with regal dignity once more but the flush on her cheeks gives her away
her ladies follow
there stands raleigh waiting for her
ive kept you waiting
you have more important concerns than me
there is always other business
but i have been waiting too
elizabeth turns on him with a frown of irritation
the traitor has talked majesty
the traitor throckmorton
orchid revisions june p
a a flash of fear in besss eyes
to raleigh forgive me sir
as you see my time is not my own
elizabeth moves away so that walsingham can talk to her in confidence
she listens to his murmured words and anger shows on her face
may blue draft june p
the torturer now off duty is standing in the open doorway to empty his bladder
hes unlacing his britches when he hears footsteps approaching behind
the torturer begins to piss with evident pleasure
youll never guess what i heard a knife at his throat
a quick slash
the killer agent waits one more moment to be sure the job is done
the torturer slumps still standing against the wall
agent slips away
on the flag stones blood trickles down to mingle with the urine
now there are guards everywhere
the whole palace is on heightened alert
lizabeth sweeps out of the privy chamber into the great hall accompanied by the spanish ambassador on one side and walsingham on the other
her entourage scuttles behind
what do you know of the enterprise of england ambassador
forgive me your majesty
its a plan for the invasion of my country
two armies landing on the coasts of sussex and norfolk
mary stuart is to be set free and placed on the english throne
may blue draft june p
elizabeth contd i am to be assassinated
does any of this sound familiar
i know nothing of any invasion plans
i refer to this plan as the enterprise of england
it should more accurately be called la empresa di inglaterra because its a spanish plan
the plan of your king my one time brother in law philip ii to attack my country
the ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack
it is my country that is under attack
your so called pirates attack our merchant ships daily
do you think we dont know where their orders come from
the whole world knows that pirates sail up the thames all the way to the royal bed
exploding you will leave my presence sir
go back to spain
tell philip that i dont fear him or his priests or his armies
tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us were ready to give him such a bite hell wish hed kept his hands in his pockets
don guerau sees no point in further pretence
he speaks with pride and contempt
you see a leaf fall and you think you know which way the wind blows
but a wind is coming madam that will sweep away your pride
e bows and turns to go
elizabeths words blaze after him
i too can command the wind sir
i have a hurricane in me that will strip spain bare if you dare to try me

shivering with rage she turns round and theres raleigh
her fury overflows onto him
what are you staring at
lower your eyes
i am the queen
she sweeps past him without a further glance
on raleigh watching elizabeth go
a shake of his head
immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see
skeletons of new ships big ships rising in the great yard
hundreds of ship builders at work
his is what the forests were felled for a brand new fleet is being built
tiny figures in the wide scene the royal party appears
philip has come to see progress for himself
as he and his entourage tour the construction site one of his ministers briefs him on the latest developments in england
it cant be denied that weve lost the advantage of surprise
a large part of our plans has come into their hands
the jesuit is still at liberty
we understand so majesty
he knows his business
weve lost nothing
the workmen kneel to philip as he passes
tell the carpenters to go on working
no one is to stop for me

visitor for you sir
the tyger is in dock
raleigh emerges from his cabin to find bess waiting for him
the queen has sent you to me
yes tell the queen that i will trouble her no more
as soon as my ships repairs are complete i will ask permission to sail
the queen asks me to assure you i need no assurances
im no courtier and never have been
ive lost my appetite for playing games that it seems im too stupid to understand
that is unfair you call me unfair
let me speak
may blue draft june p
raleigh is taken aback by besss sudden anger
the queen shouts at you once and you sulk like a child
i thought you more of a man than that
and i thought you a better friend to the queen
her every move is watched by a hundred eyes
assassins plot to kill her
enemies prepare to overwhelm her country
and you say shes playing games
raleigh is watching her as she speaks and hes impressed
anger suits her
what is my queens command
go to her sir
as her friend
elizabeth is pacing disturbed raleighs letter open in her hand
the doors open
elizabeth waits for the servants to close the doors behind him
holds up the letter
you ask permission to go
you plan to return to the new world
to your colony

you may express your gratitude
this is too great an honour
if its such an honour why are you staring at your boots
you know why
he raises his eyes but he still doesnt look at her
now you stare at the wall
am i so old and hideous that you cant even look me in the face
he turns now and looks her in the face
why do you talk like a fool when youre anything but a fool
this stops her in her tracks
for a moment she cant trust herself to speak
then my friend forgive me
im a vain and foolish woman
at court its all a game
i like to be admired
i require it
i grow accustomed to it
but its all nothing

elizabeth contd you come here as if from another world and i you have real adventures you go where the maps end
i would follow you there if i could believe me
raleigh looks long into her eyes
if anything he admires and loves her all the more now
the storm clouds are gathering my friend
please dont leave me now
close on throckmorton as the noose is tightened round his neck
his face is ravaged by the tortures hes endured but he holds his head high ready for death
round him an unseen crowd bays for blood
lord have mercy on the soul of your servant who gives his life for your eternal truth
a candle lit cellar where reston and the conspirators pray for the condemned man heads bowed
abington bursts in
francis is about to die
we must act

his body flails
his neck breaks
a roar of bloodlust from the crowd
bess is on her knees before the simple altar her head bowed in prayer
raleigh enters through the rear doors
he stands in silence watching her as she prays
he hears her sigh
he takes a step towards her
she hears startled
turns and sees him
i didnt mean to disturb you
my prayers done
she rises to her feet
something has distressed you
and i thought i prayed in silence
so you did
she turns away unable to look him in the eyes
a man was hanged today
i knew him well
he was my cousin
he died because i gave information
i gave information to prove my loyalty
because i was afraid

thats the world we live in
he told me he wanted to change
become part of the new england
i was afraid that he was lying to me
but what if what if it was true
he sees the horror in her eyes at the thought that she has sent an innocent man to his death
tears rise to her eyes
what if i was his last hope
what if i was the one person he thought he could trust
if you knew him well you will have sensed the truth
i thought so
he was hoping to use you
you did what you had to do
she can no longer hold back the tears
he wipes away a tear from her cheek
in desperate need of comfort she throws herself into his arms
he holds her close as she sobs
were all mortal bess
we do what we can
he strokes her cheek
she meets his eyes filled with gratitude
she takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips
she kisses it still holding his eyes
he draws her back into his arms and they kiss
suddenly theyre kissing eagerly greedily their long pent up passion released at last

a brewers wagon pulled by two dray horses and carrying beer barrels crosses the ancient bridge over the moat and pulls up by the gates
the brewer a big ugly man called burton looks down at the guards
beside him taking care not to draw attention to himself sits ramsay

the moon seen through a sextant
a strange figure stands on the flat roof of a riverside house studying the night sky
hes tall with a long pointed beard and a skullcap the famous magus dr john dee
a hiss and splash from the night river
he turns to look
out of the mists and shadows comes the lights of an approaching barge
on the royal barge elizabeth and walsingham wrapped against night chill being rowed up river
over this lines led from the next scene ell dr dee
here i am again back to consult the wisdom of your charts
the finest library in england
the greatest array of scientific instruments
part study part laboratory part magicians lair dr dees house is crammed with the evidence of his wide ranging curiosity
may blue draft june p
the magus sits at a table before an astrological chart while elizabeth and walsingham look on
the alignment of the planets is most unusual this year
mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of your birth your majesty was born on september th and i see that twelve days before the
anniversary of your birth he transfers his attention to a different astronomical chart
there will be a full moon the moon which he moves back to the astrological chart
governs the fortunes of all princes of the female gender
princes of the female gender
i mean to say a prince who is also a woman
yes dr dee
i am following you
so what does it all mean
it means the rise of a great empire majesty
and it means convulsions also
the fall of an empire
elizabeth listens a faraway look in her eyes
she knows nothing of the planets but she feels it deep within herself her moment of destiny is near
which empire is to rise and which is to fall
that i cant say
astrology is as yet more an art than a science
may blue draft june p
walsingham has been idly examining the scientific instruments
he speaks now as if his question is casual
nothing more dr dee
no more specific calamities that we can guard against
he means will i be assassinated
queens are mortal
dr dee smiles as he gently contradicts him
elizabeth is mortal
the queen will never die
you see francis
this is a mystery
to dee he has no patience with mysteries
w what i dont know i cant use
and yet mysteries have power
have you not learned that
leave us for a moment
elizabeth turns to dr dee
now for a short private moment the queen becomes a woman
and the private life of this prince of the female gender dr dee
what do the stars foretell there
or is this too a mystery
these are matters of state majesty
do the stars not foretell matters of state
for such a prediction i must look in a different chart
may blue draft june p
he means her face
he murmurs to himself as he studies her features reading her character
out of such suffering to have forged such strength
you will need all your strength in days to come
so much love
but as he looks he finds something more that disturbs him
but you doubt yourself my child
ive not seen fear in your face before
have i reason to fear
something has weakened you
there is danger yes
your strength lies in your spirit
nothing else matters
there are hard days coming
you must trust the power of your spirit
elizabeth is shaken by these words
dee turns to look out once more at the night sky
but im no prophet
i see no more than the shadows of ghosts
an art not a science
the royal barge returns down the night river
elizabeth sits in silence gazing into the darkness deep in her own thoughts
raleigh and bess make love
elizabeth stands before a long mirror alone in her dressing chamber illuminated by lamp light

eston sits at the table writing by candle light
burton the brewer enters
reston leaps to his feet very tense
you have it
burton hands him the letter
reston opens it and reads it at speed
then he hands it to a man we dont see
what do you think
there must be clear and valid authority
he gazes at the unseen man waiting on his verdict
it wont do
reston nods agreement
he returns to the table and dashes off a letter muttering as he does so
we wait on a direct order
he completes the note and gives it to burton
one more journey my friend
then fiercely consummatum est
it is finished
bess lies restlessly asleep
suddenly she gives a start and wakes
she stifles a scream with her hands
on the far side of the room sitting watching her in silence is walsingham
ive always been a loyal servant of the queen
id never betray the queen never but you have my dear

the dancing master is instructing bess in the dance called la volta watched by the queen her ladies and courtiers
a trio of musicians plays a jaunty tune
to bess when i push like this my lady give a jump into the air
let him throw you round bess
you can trust him
the dancing master spins bess round and lifts her up into the air
her feet fly out as she spins
its a bold even risque dance and the onlookers laugh to see it
and round and round and round and down
he lowers bess to the ground
she loves it
as the spinning begins again raleigh enters
a volta mr raleigh

raleigh watches bess dance
you like your ladies to jump at your command
do you think that wrong
may blue draft june p
youre the queen
you are to be obeyed
to tell you the truth mr raleigh there are times when im tired of being always in control
you dont mean a word of it
you eat and drink control
do you say so
the exercise ends
bess you must try a dance with mr raleigh
hes eager to show us his skill
no skill at all majesty
i dont know the steps
oh its very simple
he goes to bess to demonstrate holding her by the waist
you stand like this with your hands firmly clasped here and when she jumps on the eighth step you swing her round once twice three times and youre back to
what could be simpler
your majesty knows the dance better than i
so come mr raleigh
take your position
i am to be obeyed
as your majesty wishes

raleigh takes his place with bess
hold her tight
i dont want her dropped
to the musicians play
the dance begins again
bess jumps and raleigh swings her round and round finding the knack after an awkward start
elizabeth watches smiling nodding to the beat
she can see the faces of the dancers and so long as she controls the intimacy between them shes excited by it
walsingham enters and stands by her side watching

reston contd with quiet steely satisfaction i think we have it
he hands the letter over
for the first time we see who it is william now revealed as one of the conspirators
william reads the letter for himself
nodding agreement this is the spark that will set england ablaze
reston takes out pistols and hands one to ramsay one to babington
r weve been patient long enough
let gods work begin
walsingham is at work at his desk
a knock on the door
walsingham does not look up from his papers
william enters wrapped in a cloak one hand concealed
still not looking up where have you been
we havent seen you for days
i met up with some old friends
from paris no doubt
and now youve come back
he looks up at last
do you know i can still remember the day you were born
he smiles but theres sadness in his eyes
may blue draft june p
i was eleven years old
and you this helpless bundle
i looked at you in your crib with your little wrinkled face and i loved you from the first
i vowed then to look after you
i watched you grow up with your head in the clouds always a dreamer
i couldnt follow you there
and now ive failed you havent i
forgive me if i havent loved you enough
something falls from williams hand to the floor
his face has gone grey
did you really think i didnt know
on the floor a dagger
william opens his mouth to answer but no sound comes out
walsingham raps twice on his desk
the door opens and agents and enter
was it for money
at least tell me you got a good price
illiam shakes his head
what would you murder your own brother for
whisper eternal life
walsingham stares at him
a great sadness building
the bribe no man can refuse
close on elizabeth surrounded by courtiers and bodyguards as she processes from the presence chamber to the chapel royal
as before the way is lined with eager supplicants
may blue draft june p
close on babington and ramsay forcing their way through the crowd to the front line
elizabeth disappears from view into the chapel
the queen is at her prayers
he chapel doors begin to close
ramsay hurls himself forward shouting god for mary
englands true queen
the guards run to seize him opening up a momentary space babington sprints through it for the closing chapel doors babington bursts into the chapel sees a line of ladies
kneeling masking the figure in front of the altar he pulls out a pistol elizabeth
elizabeth turns and rises to confront the assassins gun
babington stares at her hypnotised by her fearlessness
then he pulls the trigger
elizabeth still stares at him
babington lets out a cry of anguish and crumples to the ground
elizabeth stares on into space frozen by the moment magnificent
mary paces impatiently in her room trailed by her little dog
she hears the sound of bells
joy floods her features
she turns to see sir amyas paulet hurrying towards her through a gate in the wall
you bring news
may blue draft june p
the queen has been attacked yes
the assassin seized yes
the queen unharmed unharmed
and you maam are under arrest
he has led up to this deliberately and now stands smiling at her utter confusion
the man who looked like a fool has been playing his own game all along
what has any of this to do with me
paulet makes a sign
burton the brewer comes through the gate walsinghams man after all
thats the trouble with intrigue isnt it
with so many secrets you can never quite tell whos on whos side until the game ends
he takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it
my own invention
theatrical but effective
my master has every letter youve written
now she knows its over
she begins to weep
im surrounded by traitors
who am i to trust
may blue draft june p
she picks up her little dog weeping bitterly
only my little one
walsingham has a lamp in his hand
he moves slowly along a passage bowed down by a sense of failure
he directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a face
reston looks back unafraid
ready to die i see jesuit
i have done what i was sent to do
why was the gun not loaded
reston doesnt answer
walsingham gazes at him a moment longer
then he moves the lamp along
there shackled and white faced sit babington and ramsay
walsingham studies their faces
walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it into the next cell
here lies a man in chains huddled on the floor
he looks up as the light falls on him
walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight
what was the jesuit sent to do
to kill the queen
you know it
you know everything
not quite everything
ive told you all i know
go ahead and kill me
take whats left of me
i dont care any more
all my life youve had everything and ive had nothing
so finish it
theres a better world waiting for me
well all be judged in the end brother
walsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride
orchid revision june p
youre no martyr
you werent even much of a murderer
go back to france
back to your dreams
never let me hear of you again
walsingham turns away
as he goes we see what he wont show william that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than he can bear
he goes back up the passage
as he passes reston the jesuit calls out softly
send me home
hilip sits listening intently staring into space the infanta by his side
don guerau de spes is briefing him
they have letters in mary stuarts own hand

all goes to plan
he turns to the infanta
my dearest how would you like to be queen of england

elizabeth sits deep in thought bess by her side
shadows all round
they say shes taller than me
her hair is chestnut in colour
her eyes are hazel
they say shes beautiful
but people lie
they say i am beautiful
a dismissive shrug
clearly she does not think herself beautiful
she plotted to kill you
yes its true
ive read her letters
i too was a prisoner once
ive feared for my life
ive done terrible things just to live
so do we all
i can be merciful
but she protests her innocence and that is a lie
why will she not admit she has wronged me
shell go on lying til you cut out her traitors heart
elizabeth stares at her in surprise
you used to be gentler bess
i used to be quieter majesty
mary stuart sits before her accusers in the great hall of this sombre castle her new prison
she wears black but she is proud composed and beautiful
she is faced by a commission of lords appointed to try her
orchid revision june p
a who are you to sit in judgement on me
by what authority do you condemn a queen
god alone has made me what i am
he is my only judge
raise your law above gods law and what law remains
in your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule
you know neither who you are nor what you do
but i know who i am
i die as i have lived trusting in the mercy of my god a queen
elizabeth raging at walsingham
mary stuart must die
where is it written
who dares to give orders to the queen
majesty this is no time for mercy dont preach at me old man
look at you
you can hardly stand
go home to your wife
go home to your bed
the law must have its way

the law is for common men not for princes
walsingham sees theres no point in persisting
he bows and withdraws
raleigh comes hurrying towards the queens quarters
bess sees him approaching and comes out to meet him
they speak low not wanting the ever present guards to hear them
thank god youve come
ive never seen her so distressed
shes been alone in her rooms since morning
shell see no one
has she asked for me
but she needs you
i know she does
raleigh takes besss b hand in his discreetly

elizabeth sits alone deep in thought
raleigh enters and comes before her
she doesnt look round but she knows its him
still she doesnt turn to him
did bess bid you come
have you too come to tell me i must murder a queen
you dont need me to instruct you in your duty
was it my fathers duty to murder my mother
i would be loath to die so bloody a death
since when were you so afraid
now she looks at him
yes i am afraid
i am always afraid
raleigh looks back at her in silence for a long moment
then you fear your soul will be touched
royalty is close to immortality
kill a queen and queens are mortal
you understand me well
we mortals have many weaknesses
we feel too much
hurt too much
and all too soon we die
but we do have the chance of love

mary stuart at supper feeding titbits from the table to her little dog
sir amyas paulet enters
mary sees at once from his face that he brings grave news
may blue draft june p
your face tells me
annette her maid bursts into wailing sobs
mary herself goes very still
shes starting to carry out her final strategy
please dont cry
the great timbered hall of the castle has been specially prepared for the execution
a stage has been constructed in the centre and around the stage are chairs upon which dignitaries and members of parliament are already sitting
the block dominates the stage
beside it the hooded executioner with his axe
the dean of peterborough in his clerical robes
here are more chairs in the body of the hall occupied by members of the public
they are all waiting for the performance to begin
he people crane their necks to see her
she doesnt disappoint
she is wearing a black velvet gown her luxurious auburn hair tied in a bunch
her ladies following her in procession show signs of weeping and distress but mary herself glides to the platform with a regal bearing
n her face there is a look that is almost ecstatic
she knows whats happening
she cant rest or be at peace
she tries to sit then paces becoming more and more agitated
as mary mounts the stage the executioner kneels
forgiveness your grace

i forgive you with all my heart for now i hope you will make an end of all my troubles
she stands smiling still and holds out her arms to let her ladies disrobe her
ow deeply distressed elizabeth suddenly bursts out of the privy chamber into the great presence chamber tears welling into her eyes
bess close behind her
she hardly notices the people around her until she sees raleigh
i want it stopped
marys black dress falls to the ground revealing underneath a petticoat of dark red silk the colour of martyrdom
there is a collective gasp from the spectators
elizabeth is hysterical shouting in raleighs restraining arms
it must be stopped
mary kneels puts her head on the block
into your hands o lord i commend my spirit
she stretches out her arms as a signal
the axe comes down
elizabeth cries out as if the axe has fallen on her neck
then she sinks sobbing to the ground supported by both raleigh and bess and for a moment the three are united in a single embrace

god save the queen
on the faces of the awed spectators

a gasp of horror from the spectators
the dead womans skirts are moving
out from under her skirts creeps her little dog

annette takes the dog into her arms
he sound of cheering crowds outside in the plaza calling out the one spanish word war
hilip enters from the balcony walking briskly holding the infanta by the hand
he comes to a stop before his assembled ministers
his eyes shine
a sweet and christian lady lies martyred slain by a godless childless bastard
blood must pay for blood
we have just and holy cause
i call the legions of christ to war
blood soaked virgin elizabeth
you will pay with your country your throne and your life
on walsingham as he walks through the palace
in my weakness and my vanity i have failed you
walsingham on his knees before elizabeth abasing himself in shame
elizabeth is in control once more
how have you failed me
what am i to forgive you for
may blue draft june p
philip of spain is a god fearing man
he cannot make war without just cause
he sent the jesuit to kill a queen
but not you
the jesuits mission was to draw mary stuart into the murder plot
he knew i was reading her every letter
he waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt
now elizabeth gets it
slowly and i ordered her execution
i murdered gods anointed queen
and now gods most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me
forgive me majesty
let me go
elizabeth hardly hears him any more
she realises the end game is upon her
elizabeth never even looks at him
shes looking into the distance preparing herself for what must now come
the great standard of the armada bearing the image of the virgin is carried into the cathedral
philip follows leading a column of spains noblest grandees and princes of the church
the archbishop sprinkles holy water onto the standard and makes the sign of the cross over it
exurge domine et vindica causam tuam
philip kneels to kiss the blessed standard which is then thrust aloft again into the vast spaces of the cathedral
may blue draft june p
and at once there is a great outpouring of emotion the congregation applauding many weeping at the sight
elizabeth is alone pacing slowly reading a book the consolation of philosophy by boethius
she reads pauses looks into the far distance then reads and walks again
think you that there is any certainty in the affairs of mankind when you know that one swift hour can destroy the greatest among us
she turns and there is raleigh
she holds up her book
the consolation of philosophy
thank you for coming at this late hour
she closes her book and puts it away
were at war
who knows when well meet again
if well meet again
may the lord god preserve englands queen
the same god in whose name philip wages his holy war
philip is a righteous man and righteous men love to destroy
they burn whole worlds to make them pure and leave behind ashes
hell not burn england
his armada is invincible they say
if london falls i fall
if england is lost i am lost

dont you ever think that one day perhaps one day soon you too will die
the closer i come to death the more i want to live
the hungrier i am for life
his defiant energy breaks elizabeths morbid mood
we must live while we can
why be afraid of tomorrow
todays all we have and all we know
they hold each others eyes
i wish but she cant say it
ive never known a woman like you
in some other time in some other world could you have loved me

raleigh intuits what she wants
he comes closer as she speaks
e something not to be spoken of afterwards to be forgotten but just for now she lifts her head to his
she meets his eyes
he takes her in his arms and they kiss
one kiss to hold all that might have been all that they both know can never be
when at last they part she turns away from him head bowed eyes still closed holding on to the sweet moment
close images as the armada standard is carried in procession to the flagship and hoisted into position on the ships towering prow
cannons fire a booming salute
as the standard billows in the breeze beyond it we see the forest of masts that make up the great armada
the palace is galvanised by the invasion threat
armed men go by at the double passing servants hauling out trolleys bearing valuables as the court prepares for the worst
raleigh and howard stride fast across the guard chamber the first of the sequence of great rooms
they are deep in war talk
bess appears ahead and beckons him to a secluded corner

raleigh stares at her stunned
more people are passing
this is no place for r displays of strong feeling

im a ward of the queen
i cant court a man without her permission
i cant marry without her permission
as for having a child another official passes by

aleigh gazes at her deeply moved
the queens ladies come hurrying by
margaret calls to bess as they go
to raleigh goodbye
she runs after the ladies
raleigh walks slowly after them down the hall
on his face a new look forms
he knows now what hes going to do
an empty horizon
then on the very line of the horizon the ghost of a movement
far away too small to make out something is coming

elizabeth starts up in bed calls out in sudden fear
i must have air
her servants hurry in and open the window
elizabeth goes to the open window and breathes in deeply
she looks up at the moon
with this ring i thee wed

raleigh and bess are being married in secret by a priest
the only witness is besss fellow maid of honour margaret
raleigh makes his vow tenderly and lovingly his eyes on bess throughout
and with all my worldly goods h i thee endow

in the name of the father he moves the ring to her forefinger and of the son to her index finger and of the holy spirit
and finally onto her ring finger

this spanish armada is at sea carrying an army of ten thousand men
indicating on the map the duke of parma has fifteen thousand men on the french coast
they plan to cross the channel in barges under the protection of the spanish fleet and sail up the thames
but they dont yet have enough barges at calais
we have a little time
surprised that is so
our forces defend the thames entrance at tilbury
how many men
we have three possibly four thousand majesty
if the spanish fleet reaches calais in strength the combined armies will be beyond our power to resist
therefore the spanish fleet must not reach calais
majesty this vast armada will surely smash through our naval defences
we must be prepared for the worst
lizabeth walks briskly through the great public rooms back to her quarters with walsingham by her side and her entourage following behind
may blue draft p
how did you know about the numbers of the dutch barges majesty
i dont recall supplying you with that information
you may observe walsingham that i dont see my way with only one eye
nor do i hop along on only one leg
why then would i rely on only one source of information
she sweeps into her quarters
her ladies waiting there jump up in haste
she scans them
her eyes coem to rest on margaret
she sees that margaret knows something
where is she
we are on the very tip of england
a watch tower has been built and next to it a large beacon of wood
a young man is minding the watch
he stares out to sea catching sight of something
over the rim of the world has appeared the long line of the spanish fleet like a floating wall black and menacing
e runs down the steps from the tower
he lights a bundle of sticks and thrusts them again and again into the beacon
the beacon catches fire
as the flames rise into the sky so a second beacon erupts into flame on the next headland
and then a third on the next a fourth on the next a fifth disappearing around the coastline
doors burst open and elizabeth comes storming out barely containing a powerful rage
bess comes running from the far end

here my lady
is it true
are you married
are you with child
are you with child
bess stands before her with her head bowed
yes my lady
elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage striking out at her beating her about the head shrieking out the words that so inflame and wound her
bess takes the blows in silence
you dare to have secrets from me
i am your queen
you ask my permission before you rut before you marry before you breed
my bitches wear my collars
do you hear me
how dare you be with child
walsingham comes hobbling up
dignity mercy but elizabeth is too far gone
she turns on him eyes blazing
this is no time for mercy
thats what you said to me
i dont forget
but you showed mercy walsingham
go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business
alsingham turns white
elizabeth is back berating bess
is it his child
is the child his

bess responds to the queens hysteria with dignity
yes my lady
it is my husbands child
her gaze reaches beyond the queen

raleigh has come up to them unnoticed
he has seen and heard all
he speaks to elizabeth quietly sadly
this is not the queen i love and serve
elizabeth stares at him
he meets her eyes
his gaze is so unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her
when she speaks next she is her proud self again
this gentleman has seduced a lady under my care
this lady has married without my consent
these are offences punishable by law
to walsingham arrest him
rom way up high we see beacon after warning beacon bursting into flame the light from them describing the contours of england
as they rush on they suddenly divide some continuing along the coast others racing inland
dr dee watches as elizabeth prowls his cluttered rooms releasing the tension that has swelled to bursting point within her
the fall of an empire you told me
did you mean the english empire
because by god england will not fall while i am queen
if thats your prophecy sir prophesy again
you want me to tell your majesty only what your majesty chooses to hear

i will not be a toy of the fates
have i not faced an assassins bullet and lived
she turns to dr dee and sees his quizzical gaze on her and she lets her rage pass
just tell me theres no certainty
the shadows of ghosts you said
any outcome is possible
give me hope
the forces that shape the world are greater than all of us majesty
how can i promise you that theyll conspire in your favour even though you are the queen
but this much i know
when the storm breaks each man acts in accordance with his own nature
some are dumb with terror
and some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind
she draws herself up finding now the self belief she needs for the battle to come
youre a wise man dr dee
and you madam are a very great lady
lizabeth stares out of the window watches as the last beacon is kindled not far away and bursts into flame
behind her stand her ministers hatton howard and walsingham

one by one they look up surprised uncertain
now they hear it loud and clear the beat of an army on the march
close on tramping feet

horses hooves beating the ground

images of the beginning of the destruction of the armada philips portrait is covered by water inside a sinking cabin a madonna statue floats a spanish battle flag burst into
raging waves black sea
the howl of the storm the rending of breaking timbers the screams of drowning men
somewhere out there tiny in the vast seascape the armada is being smashed into oblivion
elizabeth stands there drinking in the tempest the wind lashing her clothes and hair but she loves it lives it breathes it
this is her storm her victory
the space that echoed before to the chants of war is silent now
philip and the infanta come down the nave
philips face is set expressionless
philip reaches the steps at the foot of the altar
he goes down on his knees
then he drops further down to abase himself on the hard stone floor
the cardinals turn their backs to him
he infanta remains standing beside him impassive staring at nothing
she throws down her elizabeth doll
may blue draft p
a low sob from philip
elizabeth triumphant in the roaring wind
from inside a cave looking out to sea a scene of devastation
dead spanish sailors have been washed up amongst planks barrels and a torn spanish ensign
a long scream of pain close on bess screaming in pain
a final spasm passes through her
she sinks back
the cry of a new born child
she hears and her exhausted face lights up with a radiant smile
walsingham lies in bed his eyes closed
his wife ursula and daughter mary in the background
lizabeth has come to him
she looks down on him with deep concern
my old friend
an anonymous man agent walks down a shabby paris street
stops before a small anonymous house
the anonymous man is let into the house by a figure we dont yet see
he looks round the room
a fire burning in the grate
english books on the table
a half eaten meal
i come from your brother
now we see who he speaks to william
may blue draft p
what does he want
he asks your forgiveness
on william he stares
then he understands
fear brings sudden tears to his eyes
walsinghams man has plunged a knife into his heart
walsingham speaks to his queen with difficulty
i have served your majesty in all things
i know it old friend
dont leave me now
walsinghams eyes open
a weak smile
ou dont need me any more
permission to go elizabeth looks tenderly down on him shaking her head
you always did do as you pleased whether i wanted it or not
ive no doubt youll do as you please now
he lets his eyes close
she stoops down and kisses his cheek
we see raleigh from behind
hes holding something and dancing slowly about and crooning a low song in the oddest way
beyond him half glimpsed an inner room where bess is resting on a bed
now in his solitary dance raleigh turns and we see hes holding a new born baby boy
he kisses the babys little bald head and sings his wordless song
the door opens and a royal servant enters followed by other servants and guards
her majesty the queen
elizabeth enters in formal style
she stands and takes in the scene raleigh holding his baby son the room beyond bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to the queen
elizabeth seems not to see her
a regal wave at the servants and guards
elizabeth stalks round the room
no reason to suppose her displeasure has passed
when was the birth
our nights ago
the mother is well
now elizabeth turns to bess and their eyes meet
the queen puts out her hand and touches bess lightly on one cheek
a silent forgiveness
and the child
my son is well
now for the first time she looks at the baby
your elizabeth has a child
you must be proud
elizabeth moves away unable to bear seeing the baby
as any man can be
elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment
and do you still dream of your shining city your new world
more than ever
she turns to go
but before she reaches the door she stops
id like to give your son my blessing
i would be honoured
elizabeth takes the baby in her arms
she holds him carefully
she finds herself more moved than she had expected
she bends her head over him and turns her back on raleigh
raleigh watches and waits
on elizabeth her cheek pressed to the babys head
her eyes closed
i am called the virgin queen
and yet i have many children
you are all my children
there is no jewel be it never so rich a prize which i put before this jewel i mean your love
i want no more wars
england is enough for me
i want no lordship over your souls
only a free people can love
beat and in your love is my life
