written by richard kelly based on the short story by richard matheson sep th crickets chirp in the night
a doorbell rings
a bedside lamp is turned on
norma lewis sits up in bed
the soft glow of the lamp casts her in silhouette
her husband arthur lewis lies next to her
did you hear something
are you sure that was the doorbell
from down below
the doorbell rings again
norma retrieves her watch from the bedside table
what time is it
quarter til five
norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe
arthur sits up hair sticking up in every direction
he has sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers
norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door
she looks through the peephole
through the peephole
she glimpses a black sedan idling in the street
it quickly drives off
norma unlatches the dead bolt and opens the door
she notices something at her feet
someone has left a cardboard box on the front step
its dimensions are x x she leans down and picks up the box noticing that it has been meticulously sealed with clear tape
there are no markings on it whatsoever
norma looks down the quiet empty street
she quickly closes the door and turns inside and away from the cold air
arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs
what is it
someone left a box
i dont know
there was a car waiting
but they drove off
norma hands the box to arthur
he examines it
is that one of my christmas presents
their young son walter lewis is standing at the top of the stairs
he is dressed in his pajamas
his parents just stare back at him in silence
the lewis family has now moved into the kitchen
wrapping paper and christmas ornaments are scattered across the table
norma is pouring coffee
arthur is cutting through the tape that seals the box with a knife while walter looks on eagerly
should i close my eyes
its up to you
arthur opens the lid and sees that there are foam peanuts inside
he digs down and retrieves a wooden box
its dimensions are x x
the box is made of white oak with a clear varnish
mounted on top is a clear glass dome attached to a lid with a hinge mount
inside of the dome is a cylindrical metal button
is there a note
arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small white envelope
printed on the envelope in calligraphy is the name its for you norma
norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white stationary
printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence mr
steward will call upon you at do i know a mr
you tell us
arthur is now showered and shaven dressed for work
he and walter sit at the kitchen table waiting for norma to deliver breakfast
the box sits on the table between them
arthur opens up the newspaper
arthur turns the page
what kind of car was it
i couldnt see
it was dark and didnt have my contacts in
why would they just drive off
i dont know
but the bus will be here if five minutes
norma and walter emerge from the house onto the front porch
she hands him his lunch box and a winter hat
snow has begun to fall from the sky
last day of school and now it starts to snow
put on your hat
a young girl dana is waiting at the end of the sidewalk
she is wrapped head to toe in warm clothes
earmuffs and scarf around her neck
muffled through scarf hi mrs
good morning dana
and please call me norma
youre making me feel old
you are old
im thirty one
to us thats old
youre a geezer
well youll be a geezer one day too smarty pants
norma closes her eyes taking in a breath of cold air
snowflakes land in her face and hair
looking at his watch
why does the bus stop have to be at the end of our driveway
so i can watch my little walter get on his bus
safe in one piece
down the street a school bus begins to crest the hill
youre embarrassing me
my love embarrasses you
yes it does
she begins to walk down the sidewalk
taunting him as the bus approaches
what if i give little walter a little kiss in front of all his friends on the school bus
danas eyes widen
a mischievous grin emerges from behind the scarf that covers the lower part of her face
the bus is fast approaching
brakes squealing as it slows to a stop
dont come any closer
norma gives him a big hug and a kiss right as the bus doors open
a bunch of older kids stare out the window
scowling at him
walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus
dana follows him
youre baby sitting for us tonight right
dana gets on the bus
bud wall s the bus driver smiles at norma
he is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved head
bus driver bud
our last day
itll all be over soon norma
he stares at her for a moment that is almost too long
then shuts the doors to the bus
arthur sits at the table
reading the morning paper
the camera zooms into the comics section
revealing the panels of the comic strip rex morgan md
arthur begins reading the voices of rex morgan and his girlfriend june
as rex morgan do you realize that this is the first time in my life that i will be taking more than a weeks vacation june
norma arrives in the kitchen
she now has a slight limp
as june hi pitched and enjoy it
dont worry about the office
i need you back here no later than seven
rehearsal dinner starts at eight
arthur grabs his briefcase and a basketball
the viking squad has a game at four
dont get stuck in friday traffic
he starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor
she grabs the ball in mid bounce
annoyed with him
not in the house
hows your foot
she pushes him toward into the family room
opening the door that leads out to the garage
they exit the house and the camera drifts back toward the kitchen table
moving in toward the box
the garage door opens and both of the lewis family cars back out at the same time almost choreographed in perfect unison
arthur drives a silver pontiac trans am
norma drives a white oldsmobile station wagon with wood walls
they pull out onto monument avenue cars pointing in opposite directions
arthur rolls down his window
its your christmas present
from your secret lover
she furrows her brow
i hate you rex morgan md
i hate you too
dont be late tonight
ive got your present at work
its almost finished
then peels off down monument ave
from normas rear view mirror
arthurs car disappears down the road
she reaches up to re adjust
her eyes appear in the mirrors reflection
insert normas virginia license plate
the oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite direction
helicopter shot the camera crests over the barren winter forest on the southeast side of the city
tipping up to reveal downtown richmond virginia
its twenty three degrees on this december morning here in richmond
the camera moves over the downtown expressway
heavy traffic moves in either direction
the camera approaches the side of arthurs trans am as it crests around the interstate exchange onto route at the historical clock tower of main street train station
the french government in what was seen here as a gesture to president elect jimmy carter announced thursday a further tightening of controls over the exportation of nuclear technology
the camera swoops down alongside the drivers side of arthurs car
moving into the side view mirror
his face reflected in the mirror
listening to the radio as he begins his southbound commute to work
the camera pulls back from
a sign at the entrance to collegiate
an exclusive private school
normas station wagon pulls into the school parking lot
the camera tracks with norma as makes her way through the crowded hallway
filled with loud teenagers from the age of
has gotten worse
she winks at someone
then turns a corner and the camera whips around to reveal walter standing at his locker
he closes the door revealing dana and another friend named charles standing there
why does your mom limp
is something wrong with her foot
thats none of your business
dana saw her take her shoe off in the parking lot yesterday
theres definitely something wrong with her foot
it looks mangled
you didnt say mangled
you said it looked gross
walter lunges at charles and pushes him up against the locker
awkwardly trying to fight him
they continue to wrestle awkwardly for a moment against the lockers and then walter lets go
if you ever make fun of my mom again ill kill you
walter storms off down the hall
the camera moves through the school office as teachers and receptionists move about in preparation for the last day approaching a frosted glass door that reads norma sits across from
the desk of william poates the principal of the school
the board came to a vote last week so its official
theyve officially cancelled the faculty tuition discount
so what does that mean for me
youre going to have to start paying full tuition for your son
norma notices a small drop of blood forming in his right nostril
im real sorry about this norma
yeah me too
ive got three weeks to figure out how to tell my son we cant afford to send him to collegiate any more
the drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip
like i said im real sorry
your nose is bleeding
poates reaches for his handkerchief and puts it to his face wiping off the blood
the morning bell rings
norma walks hurriedly down the empty hallway
her limp has gotten worse as the morning grind has now begun
norma comes into her classroom
a science lab with sinks and bunsen burners mounted in marble top desks
kids are moving about
loud and rambunctious
everyone quiet down
take your seats
norma moves toward a stack of metal trays on her desk
inside of each tray is a ball of black mush
today is the day many of you have been eagerly awaiting
you get to dissect owl pellets
a male student pumps his fist
norma sets an owl pellet down in front of a female student
she looks at the owl pellet in disgust
this is so gross
norma sets a tray down in front of charles
why do they call it an owl pellet
a male student next to him takes his tray from norma
because they shit out of their mouths
watch the language
you say another cuss word ive gotta send you to detention okay
is it true
is what true
that owls poo out of their mouths
this is true
the classroom gasps in disgust
grey forest owls feed upon field mice squirrels and small birds
the owl will then regurgitate the bones and waste matter in a ball of black mucous
inside this mucous you will likely find the entire skeleton of its prey
norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a screen
im going to show you a film about the digestive process of the owl and how the owl pellet is formed
the classroom whispers with excitement
arthur pulls through the entrance gate at the nasa langley research center
he retrieves his badge from the dashboard and shows it to the guard
arthurs car drives down main street on the campus of the research center
the buildings are predominately drab functional one story brick structures
surrounded by various globe structures and pipe networks on manicured green lawns
the camera tracks with arthur as he moves through the crowded corridor of one of the research buildings
he says hello to various colleagues along the way
all of the men at the facility are dressed the same
with white shirts and ties and pocket protector badges
the place resembles an all male community college for young scientists
arthur eases his way into the small crowded auditorium that serves as a media room
a press conference is underway
norm cahill s the viking project coordinator is standing at the podium
next to him is an overhead projector with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a its been five months since the viking lander touched down on the surface
weve seen dozens of photographs of the rock covered surface
what can you now tell us about the tests youve been conducting
is there any sign of life on the red planet
arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium
there are three separate tests that weve been conducting
pyrolytic release labeled release and gas exchange
the first two tests based on soil samples about centimeters deep came back negative
and the third is
laughter erupts from various parts of the auditorium
can you elaborate on test number three
cahill places a transparent map of the mars surface on the overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a wax the gas exchange experiment measures the production or
uptake of c nitrogen methane hydrogen and oxygen during the incubation of the martian soil sample
are you showing us all of the photos
are there little green men up there
laughter from the press
there is a possibility that the planet abounds with chemical compounds produced by living systems
their chemical nature distribution and structural uniqueness could be used to argue the presence of microscopic living organisms on mars
as cahill moves on to the next question
arthur taps the reporter on the shoulder
it all comes down to water
arthur points to an overhead satellite photo of utopia planitia a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity of the site where viking ii landed
there are dry river bed formations in the soil
if we find water beneath the surface
and the topographic maps of utopia planitia indicate that there were once rivers on the surface of the planet its possible that well eventually find evidence of life
the owl pellet film is underway
norma sits in the back of the class next to the projector
she crosses her legs
reaching for her foot
massaging it gently
clearly in intense pain
charles looks back at her
they make eye contact
and charles turns back to the screen
arthur now sits across from cahill in his office
behind him is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory
im sorry arthur but theyve denied your application to be admitted into the astronaut program
arthur looks crushed
can i ask why
im sorry son
but they dont tell us why
the camera tracks through a large laboratory in the heart of one of the main buildings on the langley campus
work tables assembled with laboratory equipment and machinery extend out into infinity as dozens of young men all dressed in similar white shirts with nasa id badges move throughout engaged
in various tasks
arthur is standing at a laboratory table with a white mask on
he is wearing a lab coat and glasses
he pours pink liquid onto the surface of a metal pan
filling it to the edges
a colleague named wendell james walks over to see what he is doing
are they really with holding some of the mars photos
i dont know man
whats that smell
its a salinic compound
what are you making
christmas present for norma
arthur retrieves a white ceramic mold
the mold has an extrusion that is shaped like a womans foot
only the end of the foot is round and missing its toes save for the pinky a new prosthesis for her foot
arthur carefully impresses the mold of his wifes foot into the pink goop
sealing the mold at the edges into the tray
what did you change up this time
the compound theyre developing for the pilot chairs on the space shuttle
insert the bones of a field mouse have been re assembled in rough form within the tray
as the owl pellet has been ripped apart
the tray belongs to charles and he has grown tired of dissecting the owl pellet
he looks up to the head of the class and sees that norma is sitting up on her desk
filing her nails
waiting out the last remaining minutes of the period
she raises her head
what happened to your foot
she just stares at him
to my foot
she saw you take your shoe off
that theres something wrong with it
the whole class goes silent
norma begins to blush
she looks down at her right foot hidden inside of a closed toe shoe
its a long story
she looks at her watch
weve got five minutes until second period
she looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has been piqued
she has no choice now but to tell them
ill tell you what happened to my foot
arthur sits at the table with wendell
waiting for the mold to dry
arthur is dealing a deck of cards as they begin a game of gin rummy
when she was seventeen
still living in texas her brother dropped a barbell on her foot
broke three of her toes
the camera pans across the faces of students as they listen to her tell the story
and so i go to see the doctor
he goes to take an x ray of my foot to see if the bones are broken
then retrieves a replacement card from the stack
so this dumb ass richmond doctor takes the x ray
then he goes to check on another patient down the hall
arthur discards a king
this dumb ass
he left the x ray machine on
thats not good
norma raises up her right shoe to show the class
they found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completely destroyed by the radiation
norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot against her left inner thigh
so they have to amputate four of my toes
and then they had to take a bunch of skin from my inner thigh to cover the front of my foot
this is back in
so they didnt have the skin graft techniques they do now
arthur stands up and takes his right foot
pulls it up and touches it to his left inner thigh
she had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months waiting for it to heal
wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table
i hope she sued this idiot
her family sued
what was the settlement
forty thousand dollars
arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop
and we see the impression of her disfigured foot inside the new norma turns around and uncrosses her legs
they now dangle over the edge of the lab desk
you guys want to see it
now that the secret is out
i dont want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot
the class responds enthusiastically
take a look at the freak show
as the kids gather around
norma removes her right shoe and reveals her disfigured foot
missing every toe but her pinky
a rounded piece of scar tissue covers the rest of it
arthur takes the trimmed prosthesis and wraps it in tissue paper then places it in a cardboard box with a red bow on it
if this sucker works
she can start jogging again
dana walks up to walter as he stands in front of his locker
im sorry i said that her foot looked gross
it doesnt look gross
it looks cool
and if you cant tell the difference between gross and cool
then i feel sorry for you dana
walter walks off
leaving her alone
norma emerges from her car carrying grocery bags in both arms
walter comes out of the garage with his bike
why do i need a baby sitter
because youre nine years old
youre not a geezer yet
times are changing
nine years old isnt what it used to be
i think im ready to get a moped
were not buying you a moped walter
stick with the bike
and be home before dark
walter rides off down the street
norma comes into the foyer groceries in hand
the phone is ringing
norma comes into the kitchen sets the groceries down on the kitchen table
she grabs the phone off the wall and puts it to her ear
there is silence on the other end of the line
a moment of silence
then the caller disconnects
norma hangs up the phone and starts unloading the groceries
the box sits on the table
but she takes no notice of it
arthur emerges from a nasa campus gymnasium into the twilight with wendell
both are covered in sweat dressed in gym clothes
arthur is carrying his basketball and a gym bag
hows the commute back to richmond
not too bad
maybe an hour and twenty minutes
tell norma i said hello
wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking lot
approaching his car
he lights a cigarette and takes a drag
then looks at his watch
insert his watch shows that it is pm
norma sits on the couch
smoking a cigarette
on the television
the local news is playing
the doorbell rings
norma opens the front door
a man named arlington steward is standing there his body is turned in profile
he is wearing a crisp wool suit and a black hat with a briefcase in his right hand
my name is arlington steward
her eyes light up as she remembers the name and the box
arlington then rotates his body
revealing the right side of his face
normas eyes widen in horror at what she sees
nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone to his lower jaw has been burned away
his rear molars and gums are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is supposed to conceal them
norma immediately feels a strange connection
a deep sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured
i assume you received the box that i left on your doorstep
his speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends to the right side of his mouth
yes we did
and you retrieved the button unit inside of the box
he smiles back at her
the button unit
thats what you call it
may i come in
norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen
she retrieves the button unit from the table
so what it this thing
i assume youre trying to sell me something
in a way yes
i do have an offer to make
what are you selling
a financial opportunity
arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase
he places the briefcase down on the table
he takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the kitchen table
they both sit down
he then withdraws a small yellow envelope from his suit jacket pocket
inside of this envelope is a key
arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small metal key
this is the key that opens the glass dome of the button unit
arlington then inserts the key into a small horizontal slot at the top edge
he turns the key and the lid that houses the glass dome pops lose
the metal button is now exposed
if you push the button one of two things will happen
somewhere in the world
who you do not know
norma just stares at him
then you will receive a payment of two hundred thousand dollars
arlington opens the briefcase
inside are neatly stacked rows of one hundred dollar bills
the money will be delivered to you in cash
norma covers her mouth
shocked at the sight of so much money
are you for real
arlington smiles back at her
lewis i can assure you that the offer is real
who do you work for
the guarantee of payment has several restrictions
i am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers
if you discuss the details of this financial opportunity with anyone other than your husband the offer is null and void and you will not receive the money in return
for having pushed the button
you have twenty four hours
arlington glances at his watch
you have until five oclock tomorrow evening to make your decision whether or not to push the button
at that time i will return to retrieve the button unit from you
it will be re programmed and the offer will be made to someone else
arlington places the key back into the envelope seals it with crisp precision and hands it over to her
he then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave
a good day to you mrs
he nods his head and turns toward the foyer
she follows him toward the front door
wait a minute
youre just going to leave me with this thing
is this some kind of joke
who are you
he opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly smile
my name is arlington steward and i can assure you that this is no joke
the offer is real but i am not at liberty to disclose any more information than i already have
he withdraws a business card and hands it to her
he heads down the walk toward his car
she looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed in an embossed black font
she turns the card over and sees what looks like a phone number printed on the back she stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the automobile
start the engine and drive off
walter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in carytown
dana approaches him
he turns to face her
what do you want
i just wanted to tell you
that i think your mom is beautiful
walter just stares at her in silence
wanting to forgive her
norma walks back into the kitchen holding the key envelope in one hand and the business card in the other
she stares at them both then down at the box
she then retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the slot opening the glass dome
she stares at the button for a long moment
then closes the dome
she closes her eyes
trying to make sense of what has just transpired
the camera zooms out from a ringing phone that sits on a kitchen counter in a large suburban house
susan burns s goes to answer the phone
the camera continues to zoom out revealing her husband jim burns s laid out in a recliner watching television
is something wrong
norma stares at the business card
something just happened and
i dont want to talk about it right now
susan carries the phone into the family room alright
covering the phone jim
you gotta get ready
he sits up and moves toward the stairs
wait until you see the spread tonight
norma twirls the phone cord around her finger
i think theyre spending more on their wedding than we did on our house
is your foot acting up again
norma leans against the wall
lifting her right foot off the floor to ease the pain
a little yeah
that damn bone
the skin from my leg its not as tough as it should be
you know hes gonna be there tonight
norma takes this in
its been what
bound to run into each other at some point right
norma is now wearing only her bra and panties her hair and make up flawless
she finishes putting on a pair of diamond as she steps into an elegant cocktail dress
we see the deep square shaped scars on the inside of her left thigh
norma comes into the bedroom
and arthur is there
putting on his cuff links
he is dressed in a tuxedo
his jacket is laid out on the bed and next to it is his christmas present
norma sees it
a little gift from dr
she opens the present and retrieves the prosthesis
oh my god
norma removes an old store bought insole from her right shoe and inserts the new one
its a material they developed for the new shuttle chairs
itll absorb the pressure of your foot and re distribute it across the entire surface area
she then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe
and begins to walk around the room
oh my god rex
howd you do it
i just figured out a way to make it better
she crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss
i dont know what id do without you
merry christmas june
norma and arthur come into the family room wearing their winter coats
walter is sitting across the coffee table with dana
they are playing cards
the box is sitting between them
steward show up
norma sees the box sitting there and immediately grabs it off the table
whats it all about
did he show up
ill tell you about it in the car
were running late
norma leans down and kisses walter on the cheek
well be home late
your bedtime is ten
dana watches them go
her eyes transfixed on the box in normas hands
the camera tracks with arthurs car as it drives south on cary street
approaching an intersection
norma has the box sitting in her lap while arthur drives
and before i could ask him anything else
he got in his car
and he pulled off
did you get the license plate
your dad is cop norma
always get the license plate number
i was little overwhelmed arthur
somewhere in the world
someone you do not know will die
those were his exact words
did he say how they would die
and he showed you the cash
he said it was two hundred thousand
it looked real to me
what did he look like
you dont want to know
i think hes a burn victim
half of his face is gone
i think maybe hes a life insurance salesman
maybe thats what it is
its some kind of survey
we push the button and he offers us a discount on a two hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy
jokes on us
the camera descends upon the country club of virginia
it is a massive colonial mansion that sits upon a huge hill that is littered with christmas luminaries that glow in the night
we approach arthurs car as they pull into a parking space in front of the main entrance
arthur grabs the box from off her lap
did you bring the key with you
she hands it to him
he takes the key and inserts it
opening the glass dome
he then takes his index finger and places it on the button
what the hell are you doing
i was gonna push the button
norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed
you think its for real
she takes the box back from him
i dont know
he seemed very sure of himself
if its some kind of survey
hes a really good salesman because i believe him
i believe that he might give us that money
do then you think hes a maniac and he might go kill someone
i dont know
arthur takes the box back from her
he shakes it
then flips it over
he sees that there is a single screw on the bottom corner that holds it together
open the glove compartment
theres a philips head screwdriver in there
she opens the glove compartment and retrieves a phillips head screwdriver for him
what are you doing
arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box
im gonna see whats inside of it
he removes the screw
and sees that the wooden base rotates on a rod mount on the opposite corner
it is completely empty
if we pushed the button right now
hed have no way of knowing
she takes the box from him and closes the dome
arthur pops open the trunk and norma places the box inside
he shuts the trunk and they begin to walk toward the entrance to the country club
arthur then holds out his hand to his wife
let me hold the key
why do you get to hold it
because youll lose it norma
you cant hold your liquor
neither can you
what if someone takes your purse
i have pockets
let me hold it
norma goes through her purse and hands the small envelope to him
they move toward the entrance to the country club
the camera follows norma and arthur into the grand ballroom of the country club
there are several hundred people there
all dressed in black tie
a massive christmas tree sits in the center of the room surrounded by tables
a piano player plays christmas carols up on the stage
all this for a rehearsal dinner
deborah is so lucky
remember our rehearsal dinner
keg party in our back yard
susan and jim are standing with arthur lewis sr s and bev lewis s
arthur and norma go over to greet them
the camera drifts over to a placard that reads
dana enters the family room and hands a package to walter
walter takes the package and begins to remove the wrapping paper
inside is a comic book
he pulls it out of the wrapping
and on the cover is an illustration of a dark figure walking upon a red desert surface
the title is the man from mars walter looks at the cover in awe
my dad is gonna love this
norma and arthur are now seated around a table with both sets of parents
bev is running her hand through arthurs long hair
when are you gonna cut this hair
are you still cutting his hair
are you leonard or skynard
theyre never gonna let you into outer space with these sideburns
theyre all wearing them that way now bev
nathan burns normas wheelchair bound younger brother comes rolling up
is someone planning on departing the surface of the earth
arthur stands up and gives him a hug
its been years
how have you been
ive been better
i mean i used to have legs
the table goes silent
susan looks as though she might start to cry
whats this talk about outer space
arthur has been working at nasa
he helped design the camera that photographed the mars surface
arthur puts his hands on the back of nathans wheelchair
nathan and i are gonna go grab a drink
he begins to wheel nathan toward the bar
arthur made me a new prosthesis for my foot
some space age formula
can he make nathan a pair of prosthetic legs
arthur now sits with nathan over by the bar
can you believe it
i survive eighteen months crawlling through the vietnam jungle and not one bullet so much as grazes my body
and i come home take a few tabs of lsd at a grateful dead show and wrap my car around a tree
arthur doesnt know how to respond
pretty damn sad
losing the legs that way but i always thought it was karmic retribution for what i did to norma
whatd you ever do to norma
i dropped that barbell on her foot when we were kids
thats why she went to get that x ray
if it wasnt for me
shed still have all her toes
you cant think of it that way
its the truth
you didnt leave the x ray machine on dr
yeah but my mistake sent her to dr
so that makes me culpable in the eyes of buddha
youre no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell
stop punishing yourself
nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of jack daniels
you know hes here
nathan nods his head across the room
earl stupe s is seated at a table with his wife
hes still got a practice over on the west end
arthur looks over at him
for a moment they make brief eye contact
and stupe quickly looks away
susan is now staring at dr
they are joined by deborah burns normas younger sister and bride to be
i wonder if he even recognizes us
im sure he does
i cant believe they still let him practice medicine
you gotta let it go
you gotta learn to forgive and forget
id be willing to forgive him if he wouldve just admitted his negligence under oath
the bastard lied
said it was the x ray machine that malfunctioned
senator griffith powell s and his son edward powell s approach
edward is the husband to be
you look very spiffy tonight
now that the mid term elections are over
the smile lines are starting to fade
powell puts on a fake smile grabs jims hand and they both wave
poking fun at politician behavior
we all voted
powell looks over at norma
he shakes her hand
fascinated by her
and youre married to the aspiring astronaut
there he is right over there
she points over to arthur the bar
powell looks over at him
and they briefly make eye contact
dana and walter are sitting on the floor playing monopoly
will you take me down to the basement
i want to see your dads darkroom
dana and walter come down the stairs into the basement of the house
red light envelops the room
there are two long wooden work benches running down the middle
there are a series of black and white photographs hanging from a wire
each one shows a different view of the surface of mars
is that mars
what did your dad have to do with the viking
he helped design the camera
walter points to a plastic prototype model of the viking lander mounted on a third work bench at the end of the room
a model of the mars surface has been re created and painted with exacting detail
hes making the model for the science museum
walter points to one of two cameras mounted on the front of the spider shaped landing module
the camera is cylindrical and features a vertical slot on the front
they designed the camera to photograph in degrees
it scans in the image one line at a time
and takes about five minutes to complete one revolution
how do they get the images back to earth
they figured out a way to interpret the scan lines and then print them onto film
how long does it take to transmit back to earth
about ten hours
dana looks over at the wall and sees a new york times front page from september with a large image of mars on it
they tested the camera in the parking lot at langley last year
walter points to another framed photograph on the wall
in the black white photograph we see a group of fifty nasa employees assembled in a long line in a parking lot
walter points to his father standing in the group
theres my dad
he moves his finger across the line of smiling faces
arthur appears for a second time in the row
and there he is again
walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of the photo
arthur lewis appears for a third time
and there he is again
dana looks close at the photo
howd he do that
because the camera takes five minutes to scan in degrees he waited until the camera passed over him then jumped ahead in the circle
the camera moves in closer to the photograph
to the third version of arthur lewis
your dad sounds pretty clever
my dad is more than just clever dana
my dad is the coolest man who ever walked the face of the earth
the camera zooms in close to arthurs face
then tips down to another man kneeling on the pavement directly below him
it is arlington steward
smiling at the camera
his face is normal
no evidence of any burn visible
norma and arthur are now dancing among a group of people in front of the stage the stage where a woman singer is performing white christmas
two hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money arthur
what would we do with that kind of money
we could get out of richmond
move to california
then we could cross the border into mexico if they ever came after us
you cant arrest someone for pushing a button arthur
its not a weapon
its not a gun
we wouldnt be culpable
not in a court of law
what if its someones baby
what if its some murderer on death row in china
what if its our neighbor across the street
do you know our neighbors across the street
have you ever met them
doug and donna
i havent met doug or donna
what does it mean to officially know someone anyway
do you know me norma
i know you better than you know yourself
do you know walter
even better than i know you
they spin around on the dance floor
its just a stupid prank norma
arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar
nathan sits there alone
finishing his drink
arthur and norma watch as jim hoists nathan up into their van with a hydraulic lift
he is passed out drunk
stupe is waiting in line at the valet for his car
he and norma make eye contact
his eyes dart down to the pavement as he steps into his car
norma and arthur come into the family room
dana is asleep on the couch
norma sets the box down on the coffee table and goes to wake dana
danas eyes slowly open
arthur will drive you home okay
i have my bike
and my house isnt far from here
hes asleep upstairs
arthur hands dana a ten dollar bill
are you sure you dont need a ride
good night dana
dana exits through the front door
norma stands up and moves toward the foyer
can you turn off the christmas tree lights
i like leaving them on
its a fire hazard
it keeps the christmas spirit alive while we sleep
we could die
everyone dies eventually norma
she stares at the tree
leave them on
she goes upstairs
leaving him alone with the glowing tree
arthur looks down at the coffee table
the box sits there
he retrieves the key envelope from his pocket and stares at it
he then walks over to the wall and unplugs the christmas tree lights
norma and arthur lay in bed facing in opposite directions
neither of them can sleep
arthur rolls over and wraps his arm around her
the camera approaches walters bed
he has made a tent under the covers
a light glows from inside
under the covers
walter has a flashlight and he is reading the comic book
insert various illustrations from the comic
a huge temple with a massive flying beast flying above it
a meteor hurtling toward earth
kt r s lo early morning at the carytown hair salon
the camera zooms out from norma as she sits under a dome drying her hair
next to her is her sister deborah and several other bridesmaids for the wedding
the other women are gabbing
reading fashion magazines
norma seems lost in her own world
norma and deborah emerge from the hair salon with the others in tow
lurking down at the end of the sidewalk is bud wall walters bus driver
the huge man watches them intensely
norma has arlingtons business card out
she stares at the number
arthur comes in with the morning paper
the box sits on the kitchen table
she retrieves the key and inserts it into the slot
opening the glass dome
arthur comes into the kitchen
well never see that much money
why do you say that
be realistic arthur
you work for the government
maybe not forever
well never leave richmond
do you want to move
we have to put walter in public school
collegiate withdrew the faculty tuition discount
even if we sold my car and moved into a smaller house we couldnt afford that school
wed have to enroll him at hopewell
unless what norma
she reaches out and holds her finger over the button
she then picks up the business card with her other hand flips it over and stares at the number
are you gonna call him
norma begins to dial the number on the card
the camera cranes down into the willow lawn motel on the north side of richmond
the two story building has a swimming pool adjacent to south side
the camera zooms out from a ringing telephone that sits on the bedside table
arlington sits on the bed
staring silently at the wall
he picks up the receiver and places it to his ear
norma pauses for a moment
wondering how he could have known it was her
is this mr
of course it is
how did you know it was me
are you tracing this call
time is running out
have you made your decision
norma looks to arthur
who paces around the kitchen
if we push the button
are you going to murder someone
arlington leans back on the motel room bed
when you push the button
somewhere in this world
someone you do not know
i never mentioned the word murder
how will they die
im not at liberty to disclose that information
it would spoil the fun
are you selling life insurance
i am not at liberty to disclose any information about my employers
i can only remind you that the offer is real
looking at his watch and it expires in approximately eight hours
why do you do this
what do you get out of this deal
the reward is for you
norma paces around with the phone
is there anything else mrs
i have an appointment to make and i dont want to be late
can we meet in person
id like to see you
before we make our final decision
im looking at you right now norma
the grey spotted owl
in your back yard
norma turns and looks out the large picture window in the kitchen nook
outside in the back yard an owl is perched on a planter
the large bird sits motionless
its large saucer eyes do not blink
norma stares at it for a long moment
arthur paces around the kitchen
facing in the other direction
the owl flies away before arthur notices it
there is no response
are you still there
norma hangs up the phone
she stares at the box
then at her husband as he sits down across from her
what do you want to do norma
were gonna have to pull walter out of that school
then push it
push the button norma
push the button
i dare you
i double dog diddly dare you
im scared to
if you dont push it
then i will
this is stupid
arthur reaches out to push the button
but she grabs his wrist with her left hand restraining him
she then reaches out and presses down on the button with her index finger
the camera tracks along a series of cubicles at the police station in downtown richmond
a female operator sits at each cubicle
how may i direct your call
the camera moves in closer
you need to slow down
i cant understand what youre saying
she listens to the voice on the other end of the line
so you heard loud screaming and then a gun shot
what is your address
two police cars pull up with their sirens blaring in front of a townhouse on cary street
two police officers emerge from each car and approach the front of the townhouse
they begin to bang loudly on the door
a female neighbor s emerges from the townhouse next door
i heard a gunshot
then he ran out the front door and got in his car
the police officer looks at his partner and then proceeds to kick down the door
the officers move through the townhouse with their guns drawn
the screaming of a young girl can be heard from upstairs
the officers enter the kitchen
a woman s named amy bevilacqua is slumped over on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood
the camera moves in toward her face
an officer approaches the bathroom door at the end of the hall
the screaming girl from inside is bawling her eyes out
the officer sees a tiny hand emerge from underneath the door
she is reaching out for help
he goes to open the door but there is a large dead bolt lock mounted on the outside
i need you to back away from the door
im gonna have to the screaming begins to subside
the officer then kicks the door down
inside the bathroom
a young girl is cowering in the bathtub
norma and arthur are sitting across from one another in silence
there is an empty bottle of wine on the table
theres no turning back now
the doorbell rings
both norma and arthur jump in their seats
norma and arthur move toward the front door
norma puts her eye to the peephole
arlingtons disfigured face stares back at her
she opens the door
arlington stands there smiling
briefcase in hand
do you have the button unit
its in the kitchen
norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box leaving arthur alone with arlington
and you must be mr
arthur stares at him
does he recognize him from somewhere
norma returns with the box and hands it over to him
and the key
norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small envelope and places it in his hand
arlington then opens the briefcase and shows it to them
the bills are stacked neatly in rows
two hundred thousand
you can count it if you like
arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes
we trust your word
arlington offers him a broad smile
as you should
he then turns to leave
they follow arlington out onto the front walk as he approaches his car
the engine is idling
and someone else is behind the wheel
but through the tinted windows it is unclear who is driving
you said before that the box is re programmed
so now what
are you gonna go and make the offer to someone else
that s how it works mrs
and i can promise you that the offer will be made
to someone you do not know
opens the door
and steps into the passenger side
the driver hits the gas and the car speeds off
arthur moves out into the street
watching the car go
i got his license plate
arthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs a pencil
he then scrawls the license plate number down on a piece of scratch paper
what are you thinking norma
i dont know
arthur paces around
he then opens the briefcase and starts counting through the money
did he mean that were next
is that what he meant
i dont know
jim burns sits behind his desk at the police station
his secretary s comes in to his office
your daughter is on line two
he picks up the phone
norma stares at the money in the briefcase
whats going on
i need a favor
what do you need
i need you to run a license plate for me
someone just came by the house
and we think he might
looking to arthur he just seemed real suspicious and arthur got the license plate and i need you to run it
you need me to send someone over
if you could just run the plate and find out whose car it is
axv is the number
ill call you back in ten minutes
an officer removes a document from a printer and approaches burnss office
we ran those plates for you sarge
jim takes the document from him
it is a blow up of a drivers license that belongs to arlington steward
in the photo
his face is not injured
norma and arthur are pacing around the kitchen
the phone rings
norma answers it
the car is listed to an arlington j
do you want his address and phone number
norma begins to write them down
norma is dialing a number with the phone in her lap
im trying to reach an arlington steward
lewis i presume
normas eyes widen
she nods to arthur and points to the phone
he rushes into the family room to pick up the other phone so he can listen in
i assume that you pushed the button
there is the myth of prometheus and pandora
prometheus gave pandora a box
and warned her not to open it
but she did not listen and when pandora opened the box
she unleashed a torrent of sorrow and misery
norma stares at arthur
unable to speak
your descent into oblivion has begun
the question remains
what will the cuckold of a husband do
to prevent the death of his beloved pandora
arthur stares at norma
unable to speak
do you really know your wife
who is this
i am the mother of prometheus
and if you want to save yourself
i suggest that you go to the richmond public library and find the book with the following call number f
norma is writing the number out on a piece of paper
arthur steps into the kitchen
tell me this isnt real
tell me this isnt happening
this isnt real
this isnt happening
i dont think i believe you norma
arthur backs his car out of the driveway and into the street
norma rides shotgun
walter is circling around on his bike with some friends in tow
were off to run an errand
be back in a few hours okay
he watches as they drive off
arthur and norma drive toward downtown
there was owl
in our back yard
he said it was his owl
are you hiding anything else from me norma
the camera tracks with arthur and norma as they move through the vast space of the richmond public library
they arrive at the adult fiction section
and the camera moves along the spines of various books until it arrives at the one with the call number f
norma removes a book from the shelf and looks at the cover norma shows it to arthur
its pronounced sartre
jean paul sartre
the french existentialist
she begins to thumb through the pages of the play
never read it
its a play
i read it in high school
its about three strangers who find themselves trapped in a room together for all of eternity
theyve quickly discover that theyve all been sent to hell
norma turns back to the inside cover of the book
someone has written in crisp penmanship norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library card
the name of the last person to check out the book is arthur and norma approach the circulation desk
a female librarian s is standing there
were looking for an archival times dispatch from september of this year
she offers them a warm smile
arthur and norma now sit in front of a microfiche reader in a long line of wooden desks in the records room
on the screen
headlines from the years newspapers scroll by
stopping on the headline for september
i remember the name now
he used to work at arthur and wendell are standing among a large group of scientists in the laboratory
everyone is assembled
staring at a large blank screen waiting in anticipation
cahill stands at the front of the group with a walkie talkie to his ear
the first photo should come down off the server in less than a minute
the camera cranes up toward the gigantic lunar lander module
rain pours down from the night sky
lightning flashes in the distance
several miles away
the camera approaches the upper trestle beam
which crosses the expanse of the structure
mounted on top of the beam is a standing on the trestle several yards away from the antennae is arlington steward
he is wearing a rain slicker and is face appears normal
he carries a walkie talkie in his right hand
so place your bet
martians or no martians
arthur stares up at the screen
waiting on baited breath
a large black and white photo of the mars surface appears on the screen
the scientists erupt in loud cheering and applause
near the base of the lunar lander module
a nasa employee named robert bevilacqua is standing with two others
they are huddled under umbrellas
bevilacqua has a walkie talkie to his ear
he hears the cheering from the walkie talkie
arthur scrolls down to the bottom of the front page
a an engineer at the nasa langley research center was struck by lightning yesterday evening
arlington looks at his watch
staring up at the sky
nervous about the storm
rain pours down upon on the module
water running down in sheets on either side of the trestle
he hears the cheering from the walkie talkie
thunder rumbles in the distance
a massive lightning bolt strikes the top bevilacqua witnesses the fire on the lunar lander module
bevilacqua and the others begin to sprint across the lawn toward the base of the structure to the elevator door at the bottom of the elevator shaft on the south
end of the module
richmond public libp
ry records room ne t t arthur continues to read from the article
the man received third degree burns over fifty percent of his body
bevilacqua and the others emerge from the elevator at the top of the trestle
they rush toward arlingtons body
as he convulses on the trestle
smoke emanating from his charred body
arthur turns to norma
he got struck by lightning on the night we received the transmission from mars
arthur and wendell stand outside the main laboratory building with a group of scientists sipping champagne
they see an ambulance pass down the main street of the campus with its sirens on
cahill emerges from inside the building and rushes out to the parking lot
bevilacqua and the others are approaching
the module got hit
steward was up there on the trestle
he got burned real bad
the camera moves in toward bevilacquas face
his eyes filled with anguish and despair
jim burns stands in front of a group of police officers in a briefing room
he holds up a large family photo of robert bevilacqua posing with his wife and young daughter
our fugitive is named robert bevilacqua
he shot and killed his wife at their residence on cary street earlier today
we believe that he escaped on foot
and could be armed and dangerous
the camera moves across a line of police officers
bevilacqua is an employee at nasa
and he is a former marine who served in vietnam
he may very well be armed and dangerous
the camera tracks through a dingy richmond dive bar
bevilacqua sits at the bar with a baseball cap pulled down low to conceal his face
he is drinking whiskey
wendell james approaches
carrying a file under his arm
bevilacqua turns to face him
they hug one another
the two men are now sitting across from one another in a booth
wendell has a nasa blue print laid out on the table
the blue print is of the button unit
you designed it
cahill told me to
bevilacaua notices a small purple stain on the blue print
cahill stands over wendells shoulder as he sits at a drafting table in the laboratory
this what you were looking for sir
cahill looks stares at the blue print
a drop of blood falls from his right nostril and lands on it
thank you wendell
the camera moves through the massive main hangar at langley
there are several planes parked inside
wendell emerges from behind one of the planes
watching from a hidden vantage point
cahill stands at a work table with arlington
there are three button units laid out on the table
arlington begins to place them inside a leather bag
cahill then hands arlington a file
youre not gonna hurt these boys are you
any harm that comes to them will be their own doing
arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance
there is a massive cement runway
parked on the runway is arlingtons car
bud wall steps out and opens the door for his boss
bus driver bud is stewards driver
arlington steps inside
wendell watches them drive off
wendell then hands a file to bevilacqua
inside there is a dossier and photo of a arthur lewis
he flips to another dossier and photo of another nasa employee named kenneth theres a list
and theyve all got a wife and one child
bevilacqua thumbs through the list of nasa dossiers
he sees arthur lewis among them
did you kill your wife
bevilacqua just stares at him
on the verge of tears
he slides an envelope across the table
this is a confession letter that i wrote
it explains everything that happened with steward and the box
cause if i dont make it
this might clear my name one day
bevilacqua looks at the kenneth weller dossier
this guy weller is gonna be next

and this guy arthur lewis
wendell thinks to himself
then retrieves a set of keys from his pocket
these are the keys to my cousins pick up truck
its not registered
its parked in front of my house over on byrd street
thank you wendell
burns sits behind his desk
telephone to his ear
first name arlington
middle name is james
he begins to scrawl words down on a piece of paper just then
his receptionist opens the door to his office
theres a mr
steward here to see you
thats all i need
he hangs up the phone and looks through the glass window of his office into the reception area
standing there through the glass
is a man who looks identical to arlington steward
he stands with the normal side of his face in profile
he turns to face jim
but his face now appears as it did before he was burned
is this the same person
jim turns to his receptionist
who waits in the doorway send him in
the library is closing down for the night
a group of young children come out of the front exit
one of them turns and notices the owl perched on the railing
the owl stares at the children
the real arlington steward is now standing in the periodicals area
of the library
situated in front of the circulation desk
he stands in profile
then turns toward the camera in the same manner as his twin in the police station
his burned face forms a deformed smile
the steward twin steps into jims office
he reaches out and shakes jims hand
my name is reston steward
with his eyes closed
mimics his twins movement exactly
reaching out his hand and shaking it with nothing
my name is reston steward
reston steward sits down in the chair across from his desk
i see you have made an inquiry about my brother arlington
arlington is now seated in a library chair
in the exact same manner as his brother
it is as though he is controlling his twin brothers body via remote telepathy
an inquiry about my brother arlington
jim stares at him from across his desk
apparently he made an appearance at my daughters house
your brother works for nasa
arlington nods his head
my brother works at the langley research facility
jim nods his head in return
with my son in law
and may i ask
what do you do mr
with his eyes closed
arlington reaches into his pocket and retrieves something imaginary from his pocket
he raises something that we cannot see up into the air
reston is now holding out a government badge with his right hand
i work for the cia
he then hands jim one of his cards
jim looks at it
reston rises to his feet
putting his hat on his head
i assure you my brother is of no threat to your daughter
however the man youre looking for
he is very dangerous
and he might try and contact your son in law or your daughter
help us find bevilacqua
if and when you do
please call us
jim stares at the business card as reston bids him good bye
arlington is now standing
with his eyes still closed he nods his head and smiles then turns and begins to walk several steps
he then stops
takes a deep breath
and opens his eyes
reston opens his eyes
as if a spirit has suddenly left his body
he takes a deep breath and smiles at the receptionist trying to conceal his expression of horror
he moves toward the exit
reston emerges from the general assembly building
there is a black town car waiting
a cia agent stands next to it
reston withdraws a handkerchief and wipes blood from his nose
general nathan teague at the pentagon
get him on the phone immediately
the agent opens the car door and reston steps inside
norma and arthur are still sitting in front of the microfiche machine
norma looks like she is going to faint
her face has gone white
you alright norma
i feel like im gonna faint
she stands up to leave
where are you going
taward the main library
leaving arthur alone
norma emerges from the records room and walks toward the circulation desk
as she rounds the corner
arlington emerges from behind a row of book shelves
norma stops in her tracks
he stares her down
arthur stares at the microfiche reader
transfixed by the newspaper articles
a shadow passes across the wall
and arthur senses someone lurking over his shoulder
he turns to see that it is the librarian
something about her is different
she seems possessed
the myth of prometheus tells the story of a god who created man
when prometheus flew too close to the sun
his wings caught fire
and he fell to the earth
arthur remembers her voice from the phone call
was that you on the phone
youre his mother
he finds your wife fascinating
her name is elizabeth steward
norma remains frozen
her mind racing
arlington smiles at her
gesturing toward an empty chair
have a seat
she looks around
realizing that the library is now completely empty
dont be afraid
i may look like a monster
but i can assure you that i am
his face contorts into a broad smile
elizabeth sits down on the chair across from arthur
my name is clymene mother of five
prometheus atlas menoetius logan and epimetheus
a drop of blood begins to ooze from her left eye as she speaks
epimetheus is the twin brother of prometheus but he has become his brothers slave
the victim of his cunning and deceit
norma is now seated in a chair across from him
he stares deep into her eyes
transfixed by her beauty
tell me norma
when was the exact moment that you realized you loved your husband
there is something about him that now makes her feel safe
willing to tell him anything
about five seconds after i laid eyes on him
and when was this
my sophomore year
he was a year younger than me
we dated for two weeks and then
she stops herself
you became frightened about something
then i thought
this is too good to be true
when he sees my mangled foot
hes gonna be out the door in ten seconds and hes gonna go tell all his friends
how did he respond when you showed him
we were at the drive in
and he caught a glimpse of the scars on my thigh
he asked me what happened
and i felt this sense of dread
because you can just see the glow disappear in someones eyes when they discover something about you that they just cant stomach
did the glow disappear from his eyes
he was different than the others
my scars were cool
he said that they made me more attractive
arthur sits across from elizabeth
his mind is racing
trying to put the puzzle pieces together
he looks at his watch
it is almost pm
i have worked at this library for forty years
since i have read a book a day
books i have read
someone should nominate you for librarian of the year
she holds the copy of no exit in her hands
of all of the books i have read in my lifetime
this is my sons favorite
have you ever read no exit
she reaches out with her hand
take my hand
and ill show you
he stares at the blood coagulating in the bag beneath her left eye
im not gonna touch you lady
arlington now stares directly into normas soul
the scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move when he smiles
it remains frozen
unable to express emotion
and what emotion did you feel when you first laid eyes upon me norma
she thinks silently for a moment
she stops herself
afraid of how he might respond if she is honest with him
you felt what
you felt love for me
because of my foot
because of my disfigurement
i thought of all the pain ive felt in my life because of it
the physical pain
the emotional pain
i thought about what it would be like to have that pain magnified and projected onto my face
onto a part of my body that i cant hide with a shoe
there are tears welling in her eyes
i saw all of that pain in your face and i understood it
and i felt an overwhelming feeling of love for you because i knew id never feel sorry for myself or my goddamn foot ever again
elizabeth continues to hold her hand out toward arthur
take my hand son
you called me a cuckold
you made a statement
made an implication to me that my wife was going to be killed
so please understand why i might be reluctant to take your hand
arlington reaches his hand out to norma
take my hand norma
she stares at him unable to move
then takes his hand
elizabeth reaches out and grabs arthurs hand against his will
his body convulses at her touch
the camera drifts in toward arthurs face as his eyes slowly close
her spell has been cast upon him
the camera moves slowly down a corridor
the floor is shiny white marble and the walls are framed by ornate molding and arlington stands at the end of the corridor
he is wearing a tuxedo portraying the valet character from sartres no exit
the camera pans around to reveal arthur
walking slowly down the corridor
arlington opens a door at the end of the corridor and leads arthur into a drawing room
recreated from sartres play
arlington leads arthur inside and closes the door behind him
inside the drawing room there are three couches made in the style
of the second empire
the walls are covered in similar renaissance art and the floor is marble
norma and walter have now been admitted to the drawing room
norma is dressed in an elegant black gown
walter wears a tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his father is wearing
and there is a silk blindfold wrapped around his head
he wanders around the room
the dimensions of the room are equal in every way
it is a perfect three dimensional box
arthur then looks to his wife
he notices that her eyelids are now gone
arthur then turns to his son
walter reaches out into the air
seemingly unaware that they are in the room with him
the camera moves through the wall into another corridor
dressed as another valet passes by
and the camera moves into another drawing room
inside the second drawing room
the camera finds robert bevilacqua and his wife
their daughter is wearing a silk the camera then drifts up and moves through the glass panels at the top of the room
the camera pulls up higher
revealing the layout of a massive network of corridors and drawing rooms that form a larger box
through the glass ceilings looking down into each room
families are assembled together
the camera flies over the edge of the sartres hotel of rooms and corridors to reveal the plateau of utopia planitia on the surface of mars
arthurs eyes pop open
he rolls over
and norma is asleep in bed next to him
they are both fully dressed in the clothes they were wearing in the library
her eyes open
she looks around
i dont know
norma notices walter standing in the doorway
you came home an hour ago
she sits up in bed
looking at the clock radio
it is pm
neither of you said a word
you just walked into the house like two zombies
went straight to bed
arthur and norma stare at one another trying to make sense of what has just transpired
it starts in an hour
weve got to get ready
norma sees that the copy of no exit is now sitting on heir bedside table
army jet flies over the nations capital
the pentagon and the washington monument are visible below
the camera approaches us army general nathan teague s seated just behind the cockpit
in his lap is a file
he is thumbing through a series of photographs of the mars surface
he then arrives at a stack of paperwork
there is a photograph of arthur lewis at the top of the stack
norma now wearing her bridesmaid dress puts a diamond earring in her right lobe
she turns to the mirror and jumps in her skin
as the face staring back at her has no eyelids
arthur sits on the end of walters bed
walters stands in front of him as his father ties his neck tie in front of a standing mirror
whats going on
i dont know
this is about the box
did you push the button
your mother did
what happens when you push the button
i dont know
yes you do
youre just not telling me
arthur finishes with his tie
he notices something on the floor of his sons bedroom
it is the mars comic book
he picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the cover
where did you get this
she gave it to me
arthur begins to page through the comic book
arlington kneels at the edge of the motel swimming pool
he runs his hand through the water
steam is rising from the surface
strobes of white light begin flicker from beneath the surface
as though some unseen source of energy is emanating from down below
arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave
arlington approaches the black sedan idling in the car port
he gets inside
and bud drives off
the camera looks through a telescope lens of some sort from high on a rooftop in downtown richmond
it scans across several cars passing down the street
pedestrians on the sidewalk
landing on arlington and bud as they move toward the entrance of a stone front building
we see that a sniper dressed in a dark suit is perched on the roof of an adjacent building
he has an earpiece in his left ear
they are entering the building from the south entrance on fourteenth street
arlington and bud move down the main corridor of the general assembly building approaching a bank of elevators
a security guard nods to them nervously
arlington nods back
arlington and bud emerge from the elevators on the third floor and move down the hall
as they pass into a reception area the camera moves toward a glass partition with the virginia state emblem etched into the glass
below it is a name as they approach the reception area
the female receptionist s stands up anxiously behind her desk
may i help you
where is he
hes in a meeting
i need to see him
the receptionist comes into the office
griffith powell stands at the window behind his desk
smoking a cigarette
he is dressed in a tuxedo with his jacket hanging next to his desk
i dont know what to do
powell turns to face her
let him in
the receptionist goes back out
and within moments
arlington and bud enter the office
the receptionist closes the door and leaves them alone
its good to see you
call me arlington
bud just stares at the senator
showing no sign of emotion
do you have my money
ive given you four hundred thousand already
how much more are you going to need
as much as it takes
powell sighs out loud
first the nose
powell turns around and there is now blood gushing from his nose
then the ears
blood begins to ooze from both ears
as he covers his face
feeling the warm fluid rush from every orifice
then the eyes
blood rushes from beneath his eyelids
his entire face covered in blood
his white shirt drenched
ive got it right here
powell reaches beneath his desk and retrieves a large briefcase
he places it on the desk
its all there
two hundred thousand
you can count it if you want
bud grabs the briefcase from the desk and pops it open
he sees that it is filled with stacks of cash
you tell that sniper you have perched on that roof next door that i can smell his cheap cologne
the sniper hears arlingtons voice in his earpiece
i think it might be old spice
the sniper smells his shoulder
arlington and bud move through the reception area
the receptionist lurks behind her desk
arthur and norma are standing in a waiting room in the church where her sister is about to be married
bridesmaids and groomsmen are chatting with one another in anticipation of the ceremony
norma clutches the copy of no exit
you and walter were there in the room
you were wearing a black dress identical to the one you have on now
walter had a blindfold on
and then your eyes
they didnt have lids
i had the same dream
arthurs mind is racing
he glances through the crowd nervously afraid that they are being watched
whats the last thing you remember
he was asking me all of these questions
about our marriage
then i took his hand
time to line up
susan hands arthur the book and goes off with the other norma stands next to deborah as she is about to take her vows
do you deborah burns take edward powell to be your lawfully wedded husband til death do you part
norma looks over to arthur as he sits in the congregation
he is not paying attention to the wedding
he is reading sartres play
the camera zooms into a close up of the page describing the final scene in the play no exit
estelle with a peal of laughter forever
my god how funny
garcin looks over at the two women and joins in the laughter for ever and ever and ever
insert arthurs eyes
they slump onto their respective sofas
a long silence
their laughter dies away and they gaze at each other
garcin well well lets get on with it
the wedding party comes pouring out of the church
there is a massive lawn south of the entrance
during the holidays it is filled with christmas trees for sale and dozens of arts crafts booths assembled in rows
the camera moves through the crowd to find norma posing for photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the square
across the square
bud wall lurks within the rows of christmas trees
he spies arthur and walter mingling with his parents and senator powell who has two secret servicemen standing close by
the camera approaches the driveway of the virginia house
which is positioned at the south end of forest lawn square
wedding guests are arriving in droves
the house is a large gothic mansion that is often rented out for public events
and in this case
for the lavish wedding reception of deborah burns and edward powell
arthur and norma move through the courtyard into the wedding reception area
which flows through several tents that have been erected with heat lamps and tables covered in white tablecloths and floral arrangements
arthur carries the copy of no exit with him
the play tells the story of uhree people condemned to hell
they are to remain in a second empire drawing room for all of eternity
he closes the book
his mind dissecting what he has just read
they soon discover that their eyelids are missing
and for all eternity they will be unable to sleep
norma remembers most of the play from high school
there are no mirrors
so they will never be able to see their own reflection
but only the faces of their tormentors
this is sartres vision of hell
is other people
the look into one anothers eyes
norma sees a waiter pass by with a tray of champagne
they both take a glass
jim crosses the lawn to greet them
can i speak with you privately for a moment
arthur walks away with jim toward the edge of a patio that overlooks the whole party
jim and arthur stand at a table
jim has several photographs laid out on the table
they are mostly family photos taken from the house of robert bevilacqua
and do you know this fella
i know him
he works at do you know his wife
he shot and killed his wife yesterday morning
he shot her point blank in the chest in his kitchen
arthur takes a deep breath
he isnt feeling well
this bevilacqua fella
if he tries to contact you or norma
you have to call me immediately you understand
arthur looks down at the lawn
norma is staring back at them
norma is now standing up on stage with a microphone in her hand
giving her maid of honor speech
my little sister once asked me
whats the best thing about being married
norma looks across the lawn to the table where arthur is seated next to walter and their parents
i told her that
its knowing that for the rest of your life youll never feel alone
not ever again
she smiles at her husband
until you get divorced
there is laughter from the crowd
leaning her head on her new husbands shoulder
until he decides to kill you
arthur and norma are now slow dancing
why did you say that
in your speech
that joke about me killing you
i dont know
i thought it was funny
guess ive had too much champagne
did your dad tell you about robert bevilacqua
he shot his wife yesterday morning
did you know his wife
norma is still searching for some other explanation
what if its all a test for the aspiring astronauts
what do you mean
a psychological test
they want to see how youll respond to a moral dilemma
the fate of a human life
determined by the push of a single button
think of the men on the apollo thirteen mission
they turn slowly on the dance floor
arthur closes his eyes
his mind racing
a voice breaks through the music
may i cut in
arthur and norma turn to see a man standing there
it is dr
i would like to dance with your wife
do you mind
arthur glares at dr
its okay arthur
arthur looks at him
then back at norma
his face has gone pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on the dance floor
will you please excuse me
arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial estate
walter is there
whats going on
im gonna be sick walter
he places his hand on his sons head for a brief moment and then stumbles up the stairs
on the dance floor
norma is now slow dancing with dr
i know what they call me
the ones who will still see me
they find out what i did and they stop calling
im sorry for that
i cant control what people say
i am dr
someone wrote it on my windshield with soap once
i figure it must have been a relative
a friend of yours
how they love you norma lewis
and they love your husband
the one who saved you
did he save your life
did he rescue you from the oblivion that i manufactured
you have my forgiveness earl
people make mistakes
and if they seek forgiveness
they should be forgiven
thats the rule of my lord
arthur comes into the mens bathroom and rushes into one of the stalls
he falls to his knees
leaning over the toilet
on the dance floor
norma notices her brother nathan
sitting alone at his table in his wheelchair
he is drunk
lost in his own sadness
he smiles at her
there is that old cliche
that the lord works in mysterious ways
i have met the lord
i have spoken to him in my dreams
and it brought me back to that day in my office when you arrived with a fractured foot
some thirteen years ago
he told me that it was essential
an essential event in the cycle of purgatory and its inevitable conclusion
norma pulls away from him
blood drains out of his nose
for when the cycle of purgatory concludes
there is nothing left but a barren wasteland of rock and sand
a deafening wind and a cold dry winter
on the marble railing
the owl is perched on the ledge
on the dance floor
stupe retrieves a pistol from his pocket
and raises his eyes to meet those of his dance partner
i am sorry my dear
stupe takes the pistol
places it against his temple
and pulls the trigger
blood sprays across the dance floor
some of it on normas face
people begin to scream and the entire wedding erupts arthur is now standing at the urinal
he begins to hear commotion outside
he turns his head to the left
when something cold and metal locks itself around his wrist
arthur turns back to the right and sees that it is robert bevilacqua
he is standing at the urinal next to him and they are now hand cuffed together at the wrists
bevilacqua retrieves a gun from his pocket at points it at arthur
he has dark circles under his eyes
you can still save yourself
its too late for me
but you can still save yourself
follow me out through the kitchen
i have a truck waiting
arthur and bevilacqua emerge from the mens bathroom into a hallway that leads into the kitchen
there is commotion among the members of the wedding party in response to the gunshot
arthur and bevilacqua move through the kitchen
the waiters and waitresses are all distracted by the commotion and barely take notice of them as they pass through
walter walks down the driveway as several police officers rush past him moving toward the entrance of the house
the whole place is being evacuated
he looks toward the square
and begins to move in that direction
the camera drifts back toward the rock pillar that stands at the entrance to the house
arlington is standing there in front of it
he is wearing his black hat
pulled down low
he begins to follow walter toward the square
arthur and bevilacqua come out the back entrance into the driveway
there is a white pickup truck parked there
bevilacqua opens the passenger side door and the two of them slide across the seat bevilacqua behind the wheel
walter wanders through a group of christmas carolers
moving toward the maze of christmas trees
he looks over his shoulder
where arlington emerges from a crowd
staring him down like a monster
walters face is ghost white with terror
he begins to walk faster through the maze
norma comes down the driveway with her mother and sister
overcome with shock
searching the crowd
bevilacqua puts the truck into drive and speeds out of the driveway onto the street
jim stands across the lawn manning the chaos
he recognizes the two men as the pass him by
and he raises his walkie talkie to his mouth
i just spotted bevilacqua
hes in a white pick up truck
potential hostage situation
walter winds his way through the maze of christmas trees
rounding a corner
where he runs into dana
bud arrives next to her
is everything alright
come with us
she takes his hand and they move north back toward the church
the white pick up drives south down
bevilacqua has his hands on the steering wheel
arthurs left arm extended due to the hand cuffing
did you push the button
or was it your wife
i wasnt even home
she decided to push it when i wasnt around to stop her
and now shes dead
did you kill her
i dont want to talk about it
where are you taking me
bevilacqua retrieves a nasa dossier from the dashboard and hands it to arthur
you know him
name sounds familiar
does he work at langley too
him and his wife
theyve got the box now
blue and red lights appear behind them
followed by the sound of a siren
two police cruisers are now tailing the pick up truck
bevilacqua steps on the gas
accelerating to outrun them
what are you doing
im not gonna let them get me
weve got to get to kenneth weller
weve got to break the chain
or your wife is gonna die
how is she going to die
youre going to kill her
bevilacqua swerves into the oncoming traffic lane to pass a car in front of them
a large wheeler truck is barreling toward them
bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane
the wheeler slams on the brakes
then jack knives to the left
blocking both lanes
one of the police cruisers pulls off into the ditch
while the second cruiser swerves and smashes head on into the side of the truck bed
sheering the top of the sedan into two pieces
arthur looks back over his shoulder
seeing the cars smash together
youre gonna get us killed
did steward take you to the library
did you meet his mother
did she tell you about prometheus
steward has a twin brother
and he works for the cia
arthur sees four more police cruisers with their lights flashing
they have formed a roadblock
bevilacqua lowers his foot onto the accelerator
refusing to back down
this is purgatory
were living in purgatory
the white truck smashes through the line of police cruisers as police officers dive for cover
an officer raises his gun and fires off several rounds toward the truck
a bullet explodes the right front tire
the truck swerves and flips over onto one side
tumbling over and over along the interstate in a horrific crash
oncoming cars swerve into ditches
and the white truck comes sliding to a stop on the wet pavement
the camera slowly approaches the smoking wreckage
catching a glimpse of bevilacqua
his face covered in blood
arthur remains hidden from sight
norma rushes down the sidewalk on the perimeter of the square
searching for her son
a black sedan pulls up next to her
and reston steps out of the car
norma locks eyes with him
recognizing his face
my name is reston steward
i work for the cia
where is my son
where is my husband
get into the car
norma stares at him in disbelief
as he opens the back door and gestures inside
there isnt much time
jim burns walks through the aftermath of the crash site
there are now several fire trucks ambulances and other emergency vehicles scattered on either side of the interstate
robert bevilacquas dead body is now on a stretcher
jim looks down at him briefly
then turns to another officer on the scene
they took him away in an ambulance
arthur sits up in the back of the ambulance
he has a small scrape on his cheekbone
but otherwise appears unharmed
an ems technician is in there with him
he hands arthur an here
hold this against your forehead
itll keep your head from swelling
arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head
i think it might have been a miracle
the ems technician shakes his head in disbelief
that car accident
ive never seen someone walk away from an accident like that
somebody upstairs is looking out for you buddy
the door to the ambulance opens
a us army officer appears
he steps away from the doors and general teague emerges from the darkness
are you able to walk son
please step out of the ambulance
arthur steps out of the ambulance and sees that it is parked in front of a howard johnson hotel on an exit of
the hotel has a diner attached to it
there are more than a dozen police cars parked in front along with
several black sedans and military vehicles
arthur hears the rumble of a helicopter circling the sky above them
its searchlight sweeps through the forest
in front of the diner entrance
more than a dozen men operate video cameras and still cameras mounted on tripods all pointed toward the front window of the diner
teague is standing with cahill and reston along with several other military personnel
arthur notices norma as she emerges from a black sedan
she looks exhausted
she hugs him
neither has slept in two days
i dont know
reston steps forward
my brother has taken your son
but he assures me that he is alive and well
reston tries to comfort them with a smile
take a walk with us
norma and arthur begin to walk with reston teague and cahill toward the diner entrance
are you familiar with the myth of prometheus
in the s
when nasa was formed we began developing in secret a project that we dubbed the prometheus effect
projecting fictional scenarios about how we would respond if and when we came into contact with an alien intelligence
if the intelligence had hostile intent
or if it began to somehow display proof of its ability to destroy us we would have a system in place to begin negotiating with it in secret
the goal of prometheus is to maintain coexistence with this life form and eventually achieve peace with it so that its power can be harnessed developed and applied in such
a manner that will benefit the human race
arthur notices that cahill is holding a folder in his right hand
on the night of september rd as the server was downloading images from the viking camera system that you helped design
we experienced an electrical surge from a bolt of lightning
as they arrive at the entrance to the diner cahill shows arthur a blurry black and white photograph
an anomaly in the series of viking images produced this photograph of the mars surface
the photo appears to be a ghost like trail of white light streaking across the martian landscape
teague nods toward the diner window
and whatever it is
arthur notices arlington sitting alone in a booth inside the diner
a methane compound imbedded in pulse of electricity
if the human spirit is assigned a specific bandwidth upon conception
would provide it with a dual bandwidth carrier
it claims to be more than six billion years old
arthur stares at the streak of white light in the photo
took this photo
weve run the data sequence off the server more than a thousand times
this one photo in the sequence comes out of the dark room just like this
we cant explain why
arthur hands the photo back to cahill
what does it want
cahill glances at teague
who looks to cahill
i think the same thing that it wanted from bevilacqua
except that poor boy is no longer around to tell us why he shot his wife
what did he say to you when you were in the car with him
something about breaking the chain
he wanted to find the next test subject
and prevent them from pushing the button
cahill is writing diligently on his note pad
reston can now feel something taking control of him
he looks to teague
he closes his eyes
his body begins to twitch
teague stares at his friend
realizing what is happening
reston opens his eyes
blood draining from his ears
its a pleasure to meet you
i would like to continue with my experiment
if you dont mind
reston smiles at the general
please do not interfere
as i assure you that if you do
there will be dire consequences
reston then turns to face arthur and norma
time is of the essence
and id like to invite my guests inside
reston opens the door to the diner and gestures to arthur and norma for them to come inside
arthur norma and reston make their way down the long aisle of the diner flanked by a row of booths across from a long lunch counter with a metal surface
arlington sits alone in a booth
he pivots his head around to face them
please have a seat
reston sits down next to his twin brother
arthur and norma sit down across from the twins
arlington has now locked completely into his brothers spirit
the movement of the two men is in now in perfect synchronicity staggered by exactly one second
reston following arlington
arlingtons eyes remain closed in deep concentration
arlingtons lips move silently
and reston repeats them out loud
restons demeanor is now kind
almost apologetic for his past behavior
dont be frightened by my manner of communication
but it is becoming more difficult for me to speak given my bodys
what have you done with our son
well get to him in a moment
but first i want you to know that i have a deep respect and admiration you both and i am very sorry
that you pushed the button
bud now has walter laid out on the cement next the edge of the swimming pool at the shallow end
the boy is unconscious
still dressed in his suit from the wedding
from across the pool
dana is squatting on the end of the diving board
bud then removes walters right shoe and sock
exposing his bare foot
he then retrieves a serrated hunting knife
and cuts in the flesh from his big toe across the ball of his foot
reston closes his eyes for a moment
when he opens them
tears have begun to form as though he cannot bear the news that his brother is forcing him to deliver
i will now give you a chance to save yourselves
an opportunity for redemption and salvation
bud is now carrying the unconscious walter in his arms
he steps into the shallow end of the heated pool
and dunks the boy under the surface
blood from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into the water like red ink
norma closes her eyes
the impending sense of dread building inside of her
two of your sons five functional senses have been permanently impaired
walter floats with his arms spread wide
white strobes of light flicker around him
the light streaks bear a close resemblance to the image in the mars photo
blood streams out from his foot into the water
blood is now flowing out of restons left nostril
both arthur and norma recoil in horror
he is now blind and deaf
for the rest of his life he will never hear your voice
or see your face
under his breath why
you are now presented with two options
you enjoy the rest of your lives with the money you have been given and you learn to live with your sons disability
reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a pistol
he places it on the table next to the box
and then there is option number two
there is one bullet in the chamber of this gun
reston slides the gun across the table in arthurs direction
you can fire this bullet into your wifes heart
at the exact moment that her spirit departs the earth this curse upon your son will be reversed and both of his impaired senses will instantaneously return to normal
arthur looks over at norma in disbelief
then back at the twins
he cannot fathom how it has now come to this
arthur you will then be arrested and charged with the murder of your wife
and the money will be placed in an interest bearing trust for your son to receive upon his eighteenth birthday
thats not fair
let me do it
i pushed your stupid button
if i deserve to be punished for it
then let me kill myself
arthur has nothing to do with this
im sorry but the offer is not negotiable
and if normas fingers so much as touch the weapon at any point from this moment on
the restoration of walters sight and sound will be denied
if arthur has to do it
then i want you to make it look like a suicide
arthur shouldnt be punished for something that i did
but the terms of the offer are not negotiable
arthur faces has gone completely white
is there an afterlife
the twins smile cryptically in response to arthurs question
because this is purgatory right
the earth is purgatory
and youre here to start shutting things down
the twins appear impressed with his foresight
i find your theory to be quite fascinating
but i must remind you that i am unable to disclose the identity of my employers
arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras
i get it
reston then turns to the window
can someone please bring up the car
arthur and norma emerge from the diner in a state of delirium
a soldier pulls up in arthurs trans am
he steps out of the car and holds the door open
teague and cahill approach
as men in dark suits snap hundreds of photographs of the couple
cahill puts his hand on arthurs shoulder
searching for words
teague glances inside the diner
then back at arthur
arthur nods his head slowly
his mind lost
and he limps toward the car with norma at his side
norma sits behind the wheel
allowing arthur to ride shotgun
he looks weakened by the whole ordeal and she is afraid he might pass out
tell me this isnt happening norma
this isnt happening
she starts the engine
and they drive off
arthur watches the parking lot full of men reflected back at them in the side view mirror
helicopter shot the camera flies over as arthurs car travels north toward richmond
a military helicopter flies overhead
escorting them on their journey home
arthur sits shotgun as norma drives them home
they have been riding in silence for quite some time now having reached a level of complete mental and physical exhaustion
all these years
ive given you the impression that walter was an accident
it wasnt exactly an accident
i stopped taking the pill when i met you
because i was so afraid of losing you to someone prettier than me
arthur just stares at her
unsure how to respond
for that alone
i deserve a bullet in the heart
dont you think
she manages a smile
a tear rolls down her cheek as she stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining either side of the interstate
arthur pulls the car up into the driveway
the street is quiet and empty
they step out of the car
dana is sitting on the front porch waiting for them
she rises to her feet as they approach
did my dad tell you why he loves you norma
norma realizes that she has been involved all along
blood drains from her nose
because youre an amputee
he says that the soul of an amputee leaks out into the wind
searching for the place where there is no longer flesh and bone
it says that the soul that leaks is the soul that endures
it is the kindest and bravest soul of them all
where is our son
hes locked in the upstairs bathroom
i think he just woke up
dana turns away
and begins to walk down the sidewalk in the opposite direction
walter lays inside the bathtub soaking wet
he is still wearing his suit from the wedding
he is shivering
his eye balls are now completely white
pupils no longer visible
is anyone there
he begins clawing at the walls
trying to figure out where he is
i cant see
he climbs out of the bathtub and begins to crawl across the tile floor
he runs into the door
and then reaches up and finds the doorknob
it is locked
he begins to bang on the door relentlessly
norma and arthur come up the stairs and round the corner of the hallway
walters hand reaches out through the crack beneath the door
norma tries to open the door but there is a massive lock installed on it
norma reaches down and takes her sons hand
can you hear me
he does not respond
and begins banging his head against the door
harder and harder
just his head
slamming against the door repeatedly
we need to kick the door down
he could get hurt
norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist
and eventually the thumping stops
she begins to hear quiet sobs from inside the bathroom
norma rises to her feet
come downstairs arthur
she takes his left hand
as he clutches walters hand in his right
i need you to come downstairs with me
suzanne weller s sits on her bed
her husband kenneth weller s stands at the window
neither looks like they have slept in a while
suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of her
the glass dome is open
im gonna push it
arthur and norma stand across from one another in the kitchen
arthur holds the gun in his right hand
and he slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms
i love you and im so sorry
im so sorry that i did this to us
im the one who told you to push the button
so dont apologize
he looks out through the window at his back yard
likely for the last time
i love you too
and please know
that i regret nothing in this life weve lived together
ill be waiting
counting the days until my arthur comes to see me
suzanne weller smiles at her husband
reaches her finger out and places it on the button
she then presses down
their sons head banging against the door
its going to be harder for you to live than for me to die
arthur closes his eyes
the noise is excruciating
there is no time to wait any longer
lets get on with it
arthur kisses her
then steps back
still clutching her hand
raises the gun
and fires off a round into her heart
arthur falls with her
breaking her fall with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum floor
suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged giggle
he smiles back
arthur looks down into his wifes eyes as the life drains from her body
norma is dead
blood begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across the linoleum
arthur is now covered in it
walter crawls across the blood soaked kitchen floor and reaches up to the phone that is mounted on the wall
he takes his finger and places it in the cradle
the camera tracks along a series of cubicles at the police station in downtown richmond
an operator sits at each cubicle
each one female
how may i direct your call
the camera moves in closer
arthur has the phone to his ear
imprints of his wifes blood are smeared on the phones receiver
this is arthur lewis at monument avenue
ive just shot my wife
can you please send an ambulance
the operator begins to ask more questions
but arthur does not listen
he hangs up the phone
the thumping from upstairs has now subsided
he pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer
arthur rounds the corner at the base of the stairs
arthur rounds the corner of the upstairs hallway
rushes toward the bathroom door
walters hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the door
arthur grabs it
can you hear me
what do you see
where are you walter
im in the bathroom
can you see clearly
i can see
everything is bright
but i can see
everything is bright
everything is bright walter
youre gonna be okay buddy
whats going on
youre gonna be okay buddy
thats all that matters
thats all that matters now
out of the corner of his eye arthur notices something at the top of the stairs
it is a police officer
he has his gun aimed at arthur
arthur stares at the officer
the repercussions of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun
and the cop rushes over and pushes him over onto his stomach
handcuffing his wrists together
the doorbell rings
suzanne weller opens the door
arlington is standing there with his briefcase
do you have the button unit
a coroner places a blanket over normas face as the house is sealed off by various crime scene investigators and other police
arthur is now being escorted by two police officers to a waiting cruiser that is parked in front of the house
jim burns is standing there with the door open
im sorry jim
he stares arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the cruiser
jim closes the door and goes around to the front of the car
jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine
arthur looks back through the window toward his house
upstairs in the master bedroom window
walter is watching tears streaming down his face
arthur reaches up with his hands
and tries his best to wave at his son
i m sorry
from the window
walter watches the car pull away from the curb
he places his hand on the glass
