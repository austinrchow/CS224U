by anthony minghella based on the novel cold mountain by charles frazier on a black screen credits
a range of mountains slowly emerges shrouded in a blue mist like a chinese water color
below them close to a small town young men armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist come charging in a muscular steaming pack
their opponents also swinging sticks attach the pack
a ball barely round made of leather emerges smacked forwards by inman who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by swimmer a young and lithe american indian
inman falls clutching his nose
the ball bobbles on the ground in front of him
he grabs it and gets to his feet the blood pouring from his nose
his team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge
a pristine cabriolet pulled by an impressive horse comes down towards the town
it has to pass across the temporary field of play parting the teams
some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by
the driver is a man in his early fifties dressed in the severe garb of a minister monroe
and next to him a self conscious girl in the spotless elaborate architectural skirts of the period is his daughter ada
inman using his shirt to staunch his battered nose looks at ada astonished by her
an angel in this wild place
now swimmer stops chanting and begins more hesitantly to translate into english you will be lonely
you will howl like a dog as you walk alone
you will carry dog shit cupped in your hands
you will be smeared with dog shit
your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue the colour of despair
as the cabriolet passes swimmer takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal
the game resumes
ada looks back as the men swarm into each other sticks and fists flailing
a side of beef turns on a huge barbecue
the battered teams eating drinking hard liquor rehearsing victory and defeat illuminated by a roaring bonfire
swimmer is sewing up a gash in inmans cheek as he continues to translate this is your path
there is no other
thats a curse you can use on the yankee before battle
and that works
you have to say it in cherokee
you said it to me in cherokee
during this monroe and ada have arrived escorted by sally swanger a local woman middle aged kindly and her husband esco a glorious curmudgeon
the monroes are introduced to various locals
inamn watches them on the other side of the crowd
the reverend monroe his daughter ada
up from charleston bringing gods word to you heathens
is escos preferred introduction
building a church
inman watches ada moves his head to keep her in view as swimmer stitches and winces with pain
so keep your head still
sally collects plates for the monroes
hands them to ada and her father who wait patiently for silverware
esco takes a plate picks up a skewer of meat bites on it
monroe pluckily follows suit
to swimmer anyway there wont be any war
and if there is they say it wont last a week
a stand of trees
the pastoral lush green virginia
a rabbit surfaces from its hole
peace and beauty
a second rabbit shakes itself from the ground darts into open ground to confront the forbidding trenches of the the outskirts of petersburg
massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses rows of xs define the two lines
the federals have been laying siege for months
so early and its already hot
the trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches
in the confederate lines the men are rousing boiling water for coffee or to shave smoking stiff from night
theres a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub nosed cannon
another rabbit is disturbed from its hole
ears pricked up to a distant rumbling
a dark hole
some evil place
a scraping sound
shapes burrowing forwards at a crouch
a silent purpose
young oakley freshly recruited approaches a group of men like him highlanders from company f of the th north carolina regiment
he doles out breakfast
inman loading his heavy lemats pistol its nine rounds is not hungry
oakley serves another rourke last seen in the scrum at cold mountain
oakley keeps his head low as he serves
dont worry son
those yankee boys keep store hours
they aint open yet
shadows and shapes
a barrel rumbles along the tunnel
it reaches a kneeling figure who rolls it forwards
a relay team
at the end of the tunnel where it widens a man naked to the waist crouches stacking the barrels
a rabbit scared up darts along the trench
rourke sees it beckons to another cold mountain boy butcher
thats fresh breakfast
im not firing start the damn war off
butcher chases after the rabbit rourke in raucous support
the crouching man has wrapped fuze wire around the last barrel and now retreats paying out the wire as he does so as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards
rourke weaves through the gun emplacements laughing
thats my rabbit
inman fifty yards away looks over amused goes back to his gun
the fuze wire is lit
it fizzes towards the barrels
rourke is running but now the ground buckles under him and hes being lifted slowly into the air the earth swelling
the confederates are in complete disarray
the federals pour forwards across no mans land through the peaceful oasis of trees roaring the roar of attack
they flood towards the crater hundreds of them charging into a dense and impenetrable wall of smoke
out again arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud
the confederates regroup
orders are yelled
chaos developing into battle
the confederates begin firing into the crater
guns and mortar wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death trap
inman gets to his feet
oakley with him and rushes through the smoke to the pit emptying his lemats into the crater
later a black regiment from the union join the attack
bodies falling on bodies as the federals charge in and pack their comrades even tighter
the confederates make a pincer movement outside the crater forcing all the federals in
the confederates jump into the pit to engage the federals
hand to hand fighting
too close for rifles just bayonets and guns swung like clubs and inman sliding down into that hell tiring the nine rounds then the shotgun charge which does a terrible
men killing each other in embraces soldier crushed against soldier desperate to survive to kill to live
an oozing layer cake of bodies dead and frantically alive drowning in slick
young oakley loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case clubbing his opponent then slips onto him and is stuck with a bayonet the pain of which makes him
inman goes at it
hes a warrior punching and stabbing and firing
a coldly efficient killer
hes grabbed from behind and crushed a hand gouging at his face an almighty struggle
he falls and lands on top of oakley and he and his federal opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their pillow
the slaughter continues over and around them the sound the sound of hell and madness
the boy has his arm around inman like lovers
later the confederates run after the retreating union soldiers firing cavalry riding them down
inman stands the boys blood all over him exhausted and appalled
the crater behind him an abattoir of men
the victors are yelling pumped mad with adrenaline
butcher comes alongside inman
that was something
thats hell and weve been there
kicked old nicks asshole
a wounded black soldier sits up as butcher celebrates
butcher runs over but cant find a charge for his musket
he looks around in the stack of corpses pulling out weapons tries one not loaded throws it down tries another not loaded
the wounded man cant get up tries to drag himself like a crab away from butcher
inman yells at him appalled
you got a charge
he picks up another musket
the wounded federal slumps back dead
the dead being piled up for burial divided into allegiance
wounded prisoners able to walk are led away
a great deal of casual looting
of boots of equipment of personal items
inman sees a soldier in the crater lining up wounded federals putting their heads in a row
the man inman turns away sees another rebel extravagantly costumed a strange fiddle head protruding from his knapsack
this is stobrod thewes
hes bent over a dead federal examining his mouth
he reaches behind his back and roots around in the knapsack producing a pair of pliers which he inserts into the corpses mouth
hes yanking away when a swinging boot connects with his head and knocks him to the ground
startled he looks up to see inman hovering over him
thats gold in his mouth he got no need for
shrugs we take his boots
he examines his fiddle for damage
some orderlies pass lifting oakley away on a gurney
oakleys pale as a maiden the life leaking from him
inman walks a way with him
oakley looks up desperate to be brave
i got a few
i know you dont recognise me
im mo oakleys boy
inman finds this incredible its okay
i was thirteen when you all left
am i going to die
inman flicks his eyes to the orderly whose look confirms the boys wounds are certainly mortal
inman sits on the ground beside oakleys cot
around them the wounded are certainly dying makeshift care oil lights groans
id like to hear some music while i go
inman walks around the campfires
he hears some fiddle music
stobrod sees inman
inman stares his expression an instruction the turns and walks away
stobrod stands over oakley
consults with inman
what about bonapartes retreat
thats one i play
play me something sweet
like a girls waiting for me
stobrod looks at inman confused
play me something like theres nothing to fear from a merciful lord
to stobrod you heard him
nervous i only know a couple of tunes
like when youre thirsty up at bishops creek and the water is so cool
inman glares at stobrod
and stobrod starts to play
hesitant then with gathering confidence improvising increasingly expansive as if hes as surprised as everyone else
oakleys lips move
inman leans in
im reaching cold mountain before you
inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle stopping stobrod
the boy is dead
inman gets to his feet and walks away
a dozen men in the tent
inman has a book its cover gone rolled up and tied with a leather strap
his bookmark is a faded tintype photograph of a solemn young woman
he unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll
an officer comes into the tent approaches inman who makes a stand
dont get up soldier
you are mentioned tonight in my report
you are a credit to the highlands to north carolina and to the cause
tight do you have news sir on my application for transfer
a bloody day
its what our general said good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much
it was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers
right now soldier its me who is in need of volunteers
theres a dozen yankees in that stand of trees between us
stuck there from the retreat
come daylight they can shoot us down for sport
a beautiful night
lots of stars
inman and three others including butcher slide over the top of the trench far to one side of the stand of trees
the plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees closer to the enemy side than their own
the four men slither over the ground
inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses
he slithers over them
they work their way towards the trees
there are a half dozen federals crouching in the cover of the trees
they are dozing
only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the confederate lines the others have their backs to the enemy sitting against the trunks grabbing a few minutes sleep
as the four rebels approach still crawling one of the federals opens his eyes sees the attack shifts for his rifle
inman immediately stands up firing instantly killing him and two others while butcher throws himself at another
the exchanges are brief and savage and one of inmans party and all of the federals lay dead
then the rebels break from the trees
a flare goes up then another both from the confederate trenches
inman and his accomplices are picked out in a brilliant green light
shots follow from both sides aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines
as they get close voices cry out rippling down the trench joining their own admonitions dont shoot hold your fire theyre our boys hold your fire
theyre almost home
butcher is laughing whooping
then just as suddenly he falls wounded
inman stops turns back runs to him
inman collects butcher drags him carries him
theyre fifty yards from their lines
a bullet catches inman in the neck
he goes down like a tree blood pouring from his neck
lying on the ground he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black all sound fading with them
a wooden joist swings across the view of the blue ridge
men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished chapel below which appears the small town of cold mountain
among the workers armed with nails and hammer knees clutching a rafter is inman fresh and a whole lifetime younger
rourke and butcher are also there hammering building kidding around and oakley barely a teenager
below them women are setting up a lunch for the workers ada amongst them
she has the circumspect air of the blue stocking uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem the mens radar for her every move
inman watches her as sally swanger approaches
to ada as monroe moves off ada how are you settling in
are you liking the farm
its beautiful country
so listen if you would say hello to one of these fools ill get a field cleared this weekend
like a forfeit
pointing at inman who immediately looks away no
him in particular up in the rafters
been pressing me all morning
up on the roofbeams of the chapel the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the union
hammering i call this nail northern aggression
hammering i call this nail a free nigger
show some respect these nails are making a church
hammering i call this nail respect the church
ada comes over carrying a tray of lemonade glasses
calls up to inman
inman swings down
he feels the other men staring burning a hole in his head
im ada monroe
repeating a thing doesnt improve it
shrugs people call me inman
if you were to take a glass of lemonade your friends might stop staring
theyre not my friends
he drops down to ground level takes the lemonade scowls at the other guys
theyre breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables they enjoy jostling inman
and what do you do
i work wood
got a piece of land
mostly work wood
uncomfortable i can clear a field
so was there something in particular you wished to say to me
thinks about it not that comes to me
hands back the glass ill say thank you for the lemonade
and he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch
ada watches him intrigued
rourke and co
approach esco swanger a known sympathizer with the north to give him a bad time
esco loves the yankees
i prefer a yankee to a halfwit
inman arrives just as rourke points a warning finger at esco
he pushes the finger down to get by
esco continues what is it you think youd be fighting for
and whats that when its at home
escos sons ellis and acton whore working at the other end of the building have now arrived at the table
pop you causing trouble
that means yes
you cut the wood you carry the water for good old king cotton
now you want to fight for him
somebody has to explain it to me
to rourke and the others dont even try
the others are desperate to tease inman
hows the lemonade
ada at the lemonade stand again watches them laughing at inman who keeps his head fixed on the table
inman on a gurney carried someone with a cloth to his neck which is soaked through with blood
they start to run with him heading for the field hospital worried that he will die before the wound can be staunched cauterized
throughout a strange music plays discordant notes jangling from a piano lashed to a cart as it bounces along the lane passing the swanger farm
sally comes out to look
its ada riding next to one of the farmhands a second boy keeping watch over the piano
sally goes over
thats a fine looking thing
ive been missing it
thank you by the way
from adas quizzical look inmans down in the bottom field clearing his debt
and then he had nothing to say
he was happy
are men so different in charleston
i dont know
i dont even know what a woman should be like
in charleston i was called a thistle twice by two different men
both of them they were hunting for a simile what was i like and thistle came right to them
if youre saying you might like him why not go down and say hello
inmans working in the field stripped to his undershirt hot work wielding a scythe
he hears something and looks up at the edge of the lane ada is playing the piano which is still strapped to the cart
she briefly raises a hand to inman then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way again
inman smiles waves back watching as the cart rumbles off down the track
its pouting with rain
inside the farmhouse ada is playing men and women crowd into the parlour in best clothes celebrating the completion of the chapel
inman is outside on the porch his coat soaked water pouring off his hat
he looks at ada
monroe steps in front of the applause smiling
his words of thanks leak through the window to inman who stands watching listening
monroe circulates with ada
he nods at a group of men who congregate in one part not mingling
their leader teague might be a minister himself favouring a black dress coat a black crow in the corner eyes flashing
ada doesnt know them
esco comes by
monroe puts a hand on his arm
esco our friends there indicating teague and co
they helped build the chapel
thats teague and his boys
id recommend you kick them out except a man dont kick a snake
one time the teague family owned the whole of cold mountain
my farm your farm all belonged to his grand daddy
teague wanted this place bad
you got it
hes here sniffing out an advantage
theres no advantage here but to celebrate a job well done
cheers he raises his glass and thank you
and teague raises his glass across the room
ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch
shes carrying a tray with drinks
were you planning to come inside
im wetter than a fish
theres a good fire going
im all right
somebody said you were enlisting
no response are you
if theres a war well all fight
unimpressed if theres a mountain well all climb if theres an ocean well all drown
call a thing a war makes it a challenge to some men
did you get a picture made
a tintype with your gun and your courage on display
youre laughing at me
i dont know you
youre always carrying a tray
im taking a drink over to the negroes in the barn
takes the tray ill do that
i cant get much wetter
he goes into the night rain
she watches him
a beautiful day the farm peaceful
inman walks up the path to the farmhouse its borders flowering and pretty a slave woman weeding
he knocks on the door
what can i do for you
inman hovers awkward
ada appears awkward
i have some sheet music
belonged to my father
no use to me
ada comes forward takes the package
you must come in
i should probably get along
inman is more comfortable outdoors
perhaps we might take a walk
a splendid idea
monroe and inman and ada touring the farm
its a biggish property over three hundred acres
and well tended by the dozen slave farmhands who work it some of whom are dotted about in the landscape
rolling mountains dominate the view
expansive i want to get sheep into this field
a big field doesnt look right without sheep
youre a lucky fellow mr
inman youve had this view all your life
i think so
its a special view
i dragged my poor daughter to cold mountain from charleston because of my doctors they say my heart is weak so the airs meant to do me good
but its the view i think heals
ada walking behind comes alongside the two men threading her arm into her fathers but by so doing also arriving next to inman
i have to get on my visits
can i offer you a ride back into town
inman looks at ada
from the window ada watches the cabriolet head towards town
at the piano she unwraps the leather lace from the package of music
inside the first book of music theres a daguerreotype of inman with his lemats a typical confederate pose
some of the music has left its imprint on the picture the notes like a melody over inmans face
ada picks them out on the piano
the ebullient sound of shape singing
a noisy choir letting rip the other
monroe conducts sings
inman is there as is ada
he fixes on her neck the way the hair falls
the door bursts open
young oakley apologetic nod to monroe sits at the back then leans forward as the singing continues to say something to rourke who says something to butcher the news spreading
rourke gets up leaves
butcher gets up next follows
depleting the male voices until only women and some of the older men are singing and one side of the church is practically empty
inman remains fixed on ada
who does not look round
those left in the congregation now spill out into what has become a melee as the news of secession goes up
enormous excitement particularly among the boys who now seem curiously attractive to the girls
inman blinks out into the sun ada finds him
theyre awkward as they watch other sweethearts embracing
well you have your war
teague and his men come riding up the street their horses clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd
teague reins in his horse and rides it up against esco swanger
those who follow lincoln or preach abolition best keep one eye open when theyre sleeping old bogey man might get you
inman steps between esco and teague holding the reins of teagues horse easy and dangerous
are you the law all of a sudden
teague produces a document which he waves in the air
thats right son
home guard for haywood county
im the law from today
you all go fight now
well watch your sweethearts
and he spurs on his horse his fellow home guard falling in behind riding on over the ridge
inman walks to ada
you might be safer back in charleston
but then wholl be waiting for you
she puts a hand on his arm for a second
they both want to get to the point of declaration but dont know how
they stand people noisy around them those about to leave those about to be left
im going to walk back inside the chapel
and he does so making his meaning clear for her to follow
inman walks inside
stands with his back to the door
it opens and closes
did you want a quiet word
now the door opens again and its ada
shes dismayed to see her father
just some quiet
of course ada
he indicates they should both leave
inman sits at a bench
monroe and ada come into town in their cabriolet
they pass under banners proclaiming the confederate cause old rips awake
watch out yankees
the trap draws up by the cold mountain general store
monroe lets ada down
of his appointment ill daresay dr
obrienll want to do a test or two
and then therell be a coffee or two a brandy or two
monroe smiles in acknowledgement gets back in the trap
ada heads into the store
inman sits on his bed wearing pants and a vest
his room is like a monks cell
nothing in it
inmans trunk is packed
hes polishing his boots in his bare feet
one hand inside the boot the other blacking it
theres a knock at the door
he opens it
he abruptly closes the door on her
ada waits outside
shes not sure whats happening
then inman opens the door
hes buttoning his shirt
his boots are on one conspicuously dirty one highly polished
somebody walks up the stairs carrying a jug and bowl
they separate as the man passes them
theyre tender awkward
i found you this book
they tell me its good
i think he writes about these parts the author so
inman takes it
she has something else
wrapped in paper
hands it to him im not smiling in it
i dont know how to do that hold a smile so now im solemn
he kisses her pressing into her his arm circling her waist
below them the sound of a marching band
its the recruitment parade and brings rourke and butcher racing down the stairs
inman pulls away from ada as the boys hurtle for the front door
rourke butcher and then inman appear in the doorway of the rooming house and then fall in with the motley crew of volunteers as they march by with the band
and the enlisted soldiers
the town is out to wish them well parents younger brothers sweethearts walking alongside their brave men
ada comes to the door of the rooming house
inman looks back and sees her but almost immediately loses her in the crowd
the a train with the seriously injured snakes past the back of the confederate lines its suburbs of supplies arriving and departing troops and into peaceful country
fiddle a crowded wagon
its a cauldron and those able smash through the wooden walls to make a breathing hole
some have their heads thrust out like crated poultry
inman is in there neck bandaged its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace
the light plays black and white through the boarded sides of the boxcar flashing on inmans face as he drifts in and out of consciousness
he focuses and sees the strange head of stobrods fiddle
stobrod is serenading him accompanied by an angel faced and extremely heavy child man pangle whose grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic grim world
inman is panicked puts a hand to push the fiddle away
his voice is a croak spoiled
im not dying
to pangle whatd he say
says he aint about to die
to inman truth to tell they say you are soldier
well meet again in the better world
he changes his tune and the tempo finding a foot slapping rhythm the two musicians grinning at each other
inman lapses back into unconsciousness
the rhythm becomes a hammering sound
as a man hammers a tintype of his sons face into the wooden porch of the chapel where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war
one of the slaves from black cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father
other families wait with their own daguerreotype to mount
its a memorial service without bodies
teague brings his horse up alongside monroe at the chapel door tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families
with him is a young intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider bosie his hair long a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown
my condolences to you all
he considers the slave keep an eye on the negro
they want what the white man got all of you watch out your brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder rape and arson to
the only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm
theyre good christians and ill vouchsafe for them
cold mountain at its loveliest
the cabriolet with monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm
at a bend they meet a couple of riders twins from teagues home guard riding furiously past them
monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home
monroe is intrigued by ada as if hes never looked at her before
youre looking at this moment i dont know why youre looking exactly like your mother
every time you see the doctor you get melancholy
he listens to my heart and i get emotional
he gives you alcohol and you get emotional
she squeezes his arm
we commiserate about the folly of this terrible war
they ride in silence do you worry when theres no word from him
no response from mr
but then ive tried counting the number of words which passed between mr
inman and me
looking ahead seeing smoke is that a bonfire
so close to the barns
then they see the family of slaves turn off the road as their cabriolet approaches running away into the fields
whats going on
shouting at the disappearing slaves hey
monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields after the retreating family who are carrying bundles chairs personal items all loaded up
ada has already taken the reins and has driven up to the house
the barn in which the slave family had lived is on fire
monroe catches one of the women remonstrates with her
shes upset distressed one of her sons comes back pushes monroe to the ground
they hurry away
monroe gets up hurries to the fire
monroe spies it as he catches up with ada
no daddy its not real
the figure swings round
its an effigy a grotesque appalled what is wrong with us all
ada turns and runs off
ill get help
shouting over her shoulder keep away from the flames
monroe stands and considers the flames
ada turns back once more to see him a small man silhouetted against the blaze
inman lies bandaged eyes closed in the ballroom of a colonial mansion co opted as one ward of a confederate hospital
rows of beds the wounded and the dying are lodged between some vestiges of the rooms former glory
some local women conscious of their duty to the cause are brought through by an exhausted doctor whos lost all his grace
the windows are open but its still insufferably hot the muslin curtains barely moving
most of these men will be dead by the morning or if theyre stubborn by nightfall
i have other men outside in the quadrangle waiting for the beds
the women try to process this the attitude
so any kind word will be a blessing
one woman is overpowered by the stench gags
its the heat
the women begin to approach the beds
if theyre not god fearing you can stir up a hornets nest
morgan nervous decent sits next to inman
his mouth is moving
she doesnt know what hes saying
im sorry you want water
she bends to him again
his voice is a faint croak
little east fork
the doctor is on his exit stops at the bed
i dont know what hes saying
names of loved ones
listening to inman pigeon river
is that a place
the doctor shrugs not a detective moves on stops at the man in the next bed
has a brief look calls to a nurse
this man is dead
monroe and ada are outside a picnic at the summer table autumn leaves blowing up around them
nearby the charred skeleton of the barn
ada gets up clears away
staying her for grace for your providence oh lord we thank you
that was the last of the ham
it was delicious
i have to learn how to cook
i was going to say something in chapel
perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer
i cant have people coming here and cooking for me
its my fault
i should have raised you less like a companion and more like a young woman
im not sorry but i dont know how well get through another winter
will you play me something
something peaceful while i look over my sermon
ada takes the dishes away
he gets out his papers his pen and ink
ada plays the piano
chopins prelude in e minor
outside in the garden monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair and is hunched over his notes
the door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works
a few spots of rain appear at the window
then the steady drumming of a summer shower
still playing daddy bring the tablecloth in with you
she plays some more
monroe hasnt come in
the rain splashes on to the window
daddy come inside before you drown
after a few more bars she stops playing and curious goes to the door
she stands at the doorway
monroes sermon is abstractions his hand dropped and visible to ada as with dread she approaches
she catches the sodden papers chasing hes like a fish his face shining with the rain and glass eyed
she leans in to him her head to his heart then runs oblivious to the rain her dress already drenched runs down the lane
inmans face as he drifts in and out of consciousness
morgan the hospital volunteer sits by inmans bed
she holds adas unopened letter badly weather damaged the pages stuck together the writing blurred where the ink has run
its come to you by way of virginia
there are various dates which she decodes
its not too recent written this past winter
im afraid i cant read who its from
inman ada is writing at her fathers desk
a lonely room
im still waiting as i promised i would but i find myself alone and at the end of my wits mrs
morgan reads to inman trying to decipher the letter at the end of my wits so now i say to you plain as i can come back to me
come back to me is my request
cant read the next bit then something i cant read something come back to me
inman is very still
then eyes glinting with determination gives a tiny nod
by order of zebulon vance governor of this great state of north carolina any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog
ada walks down the hill from the chapel
there is an absence of young people but the older folk are gathered round the general store where a uniformed official is reading from a document
any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason
the official is flanked by teague bosey and the twins puffed up with self importance
ada has to walk around him to enter the store
the home guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit without notice or constraint
names of all deserters will be posted in every town published in every newspaper
the official continues outside as ada enters
ada approaches mrs castlereagh the owner
is there a letter for me
nothing were getting no post through at all although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived
they go to the back of the store to a screened off area
castlereagh hands her over a packet of material
theres another more furtive transaction to take place
mrs castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics
ada tears at the wrapping
its a parcel of books
if folks knew i was taking deliveries from the north
thank you so much
the sooner we lose this war the better
already one boy gone another with his leg took off at the knee
what do you hear
all i know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters
ada emerges almost collides with teague
she wriggles past him tries to make her package invisible
a solitary rider jogs his horse through the frost towards black cove farm
ada is working at a handpump failing to coax water from the well
shes wrapped in blankets
the farm is somewhat unkempt and so is she
the hem of her skirt is frayed
she rips at it tearing off a strip of material which she binds around the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism
then she looks up to see the horseman approaching
ada immediately heads inside the house
teague arrives at the house takes a brace of rabbits from his saddlebag
he heads for the gate
the gate needs oiling the path is overgrown he looks at the pump handle the abandoned pitcher
ada opens the door pinning her hair
its taken me too long but ive come to pay my respects
hands over the rabbits i reckoned you might need fattening up
ada takes them
she is very queasy with these dead animals
this house must bring bad luck
killed my granddaddy to lose it then my daddy died on account of not having it then your daddy died on account of getting it
we should burn it down
didnt somebody try
lot to manage without help
need a hand with that pump
im happy to volunteer
but not to volunteer for the war
i wanted to go
but you know too old too literate
plus i got no spleen
lost it from a horses kick
youve got no spleen
thats the thing about an organ
you dont know you need it till you lost it
suddenly busy with a bayonet i want to clear this path
i can just as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk
then you can say men beat a path to your door
id really prefer it if you didnt do that
would you rather i did my job
scything at the path see if theres any material i should confiscate
for the war effort
i was raised in the good manners of the south where a gentleman doesnt enter a house with a woman alone
now hes at the pump good manners didnt quite make it to these mountains
if it dont yield meat or you cant sit on it or suck on it
he gets the pump going water pours out and youre sleeping all right
these cold dark nights
im sleeping fine
its going to be a long hard winter
he turns and stops at the gate runs his hands through his hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge
then steps up onto his horse and rides away
ada watches him
ada comes into the kitchen
a weak oil lamp reveals the two rabbits partially covered on a plate flies buzzing around them a little liquid leaking from them
ada takes a knife and contemplates skinning gutting them
suddenly she gathers them up and runs out
ada buries the two rabbits
the wind howls
she covers the little hole with soil and stones
pumps out water to wash her hands
thinks she hears a noise listens alert to any unfamiliar sounds then hurries back to the house
ada comes inside she closes the door
puts a chair against it
goes upstairs to her bedroom
ada enters her bedroom
its a chaos of books clothes dishes
she closes the door sets another chair against it
then drags her armchair up against that books and papers spilling onto the floor
she props up inmans portrait on the chair as if he were guarding her
sits on the bed and desolate begins to write should i imagine you are dead and that it is to your spirit i am writing
no word from you in all this time
if you receive this please know i am here and warring too with a faint heart
therapy for wounded soldiers
some of those convalescing swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea
there are rudimentary wheelchairs
inman a long way from home is amongst those sitting in one of these very still grey and sick but alive
he pulls at the dressing on his neck exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air
inman has his bartram his bookmark is the battered and foxed picture of ada which he considers before continuing to read
behind him a hundred slaves at work in the fields and behind them the mansion which has become the hospital
a series of bells of shouts and the slaves stop working prepare for the long walk home congregating then forming a line herded by the foremen
inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in the seawater
he brings the wet bandage to his neck considers the ocean his fellow ragtag of wounded the slaves the great fields the mansion
the whole meaning of this war around him
a gravel voice starts to sing the blues continues the men return to the hospital
a blind man is selling peanuts which he roasts over a small fire
hes singing as a tintype of oakley is added to the chapels votives hammered in alongside rourke and butcher
there are fifty or more images now the paint flaking around them
the exterior of the chapel three years on has taken on the burden of recording history
there is no minister no services just the votives daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers
the town shrouded in mist and quiet
everywhere signs of profound neglect like a grimms fairy tale of a deserted house
the fields are overgrown with weeds the gardens abandoned
the chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings scuffing at the packed dirt
sally and esco come up the overgrown path avoiding the chickens and knock at the door
ada its sally
theyre seen from ground level through a boxwood as their feet patrol the ground turn away from the door and then retreat their voices drifting away
ada is there crouching in her hidey hole a blanket on the ground her book
she wants to reveal herself but is too embarrassed
will you look at the state of this place
shes got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery
during this a rooster black and gold struts into the boxwood
as the rooster approaches ada shudders tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence
ada peers through the boxwood as sally and esco close the gate and recede
the rooster comes at her again
she rises up kicking out at it while he flares his wings spurs flaying at her
ada runs from the boxwood tormented by the triumphant rooster which continues to fly and scratch driving her into the house
ada dabs at the scratches her dress rolled down to the waist to reveal her arms and shoulders
now she shucks off the dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement
there isnt one so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket for something less dirty
ada enters her fathers room wearing undergarments
everything as he left it and in contrast to the rest of the house extremely tidy
she opens a wardrobe finds one of his coats puts it on
its much too big and she rolls up the sleeves catches her pinched face and disheveled face in a swivel mirror
she turns the mirror away and the image swings into the figure of inman walking frail grey
a kind of lurching walk as if his balance isnt guaranteed
he gets close to the gate and interests a guard on the lookout for would be deserters
a blind man is selling peanuts which he roasts over a small fire
hes always singing
when inman speaks his voice is a croak
getting better all the time
seems that way
i wouldnt hurry
wars almost done
whered you take your wound
before i was born
never saw a thing in this world not a tree a gun or a woman
though i put my hand on all three
couple of things i felt back there id sure liked to have had a long look at
hes shoveling some peanuts into a twist of paper
what would you give for that
to have your eyeballs back for ten minutes
wouldnt give an indian head cent
i fear it might turn me hateful
thats sure what seeings done to me
that aint the way i meant it
you said ten minutes
its having a thing and then the loss im talking about
then we dont agree
theres not much i wouldnt give for ten minutes of someplace
someplace or someone
you watch yourself
theyre shooting men who take themselves a walk
inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way under supervision towards the town
the grandeur of the approach the carriages
the sorry state of the soldiers
two great trestle tables loaded with clothes
underneath the tables boots laced together origins various
the charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering soldiers some of whom are still on crutches or in wheelchairs
inman finds a black dresscoat some pants a pair of boots
he accumulates a little pile
on his way out an elderly and staunch confederate gentleman shakes his hand and gives him an apple from the barrel
inman emerges from the courthouse and joins the line for a shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the courthouse
two barbers two chairs
a very elegant square next
inman settles in the seat
the barber contemplates his scraggy beard the livid scabbed wound on his neck
nervous ill cut your hair but i aint about to shave you
that thing opens up your heads liable to falloff
it is almost dawn
the window by inmans bed is a frame giving onto the still dark world
the night guard passes by on its patrol of the perimeter
a clean shaven inman is fully dressed under the covers
he gets his hat pushes his book into his knapsack and with one step up walks out of the window and inman his footprints in the sand as he hurries
along by the edge of the ocean away from the hospital
as ada walks the wind kicking up around her past the swanger place
shes bent and curiously dressed in her fathers coat
sally swanger calls out from the field
shes concerned at adas gaunt ragged appearance
ada waits for her approach
youre skinny as a whippet girl youre coming indoors with me
im not i need to clean some clothes
great god you ever looked at my husband
i cant get him to wear decent church clothes christmas morning
hang on to me the windll blow you over
and she folds her arm into adas
they walk up the lane
esco across from her contemplating her evident appetite the oversized mans jacket
sally ladles more food onto adas plate
dont go back to that dark house
theres a bed here least till our boys get home
that your daddys coat
i was saying to sally i wasnt expecting to be visiting so
dont suit you
he starts to chuckle then ada too then sally
i cant get up to your place this week
of sally shes mad at me i dont expect more than i can do to keep this place half managed
im ready to stop i tell you
i just want to sit on my porch with sal watch my boys in the field holler good job
every hour or so
what about your people in charleston
there are no people
and no money
my father had some bonds and investments
theyre worthless now of course the war has
theyre not worth anything
they look at each other i love it here
in spite of everything
and waiting on a feller
a look from sally
look down our well
sallys disgusted with him she should
look down our well with a mirror youll see the future
swhat they say
to sally you do it
dont make that face
i know it aint rightly christian but its what folks do like when they dangle a needle over the belly to see if youre carrying a boy or a girl
what kind of mirror
ada is bent backwards over the well a hand mirror glinting down into the blackness
the reflection is elusive against the bright evening sky the sun almost set and low
i dont know
i tried many a time never saw a dickybird
the image is clearer
the trees sharpen the figure walking the steep incline of the corridor all fiercely black and white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs of trees
and crows flying
the trick of the glass and the watery disc of the well surface
a buzzing in adas ears something like a distant music
then the figure seems to suddenly pitch forwards but at that moment ada canted over getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away replaced with the sky the
flash of the setting sun
you all right
she sits up blank a little shaken
yesterday i found myself crouched over a well like a mad woman which i suppose i have become inman walks along an expanse of marshland
great cranes fly heavily over him
and staring down into its secrets i thought i saw you there walking back to me ada is writing in her fathers campaign chair a blanket wrapped around her a
rake propped next to her
or wished i did
that cow wants milking
ada looks up from her writing with a start
she covers her letter guiltily instinctively
in front of her at the gate is a young rawboned feral woman of indeterminate origins
she is barefoot and dressed in a hand dye shift of blue
her name is ruby
if that letter aint urgent the cow is is what im saying
i dont know you
old lady swanger says you need some help
here i am
ada is instantly defensive intimidated
i need help i need i do need help but i need a laborer theres plowing and rough work and i think theres been a misunderstanding
whats the rake for
aint for gardening thats for sure
number one you got a horse i can plow all day
im a worker
number two theres no man better than me cause theres no man around who aint old or full of mischief
i know your plight
am i hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything
im not looking for money never cared for it and now it aint worth nothing
i expect to board and eat at the same table
im not a servant
do you get my meaning
youre not a servant
peoplell have to empty their own night jars thats my point
and im not planning to work while you watch neither
is that a yes or a no
looks at ruby yes
theres half the day yet
lets make a start
my names ruby
i know your name
the rake theres a rooster devil im sure of it
hes lucifer himself
i go near him hes at me with his spurs
i despise a flogging rooster
where is he
ada gets up nods to the corner of the yard
ruby goes over
the rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent
lets put him in a pot
inmans walking on a track which passes through cornfields the crop high and thick around him
he stops hearing something
he wades into the field seeking cover in the tall crop lying in the dirt
home guard in tow a couple of federal soldiers
they have dogs which sniff and growl intrigued by the fields called back by the home guard
inman waits until theyre well out of sight
as he gets to dotted around the field
he walks to the road paying no heed to them
they assemble paying no heed to him and move off in the opposite direction
inman turns looks at them
they stop turn id pay a dollar for an egg
a piece of cheese
they look at him then continue on their way
ada wakes up to persistent knocking
opening her eyes its still dark
tell the cows that
ada enters blearily clutching her novel
ruby already busy
i have to eat something
then you have to get up earlier
at adas book whats that
heading outside you want to carry a book carry one you can write in ruby emerges followed by ada chewing on a tomato
we got our own story
called black cove farm a catastrophe
she looks back at ada for a reaction
i can spell it too
c a t a s t r o phe
learned the same place you did in the schoolroom
thats one of the first words they taught me
ruby thewes you are a ca t a s t r o p h e
theyre heading for the stable
rubys already pitching hay
turns to ada
you mucking out
ada half asleep obedient stunned by this energy
three years i was in school before my daddy saying god rest his soul is like wishing him what he had in life cause he lived to rest he was
born tired before my daddy decided there was better use for my backside than have it sat all day in front of a blackboard
ruby dictates a list to ada as they bustle along
number one layout a winter garden for cool season crops turnips onions cabbage greens
ada scribbles walks scribbles
ruby up a ladder inspecting the roof
number two patch the shingles on the barn roof
do we have a maul and froe
writing holding the ladder maul
m a u l
i have no idea
ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel allowing the stream to flow free and cool
number three clay crocks for preserves
ruby doing her version of soil analysis scrunching the earth tasting it spitting it out
ada makes a face
clear and turn this field
no harm done letting it go fallow now well do well
ruby looks up
ada catches up with her
number fifteen sixteen
number sixteen lets get a martin colony going in the gourd house
keep away crows
you got one thing in abundance on this farm and thats crows
whats a gourd house
ruby delighted contemplates the bounty of apples
on them trees
turns to an exhausted ada you got a cider press or would that be wishing on a blessing
actually yes i think we do
ruby whoops jogs away
ada exhausted takes a bite of an apple watches her
side a steep cliff to the other the way itself broken and precarious bad country to meet an enemy
inman sees a light in the distance a torch flicking in and out of view like a star to follow
he stops narrows his eyes to focus on the view listening hard
he pulls out the lemats
the horse has a burden a sack or wrapped bundle draped over either side of the saddle
the attempts to heave the bundle onto his shoulders
he cant and the bundle slips to the ground cover falling enough to glimpse an arm a head
it is the body of a black girl
the man tries again to lift her
hes clearly upset despairing his hat comes off to reveal long dandys hair all extravagant curls
he staggers with the weight of the girl heading for the lip of the deep gorge
he kisses the girl again and again cheeks mouth mumbling to her
hes at the edge now and can just let her go
then dont let go
just back up nice and steady do this all in reverse youre going to end up with her draped back over your animal
dont pull that trigger
i am a man of god
ive killed several of them
i mean i am gods minister
what part of gods business is throwing a woman down a gorge
a slave woman can you see that in this light
shes black as a bucket of tar
hes retreating on his way back to the horse
is she dead
like you would a butterfly
and i care for her thats the heartbreak of it
he has the girl back on the horse
inman brings the torch up to his face
its tear stained
shes got my bastard in her belly
what kind of pistol is that i never saw the like of it
inman leads the horse with veasey ahead of him hands tied behind his back desperate for a reprieve
im begging you
its better you blowout my brains than return me to this place
where does she live
in our house
she sleeps in our kitchen
you dont know me friend but the good lord punished me with want
i am all appetite
thats all i do all day is want food the female parts
shut your mouth
i dont want a sermon every time i ask a question
theyre in the towns main drag now
theres a chapel and next to it a small house
this your place
dear god of misery
youre going to put her back where she sleeps
i do that the members will lynch me
consorting with a nigger adultery siring a bastard while serving as their preacher
were a strict congregation weve churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath
so you reckoned to kill her
disgusted inman approaches the front door of the house
theres a back door
and he leads inman down a side path
veasey comes in now carrying the girl
inman comes behind the gun trained on veasey as he sets her down by the fire
whispering thank you
i was going to do a grievous wrong
he looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around her shoulders
he turns to inman
you tasted dark meat
sweet as liquorice
i think i should go back up to my wife
she wakes at the slightest noise
inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed
you find me some paper and a pen
of his chapel
inman is pinning a sheet of paper above veaseys head
its covered in handwriting
a dog barks
youre not entitled to judge me
youre nothing but an outlier plain as daylight
inman has pulled a handkerchief from veaseys jacket
he stuffs it into his mouth cutting this diatribe short
and then he walks away leaving veasey tied to the tree cursing through the handkerchief
ruby enters shattering the calm
pigs you have any loose in the woods
we bought our hams
theres a world more to a hog than the two hams
lard for example well need plenty she picks up some discarded laundry contemplates the overflowing laundry basket
the catastrophe of ada monroes laundry
marching out i can feel you shutting your eyes
ada and ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings of a split rail fence
as they struggle with a heavy rail ruby is testing ada
whats this wood
i dont know
north is north is name me three herbs growing wild on this farm
frustrated with ruby and with herself i cant
i can talk about farming in latin
will that do
i can read french
i know harmony and counterpoint
i know my bible
i can name the principal rivers of europe but dont ask me to name one stream in this county
i can embroider but i cant darn i can arrange cut flowers but i cant grow them
if a thing has a function if i might do something with it it wasnt considered suitable
ruby you could ask why
about pretty much everything to do with me
they manage to get the first line of rail set down
this fence is about the first thing ive ever done thatll produce an actual result
so you never wrapped your legs around this inman
an old fashioned look from ada
inman finds himself in a sunken forest of pine
he moves warily his beard longer his figure gaunt his clothes weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal
he hears dogs barking in the distance faint shouts
he picks up his pace skirts round the swampy lake
inman comes to the bank of a huge river
the water as the light begins to go is the color of mud with bubbles belching to the surface full of ugly prominent
inman is almost jogging now an ear tracking his still distant pursuers
the river is too wide to contemplate swimming and now it begins to curve left forcing him against his judgment to circle back
he approaches a small jetty
a sign ferry
on the far bank theres a cabin on stilts above the highwater mark
inman calls out reluctantly his voice still a kind of growl
a tiny figure steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping into a small canoe
the canoe heads against the current the rowers back bent with the effort
as the canoe approaches inman sees that the ferryman is in fact a young girl not eighteen
she doesnt look at him
he produces five dollars
she eyes the bill with contempt
for five dollars i wouldnt give a parched man a dipper of this riverwater
sign says ferry five dollars
this look like a ferry
my daddys dead or gone off to the federals dont matter which
im the way across now
whats the name of this thing
nothing but the mighty cape fear river is all
a dog barks in the distance
inman turns to the sound
the ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage
nobody crosses this water unless theyre running from someplace
some cross one way some the other makes no difference theyre all running
you want to wait for your friends
i can give you thirty dollars script
inman is astonished to see veasey stumble out of the trees
his head is shaved his face bruised and swollen his clothes castoffs and ill fitting cinched at the waist with rope
he stumbles towards inman urging him to get on with the journey
were both in trouble
he gets straight into the canoe
made me tell them all about you
i should have shot you when i had the chance
shouts more barking
inman jumps in the canoe and theyre off
the ferrygirl turns the boat around rows them away from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for the thousandth time
im not looking for revenge by the way
for what you did to me
no im a pilgrim now like you traveling the road paying our dues relying on the kindness of strangers
youre nothing like me and the last thing i want right now is a conversation
to ferrygirl you recall job in the scriptures
i will give free utterance to my complaint
i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
thats our friend here
to inman they cut off my hair
which was hard
i was vain about my hair
to ferrygirl i had good curls
but i deserved it
im the reverend veasey
have i seen you in church
inman sits scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers
the sun is sinking fast
im saving for a cowhide and when i get it i aim to get a saddle made and when i get me a saddle ill save for a horse and
when i got a horse ill throw on the saddle and then you wont see my sorry ass round this swamp again
she has no love for the river
another gurgle of viscous bubbles around the canoe
keep your hand in the boat
already looks like some critter chewed his neck
she looks at inman thirty more dollars we can go to the cabin
ill pull this dress over my head
excited have we got thirty dollars
a sharp sound a tiny thwack of ball on meat
the ferrygirl suddenly slumps back and falls into the water
veasey grabs out at the oar but it goes too
the girl sinks quickly a bloody gap to the side of her head
inman on his knees and stretching cant help her
then a second noise as a hole the size of a fist appears in the canoe just at waterlevel
water pours into the canoe
dogs bark and now figures are visible at the jetty
one of them has a snipers rifle and is loading for a third shot
inman can see him sighting the rifle
they lie flat in the canoe
another great fist of wood is gouged out
now the boat is almost full of water
veasey spits out a foul mouthful
inman rocks the canoe and lets it turn over onto them veasey surfaces from under it clutching the wood as a raft but the canoe catches inman a blow to
his head and he sinks
veasey hauls him to the surface and surprisingly strong holds him with one fist the boat with the other lets the current take them pulling them under then up under
then up but clinging on as the rifle continues to deliver its assault another shot into the boat another into the water near to veaseys arm
the girls body comes by them carried by the river the dress billowing out almost covering her head
the sun has gone the light fading the canoe sliding downriver away from their aggressors
in the moonlight the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and veasey drags a half drowned inman to land both of them retching with the vile river water
an alligator eases into the river not ten feet from where they lie lungs heaving
they get up
veasey to his feet inman to his knees
inman nods coughs
and veasey aims a kick at inmans head knocking him back into the mud
i figure that righteous given our history
otherwise id bear a grudge on our journey
theres nowhere im going with you except to hellfire
ada her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration is working on rubys hair while ruby experiments with some earrings
a pile of adas jewelry on the bed beside them
agricola poetis viam non monstrat
the farmer does not point out the road to a poet
should be the other way round which means i suppose which means the poet should know where hes going
of adas hairdressing its no wonder youre helpless and hopeless if it takes this long to fix your hair
of the latin say some more
terra mutata non mutat mores
cant believe she knows all these phrases by heart its appalling whats in my head
its appalling whats in my head
no it means a change of place does not change a character
well thats surely true even in english
you can keep those earrings
we cant keep anything
i have to keep the bangles
they were my mothers
well thats all
the rest is for trading
else they can bury you in your finery
of her hair youre done
theres a small mirror on a stand
it has inmans picture stuck in it
she picks it up removing the tintype and holding it up for ruby to see her hairstyle
she takes the mirror and shows ada her simple plait
i like it
takes two minutes
thats what i like
she puts the earrings back in the pile
how much do you love that piano
the piano jangles down the rutted lane on the back of mr
ada watches a small flock of sheep milling around her in the path
ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard
ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house
ada arrives in the kitchen
theyve got it under control now scrubbed and orderly
she puts the sack down next to another one
her hands are calloused the finger nails cracked and ruined stripes of earth under them
ruby comes in struggling with the last sack pleased
were careful well get through the winter now
i made old man roy give me ten of those sheep on account of i said they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper sheep
my father always wanted sheep on this land
im sorry you had to lose your piano
i cut off my hair once for money
my daddy got two dollars for it
made a wig for a rich feller in raleigh
theyre working as they talk taking the sacks into the larder putting out stuff for the evening meal
stobrod called himself a musician my daddy he could play six tune on a fiddle
got himself shot dead at petersburg
i was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post
he left me once up the mountains
i was eight
he was gone over two weeks
defiant i was all right
hed walk forty miles for liquor and not forty inches for kindness
and your mother
never met her
were the same in that regard
he said she was he told me a thousand stories she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey
dont say much for him except you know hed be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it
theres a pause
ruby not easy with her emotions
abruptly she jumps up
theres cows to milk
inman stands in the river hoping to catch a fish trying to concentrate
veasey presides complaining
used to be as regular as morning prayers
matter of fact i could set my watch by my bowels
that beeswax you fed me day before yesterday it stops a man up
open my gut now theyd find turds stacked up like little black twigs
on a parallel track across the river riders
impossible to say whether home guard or a federal raiding party
inman splashes out of the water pushes veasey down silencing him
the riders pass
veasey spots something shining in the grass picks it up
look at this
flexing it this is a good saw
getting up its not yours
you take it you make us another enemy
youre a christian don t you know your commandments
youll find the good lord very flexible on the subject of property
we could do a lot with this saw
inman is vexed walks away
veasey follows experimenting with the saws music when flexed
inman stalks on
inman way ahead full of purpose
veasey still has the saw trots to catch up
why you in such a hurry the whole time
no answer hurry or slow the destination is always the same
its only the journey that is different
thats either in the good book or i made it up
inman suddenly stops scowling puts up a hand listens
inman carefully scouts the track then with great caution edges towards the river bank
a heavy set man labours in the water
hes contemplating the huge black carcass of a bull which has slipped into the ford and died
the man is wet and exasperated
good day to you
the man turns his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect of help
his name is junior
hes working on roping the animal
my old bull wandered off and died in this here creek
fouled up our water is how i found it
veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal
this is a tricky one
the three men contemplate the carcass swatting away the swarms of flies
junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor
inman refuses veasey takes a long pull shudders happily
the name for the bulls member is a tassel
i learned that and never forgot it
reckon i need a train of mules
walking away im getting an idea
my saw is the remedy
lets saw up some wood and make levers
lever him out
he walks into the wood
where you two sports heading
inscrutable i dont know where hes heading
im going down the road
and i got a good way to go before nightfall
acknowledging his attitude charitable of you to make a stop
aint for me to be curious
emerges from the woods how do you work this damn thing
to veasey give me that saw
to junior come on
he takes the saw walks to the bull gets on one side indicates junior should go to the other
lets do this in chapters
and they begin to saw off the bulls neck
later and theyre in a vile stew of blood and innards
the stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek
veasey is disgusted draws back
the two other men haul up the rest of the animal onto the banks
you might want to leave off that water for a day or two
therell be a tang id imagine
junior inman and veasey come around a bend and theres a big cabin looming
its in such poor repair that one end has slipped from the stones which serve as its foundation and stands badly tilted over
junior roots up another hidden jug of liquor which he drinks from then hands to veasey
theres my place
hope you can stomach a yard chock full of females
brought my woman home she showed up with her three so called sisters and their brats
the noise in that place is something awful
its why i go hunting
considering the wild camber looks a bit crooked
it is on a bit of a tilt
they all roll down one end each night
roll me over
in the clover one good fart thatll tip over
they guffaw delighted in the alcohol haze
veasey suddenly exclaims hand in the air rushes into the bushes
oh god of my god
the tribes of israel are about to flee from the banks of egypt
explaining to junior hes got a shit coming on
bewildered and hes a preacher
like a christian
like a christian
the three men arrive at the yard
dogs and children mill around the visitors
four women come out one after the other each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their voluptuousness or so it seems to veasey
they freely stare
these two boys is stopping for supper
theyre on the road to atonement
the women consider the men then disappear back inside
atonement is not a place
so what is it when its at home
those are fine examples of the female
take them all and leave the saw
be a sight more use
reappearing if they want to get in a tub theres an hour before food
they love to scrub a man
to shyla put the water on the boil
back to the men its my liquor gets their titties swinging
excited god damn
to inman i was right about sheep droppings those stools like rock hard
no real furniture
veasey is shaving
inman stows his knapsack behind the woodburning stove on which a big kettle of boiling water steams away
then he gets in the tub his back to the door
shyla comes in brings the kettle over to the tub pours in the steaming water
she appraises inman
its intensely sexual
thats battered flesh

took that wound at petersburg
he doesnt know what i am
uncomfortable with her stare thanks
to veasey hes shy aint he
wait up a few minutes ill be in that tub then well see whos a shy one
i want to poke my thumb in his holes
a second woman comes to the door
lila says suppers up
lila juniors wife spoons out stew from a vast pot
the table crammed with customers her three sisters the three men the herd of dogs and filthy children
each time lila bends over to spoon out of the pot her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress
inman is also getting drunk his eyes increasingly glazed
when lila makes to sit down next to junior he slides a hand up her dress exposing a naked buttock which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away
junior grins looks over at inman then nudges veasey
hes gone now
his eyes have gone
vaguely drunk what

thats a poem
thats a poem
he begins to recite has a verse in his mind
dolly lila shyla and mae but he can t summon it da da da da da da dae
vague theres a poem there
im leaving soon as im full

ill be back tomorrow before dark
youll still be here
thats my fervent prayer
my house is your house
suddenly like to wash their hands and pray
dolly lila shyla and mae
dont say much but even liquored up theres a preacher in him
inman gets up suddenly sways
ill say my goodbyes got miles and miles to go before sunset
head spinning ill just quickly lie down
and he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls up
im heading for that smokehouse and im ready to be washed clean of my dirt
he gets up wanders out of the door
juniors eyes glint
he jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of the smokehouse
you go tend to him
to lila ill be seeing you
he picks up his gun and leaves dolly gathering up the children and herding them out
come on you get
shyla stays mae having gone off after veasey
lila waits until the children have gone
they consider inman supine by the fire
you can go rub yourself off on the preacher
of inman gonna make him hug me till i grunt
lila shepherds shyla out shuts the door swigs from the jug walks over to inman then turns to the big table and pushes pots and plates way down to one
end to make a playing field
then she bends over the prostrate inman
inman stirs glazed
kneeling down to him you want to see what mammas got for you
inman is drunk doesnt think hes awake
she takes her breast to his mouth and inman suckles
then she puts his hands under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her legs
aint that sweet
you just get on and ride me all the way to china
he doesnt move except to sway eyes glazed
you need a hand
goes to his buttons lets have a look see what we can muster
shes kneeling now her dress hunched up around her middle working the front of inmans pants
hes in a swoon surrendering to her getting aroused his hand cupping her head
on cue the door crashes open and hes staring down as lila turns junior kicks her violently in the head knocking her over
you little bitch
look at you
cover yourself up
inman falls back
junior goes to the door and whistles
lila enters the smokehouse hand to her bruised head
veaseys naked mae into an embrace
he considers lila beams i had a special prayer youd come visit
veasey led out a chain gang waiting a bedraggled collection of prisoners slaves deserters and now inman
veasey is joined to the line
it starts to rain
ruby and ada at the door of the swanger house
they both wear monroes clothes by now like two little men
theyre carrying a small sack a pie under a cloth
ruby hammers at the door a little impatient
sally swanger opens it has to decode who it is under the clothes the hats
ada monroe and ruby thewes
look at you both
look at us both what
like a coupla scarecrows after a thunderstorm
we need a scarecrow birds eating up half our winter garden
we should both stop toiling and stand a while with our arms stretch out
we got something for you
for all your kindness
and a pie
thats real coffee
it aint hickory and dirt
taking the gifts thank you both
of the pie ruby i look forward to this
we all do
esco and me
grinning at ada she made it
i made it
good god in heaven
by way of recommendation im still alive
sallys strangely awkward lingering at the door staring at the gifts
well be getting along
nodding i know escos going to be real sorry he missed you
you all take care
they all kiss then the girls walk back down the path
ruby is vexed
that strike you as odd
stood at her front door
number one i know that woman all my life
i never stood outside her house shed invite a wolf inside if it knocked on the door
perhaps i dont know perhaps she was busy
number two old man swanger was inside that house i could smell his pipe burning
number three look at these fields
what about them
she contemplated the stubble fields theyre passing
we came by here a week ago they were waist high in hay
the home guard ride bent under their oilskins as the rain tips down
between the horses unprotected and drenched their prisoners trudge along the muddy path
inman and veasey among them
veasey has grown some beard
an older man collapses lies where he falls not moving
theres a domino effect and so inman falls on top of him
he picks himself up then tries to pull up the older man
he doesnt move
the horses plough on
inman shouts to brown the leader
this mans dead
nobody pays any attention
he has to drag the body
more days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners veasey and inman are haggard and filthy and reduced
the home guards stop for food a wash a break chain the prisoners to a horse rail
citizens go by veasey knows them all
some of them spit contemptuously at the deserters
none of them recognise veasey
am i so altered that they dont see me
somebody walks by with a young child
veasey looks at inman
i christened that child
the child stops looks without recognizing is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother
one of the other prisoners sheffield leans in to inman his voice low
im looking to get out of this
they drag us back to fight were just target practice for the federal boys
you run were all running with you the lame and the stupid of which we number both
either way were fucked
run or dont run
just give me some warning so i can tell the guard im not getting shot again for some cause i dont believe in
a group of slaves are walking by carrying sacks
one of the women is pregnant
veasey studies the group sees the pregnant woman recognizes her
mesmerized thats rebecca
he hisses rebecca
in daylight its apparent that rebecca is a real beauty
she turns at the sound of her name stops is confused
she sees veasey and approaches appalled at his condition
is it well with you
rebecca nods ive been repenting for what i did
ive walked the road of atonement
your curls is all gone
holding his head to rebecca god bless you
rebecca reluctant rejoins the other slaves walks away with them but then turns back to look at veasey
she clearly cares about him
and seeing her has somehow broken his heart
he turns away from inman towards sheffield
im with you
i got a baby coming
the chain gang trudges down the track horses on either side of them steep banks forming a v for the railroad
a train is coming
brown rides up to the prisoners herds them off the track
the train approaches quite slowly the boxcars full of wounded soldiers
some of the home guard dismount take out pipes
the prisoners wait one of them sits down
sheffield says something to veasey who casually yanks up the sitting prisoner
inman suddenly understands whats going to happen
the train is almost on them
but its too late
sheffield jerks forward in front of the train pulling all the others with him their reluctance tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming train
somehow the chain gang gets across the track stumbling and chaotic the chains yanking tight then loose the tight causing a collapse the loose a recovery
they run alongside the train blocking themselves from the fire of the guard sheffield screaming tactics and then as the train starts to pull past them they run up the
bank now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit
their horses and are riding hard alongside it
then they have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along the ridge
sheffields yelling with adrenaline veasey joins in elated
one of the guards raises a rifle steadies himself on his horse fires
he catches veasey who crumples spinning round and falling down the bank until inman uses all his strength and practically lifts him in the air
the chain recovers and works back up the bank
but then a second bullet catches another prisoner and this time the effect is catastrophic the whole gang just flips over and plummets down the bank
the home guard approach firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch by the side of the track
until all movement ceases
inman has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely almost completely covering his face
brown arrives considers the carnage
get these sacks of shit under the ground
its barely daylight
shes slowly becoming a country girl
ruby appears in the doorway
someones been in the corncrib
its a coon or possum
scratched out a fist hole in the side
im telling you we grow others eat
ill go into town take the last of the cider and trade for a trap
ada is in monroes bedroom looks out as ruby goes off to town jugs of cider swung either side of the horse
ada goes over to monroes closet pulls out some clothes
ada buttons monroes dress coat and completes the scarecrow shes spent the day making save for the hat which she now fixes on pushing in a hat pin to secure
shes made a stern black thing and steps back to consider it
horsemen come riding along the lane
its teague and his men
he doesnt stop but raises his hat to ada
ada looks out at the winter garden
from that distance it really does look like her father out in the field arms outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him
she finds it unbearable her tears coming runs out into the fields attacks the scarecrow pulling off the hat the clothes
the sound of tiny bells
a misty drizzle
a goat snuffles around in the freshly turned dirt a hand pale and wet protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies of the murdered chain gang
something shifts under the dirt breaking the surface
inman wedged under three or four corpses their limbs and chains wrapped around him has regained consciousness
he coughs cant breathe properly tries to work himself some air spitting out dirt
he makes a noise to distract the goat rattling the chains
inman rears up the bodies slithering off him but even then the animal only retreats a yard or two
veasey slides face up a bullet in his forehead like a mystical third eye
inman feels a surprising loss and tenderness
he heaves again groaning with the pain of new and old wounds
ruby rides back from town along the river
an ugly looking trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks
by an abandoned mill she sees the home guard under the trees
she slows up
what you looking to catch
with that trap
we got some critter stealing our corn
still but the two of you up there is it
you know it
when we get a cold night camped out trying to keep the rule of law protecting girls like you from federals and deserters thats a thought warms us to his
men aint it
the two of you up there on my grand daddys farm dressed in mens clothes
warms us right up
what you got in the sacks
to the men looks like human heads
looks like a bunch of heads
we got competition
ruby rides on
she rides around the bend shes not far from the swanger farm
goats their bells tinkling munch around the tracks
one of them turns at a noise a grotesque vision a moving seething mound of dirt
its inman inching along the embankment the chain of dead bodies in tow a macabre tug of war
he considers the goats they consider him
he rears up and finds himself staring down the barrel of a shotgun
sally is pinning out white sheets theyre filling out like sails in the afternoon wind
ruby rides up
sally seems a little vexed to see her
she walks down to the gate
im not stopping sally
im not snooping neither
just you should know teague and his boys are lurking down by pigeon river the old mill
after a beat you tell ada that was a good pie
ruby rides off
sally watches then goes inside the house her energy changing immediately as if she might faint
a secret place in the heart of a forest
theres the answering sound of small bells a chorus of them
inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter
goats appear they herd around the figure dragging the litter
its an old woman silver haired her face a leather map her clothes leather everything about her like old leather
she and inman round a bend and theres maddys house an old caravan long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers
inman tries to sit up
an old whiskered billygoat butts up against inman knocks him down
maddy pays no attention to the struggle heads inside her caravan
mind that billy hes the jealous kind
she emerges with a bowl of water rags washes his face pushing back his hair to look at his wound puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional
in her appraisal
inman is barely conscious he groans trying to defend himself
pay no attention to me
what happened to your head
and your neck
youre the color of a cadaver
ill fix you
i can fix you up
speaking of his spirit mister you could fix me id be in your everlasting debt
debts fighting them words dont mean much round here
for the record im a female of the species
ruby rides up to the farm
she rides past the winter garden admires the scarecrow which now parodies ada the same outfit she once wore to visit inman the same dress same hat
ruby grins as ada comes over from the field
the hats a nice touch
ruby gets off the horse and they start unloading sacks
i cried for my daddy
i dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back his arms out said you never cried enough you never cried enough
well now you did
then i thought its not my daddy its my sweetheart
i saw him once that way when i looked down sallys well
so i dressed the scarecrow in the dress i wore the day he left
in case his spirit flies over looking out for me
of the vicious looking trap that looks terrible
ruby opens the sacks
i bargained like lucifer
we can make all kinds of good eating
slaw sauerkraut cabbage soup fried cabbage stuffed cabbage
teagues men ride up to the farm
escos out in the field labouring away but with his shotgun by him
teague stops alongside the field the rail between him and esco
esco stops working picks up his shotgun and goes over
teague has four men with him
mo and jo the twins huge and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them grayling a reluctant looking man funereal in his bearing
the riders slowly fan out almost as if choreographed
dont spread out
why they spreading out
im not spreading out
im sitting here
esco comes over the rail fence his gun loose in his hands
never knew a man worked in his field with a shotgun
theres a war on
got to watch out for the bogey man
he starts to fish out a tobacco pouch
escos gun swings up
teague shows him the leather pouch shrugs starts to make a cigarette
from inside the house sally watches everything
her view impaired by the sheets
ambles past esco looks behind the sheets
esco kicks out at him the shotgun rigid and pointing
get off my land
mo examines his breeches for a dust mark wipes it off retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting
your boys come back
aint seen my boys in four years
theyre fighting other boys not old men and women
to his men he means us
hes referring there to us
to esco so you wont care if we take a look around
what i gotta give you
thing is you got one barrel and theres five of us
not a fair fight
esco is momentarily distracted and in that instant mo kicks out at him knocking the gun from his hands which fires into the air a shocking sound
ruby and ada digging a trench by the smokehouse laying in the pale heads of cabbage
they hear the distant shot
look at each other start running
jo sets on esco knocking him backwards into a sheet where it gets twisted while jo kicks and punches little spots of blood staining the sheet with each blow
mo pulls out his that it tightens
a stain grows out from the blade huge and spreading
teague walks to esco
youre harbouring deserters
i can confiscate every animal on this farm every plate every sheet every little pellet of chicken shit i can confiscate your old ladys asshole so dont offer me a
sally runs out screaming
she tries to pull out the sabre
mo backs away
sally is screaming
she watches helpless as esco dies in front of her the sheet growing a darker red
you got your bait
set it on the hook
ellis and acton swanger emerge from their hiding places unable to bear the sound of their mothers screams
theyre carrying an axe a pitchfork mad for revenge
bosie is doing some sort of dance along the fence rail
hes very graceful his hair flying his hands out one finger nail extremely long his boots stamping down on the fence
she cant scream any longer because the noose has practically strangled her
the ropes tied off to bosies horse which yanks on the noose with every slight movement
sally is prostrate in the dirt
her two boys come running from the barn
teague casually ada and ruby riding together on the horse arrive at the swangers
sally is still pinned under the fence post
the noose around her neck has been tied off to the post so that she cant move
theres a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the well
blood on the ground
ruby heaves at the fence
i cant get this damn thing off her
at the well looking down dear lord in heaven
ada i cant get this off her
ada runs over
they struggle cant lift it
sallys lips are moving
she bends down listens to her
looks up at ada
shes saying dont bother
she grabs a thick log off the stack staggers back and in a second theyve inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from sallys hands
they fall back onto the dirt
ruby cradles sally
ada nods towards the well
theres someone down there
i think its esco
ruby looks over at the well then at ada
this world wont stand long
god wont let it stand this way long
an exotic interior many crocks and jars bunches of herbs wrapped papers of dried things like a woodland apothecary store
inman wakes up
he finds himself in a small cot wrapped in blankets a poultice at his neck
he doesnt know where he is or how long hes been there
maddys sitting on a stool
theres a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it
inman emerges from the caravan
hes pale and unsteady
how long have i been sleeping
not long enough
i cant stop here
im a deserter
they find me here things could be bad for you
what they going to do
cut short my young life
sit down before you fall down
she calls over a little goat
it ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand
she strokes it and scratches under the chin
the creature gets increasingly tranquil
how long you been up here
what year are we
last time i checked it was
id say twenty six years
twenty six years
i could move on anytime
ive seen most of the world anyway richmond in the north south almost to charleston
youre going somewhere or you are somewhere whats the difference
shes still stroking the goat
it looks as if its asleep
ive learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat
i cant abide a chicken but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then when you need it good meat
in a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has slit the throat of the goat putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood still
stroking the goat which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying
so youve been fighting
as if he might break i could be at killing for days sometimes in the hand to hand my feet against the feet of my enemy and i always killed
him and he never killed me
he gave it a try to look at you
i guess he did
see i think theres a plan
theres a design
for each and every one of us
during this shes shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone whos done this a thousand times
you look at nature a bird flies somewhere picks up a seed shits the seed out a plant grows
birds got a job seeds got a job
and the goat is now thin and pink eyes bulging a piece of meat
a woodburning stove with a single cooking plate on which pieces of the goat meat sprinkled with herbs are sizzling in a pan
corn fritters and pushing them into his mouth
maddy watches him adds another mound of meat to his plate
inman nods in thanks but doesnt look up
she opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads puts them near the stove then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old
take one of these now with your food
inman is circumspect views the stub lozenge with suspicion
if you die ill give you your money back
inman puts it in his mouth gags at the taste of it
she hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down
our minds arent made to hold on to the particulars of pain the way we do bliss
she starts steaming the poppies
what you remember
whats her name
at the food sometimes i think im crazy when im just hungry another mouthful ada monroe
and is she waiting for you
i dont know
or if shed know me
im like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the spring with a whistle
maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium then hands inman the liquid
now drink this
it visits the pain
and youll sleep
he drinks the laudanum shes made
ive had to put myself in the way of peoples kindness
i hope you found it
she dips a cloth in the steaming water unbuttons his shirt
she has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline
she smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp
inman surrenders to the drug
the passenger pigeons fly south the berries ripen
whether i see them or not whether a man dies or a war is won
thats the laudanum getting to you
say something more
she kneels to his leg raise that up for me
she grimaces at the state of it where the chain has chewed into the flesh
gets to work
she gave me a book
man by the name of bartram
wrote about his travels
i carried that book through every battle
i left it someplace got to get it back
sometimes just reading the name of a place near home sorell cove fire scale ridge was enough to bring me to tears
thing is ive been thinking those places belonged to people before us to the indian and he had a different name
what did he call sorell cove
how can a name not even the real name break your heart
its her shes the place im heading
and i hardly know her
so how can a person whos maybe not even a real person i dont know what im talking about i have to close my eyes
he slides off the stool and lays on the floor
maddy goes over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes over him
ada in the henhouse collecting eggs is confident now among the birds
she emerges to find ruby walking out of the backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look
its a man
raiding our corn
got him in the trap
thats him yelping
youre not going to shoot him
i dont want him to shoot me
of the gun can you fire this thing
making it clear she cant yes
they head towards the corn crib bundled up against the cold
a man is kneeling at the corn crib perfectly caught in the art of stealing his head forced away from view
ruby hands ada the gun and approaches warily
listen up you got a barrel trained on your rear end
get me out of this dang thing
my fists about to drop off
you got a weapon
im begging you
im already on my knees otherwise id get down on them
suddenly recognises the voice unbelievable
to ada disgusted thats my daddy
she walks up to him and kicks him hard as she can on his a strip of fabric homemade bandage being wrapped around stobrods badly gashed hand
ada is tending to him
ruby is cooking at the range not remotely warm towards her prodigal father who looks rather comfortable
stobrod looks at her
just sos you know i can eat while shes doing this in case youre holding off
just sos you know youre not eating inside
number one they hang people round here for taking in deserters
number two even if they gave out prizes youd still eat outside
i did wrong to you
youd be scarred
youd be really scarred if i hadnt wrapped them trap teeth in sacking
which was her idea
i hurt you
i wrote fifty tunes with you in mind
ruby this ruby that ruby with the eyes that sparkle
lets agree you beat me you abandoned me you ignored me you beat me some more all of that is better than ruby with the eyes that sparkle
war changes people something terrible
to ada rubys told you ive no doubt i wasnt always the best
you were an asshole
i cant disagree with that
get him out of here
musics changed me
im full of music darling
i wish id brung my fiddle hey ruby
got a new fiddle its got a little snakes rattle in the body took it off a dead federal in virginia
thats a beautiful fiddle
its full of tunes ruby
dont know if its from that little rattle locked up in it or from something untied my heart
ruby walks over with a crock wrapped in a cloth
youre all set
sincerely bless you both
he goes to the door
aint you got a proper coat
darling im fine
and you just say the word i wont come back neither
i dont want to put either you or your mistress here in any bother
im not rubys employer
oh okay who is
stobrod digests this ill make up food for you you come sundays before its light ill leave it behind the old frazier mill
do you know who really needs a coat darling is my partner fat boy name of pangle
were hiding up in the caves and he feels the cold like a thin man but aint no coatll fit him
leaving i love you ruby
in case the sky falls on our head
youre a good girl
and hes gone
fiddle music begins
he is so full of manure that man we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him
so thats stobrod thewes
it is and thats the last youll see of him
maddy is loading up inman for his journey
she hands him a bulging goatskin satchel
thats medicine and goatmeat
youre sick of both
i have a deal to thank you for
she hands him an ancient flintlock pistol
and thats just for show or if you can get close enough a wild turkey
she turns abruptly mingles in with her goats
inman nods knows that she doesnt want a fuss although he wants to make one and turns himself heads away from the caravan
the music continues
a turkey calls
junior is hunting
he creeps through this clearing eyes peeled for the turkey gun at the ready
his dog growls and he puts a hand over its mouth
junior moves without sound in its direction stops for several seconds under a tree listening
he looks up
inman the music continues
inman drags juniors corpse in to the yard
the dogs whine and slobber over the body
inman goes straight into the smoke house
the music continues
inman reaches behind the stove and retrieves his bag
he checks for the lemats for the bartram opens it locating the tintype of ada which he considers as the dogs howl outside joined with another wailing
the music continues
inman emerges with his bag lemats at the ready
the women are all keening over the corpse as it a saint had passed away
dogs women all howling
a chicken bobs in investigates the glob of blood on juniors skull
inman walks away doesnt look at the women who dont look at him
the music continues
ruby wakes up
looks out of the window
ada also woken comes into rubys room
stobrod is outside with pangle violin and banjo
ruby opens the window scowling
stobrod beams stops playing holds up the food points at pangle in his new coat
get on back where you came from
stobrod and pangle smile and hurry away
winter setting in
inman increasingly a stick figure in the landscape wasted and fragile trudges along through fallen leaves
he still limps from the leg irons
no shelter anywhere
he unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat meat and corn bread
he walks and eats fishes out a lozenge tries to swallow it washes it down with a drink from his flask
opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease into his neck and ankle
the path splits
he doesnt know which way to go a crow repeatedly caws off to the left and taking it as a sign inman goes in that direction
my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath ada in the bed reading to ruby from wuthering heights
a source of little visible delight but necessary
she aint gonna marry linton is she
she said whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same
you cant say that and then marry linton
well find out
im not waiting until tomorrow
ruby im falling asleep
she lies back in her bed
ruby takes the book lies across the bottom of the bed as ada goes to sleep
little visible delight but necessary
i like that
inman shelters under a huge tree whose split trunk provides a mean shelter
he inserts himself into the cleft of it a black thing in a black tree like a troll
he stands shivers sodden desolate
a little cabin
its lights coming through square windows like a chinese lantern
inman considers it the risk versus the shelter
the sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach
closer he can hear a sound coming from the house
its a inman knocks hard on the door
the light from the lamp goes out although the fire still gives the room a clear glow
im one man alone
im a confederate soldier on furlough
i have no bad intention
i need shelter and food
can i at least sleep in the corn crib just for some shelter
ill be on my way come morning
inman accepts this as a rebuttal and trudges back towards the road
ive got a rifle
a gap in the door appears the figure barely seen
the babys crying behind her
theres some beans and corn pone all i got
you better come in
inman enters the cabin
its a single room
a big fire
the baby on the bed a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it
the woman is already at the little stove
she turns to him
shes painfully beautiful
but sad and fragile
inman despite himself is mesmerized
im alone here as you can see with my baby
i need to believe you mean no harm
inman takes out his gun
she starts terrified
no i mean to give it to you
he turns it handle forwards and offers it to her
i dont want it
i had my way theyd take metal altogether out of this world
every blade every gun
is your baby sick
i dont know
he cries a lot
my man is dead
he took his wound at fredericksburg
never saw his boy
she never once looks at him
her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby
its pretty much what youll get if you knock on any door of this war
man dead woman left
she hands him a plate of steaming beans
an onion perched on top
its mean food but its hot
she goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him singing the while an odd lament
inman eats looks at her at the child and the fire
he picks up the onion bites into it
sara looks across
ashamed of his hunger theres no hunting on the road just cress and he takes another bite
sara picks up the baby
i need to feed this man if you could look away
inman embarrassed turns his back to her
he sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast slipping the shoulder from her dress
while the baby feeds
used to have a cow few goats
raiders took them
made me kill our own dog on the porch
that poor creature watched over me
nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring
ill have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something i never did
i could do that for you in the morning
im not asking
its what id gladly do for you for what youre gladly doing for me
im inman by the way
thats my name
my babys ethan
glad to know you both
sara walks ahead of inman
she carries a pile of clothing a pair of boots
its still wretched outside she hugs the house the porch barely offering shelter
inman follows with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm
she hands him the clothes
you look about his size
he was another man straight up and down
theres a palpable attraction between them so that every exchange seems to contain a promise a sexual charge
i dont even have a blanket
i got a blanket
ill leave you the lamp
by the dim light inman peels off his clothes sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean
he can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants
sara sits at the cot still singing to the baby then gets up goes to the window sees inman dressing walks to the door lets it open a little but
not so as she can be seen
these boots are good boots
ill say good night
inman settles down into the corncrib
hes cold and everything is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable
he pulls his thin blanket around him
the wind is howling
he levers himself up looks at the house with its warm invitation can almost feel sara in there
he reluctantly settles down again
will you come inside
she stands in a shift a blanket over her shoulders
her body under the cotton very clear to him
she turns and goes back inside
inman comes in
sara is sitting on her bed
could you do something for me
do you think you could lie here next to me and not need to go further
i dont know
he sits on the bed as she slips under the covers and then removes the boots his shirt gets under the covers
theres an electric space between them
then sara begins to cry pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him
ill go shall i
i dont want you to
they lie staring up at the ceiling her tears falling
a the music continues
stobrod is playing the fiddle his bowing hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering it
theyre in the abandoned mill a derelict space which has been cheered up with some rudimentary christmas decorations
ada ruby and sally swanger her hair now almost completely white
some token presents
pangle is picking at a banjo his grin infectious and a third player georgia with a harmonica
as they play of sally she dont speak
she cant speak
i told you
smiles at sally is she feeble then
to sally dont mind him
to ruby hey ruby what about this
he starts the tune of wayfaring stranger
dont make that face you listen cmon georgia
and he starts up again but this time georgia begins to sing
hes like a pale angel and sings with a soft true voice
ruby finds herself taken by this boys voice and by stobrods extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild journey
ruby sits next to ada fiddles with her bracelets slips one from adas wrist and slides it over her own
theyre all outside now shaking hands
theres snow in the air
dont sleep here
its bitter they could stop one night
they stop one night theyll want to stop two
this coats warm
what about next sunday
thatll be the new year
its gonna be a better one
the wars over in a month
he said that a month ago
shaking stobrods hand in goodnight it started off being over in a month
the three women walk down the lane the three men watch
thats my ruby
shes an original
you think the good lord would forgive an old cold fool if he changed his mind
ada said it herself it was bitter
the three women head towards sallys house
what kind of names georgia
its where he comes from its not his name
i know thats meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens
why do you care what his name is
a funny look then whats that cluster of stars
what about them shaped like a wishbone
thats taurus the bull and thats gemini and thats orions big dog canis major
listen to her sal
shes turned into a highland girl
i could always name the stars ruby that was never my problem
they all three have linked arms
ada imitates stobrod
i love you darling
in case that big old sky falls on our heads
and i love you too
its sad sal
its a c a t a s t r o p h e
ada at the window as outside snow flakes begin to fall
stobrod opens the door of the mill
the snow flakes dissuade him from venturing further
he goes back inside
no sense setting off in snow
sara dressed agitated the baby already complaining is urgently shaking inman
hissing at him get out of here quick
inman surfaces from deep sleep
federals are coming
they find you here itll go bad on all of us
inman is up grabbing clothes boots his gun
i can try and fight them
no my baby
she pulls up the window in back of the cabin
inman throws things out into the freezing morning
he has his pants on but is otherwise naked
he swings over the window and down onto the frosty ground
inman picks up his stuff and at a crouch runs for cover to the wood which borders the property
he can hear horses and a commotion at the front of saras cabin but doesnt look round until hes sheltered by the trees
federal soldiers a raiding party have dismounted and are already wrangling with sara
inman watches pulling on his shirt shivering then his boots
sara is standing in front of the hogpen as if to protect the animal but one of the soldiers pistol barges her to one side toppling her and opens the
gate starts herding the hog out into the yard
a second soldier nym emerges from the cabin carrying ethan
sara starts up struggles with him is again knocked down
then sara starts to scream
inman is dressed
he looks back at the yard
the men sitting smoking prepared to wait their breath coming out in gusts in the freezing air
flakes of snow fall
we got all day
my babys sick
cover him up
have some pity
a third federal bardolph chases after the chickens gathers them up
i got nothing
nym gets close to her putting his rifle to her chest
that aint necessarily so
take me inside
lets all go inside
take my baby inside and then well do whatever you want
nym unties her
pistol has a rope around the hog and now leads it towards the horses
screaming theres nothing
you take that hog im as good as dead
cover up my boy
shes wailing an unbearable ululation
nym slaps her twice the door is kicked open
nym pushes sara inside kicks the door shut revealing inman standing behind it
bardolph a chicken in his arms goes over to the baby
this is ready to get a fit going
its gone blue
to nym how long does he want
leave some for the rest of us
pistol heads towards the cabin
as he approaches the door bardolph rearranges the blankets to cover the baby
pistol opens the door
nym is on top of sara
pistol laughs enters and is clubbed down by inman who steps out onto the porch while sara shrugs off the body of nym his throat cut
bardolph looks up to see inman walking towards him
bardolph has left his weapon by the fence
move away from the baby
bardolph obeys terrified
sara runs out collects ethan gives a little moan of anguish runs back inside the cabin
take off your boots
bardolph does so take off your pants and your shirt
dont shoot me please
we havent eaten
youd better get running before you catch your death of cold
nods terrified thanks thank you
behind inman sara stands with a rifle
theres a sense of ritual and order the chapters of transforming the hog into food
sara is inside the cabin the door open onto the yard
she holds the baby by the fireplace swaddled up tight
she tries to put him to her breast but he wont feed
she puts ethan back in his crib comes outside
now inman is butchering the hog chopping down either side of the spine to make two sides of meat
now sara is holding up a sheet of hog fat as if it were a lace shawl
now shes rendering the fat into lard
now inmans salting the two hams
now saras washing the intestine
she sings all the while i dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and my bride bed full of blood they dont really converse
inman continues to work
sara goes back inside to ethans crib
inman glances back but can hardly bear to her anxiety so palpable
the baby is dead
she looks at it
she takes it up in her arms
kisses its forehead
makes a strange stifling noise
inman doesnt look at her
she comes out again shovels some of the food into a plate serves it up to inman gently touching him as she does so
then serves out food for herself
inman starts to eat
she collects up the knapsacks including inmans and goes back inside the house with them
inman squats eating glancing back towards the cabin
theres the sudden shocking report of a revolver
inman knowing what it is goes slowly towards the house and its two dead bodies
his own face is a rictus the eyes thin slits
if he gave into his grief it would never cease
from the house the silhouette of inman working outside in the days dying light snow falling around him
hes digging a grave
inside the house two bundles the small body wrapped in a blanket the other wrapped in the beds patchwork quilt
ruby trudges past ada who is digging out a couple of heads of the buried cabbages
do you think hes dead
shrugs this snow
isnt it supposed to fall with bad news
bad news is girls get working
im going to round up the animals
squints up at the snow thisll settle
she walks past
ada stares into the distance where the snow falls down on inman
hes hardly visible in its gusting waves
just a thin black question mark hunched over the elements moving slowly forwards
the snow has stopped
its left a carpet on the ground
stobrod pangle and georgia emerge from the old mill
they make heavy footprints as they set off up the hill towards the mountain
inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the path
he cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops away to reveal a view of the geography
and there finally in the distance inman can see the blue ridge
somewhere in there is home is ada
he goes on
pangle walks too close to stobrod and steps on the back of his boot which promptly detaches itself from stobrods foot
stobrod turns and with a raised finger pushes pangle
some horses cluster around the stobrod partys footprints
bosie swings acrobatically over his horse to hang over the tracks then up again into his saddle looks at teague
the home guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks
a clearing fringed by poplars
stobrod is making a fire
pangle appears with an armful of firewood his big grin a fixture
then georgia appears
hes carrying a small buck frozen and covered with snow
what dyou reckon
think we could eat this
you cook something long enough you can eat anything
prodding it its frozen
how long it been there for
not very long
teague examines the snows imprinted silhouette of pangle
georgia joins in the chorus
stobrod pulls one of the hickory stick skewers out of the fire blows on the meat smells smells again looks at georgia takes a bite
pangle takes another stick burns his fingers
takes a bite from his skewer dont taste much like venison
i think its good
the three men are asleep
the fire still burning
theyre lying like petals of a flower around it
suddenly georgia sits bolt upright grimaces gets up stumbles away from the fire toward a stand of trees from which come the vivid sounds of violent nausea
georgia is kneeling in the snow his head in the snow when he a half dozen riders trot past approaching the sleeping stobrod and pangle
georgia has to vomit again
teague rides up to the fire the other riders with him mo jo bosie grayling
stobrod wakes sits up pangle sleeps
hope we didnt disturb you
youre all right

teague slides off his horse approaches the fire
you a deserter
dont mind if i just warm up at your fire

georgia squints through the trees

pangle surfaces blinks grins at everybody
looking around wheres georgia

in the trees georgia ducks retches
he dont know what hes saying
we were talking about georgia early on maybe heading down there
georgias like my armpit
worse its like yours
to pangle want some sausage
you is home guard
you is teague
to the others im known
he dont know what hes saying
quoting that bastard teague
folk always put the curse words in front of your name
teague wants us to play
we heard there were deserters in these parts
hiding out in a big cave
not come to my ears
you dont know where this cave is
you do stobes
he means right right
he means there is a cave right its up over the other side big cave we played some music up there never occurred to me they were deserters
near bearpen branch
aint nowhere near bearpen branch
its this side
hes always getting lost
that cave we live there
its over on big stomp
tell you how i always find it
theres a big old locust tree fell down across the path that points straight at it like a finger always a dozen squirrels round that tree
you gets to the tree sit on it and theres your entrance straight in front of you tree points at it
come right to your hand them squirrels makes a chirping sound chrrrpppp
okay lets eat lets hear some music
georgia watches as the music starts stobrod playing and singing pangle joining in at the chorus
their improvising is wild profound stobrod chording the fiddle pangle following him then finishing with another verse and ending with the title declaimed by stobrod
i call this tune rubys lament
something like compassion has flickered over teagues face
mo and jo nod to the musics secret rhythms
only bosie seems detached contemplating his long fingernail
the music finishes
the home guard applaud
whatd you make of that
stand over by that tree
over by that tree
take your boyfriend
stobrod gets up carrying his fiddle heads over to a big old poplar
nods at pangle
pangle gets up banjo in his hand
puts his arm around stobrod as if they were about to be photographed
the home guard gather around them
from the trees georgia watches helpless
pangle grins at teague
he always smiles
he dont mean nothing by it
i told him this worlds got nothing worth a smile
put your hat over your face
what do you mean
cover your face with your hat
georgia lies prostrate in the snow shuddering under the report of each bullet
ruby working in the snow in the field clipping a sheeps feet the animal on its back between rubys knees
she looks up to see georgia running across the field towards her calling out her name
from the kitchen window ada looks on as he reaches ruby the story pouring from him
ada emerges from the house walks towards the bad news
ruby sorting out a kit of shovels blankets
ada comes in doesnt know how to help her friend who shows no emotion
i told georgia he can stop here sleep in the barn
hes got nothing inside him
hed walk out of here and die in the snow
he can milk the cows
i was worrying about that
itll be dark in a couple of hours
is ten hours climb from here
hes drawn a map
boiling you know these fools stayed the night in the mill
thats stobrod he cant do one good thing without adding the bad
left tracks in the snow all the way up for them home guards to follow
thats a sign says shoot me
ruby im so sorry
ada moves towards her puts her arms around her
ruby is rigid
ada stops embracing her
we should get going
shes tying up the kit
she doesnt know how to grieve
every piece of this is a mans bullshit
they call this a war a cloud over the land but they made the weather
then they stand in the rain and say shit
tears welling if i cry one tear for my daddy i stole it off a crocodile
mountain dressed in monroes clothes hats pulled down leading the horse which is loaded up with tools and supplies
a choice of paths
they start up one then ruby decides against it consults the map and they reverse pulling the horse back and then yanking it up the other path
ruby and ada have made a fire
they sleep under a stone structure which forms a natural pi shape the fire in the entrance the snow caught in its light
ada and ruby arrive at the scene of murder
pangle is keeled over at the old poplar snow covering him
only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him
ada brushes some of the snow from his face revealing the death wound then lays a hand in blessing on his head
i dont understand
maybe teagues took him
they did that with the swanger boys didnt they
dragged them into town then strung them up as warning
its snowed since so i cant read the story on the ground
ada fishes out pangles banjo from the snow
its broken and the strings hang slack
later and ruby finishes off the grave hammering in a stone to mark the place
ada walks away towards the creek to wash her hands
she bends and rinses her face
as she looks up she sees stobrod on the other side of the creek half in half out of the water slumped against a tree blood everywhere staining the crust
of snow which covers him
ruby arrives at ada looks to where shes looking walks straight into the creek all her love contained in the urgency with which she hurtles to her father oblivious to
the freezing water
she puts a head to his chest seeks out a pulse at his wrist
calls back to ada
hes still breathing
to stobrod god damn
daddy daddy its ruby
dont you die on me again
to ada hes still breathing
a mean fire burns by the creek
ruby turns a knife in the flames
stobrods back is exposed
just by the shoulder blade is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple
ruby turns to ada who is helping
pack a pan full of snow
i need good clean water boiled up
she cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in the snow and rolls around to clean
stobrod doesnt move
he could be dead
ada loads the pan with snow
lets get him home
we have herbs there and its warm
hell die first
hes got hardly no blood left in him
hell die lying here
theres a place further on up
used to be
old cherokee place
theres good water right by it
ada puts the snow packed pan on the fire
teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree
he feeds the squirrels looking straight ahead where the mouth of a cave winks back at him
theres a stream and up on the bank a cluster of black conical huts made up of chestnut logs abandoned and slightly sinister looking
they approach one of the huts its door long lost
the snow has drifted in
a second hut has a door which they pry open
its dark and cold but apparently still weatherproof
they get stobrod off the horse and carry him inside then come out again to unload the horse of its remaining load
this horse is weary
hes ready to give up the ghost
ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside to her father
ada takes the horse to another hut and despite his great reluctance pushes him inside
she blows into his nostrils calming him thats warmer isnt it
ada wouldnt even recognize this practical hardy woman shes become
stringy and of few words
she sets off towards the tree tunnel passing stobrods hut
im getting firewood
inman approaches the killing ground
he studies the ground finds pangles grave
blood has left its black writing in the snow and he finds first where stobrod has been where the bullet had been removed then the journey away still tiny telltale
spatters of blood and the hoof prints and boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse
he puts his hand into the ashes of rubys fire cant feel any warmth
its getting dark
he takes a drink from the stream shudders at the cold
the fire burns a pall of smoke
stobrod lies on the ground swathed in blankets
ruby sits next to him wipes the hair from his forehead
ada opens her eyes looks closes them listens to the fire a strange squeaking as it burns
that wood that sound when it burns that mean more snow
yes it do country girl
the sun creeps up a red streak of dawn
inman walking his head bent to the tracks
he walks quickly even as the terrain gets more steep
as he bends to the snow where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print a flake of snow lands on his hand
then a second
he looks up
the snow falls
he starts to move more quickly racing the snow as it seeks to erase the tracks
the snow thickens
in the chestnut grovel a dozen wild turkeys pick their way across the snow
a shotgun lines up its sight at one of them
the trigger is squeezed
an explosion of feathers
inman hears the shot
then a second the sound ricocheting around him
he cant quite identify its source but he runs again heading for the chestnut trees he can see above him
ada collects the two turkeys the first creatures shes ever shot
doesnt quite know how to hold them
she straightens up and sees at the other end of the tree tunnel backlit by the morning sun the silhouette of a man
she drops the turkeys tires to reload the shotgun
inman comes down the tunnel approaching the hunter he sees through the snow at the other end of it
turn round and go back where you came from
inman is bewildered by this womans voice in a mans outfit keeps walking peering through the snow
ada fires a warning shot
inman still some distance suddenly understands
i do not know you
after all this time all this way inman could give up the ghost
then i believe i made a mistake
he turns walks heavily away from her
then he turns again completely lost without compass
if i knew where to go id go there
finally recognising him inman
they dont know how to speak to each other just stand awkwardly some distance apart the emotion stones in their throats
eventually youd better come with me
and with that she starts to sob and sob
very high angle inman walks towards ada
ada enters inman behind her
ruby looks up from stobrod
ruby this is inman
ruby digests this
considers this ghost of a man
congratulations i should send you out with a shotgun more often
he looks as he needs sleep
i may need to
be my guest
you shot or something
inman nods ruby to ada he woke up
said your mommys name was grace then closed his eyes again
ada comes out of stobrods hut a glimpse of inman sleeping on the floor heads for another hut which ruby is sweeping out
the snow has stopped
ada stands in the door watches ruby
rubys resistance to inman is palpable
they both are
im not surprised
your man looks played out
i saw him
i realize now
saw him when
in sally swangers well
a tunnel of trees
the man like a black smudge in the snow the sun behind him
well there you are
funny thing is it wasnt the same
it wasnt snowing
and in the well he was as if he were falling
you probably dont remember it right
i remember it exactly
there were crows these black crows flying towards me
i thought i was seeing him fall
instead i was seeing him come back to me
all this while ive been packing ice around my heart
how will i make it melt
better get a fire going
goes to the fireplace ive got big plans for that farm
got a vision in my mind of how that cove needs to be
i know you have
theres not a thing we cant do ourselves
the fire burns
ada lies awake
ada gets up steps out into the snow her blanket around her
inman is outside his cabin
only the light escaping from the cabin fire lights them almost silhouettes
i was trying to be quiet
i couldnt sleep
i got no appetite left to be in a room with wounded men
i cant see your face
its not a face you recognised
did you get my letters
i got three letters
carried them in that book you gave me
i must have sent
did you write to me
whenever i could
if you never got them i can summarize
no its i pray youre well
i pray im in your thoughts
you are all that keeps me from sliding into some dark place
but how did i keep you
we barely knew each other
a few moments
a thousand moments
theyre like a bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a black heart
dont matter if theyre real or things i made up
the shape of your neck
the way you felt under my hands when i pulled you to me
your boots one polished one not yet polished
youre playing a piano and im standing outside
im playing a piano and youre standing outside
that kiss which ive kissed again every day of my walking
every day of my waiting
maybe you cant see my face but if you could see my inside my whatever you want to name it my spirit thats the fear i have deeper than any
gash on my neck
i think im ruined
they kept trying to put me in the ground but i wasnt ready no maam no more ready than that scoundrel in theres not ready to die on us
but if i had goodness i lost it
if i had anything tender in me i shot it dead
ruby stomps out of the hut
number one shut this door its freezing
goes over to stobrods hut number two shut that door its freezing
turns to them im laying on my back with my fingers poked in my ears trying to shut out whos got a bag of diamonds and whos got boots needs
polishing if you want to get three feet up a bulls ass listen to what sweethearts whisper to each other
shes at the door to stobrods hut
she contemplates them
in fact if youre going to wimble all night im going to sleep in with him
and with that she enters stobrods hut slamming the door
now i cant see anything
a long pause
ill say goodnight
i dont think rubys vacating my hut so that you can sleep in a different one
ada puts logs onto the fire
after a few moments a knock
they dont know the rules for this
whatever comes to pass between you and me i want ruby to stay in black cove
as long as she wants
and if she never leaves ill be glad
more a question could she put up with me
and you understand shes my friend shes not a hired hand and she doesnt empty a night jar unless its her own
this wars made some things pointless
its hard to imagine a wedding
i think even my father would recognize that
ada i want to marry you
if youll have me
isnt theres some religion where you just have to say i marry you three times and then youre man and wife
i marry you
i marry you
i marry you
ada laughs unsettling inman
whys that funny
no i think its i divorce you three times and then youre not married anymore
i can wait for you
you waited enough
i certainly did
i marry you
i marry you
i marry you
and they kiss tentative then more urgent
im sorry about the way i look
in these clothes
inman shakes his head and there are so many buttons
starts to undress will you turn your back
not for all the gold dollars in the federal bank
she stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover herself
he takes them from her drops them to the floor
a crisp cold beautiful morning
theyre packing up all their clothes in layers
inman prepares the horse
ruby and ada carrying bundles out of the huts
inman approaches ruby
you go ahead
ill follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate
we can all go together
its safer this way
no one has quarrel with you
to ruby i gather i need permission if i reckon on living at black cove
ruby gives a curt nod goes over to stobrods hut
inman gets close to ada
well get to you by nightfall
you be safe
she puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile
bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow
it flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow
it can wait a year two years i dont know maybe longer
then a cow comes along and it wakes up flies down lays its eggs on the cow
theres purpose for you
and am i the fly in this story or the cow
ruby is wrapping a fragile stobrod for the journey
you come up the mountain for me darling id be dead otherwise dead and gone
youd have found some other fool to rescue you
hes sweet on you that georgia boy
he coughs for a long time
if you say a thing and then cough its a lie
daddy stay on that horse and dont lose him or sell him
well need him on the farm
and then the two women are off little men in their outfits tramping off in the snow
ruby and ada walk
i hope that georgia boys been seeing to the animals
i thought you were thinking on him
i was not
i was thinking on swollen udders and before you say same difference
im saying nothing
ruby elbows her
miss lovey dovey
ada elbows her back
inman has roped stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope
behind him their hooves muffled by the snow a inman walks on apparently oblivious to whos behind him
he and stobrod are some distance from broken ground a fringe of trees
quietly to stobrod dont look round
how many men does he have
there were five
you cant reason with that man
takes off his gloves i got a conversation stopper
theyre getting closer closer we get to that broken ground the better
inman opens his coat
stobrod looks at the lemats
theyre at the edge of the trees
you hold on tight do you hear
when i say three look round nice and slow
one two three
stobrod looks round
teague has some new bodies in his entourage but theyre all dead
a spare horse has teague waves
youre a hard fucker to put down
they approach good directions to that cave from the fat boy saw the squirrels sat on the tree made some friends brought some back with me
his riders begin quite casually to fan out
the snow bleeding from the groin and screaming
the riderless horse gets tangled up with the others
inman is in the trees shots around him
he doesnt move away from but towards the riders inside the line of trees
grayling charges him riding into the trees
inman shoots himself at teague whose horse is bucking wildly
teagues carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air
inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the lemats with the other the big pistol almost leaping from
his hand with the recoil
teagues chest opens out as hes thrown off the horse
mo is still screaming
inman walks over and shoots him in the head then walks to teague who is saying something the blood blotting the snow under him
inman studies him picks up the spencer carbine turns to look where bosie has gone steps up onto teagues horse reins the horse in and trots it over to the
prostrate teague leans over and shoots him dead
he turns the horse in the direction bosie had headed
he cant see horse or rider but in the stand of hickory trees ahead the gusts of steaming breath betray them both
he rides slowly towards the stand of trees
ada and ruby walking
they hear the shots
ada turns and starts to run through the snow her hat flying from her head
inmans horse is parallel to bosie who is deep inside the trees but also riding slowly
its like a dance
come out of there
i just have to shoot the horse from under you
shes not mine
you riding mr teagues mare
i hope so
wearily as he brings his horse inside the trees look how old are you
give me your gun and ride home im done fighting
im sick of it
i give you my gun youll shoot me dead
i will not shoot you but nor am i walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you
thats what they call a conundrum
i tell you what ive got on my side
what have you got on your side
the confidence of youth
and in that second he produces his gun and fires
inman has ada and ruby running
they reach stobrod his horse stopped drinking from the creek
stobrod barely conscious hanging halfway down its flank held on by the ropes
ada hurries on taking the shotgun from ruby who tends to her father
ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses
she hardly stops to look at the bodies just rushes on
she runs her heart broken towards the body of inman
hes dead the red flag of his life ebbed away in the snow
ada falls to her knees and pulls him over the snow crusted on his face which she wipes away with great tenderness then sits his head in her lap as
ruby slowly comes up the hill towards them
a violin plays quite raucous
a girl about five or six with adas curls sits at the table cradling a tiny lamb which wont feed from the nippled bottle she offers it
she tries again
ada comes in suddenly takes a knife from the kitchen and hurries out
you bring that lamb outside
the girl gets up carries the lamb out into the field
the sound of the fiddle continuing joined by a banjo its a glorious spring morning black cove farm at its most luxuriant the path edged with brilliant flowers
there are more animals in evidence
the girl emerges from the house and sees ada in the field surrounded by sheep
she hurries over
ada is expertly skinning a stillborn lamb
the little girl is horrified
what are you doing
he came out dead love
she has the skin off the lamb which lies like a little pink cat on the ground
she approaches grace takes the live lamb from her arms the girl resistant frightened
dont kill him
im not going to kill him
but we have to try something or else hes going to die
she takes the skin and wraps it round graces lamb
then puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lambs mother
it goes to the sheep and after a few false starts starts to feed accepted as a surrogate
isnt that a small mercy
and a voice joins in with the fiddle and banjo
stobrod is playing on his repaired fiddle
