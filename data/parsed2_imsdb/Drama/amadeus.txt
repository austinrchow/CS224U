b if window
href b b by peter shaffer final draft total darkness
we hear an old mans voice distinct and in distress
it is old salieri
he uses a mixture of english and occasionally italian
forgive your assassin
a faint light illuminates the screen
flickeringly we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs
we are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing
up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by salieris valet
by his side is salieris cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits
both men are desperately worried the valet is thin and middle aged the cook plump and italian
it is very cold
they wear shawls over their night dresses and clogs on their feet
they wheeze as they climb
the candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house which is evidently an old one and in bad decay
a cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs as they reach the salon door
the valet tries the handle
it is locked
behind it the voice goes on rising in volume
show some mercy
i beg you
i beg you
show mercy to a guilty man
the valet knocks gently on the door
the voice stops
open the door signore
be good now
weve brought you something special
something youre going to love
open the door
the voice of old salieri continues again further off now and louder
we hear a noise as if a window is being opened
i confess it
the two servants look at each other in alarm
then the valet hands the candlestick to the cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs
the street is filled with people ten cabs with drivers five children fifteen adults two doormen fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs
it is a windy night
snow is falling and whirling about
people are passing on foot holding their cloaks tightly around them
some of them are revelers in fancy dress they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks as if returning from parties
now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house
the window above the street is open and old salieri stands there calling to the sky a sharp featured white haired italian over seventy years old wearing a stained dressing
i cannot bear it any longer
i confess what i did
i killed you
sir i confess
i killed you
the door of the house bursts open
the valet hobbles out holding the sugared cake
the wind catches at his shawl
forgive your assassin
forgive your assassin
looking up to the window thats all right signore
he heard you
he forgave you
he wants you to go inside now and shut the window
old salieri stares down at him
some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle
come on signore
look what i have for you
i cant give it to you from down here can i
old salieri looks at him in contempt
then he turns away back into the room shutting the window with a bang
through the glass the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street
they stare back at him in confusion
who is that
no one sir
hell be all right
hes a little unhappy you know
he makes a sign indicating crazy and goes back inside the house
the onlookers keep staring
the cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand the dish of cakes in the other
the valet arrives panting
did he open
the cook scared shakes his head no
the valet again knocks on the door
here i am signore
now open the door
he eats the sugared cake in his hand elaborately and noisily
mmmm this is good
this is the most delicious thing i ever ate believe me
signore you dont know what youre missing
we hear a thump from inside the bedroom
now thats enough signore
we hear a terrible throaty groaning
if you dont open this door were going to eat everything
therell be nothing left for you
and im not going to bring you anything more
he looks down
from under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing
in horror the two men stare at it
the dish of cakes falls from the cooks hand and shatters
he sets the candlestick down on the floor
both servants run at the door frantically once twice three times and the frail lock gives
the door flies open
immediately the stormy frenzied opening of mozarts symphony no
the little g minor begins
we see what the servants see
old salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood an open razor in his hand
he has cut his throat but is still alive
he gestures at them
they run to him
barely we glimpse the room an old chair old tables piled with books a forte piano a chamber pot on the floor as the valet and the cook struggle to
lift their old master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin
twenty five dancing couples fifty guests ten servants full orchestra
as the music slows a little we see a masquerade ball in progress
a crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early s
as the fast music returns we see old salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed in a horse drawn wagon under the
supervision of a middle aged doctor in a tall hat
this is doctor gulden
he gets in beside his patient
the driver whips up the horse and the wagon dashes off through the still falling snow
the wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city
inside the conveyance we see old salieri wrapped in blankets half conscious being held by the hospital attendants
doctor gulden stares at him grimly
the wagon arrives outside the general hospital of vienna
a wide white washed corridor
doctor gulden is walking down it with a priest a man of about forty concerned but somewhat self important
this is father vogler chaplain at the hospital
in the corridor as they walk we note several patients some of them visibly disturbed mentally
all patients wear white linen smocks
doctor gulden wears a dark frock coat vogler a cassock
hes going to live
its much harder to cut your throat than most people imagine
they stop outside a door
here we are
do you wish me to come in with you
vogler nods and opens the door
a bare room one of the best available in the general hospital
it contains a bed a table with candles chairs a small forte piano of the early nineteenth century
as vogler enters old salieri is sitting in a wheel chair looking out the window
his back is to us
the priest closes the door quietly behind him
old salieri turns around to look at him
we see that his throat is bandaged expertly
he wears hospital garb and over it the civilian medal and chain with which we will later see the emperor invest him
what do you want
i am father vogler
i am a chaplain here
i thought you might like to talk to someone
you tried to take your life
you do remember that dont you
in the sight of god that is a sin
what do you want
do you understand that you have sinned
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am
you never heard of me did you
that makes no difference
all men are equal in gods eyes
offer me your confession
i can offer you gods forgiveness
i do not seek forgiveness
my son there is something dreadful on your soul
unburden it to me
im here only for you
please talk to me
how well are you trained in music
i know a little
i studied it in my youth
here in vienna
then you must know this
he propels his wheelchair to the forte piano and plays an unrecognizable melody
i cant say i do
what is it
im surprised you dont know
it was a very popular tune in its day
i wrote it
how about this
he plays another tune
this one brought down the house when we played it first
he plays it with growing enthusiasm
we see the pretty soprano katherina cavalieri now about twenty four dressed in an elaborate mythological persian costume singing on stage
shes near the end of a very florid aria by salieri
the audience applauds wildly
taking his hands off the keys well
i regret it is not too familiar
can you recall no melody of mine
i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy
i wrote forty operas alone
what about this little thing
slyly he plays the opening measure of mozarts eine kleine nachtmusik
the priest nods smiling suddenly and hums a little with the music
oh i know that
i didnt know you wrote that
that was mozart
wolfgang amadeus mozart
you know who that is
the man you accuse yourself of killing
ah youve heard that
all vienna has heard that
eagerly and do they believe it
is it true
do you believe it
a very long pause
salieri stares above the priest seemingly lost in his own private world
for gods sake my son if you have anything to confess do it now
give yourself some peace
a further pause
do you hear me
he was murdered father
almost whispering yes
did you do it
suddenly old salieri turns to him a look of extreme innocence
he was my idol
i cant remember a time when i didnt know his name
when i was only fourteen he was already famous
even in legnago the tiniest town in italy i knew of him
there are twelve children and twenty adults in the square
we see the fourteen year old salieri blindfolded playing a game of blindmans bluff with other italian children running about in the bright sunshine and laughing
i was still playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors
even the pope in rome
we see the six year old mozart also blindfolded seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books playing the harpsichord for the pope and a suite of cardinals
and other churchmen
beside the little boy stands leopold his father smirking with pride
i admit i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him
not of the brilliant little prodigy himself but of his father who had taught him everything
the piece finishes
leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it
mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes
both father and son bow
a papal chamberlain presents leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud
over this scene old salieri speaks
my father did not care for music
he wanted me only to be a merchant like himself
as anonymous as he was
when i told how i wished i could be like mozart he would say why
do you want to be a trained monkey
would you like me to drag you around europe doing tricks like a circus freak
how could i tell him what music meant to me
serene music of the italian baroque pergolesis stabat mater sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment
we see the outside of the th century church sitting in the wide landscape of lombardy sunlit fields a dusty white road poplar trees
the music continues and swells
we see the twelve year old salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation listening in rapture
his father is a heavy looking self approving man obviously indifferent to the music
a large and austere christ on the cross hangs over the altar
candles burn below his image
even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy almost to falling
the boy falls forward on his knees
so do his parents and the other members of the congregation
he stares up at christ who stares back at him
whilst my father prayed earnestly to god to protect commerce i would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of
lord make me a great composer
let me celebrate your glory through music and be celebrated myself
make me famous through the world dear god
make me immortal
after i die let people speak my name forever with love for what i wrote
in return i vow i will give you my chastity my industry my deepest humility every hour of my life
and i will help my fellow man all i can
amen and amen
the music swells to a crescendo
the candles flare
we see the christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly
and do you know what happened
cu a large cooked fish on a thick china plate
camera pulls back to show the salieri family at dinner
father salieri sits at the head of the table a napkin tucked into his chin
mother salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing them round
two maiden aunts are in attendance wearing black and of course the young boy
father salieri receives his plate of fish and starts to eat greedily
suddenly there is a gasp he starts to choke violently on a fish bone
all the women get up and crowd around him thumping and pummeling him but it is in vain
father salieri collapses
suddenly he was dead
just like that
and my life changed forever
my mother said go
study music if you really want to
off with you
and off i went as quick as i could and never saw italy again
of course i knew god had arranged it all that was obvious
one moment i was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town
the next i was here in vienna city of musicians sixteen years old and studying under gluck
do you know who he was
the greatest composer of his time
and he loved me
that was the wonder
he taught me everything he knew
and when i was ready introduced me personally to the emperor
emperor joseph the musical king
within a few years i was his court composer
wasnt that incredible
imperial composer to his majesty
actually the man had no ear at all but what did it matter
he adored my music that was enough
night after night i sat right next to the emperor of austria playing duets with him correcting the royal sight reading
tell me if you had been me wouldnt you have thought god had accepted your vow
and believe me i honoured it
i was a model of virtue
i kept my hands off women worked hours every day teaching students many of them for free sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians work and work and work
that was all my life
and it was wonderful
everybody liked me
i liked myself
i was the most successful musician in vienna
and the happiest
till he came
a grand room crowded with guests
a small group of gypsy musicians is playing in the background
thirteen members of the archbishops orchestra all wind players complete with th century wind instruments elaborate looking bassoons basset horns etc
and wearing their employers livery are laying out music on stands at one end of the room
at the other end is a large gilded chair bearing the arms of the archbishop of salzburg
a throng of people is standing talking and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs to hear a concert
one day he came to vienna to play some of his music at the residence of his employer the prince archbishop of salzburg
eagerly i went there to seek him out
that night changed my life
we see salieri age thirty one a neat carefully turned cut man in decent black clothes and clean white linen walking through the crowd of guests
we follow him
as i went through the salon i played a game with myself
this man had written his first concerto at the age of four his first symphony at seven a full scale opera at twelve
did it show
is talent like that written on the face
we see shots of assorted young men staring back at salieri as he moves through the crowd
which one of them could he be
some of the men recognize salieri and bow respectfully
then suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries stalks past
instantly riveted by the sight of such delights salieri follows him out of the grand salon
the servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft
salieri follows him
the servant turns into salieris pov several tables dressed to the floor with cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery
it is in fact salieris idea of paradise
the servant puts his tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room
salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant
as soon as the man disappears salieri sneaks into the buffet room
salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously
he is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things
his attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple
he reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him
he ducks down behind the pastry table
a girl constanze rushes into the room
she runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables
after a beat of total silence mozart runs into the room stops and looks around
he is age twenty six wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the archbishop of salzburg upon it
he is puzzled constanze has disappeared
baffled he turns and is about to leave the room when constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse
instantly mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor meowing and hissing like a naughty cat
watched by an astonished salieri mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon constanze
we hear a high pitched giggle which is going to characterize mozart throughout the film
the throng is mostly seated
the musicians are in their places holding their various exotic looking wind instruments the candles are all lit
a majordomo appears and bangs his staff on the floor for attention
immediately colloredo prince archbishop of salzburg enters
he is a small self important figure of fifty in a wig surmounted by a scarlet skullcap
he is followed by his chamberlain the count arco
the archbishop goes to his throne and sits
his guests sit also
arco gives the signal to start the music
instead a wind musician gets up approaches the chamberlain and whispers in his ear
arco in turn whispers to the archbishop
mozart is not here
where is he
theyre looking for him your grace
three servants are opening doors and looking into rooms going off the corridor
the guests are turning around and looking at the archbishop
the musicians are watching
there is puzzlement and a murmur of comment
the archbishop tightens his lip
to arco well start without him
mozart is on his knees before the tablecloth which reaches to the floor
under it is constanze
we hear her giggling as he talks
its puss wuss fangs wangs
he grabs her ankle
he pulls her out by her leg
they roll on the floor
he tickles her
im stopping it slowly
look ive stopped
now we are going back
he tries to drag her back under the table
listen dont you know where you are
we are in the residence of the fartsbishop of salzburg
she laughs delightedly then addresses an imaginary archbishop
your grace ive got something to tell you
i want to complain about this man
go ahead tell him
tell them all
they wont understand you anyway
because here everything goes backwards
people walk backwards dance backwards sing backwards and talk backwards
people fart backwards
do you think thats funny
yes i think its brilliant
youve been doing it for years
he gives a high pitched giggle
oh ha ha ha
sra im sick
sra im sick

ui vol i tub
tub but i tub but i vol love but i love ui you
i love you
the mood becomes suddenly softer
she kisses him
then he spoils it
tish im tee
tish im tee
eat my ah
shocked she strikes at him
at the same moment the music starts in the salon next door
we hear the opening of the serenade for thirteen wind instruments k
theyve started without me
he leaps up disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room
salieri watches in amazement and disgust
the music is louder
mozart hastens towards the grand salon away from the buffet room adjusting his dress as he goes
the opening of the serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind musicians
guests turn around as mozart appears bowing to the archbishop and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing
the leader yields his place to the composer and mozart smoothly takes over conducting
constanze deeply embarrassed sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back
the music fades down
salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping
after a second he moves almost in a trance toward the door the music dissolves
mozart is conducting the adagio from his serenade k
guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists
the squeezebox opening of the movement begins
salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon
he stares in disbelief at mozart
so that was he
that giggling dirty minded creature id just seen crawling on the floor
the phenomenon whose legend had haunted my youth
the music swells up and salieri listens to it with eyes closed amazed transported suddenly engulfed by the sound
finally it fades down and away and changes into applause
salieri opens his eyes
the audience is clearly delighted
mozart bows to them also delighted
colloredo rises abruptly and without looking at mozart or applauding and leaves the salon
count arco approaches the composer
mozart turns to him radiant
follow me please
the archbishop would like a word
he follows arco out of the room through a throng of admirers
mozart and arco walk side by side
they pass salieri who is staring at mozart in fascination
as they disappear he steals toward the music stands unable to help himself
well i think that went off remarkably well dont you
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it
his grace is very angry with you
what do you mean
they arrive at the door of colloredos private apartment
you are to come in here and ask his pardon
arco opens the door
the archbishop is sitting chatting to quests
among them are several ladies
arco approaches him obsequiously
why what sir
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants
how much provocation am i to endure from you
the more license i allow you the more you take
the company watches this scene deeply interested
if his grace is not satisfied with me he can dismiss me
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg
your father is waiting for you there patiently
i will speak to you further when i come
no your grace
i mean with all humility no
i would rather you dismissed me
its obvious i dont satisfy
then try harder mozart
i have no intention of dismissing you
you will remain in my service and learn your place
he extends his hand to be kissed
mozart does it with a furious grace then leaves the room
as he opens the door we see a group of people who have attended the concert among them constanze are standing outside the private apartment
at sight of the composer they break into sustained applause
mozart is suddenly delighted
he throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the archbishop sits and he can see them
colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee
he smiles and bows uneasily as they include him in the small ovation
mozart stands in the corridor out of the archbishops line of sight bowing and giggling and encouraging the applause for the archbishop with conducting gestures
suddenly irritated colloredo signs to arco who steps forward and shuts the door ending the applause
salieri in this vast room is standing and looking at the full score of the serenade
he turns the pages back to the slow movement
instantly we again hear its lyrical strains
cu salieri reading the score of the adagio in helpless fascination
the music is played against his description of it
on the page it looked nothing
the beginning simple almost comic
just a pulse bassoons and basset horns like a rusty squeezebox
then suddenly high above it an oboe a single note hanging there unwavering till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight
this was no composition by a performing monkey
this was a music id never heard
filled with such longing such unfulfillable longing it had me trembling
it seemed to me that i was hearing a voice of god
suddenly the music snaps off
mozart stands before him as he lays down the score
he takes the score bows and struts briskly out of the room
salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure
would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument
it was not to be believed
this piece had to be an accident
it had to be
at the table sits the emperor joseph ii eating his frugal dinner and sipping goats milk
he is an intelligent dapper man of forty wearing a military uniform
around him but standing are his chamberlain johann von strack stiff and highly correct
count orsini rosenberg a corpulent man of sixty highly conscious of his position as director of the opera
baron von swieten the imperial librarian a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid fifties
first kapellmeister giuseppe bonno very italian cringing and time serving aged about seventy
and salieri wearing decorous black as usual
at a side table two imperial secretaries using quill pens and inkstands write down everything of importance that is said
how good is he this mozart
hes remarkable majesty
i heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month
idomeneo king of crete
a most tiresome piece
i heard it too
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities
too much spice
too many notes
majesty i thought it the most promising work ive heard in years
well then we should make some effort to acquire him
we could use a good german composer in vienna surely
i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible
the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
very small pay i imagine
im sure he could be tempted with the right offer
say an opera in german for our national theatre
but not german i beg your majesty
italian is the proper language for opera
all educated people agree on that
what do you say chamberlain
in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir
for plain people
he looks defiantly at orsini rosenberg
italian accent majesty i must agree with herr dirretore
opera is an italian art solamente
german is scusate too bruta for singing too rough
court composer what do you say
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna majesty
it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majestys intention
you are cattivo court composer
briskly to von strack i want to meet this young man
chamberlain arrange a pleasant welcome for him
there it is
a somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study
we see a four poster bed
also a marble mantelpiece above which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood bearing the figure of a severe christ
opposite this image sits salieri at his desk on which stands a pile of music paper quill pens and ink
on one side of him is an open forte piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing with some difficulty
he scratches notes out with his quill and ruffles his hair which we see without a powdered wig
there is a knock at the door
a servant admits lorl a young lower class girl who appears carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin
she has just come from the bakers shop
here she comes
fraulein lorl good morning
good morning sir
what have you got for me today
let me see
greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box
siena macaroons my favourites
give my best thanks to the baker
i will sir
he takes a biscuit and eats
are you well today fraulein lorl
yes thank you sir
she gives a little curtsey flattered and giggling and is shown out
salieri turns back to his work chewing
he plays through a complete line of the march
he smiles pleased with the result
he inclines his head to the christ above the fireplace and starts to play the whole march including the phrase which pleased him
the march continues on the forte piano as we see mozart seated in front of a mirror wearing an extravagant wig
on either side of him stands a salesman one of them holding another wig equally extravagant
mozart takes off the first wig to reveal his own blonde hair of which he is extremely proud and hands it back
and the other one
the salesman puts the second wig on his head
mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror
and the other one
he takes it off and the other salesman replaces it with the first wig on his head
oh theyre both so beautiful i cant decide
why dont i have two heads
the music stops
a door opens
we glimpse in the next room the emperor joseph bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing around a table
good good good
he turns and comes into the salon where another group awaits him
it consists of von strack orsini rosenberg bonno von swieten and salieri
the room contains several gilded chairs dotted about and a forte piano
good morning gentlemen
all bow and say good morning your majesty
to von strack well what do you have for me today
your majesty herr mozart yes what about him
there it is
majesty i hope you wont think it improper but i have written a little march of welcome in his honour
he produces a paper
what a charming idea
may i see
handing it over its just a trifle of course
may i try it
the emperor goes to the instrument sits and plays the first bars of it
delightful court composer
would you permit me to play it as he comes in
you do me too much honour sire
lets have some fun
to the waiting majordomo bring in herr mozart please
but slowly slowly
i need a minute to practice
the majordomo bows and goes
the emperor addresses himself to the march
he plays a wrong note
a flat majesty
taking his instructions literally the majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door
he is followed by a bewildered mozart dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier
joseph finishes the march
the door opens
mozart comes in eagerly
immediately the march begins played by his majesty
all the courtiers stand listening with admiration
joseph plays well but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript
mozart still bewildered regards the scene but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself
it finishes and all clap obsequiously
bravo your majesty
well done sire
the emperor rises pleased with himself
he snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene
gentlemen gentlemen a little less enthusiasm i beg you
he extends his hand
mozart throws himself to his knees and to josephs discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour
no no please
it is not a holy relic
raising mozart up you know we have met already
in this very room
perhaps you wont remember it you were only six years old
to the others he was giving the most brilliant little concert here
as he got off the stool he slipped and fell
my sister antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did
jumped straight into her arms and said will you marry me yes or no
embarrassed mozart bursts into a wild giggle
joseph helps him out
you know all these gentlemen im sure
von strack and bonno nod
the baron von swieten
im a great admirer of yours young man
oh thank you
the director of our opera
count orsini rosenberg
bowing excitedly oh sir yes
the honour is mine
orsini rosenberg nods without enthusiasm
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri
taking his hand finally
such an immense joy
i know your work well signore
do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
mio caro adone
a funny little tune but it yielded some good things
and now he has returned the compliment
herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you
speaking expertly really
oh grazie signore
e un onore per mo eccezionale
compositore brilliante e famossissimo
he bows elaborately
salieri inclines himself dryly
well there it is
now to business
young man we are going to commission an opera from you
what do you say
to the courtiers did we vote in the end for german or italian
well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian
i dont think it was really decided director
please let it be german
because ive already found the most wonderful libretto
have i seen it
i i dont think you have herr director
i mean its quite n of course ill show it to you immediately
i think youd better
well what is it about
tell us the story
its actually quite amusing majesty
its set the whole thing is set in a in a he stops short with a little giggle
in a pashas harem majesty
you mean in turkey
then why especially does it have to be in german
well not especially
it can be in turkish if you really want
i dont care
he giggles again
orsini rosenberg looks at him sourly
kindly my dear fellow the language is not finally the point
do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
i mean i dont actually show concubines exposing their
its not indecent
to joseph its highly moral majesty
its full of proper german virtues
i swear it
well im glad to hear that
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be
being a foreigner i would love to learn
cattivo again court composer
well tell him mozart
name us a german virtue
well of course in italy we know nothing about that
the italian faction orsini rosenberg and bonno laugh discreetly
no i dont think you do
i mean watching italian opera all those male sopranos screeching
stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about
thats not love its just rubbish
an embarrassed pause
bonno giggles in nervous amusement
majesty you choose the language
it will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch
joseph is clearly pleased
well there it is
let it be german
he nods he has wanted this result all the time
he turns and makes for the door
then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand
ah this is yours
mozart does not take it
keep it sire if you want to
it is already here in my head
on one hearing only
i think so sire yes
mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the emperor
then he goes to the forte piano and seats himself
the others except for salieri gather around the manuscript held by the king
mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy
to salieri the rest is just the same isnt it
he plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase which he repeats dubiously
that really doesnt work does it
all the courtiers look at salieri
did you try this
wouldnt it be just a little more
he plays another phrase
or this yes this
he plays another phrase
gradually he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in the marriage of figaro non piu andrai
he plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity
salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face
the court watches astonished
he finishes in great glory takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph and grins
we see the olivewood cross
salieri is sitting at his desk staring at it
there is a knock at the door
he does not hear it but sits on
another knock louder
lorl comes in
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson sir
he gets up and enters katherina cavalieri a young high spirited soprano of twenty is waiting for him dressed in a fashionable dress and wearing on her head an exotic
turban of satin with a feather
curtseying to him maestro
posing in her turban well
how do you like it
my hairdresser tells me everythings going to be turkish this year
what else did he tell you today
give me some gossip
well i heard you met herr mozart
news travels fast in vienna
and hes been commissioned to write an opera
is it true
is there a part for me
how do you know
well even if there is i dont think you want to get involved with this one
well do you know where its set my dear
in a harem
a turkish brothel
oh if its turkish thats different
i want to be in it
my dear it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk
he seats himself at the forte piano
well perhaps you could introduce us anyway
he plays a chord
she sings a scale expertly
he strikes another chord
she starts another scale then breaks off
what does he look like
you might be disappointed
looks and talent dont always go together katherina
airily looks dont concern me maestro
only talent interests a woman of taste
he strikes the chord again firmly
cavalieri sings her next scale then another one and another one doing her exercises in earnest
as she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of martern aller arten from il seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to
the exceedingly florid aria
we dissolve on the singers face and she is suddenly not merely turbaned but painted and dressed totally in a turkish manner and we are on the heroine of the
opera cavalieri is in full cry addressing the pasha with scorn and defiance
the house is full
watching the performance which is conducted by mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra we note von strack orsini rosenberg bonno and von swieten all grouped around
the emperor in a box
in another box we see an overdressed middle aged woman and three girls one of whom is constanze
this is the formidable madame weber and her three daughters constanze josefa and sophie
all are enraptured by the spectacle and madame weber is especially enraptured by being there at all
not so salieri who sits in another box coldly watching the stage
cavalieri is singing martern aller arten from the line doch du bist entschlossen
since you are determined since you are determined calmly with no ferment welcome every pain and woe
bind me then compel me
bind me then compel me
at last i shall be freed by death
after a few moments of this showy aria with the composer and the singer staring at each other he conducting elaborately for her benefit and she following his beat with
rapturous eyes the music fades and salieri speaks over it
there she was
i had no idea where they met or how yet there she stood on stage for all to see
showing off like the greedy songbird she was
ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground
music up again for the last bars of the aria
singing be freed at last by death
be freed at last by death
at last i shall be freed by
before the orchestral coda ends cut to through the window we see that night has fallen
understand i was in love with the girl
or at least in lust
i wasnt a saint
it took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow
i swear to you i never laid a finger on her
all the same i couldnt bear to think of anyone else touching her least of all the creature
the brilliant turkish finale of seraglio bursts over us
all the cast is lined up on stage
mozart is conducting with happy excitement
singing pasha selim may he live forever
ever ever ever ever
honour to his regal name
honour to his regal name
may his noble brow emblazon glory fortune joy and fame
honour be to pasha selim honour to his regal name
honour to his regal name
the curtains fall
the emperor claps vigorously and following his lead so do the courtiers
the curtains part
mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back
he skips up onto the stage amongst them
the curtains fall again as they all bow
in the auditorium the chandeliers descend filling it with light
the curtains are down and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround mozart and cavalieri all excited and chattering
suddenly a hush
the emperor is seen approaching from the wings lit by flunkies holding candles
von strack orsini rosenberg and von swieten amongst others follow him
the singers line up
joseph stops at cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey
you are an ornament to our stage
to salieri and to you court composer
your pupil has done you great credit
let us pass please
let us pass at once
were with the emperor
i am sorry madame
it is not permitted
do you know who i am
pointing to constanze this is my daughter
i am frau weber
we are favoured guests
i am sorry madame but i have my orders
call herr mozart
you call herr mozart immediately
this is insupportable
go ahead constanze
just ignore this fellow
pushing her go ahead dear
barring the way i am sorry madame but no
i cannot let anyone pass
young man i am no stranger to theatres
im no stranger to insolence
all are applauding cavalieri
the emperor turns to mozart
well herr mozart
a good effort
an excellent effort
youve shown us something quite new today
mozart bows frantically he is over excited
it is new it is isnt it sire
so then you like it
you really like it your majesty
of course i do
its very good
of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate
what do you mean sire
well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say
he stops in difficulty to orsini rosenberg how shall one say director
too many notes your majesty
very well put
too many notes
i dont understand
there are just as many notes majesty as are required
neither more nor less
my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening
i think im right in saying that arent i court composer
er on the whole yes majesty
to salieri but this is absurd
my dear young man dont take it too hard
your work is ingenious
its quality work
and there are simply too many notes thats all
cut a few and it will be perfect
which few did you have in mind majesty
there it is
into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of noise and madame weber floods onto the stage followed by her daughters
all turn to look at this amazing spectacle
wolfi my dear
she moves toward mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture then sees the emperor
she stares at him mesmerized her mouth open unable even to curtsey
mozart moves forward quickly
majesty this is madame weber
she is my landlady
such an honour
and and and these are my dear daughters
this is constanze
she is the fiancee of herr mozart
cu of cavalieri astonished at the news
cu of salieri watching her receive it
may i ask when you marry
well well we havent quite received my fathers consent your majesty
he giggles uncomfortably
excuse me but how old are you
well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna
ive told him that your majesty but he wont listen to me
cavalieri is glaring at mozart
mozart looks hastily away from her
oh your majesty you give such wonderful such impeccable such royal advice
i i may i
she attempts to kiss the royal hand but faints instead
the emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace
there it is
he nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage with his chamberlain
cavalieri turns with a savage look at mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way to her dressing room tossing her plumed head
mozart stays for a second indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help madame weber
to mozart get some water
he hurries away
the daughters gather around madame weber
katherina sits fuming at her mirror
a dresser is taking the pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her
mozart sticks his head round the door
ill tell you what im going to do
im going to write another aria for you
something even more amazing for the second act
i have to get some water
her mother is lying on the stage
ill be right back
he dashes off
constanze and mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of seraglio
we see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance
a fireman passes mozart carrying a small bucket of water
mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to madame weber who still lies prone on the stage
mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face
she is instantly revived by the shock
constanze assists her to rise
are you all right
instead of being furious madame weber smiles at them rapturously
ah what an evening
what a wise man we have for an emperor
oh my children
with sudden hard briskness now i want you to write your father exactly what his majesty said
the activity continues to swirl around them
you should really go home now frau weber
your carriage must be waiting
but arent you taking us
i have to talk to the singers
thats all right well wait for you
just dont take all night
cavalieri still in costume is marching up and down very agitated
did you know
had you heard
well what does it matter to you
he can marry who he pleases
i dont give a damn
she catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself
how was i
tell me honestly
you were sublime
what did you think of the music
meaning you didnt like it
mozart comes in unexpectedly
oh excuse me
is her mother still lying on the floor
no shes fine
im so relieved
she seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig
dear mozart my sincere congratulations
did you like it then
how could i not
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today
dont you agree
is she a good fuck
i assume shes the virtuoso in that department
there cant be any other reason youd marry someone like that
salieri looks astonished
there is a knock on the door
the door opens
excuse me wolfi
mama is not feeling very well
can we leave now
no no no no
you cant take him away now
this is his night
wont you introduce us wolfgang
excuse us fraulein
good night signore
mozart hurries constanze out of the door
cavalieri looks after them as they go her voice breaking and rising out of control
you really are full of surprises arent you
you are quite extraordinary you little shit
she turns and collapses crying with rage into salieris arms
we focus on him
at that moment i knew beyond any doubt
hed had her
the creature had had my darling girl
the old man speaks passionately to the priest
it was incomprehensible
what was god up to
here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married
and no rebuke at all
was it possible i was being tested
was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful
that was very possible
all the same why him
why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility
my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man
for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts
i couldnt stop them
did you try
sometimes for hours i would pray
the young salieri is kneeling in desperation before the cross
send him away back to salzburg
for his sake as well as mine
cu christ staring from the cross
we see leopold kneeling now not to the cross but to archbishop colloredo sitting impassively on his throne
count arco stands beside him
leopold is a desperate once handsome man of sixty now far too much the subservient courtier
i wont have him back
but he needs to be here in salzburg your grace
he needs me and he needs you
your protection your understanding
oh sir yes
hes about to make the worst mistake of his life
some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage
i know my son
he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him
im not surprised
money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship
he has sold himself to vienna
let vienna look out for him
sir your son is an unprincipled spoiled conceited brat
yes sir thats the truth
but dont blame him
the fault is mine
i was too indulgent with him
but not again
never again i promise
i implore you let me bring him back here
ill make him give his word to serve you faithfully
and how will you make him keep it
oh sir hes never disobeyed me in anything
please your grace give him one more chance
you have leave to try
oh your grace i thank your grace
i thank you
in deepest gratitude he kisses the archbishops hand
he motions leopold to rise
we hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the overture to don giovanni the theme associated with the character of the commendatore
my dear son
the second fortissimo chord sounds
we see a huge cu of mozarts head looking front and down as if reading his fathers letter
we hear leopolds voice over this image no longer whining and anxious but impressive
i write to you with urgent news
i am coming to vienna
take no further steps toward marriage until we meet
you are too gullible to see your own danger
as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as i bid and await my coming
the camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside constanze
a priest faces them
behind them are madame weber josefa and sophie weber and a very few others
among them a merry looking lady in bright clothes the baroness and will you constanze weber take this man wolfgang to be your lawful husband
i now pronounce you man and wife
the opening kyrie of the great mass in c minor is heard
mozart and constanze kiss
they are in tears
madame weber and her daughters look on approvingly
the music swells and continues under the following there is a view of a castle in background
leopold sits alone in his room
he is reading a letter from wolfgang
at his feet are his trunks half packed for the journey he will not now take
we hear mozarts voice reading the following letter and we see as the camera roves around the room mementos of the young prodigys early life the little forte piano made
for him the little violin made for him an order presented to him
we see a little starling in a wicker cage
and we see portraits of the boy on the walls concluding with the familiar family portrait of wolfgang and his sister nannerl seated at the keyboard with leopold standing and
the picture of their mother on the wall behind them
most beloved father it is done
do not blame me that i did not wait to see your dear face
i knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and i could not have borne it
your every word is precious to me
remember how you have always told me vienna is the city of musicians
to conquer here is to conquer europe
with my wife i can do it
i vow i will become regular in my habits and productive as never before
she is wonderful papa and i know that you will love her
and one day soon when i am a wealthy man you will come and live with us and we will be so happy
i long for that day best of papas and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times
the music of the mass fades as leopold crumples the letter in his hand
salieri stands waiting hat in hand
beside him stands a royal servant
behind him gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride
down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback the emperor joseph and his niece the princess elizabeth
they are mounted on glossy horses
the princess rides side saddle
running beside her is a panting groom
the emperor rides elegantly his niece a dumpy little hapsburg girl of sixteen like a sack of potatoes
as they draw level with salieri they stop and the groom holds the head of the princess horse
salieri bows respectfully
good morning court composer
this is my niece the princess elizabeth
out of breath the princess nods nervously
she has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor
i think ive come up with an excellent idea
he smiles at salieri
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
im thinking about herr mozart
what is your view
salieris face falls almost imperceptibly
an interesting idea majesty
you already commissioned an opera from mozart
and the result satisfies
yes of course
my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
but i so want mozart
im sure there is a way majesty
some kind of a little contest
i could perhaps put together a small committee and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majestys wishes
you please me court composer
a very clever idea
there it is
he rides on
the groom releases her horses head and runs on after the princess
von strack sits stiffly behind his gilded desk
mozart stands before him trembling with anger
what is this herr chamberlain
what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee
just to teach a sixteen year old girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
on the contrary
then why doesnt he simply appoint me to the post
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but im the best
a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
naturally the italians
always the italians
mozart they hate my music
it terrifies them
the only sound italians understand is banality
tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection
singing angrily ba ba
anything else is morbid
mozart show them one interesting modulation and they faint
italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
look young man the issue is simple
if you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
well i wont
i tell you straight i will not
the room is very small and untidy
constanze is marching up and down it upset
mozart is lying on the bed
i think youre mad
youre really mad
oh leave me alone
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking
wed be set up for life
theyll come anyway
they love me here
no they will not
i know how things work in this city
you always know everything
well im not borrowing any more money from my mother and thats that
you borrowed money from your mother
well dont do that again
how are we going to live wolfi
do you want me to go into the streets and beg
dont be stupid
all they want to see is your work
whats wrong with that
just shut up
i dont need them
this isnt pride
its sheer stupidity
she glares at him almost in tears
salieri is giving a lesson to a girl student who is singing the italian art song caro mio ben
there is a knock on the door
a servant enters
excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
who is she
she didnt say
but she says its urgent
to the pupil excuse me my dear
salieri goes into the salon
constanze stands closely veiled holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts
the singing lesson ends with two chords on the instrument
salieri enters the salon
constanze drops him a shy curtsey
how can i help you
shyly she unveils
thats right your excellency
ive come on behalf of my hus band
im im bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment
but why did he not come himself
hes terribly busy sir
he takes the portfolio and puts it on a table
i will look at them of course the moment i can
it will be an honour
please give him my warmest
would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now
while i wait
im afraid im not at leisure this very moment
just leave them with me
i assure you they will be quite safe
i i really cannot do that your excellency
you see he doesnt know im here
my husband is a proud man sir
he would be furious if he knew id come
then he didnt send you
this is my own idea
sir we really need this job
my husband spends far more than he can ever earn
i dont mean hes lazy hes not at all he works all day long
hes not practical
money simply slips through his fingers its really ridiculous your excellency
i know you help musicians
youre famous for it
give him just this one post
wed be forever indebted
a short pause
let me offer you some refreshment
do you know what these are
he indicates a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts
cappezzoli di venere
nipples of venus
roman chestnuts in brandied sugar
wont you try one
theyre quite surprising
he offers her the dish
she takes one and puts it in her mouth
he watches carefully
he takes one himself
we notice on his finger a heavy gold signet ring
thank you very much your excellency
dont keep calling me that
it puts me at such a distance
i was not born a court composer you know
im from a small town just like your husband
he smiles at her
she takes another chestnut
are you sure you cant leave that music and come back again
i have other things you might like
thats very tempting but its impossible im afraid
wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing
you see theyre all originals
he puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio from the table
he opens it
he looks at the music
he is puzzled
these are originals
he doesnt make copies
the old man faces the priest
it was actually beyond belief
these were first and only drafts of music yet they showed no corrections of any kind
do you realize what that meant
vogler stares at him
hed simply put down music already finished in his head
page after page of it as if he was just taking dictation
and music finished as no music is ever finished
cu the manuscript in mozarts handwriting
the music begins to sound under the following displace one note and there would be diminishment
displace one phrase and the structure would fall
it was clear to me
that sound i had heard in the archbishops palace had been no accident
here again was the very voice of god
i was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink strokes at an absolute inimitable beauty
the music swells
what we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from mozarts music ravishing to salieri and to us
the court composer oblivious to constanze who sits happily chewing chestnuts her mouth covered in sugar walks around and around his salon reading the pages and dropping them on the
floor when he is done with them
we see his agonized and wondering face he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce
more pages fall than he can read scattering across the floor in a white cascade as he circles the room
finally we hear the tremendous qui tollis from the mass in c minor
it seems to break over him like a wave and unable to bear any more of it he slams the portfolio shut
instantly the music breaks off reverberating in his head
he stands shaking staring wildly
constanze gets up perplexed
is it no good
it is miraculous
hes really proud of his work
so will you help him
salieri tries to recover himself
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor
one word from me and the post is his
oh thank you sir
overjoyed she stops and kisses his hand
he raises her and then clasps her to him clumsily
she pushes herself away
come back tonight
some service deserves service in return
what do you mean
isnt it obvious
they stare at one another constanze in total disbelief
its a post all vienna seeks
if you want it for your husband come tonight
im a married woman
its up to you
not to be vague that is the price
he glares at her
he rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the roam
constanze stares after him horrified
the servant enters
shocked and stunned constanze goes down an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor
cu father vogler horrified
so much for my vow of chastity
what did it matter
good patient hard working chaste what did it matter
had goodness made me a good composer
i realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art
and i was nothing to god
crying out you cannot say that
was mozart a good man
gods ways are not yours
and you are not here to question him
offer him the salt of penitence
he will give you back the bread of eternal life
he is all merciful
that is all you need to know
all i ever wanted was to sing to him
thats his doing isnt it
he gave me that longing then made me mute
tell me that
if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent
go on tell me
speak for him
my son no one can speak for god
i thought you did so every day
so speak now
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries
i treasure them
as you should
impatiently oh yes yes yes yes yes
always the same stale answers
intimately to the priest there is no god of mercy father
just a god of torture
salieri sits at his desk staring up at the cross
evening came to that room
i sat there not knowing whether the girl would return or not
i prayed as id never prayed before
dear god enter me now
fill me with one piece of true music
one piece with your breath in it so i know that you love me
show me one sign of your favour and i will show mine to mozart and his wife
i will get him the royal position and if she comes ill receive her with all respect and send her home in joy
long long silence
salieri stares at the cross
christ stares back at him impassively
finally in this silence we hear a faint knocking at the door
salieri stirs himself
a servant appears
that lady is back sir
show her in
then go to bed
the servant bows and leaves
we follow him through the servant crosses it and enters constanze is sitting on an upright chair veiled as before the portfolio of music on her lap
through the far door leading from the hall another servant is peering at her
the first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl leaving her alone
we stay with her
the clock ticks on the mantelpiece
we hear an old carriage pass in the street below
nervously she lifts her veil and looks about her
suddenly salieri appears from the music room
he is pale and very tight
they regard each other
she smiles and rises to greet him affecting a relaxed and warm manner as if to put him at his ease
well im here
my husband has gone to a concert
he didnt think i would enjoy it
i do apologize for this afternoon
i behaved like a silly girl
where shall we go
should we stay here
its a charming room
i love these candlesticks
were they here earlier
i didnt notice them i suppose i was too nervous
as she talks she extinguishes the candles in a pair of venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around the room
wolfgang was given some candlesticks by king george in england but they were only wood
oh excuse me
lets not talk about him
what do you think of this
its real lace
she turns and takes off her shawl
well its much too good for every day
i keep saying to wolfi dont be so extravagant
presents are lovely but we cant afford them
it doesnt do any good
the more i tell him the more he spends
oh excuse me
there i go again
she picks up the portfolio
do you still want to look at this
or dont we need to bother anymore
i imagine we dont really
she looks at him inquiringly and drops the portfolio on the floor pages of music pour out of it
instantly we hear a massive chord and the great qui tollis from the mass in c minor fills the room
to its grand and weighty sound constanze starts to undress watched by the horrified salieri
between him and her music is an active presence hurting and baffling him
he opens his mouth in distress
the music pounds in his head
the candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace
suddenly he cries out
he snatches up the bell and shakes it frantically not stopping until the two servants we saw earlier appear at the door
the music stops abruptly
they stare at the appalled and frightened constanze who is desperately trying to cover her nakedness
show this woman out
constanze hurls herself at him
you rotten shit
he seizes her wrists and thrusts her back
then he leaves the room quickly slamming the door behind him
constanze turns and sees the two servants goggling at her in the room
what are you staring at
wildly she picks up the candelabrum and throws it at them
it shatters on the floor
cu salieri standing his eyes shut shaking in distress
he opens them and sees christ across the room staring at him from the wall
from now on we are enemies you and the old man is reliving the experience
vogler looks at him horrified
because you will not enter me with all my need for you because you scorn my attempts at virtue because you choose for your instrument a boastful lustful smutty infantile
boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation because you are unjust unfair unkind i will block you
i swear it
i will hinder and harm your creature on earth as far as i am able
i will ruin your incarnation
cu the fireplace
in it lies the olivewood christ on the cross burning
what use after all is man if not to teach god his lessons
the cross flames up and disintegrates
salieri stares at it
the front door bursts open
mozart stumbles in followed by emmanuel schikaneder three young actresses and another man all fairly drunk
schikaneder who appears everywhere accompanied by young girls is a large fleshy extravagant man of about thirty five
the others laugh
imitating mozart stanzi manzi banzi wanzi
he walks unsteadily to the bedroom door and opens it
to the girls very tipsy sssh
constanze lies in bed her back turned to her husband who comes into the room and shuts the door
hows my mouse
im back puss wuss is back
she turns around abruptly
she looks dreadful her eyes red with weeping
mozart is shocked
he approaches the bed and sits on it
immediately she starts crying again desperately
whats the matter
what is it
he holds her and she clings to him in a fierce embrace crying a flood of tears
stop it now
ive brought some friends to meet you
theyre next door waiting
do we have anything to eat
theyre all starving
tell them to go away
i dont want to see anybody
whats the matter with you
tell them to go
what is it
i love you
i love you
she starts crying again throwing her arms around his neck
i love you
please stay with me
joseph sits eating
a butler serves him goats milk to drink
joseph is holding a memorandum from salieri in his hand
salieri stands before him
i dont think you understand me court composer
majesty i did
believe me it was a most agonizing
but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
well sire i made some inquiries in a routine way
i was curious to know why he had so few pupils
it is rather alarming
with a gesture joseph dismisses the butler who bows and leaves the room
majesty i dont like to talk against a fellow musician
of course not
i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
as a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well
twice in the course of the same lesson
there it is
salieri has just returned from the palace and is coming up the staircase
he is met by his servant
sir there is a herr mozart waiting for you in the salon
salieri is plainly alarmed
what does he want
he didnt say sir
i told him i didnt know when you would be back but he insisted on waiting
come with me
and stay in the room
he mounts the stairs
mozart is waiting for salieri holding a portfolio
salieri approaches him nervously
mozart stands not belligerently but humbly
herr mozart what brings you here
your excellency you requested some specimens of my work
here they are
i dont have to tell you how much i need your help
i truly appreciate your looking at these
i have pressures on me financial pressures
as you know im a married man now
so you are
how is your pretty wife
she is well
she is well actually im about to become a father
she only told me last night
you are the first to know
and congratulations to you of course
so you see this post is very important to me right now
salieri looks at him in distress
why didnt you come to me yesterday mozart
this is a most painful situation
yesterday i could have helped you
today i cant
here is the music
i am submitting it humbly
isnt that what you wanted
i have just come from the palace
the post has been filled
they havent even seen my work
i need this post
please cant you help me
my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late
whom did they choose
but the mans a fool
hes a total mediocrity
no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity
but i cant lose this post i simply cant
lets go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice
he could actually do musical harm to the princess
an implausible idea
between you and me no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth
mozart chuckles delightedly
salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon
mozart takes it absently and goes on talking
look i must have pupils
without pupils i cant manage
you dont mean to tell me you are living in poverty
no but im broke
im always broke
i dont know why
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how can anyone say that
we have no cook no maid
we have no footman
nothing at all
how is that possible
you give concerts dont you
i hear they are quite successful
theyre stupendously successful
you cant get a seat
the only problem is none will hire me
they all want to hear me play but they wont let me teach their daughters
as if i was some kind of fiend
im not a fiend
of course not
do you have a daughter
im afraid not
well could you lend me some money till you have one
then ill teach her for free
thats a promise
oh im sorry
im being silly
papas right i should put a padlock on my mouth
seriously is there any chance you could manage a loan
only for six months eight at most
after that ill be the richest man in vienna
ill pay you back double
name your terms
im not joking
im working on something thats going to explode like a bomb all over europe
ah how exciting
tell me more
id better not
its a bit of a secret
come come mozart im interested
actually its a big secret
oh this is delicious
what is it
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum
crema al mascarpone
we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred
what exactly are you working on
i cant say
really i dont think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart
however i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you
and he has a daughter
will that do
hysterical barking and howling
the hall is full of dogs at least five all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket
mozart dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant michael schlumberg
bluff friendly and coarse looking he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals greeting mozart
down there damn you
to mozart welcome to you
pay no attention theyre impossible
stop it you willful things
come this way
just ignore them
theyre perfectly harmless just willful
i treat them just like my own children
and which one of them do you want me to teach
thats funny i like it
which one eh
youre a funny fellow
come this way
he leads mozart through the throng of dogs into a salon furnished with comfortable middle class taste
frau schlumberg appears an anxious woman in middle life
to mozart you wont be teaching this one either
shes my wife
this is herr mozart my dear
the young man herr salieri recommended to teach our gertrude
where is she
you cant be herr mozart
im afraid i am
of course its him
who do you think it is
ive heard about you for ages
i thought you must be an old man
its such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart
and for gertrude
people who know say the girls got talent
you must judge for yourself
if you think she stinks say so
im sure you will find her most willing herr mozart
shes really very excited
shes been preparing all morning
here she comes
gertrude schlumberg appears in the doorway an awkward girl of fifteen in her best dress her hair primped and curled
she is exceedingly nervous
good morning fraulein schlumberg
strudel this is herr mozart
say good morning
gertrude giggles instead
to mozart perhaps a little refreshment first
a little coffee or a little chocolate
id like a little wine if you have it
hes going to need it
calling and clapping his hands klaus
a bottle of wine
now lets go to it
ive been waiting all day for this
he leads the way into a forte piano is open and waiting
all the dogs follow him
after them come mozart frau and fraulein schlumberg
to mozarts dismay husband and wife seat themselves quite formally on a little narrow sofa side by side
to the dogs now sit down all of you and behave
zeman mandi absolutely quiet
to a young beagle especially you dudelsachs not one sound from you
the dogs settle at their feet
husband and wife smile encouragingly at each other
come on then
up and at it
mozart gestures to the music bench
reluctantly the girl sits at the instrument
mozart sits beside her
now please play me something
just to give me an idea
anything will do
to parents i dont want you to stay
thats all right dear
just go ahead as if we werent here
but you are here
never mind strudel
its part of music getting used to an audience
arent i right herr mozart
on the whole
to gertrude how long have you been playing fraulein
just one year
who was your teacher
but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
thank you madame
to gertrude come on now courage
play me something you know
in response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard without playing a note
an awkward pause
perhaps it would be better if we were left alone
i think were both a little shy
husband and wife look at each other
strudels not shy
shes just willful
you give into her now youll be sorry later
the girl sits unmoving
schlumberg bellows i said play
perhaps if i were to play a little first it might encourage the fraulein
to the girl why dont you let me try the instrument
suddenly the girl rises
mozart smiles at the parents
they smile nervously back
mozart slides along the bench raises his hands and preludes over the keys
instantly a dog howls loudly
startled mozart stops
schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle
stop that dudelsachs
stop it at once
to mozart dont let him disturb you
hell be all right
hes just a little willful too
please please play
i beg you
mozart resumes playing
this time it is a lively piece perhaps the presto finale from the k
the dog howls immediately
no not you
i was talking to the dog
you keep playing
its most important
he always howls when he hears music
weve got to break them of the habit
amazed mozart starts to play the rondo again
the dog howls louder
now keep going just keep going
to the beagle now you stop that noise dudelsachs you stop it this instant
this instant do you hear me
keep going herr mozart thats it
go on go on
mozart plays on
suddenly the dog falls silent
schlumberg smiles broadly
good good good
very good dog
very very good dudelsachs
to his wife snapping his fingers quick quick dear bring his biscuit
the wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits
a servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray
he puts it down beside mozart as schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection
now guess whos going to get a nice reward
clever clever dudi
he gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily
mozart stops playing and stands up
its a miracle herr mozart
barely controlling himself well im a good teacher
the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs please let me know
goodbye fraulein goodbye madame
he bows to them and leaves the room
they look after him in puzzled astonishment
what a strange young man
he is a little strange
a cheerful scene
we see mozart strutting and beaming making his way through the crowd of porters carriers and hawkers sellers of sausages and pastries vendors of hats and ribbons
horses and carriage clatter past him
his mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of non piu andrai played on the forte piano
still in the same mood he enters the door of his own house
suddenly he stops
he looks up the stairs
the grim opening chords from the overture to don giovanni cut across the march from figaro
what he sees looking up the stairs is a menacing figure in a long grey cape and dark grey hat standing on the landing
the light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards mozart in an alarming gesture of possession
it takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before mozart realizes who it is
then as the music continues he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figures arms
both men embrace
the music slowly fades
a cramped low ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages
we see music lying everywhere
also there are many empty wine bottles musical instruments among them a mandolin a viola a forte piano with the black and white keys reversed books and abandoned plates of
mozart clasps his fathers arms
leopold is now seen as an aging travel stained man in clothes that need repair
his face is lined and he is obviously not in perfect health
why are you here
am i not welcome
of course welcome
welcome ten thousand times
he kisses his hands
youre very thin
does she not feed you this wife of yours
mozart ducks away and fetches his fathers bags from the landing
well of course she feeds me
she stuffs me like a goose all day long
shes the best cook in the world
i mean since mama
just wait youll see
is she not here
i dont know
leopold looks about him at the mess in the room
do you always live like this
oh i mean no not exactly like this
i mean today just today stanzi i remember now
she had to go yes
she had to help her mother
yes shes like that
her mothers a very sweet woman youll see
he carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom
constanze lies in bed
she sits up startled
i didnt know you were home
stanzi this is my father
constanze who looks ill and tired stares at leopold
leopold stares back from the doorway
well wait well wait
why dont you get up now darling
he closes the door again
shes very tired poor creature
you know me im a real pig
its not so easy cleaning up after me
dont you have a maid
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi wont hear of it
she wants to do everything herself
how is your financial situation
it couldnt be better
thats not what i hear
what do you mean
really its its marvelous
people love me here
they say youre in debt
who says that
now thats a malicious lie
how many pupils do you have
i dont know
its not important
i mean i dont want pupils
they get in the way
ive got to have time for composition
composition doesnt pay
you know that
this one will
he picks up some pages of manuscript
oh lets not talk about it
its a secret
you dont have secrets from me
its too dangerous papa
but theyre going to love it
ah there she is
constanze comes into the room
she is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair
we see that she is clearly pregnant
my stanzi look at her
isnt she beautiful
come on now confess papa
could you want a prettier girl for a daughter
stop it wolfi
i look dreadful
welcome to our house herr mozart
hes not herr mozart
call him papa
i see that youre expecting
when may i ask
in three months
isnt that marvelous
why didnt you mention it in your letters
i thought i did
im sure i did
he gives a little giggle of embarrassment
may i offer you some tea herr mozart
who wants tea
lets go out
this calls for a feast
you dont want tea papa
lets go dancing
papa loves parties dont you
how can you be so boring
wolfi i think your fathers tired
ill cook us something here
thatll be fine
dont spend any money on me
oh come papa
what better way could i spend it than on you
my kissable missable suddenly visible papa
the jaunty tune of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein k
sounds through all the following
this is an alternate song from il seraglio a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum
the vocal part should be arranged for trumpet
mozart and constanze with leopold between them
we see couples shopping
this is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades
it is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds
wolfgang is wearing a costume a mask pushed up on his forehead constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask
amidst the merriment leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat to which is attached a full mask of
its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile
he turns and looks at his son through this mask
we are in the full whirl of a masquerade ball
couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes
the music of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein increases in volume and persists
we see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers
a steer is being roasted
through the bobbing crowd we see a group headed by the figure of bacchus this is schikaneder in a greek costume wearing vine leaves in his hair
he is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men
constanze as columbine and mozart as harlequin are pulling leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask
this whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door
as they go they are watched by salieri standing alone in a corner wearing ordinary evening clothes
he turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them
as soon as they disappear into the far room salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray
he quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on
a fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto lit by candles
a forte piano to one side is being played by schikaneder the music of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein cross fades to another tune
this is vivat bacchus from il seraglio which schikaneder dressed as bacchus is humming as he plays
the music is actually accompanying a game of forfeits which has begun
five couples the group we have just seen are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs
when the music stops they will each have to find a chair and the one who fails must pay a forfeit
constanze is dancing with leopold mozart is dancing with one of the actresses the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen and two children dance together a little
boy and a little girl
the scene is watched by a circle of bystanders among them from the doorway is salieri
schikaneder stops playing
immediately the couples scramble for the chairs
leopold and constanze meet on the same chair bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it
to the amusement of the people around the chair over balances and they both end up on the floor
constanze immediately gets up again sets the chair on its feet and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time
but schikaneder calls out from the forte piano
you both lost
you both lost
you both have to forfeit
and the penalty is you must exchange your wigs
people are delighted by the idea of this penalty
the children jump up and down with excitement
the three actresses immediately surround leopold reaching for his hat and mask and wig whilst he tries to hold on to them
mozart takes off constanzes wig an absurd affair with side curls
constanze laughingly surrenders it
this is ridiculous
despite his protests an actress takes off his hat to which the smiling mask is attached to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath
another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old mans head
the third actress takes constanzes wig from mozart and attempts to put it on his fathers head
calling to him this is just a game papa
constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice
this is just a game papa
laughingly the bystanders take it up especially the children
this is just a game papa
as leopold glares furiously about him the actress succeeds in getting constanzes wig firmly onto his head
everybody bursts into applause
delightedly constanze puts on leopolds wig hat and mask from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of leopold in the smiling grey mask and he looks
like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig
schikaneder starts to play again and the couples start to dance
leopold angrily takes off constanzes wig and leaves the circle his partner constanze is left alone
seeing this mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm
oh no papa please
dont spoil the fun
here take mine
he takes off his own wig and puts it on leopolds uncovered head
the effect if not as ridiculous is still somewhat bizarre since wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs
he takes constanzes wig from his father
as this happens the music stops again
mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair the others scramble for the other chairs and he is left as the odd man out
schikaneder calls out to leopold from the keyboard
herr mozart why dont you name your sons penalty
yes papa name it
ill do anything you say
i want you to come back with me to salzburg my son
what did he say
what did he say
papa the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
im tired of this game
please play without me
but my penalty
ive got to have a penalty
all the bystanders are watching
ive got a good one
ive got the perfect one for you
come over here
mozart runs over to the forte piano and schikaneder surrenders his place at it
now i want you to play our tune sitting backwards
oh thats really too easy
any child can do that
amused sounds of disbelief
and a fugue in the manner of sebastian bach
renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty
mozart smiles at schikaneder it is the sort of challenge he loves
he defiantly puts on constanzes wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard
before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task
his right hand plays the bass part his left hand the treble and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which
they have been dancing
attracted by this astonishing feat the players draw nearer to the instrument
so does salieri cautiously with some of the bystanders
constanze watches him approach
only leopold sits by himself sulking
the fugue ends amidst terrific clapping
the guests call out to mozart
give me a name
who shall i do
give me a name
smash cut salieris masked face whips around and looks at her
now thats hard
thats very hard
for salieri one has to face the right way around
giggling he turns around and sits at the keyboard
then watched by a highly amused group he begins a wicked parody
he furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes
then he begins to play the tune to which they danced in the most obvious way imaginable relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant
the music is the very essence of banality
the bystanders rock with laughter
mozart starts to giggle wildly
through this excruciating scene salieri stares at constanze who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him
mozarts parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences
he builds this up urged on in his clowning by everyone else until suddenly he stops and cries out
the laughter cuts off
mozart stands up clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches
the momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter
cu salieri staring in pain
cu the old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation
a repetition of the shot of mozart at the forte piano wearing constanzes wig and emitting a shrill giggle
salieri sits at his desk
he holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang
faintly we see the mark of the cross
that was not mozart laughing father
that was god
that was god
god laughing at me through that obscene giggle
go on signore
rub my nose in it
show my mediocrity for all to see
i will laugh at you
before i leave this earth i will laugh at you
it is littered with manuscripts
in the middle stands a billiard table
the beautiful closing ensemble from act iv of figaro ah tutti contenti
saremo cosi plays in the background
standing at the billiard table mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table
from time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes
he is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation
presently however we hear a knocking at the door
outside the door wolfi
the music breaks off
what is it
he opens the door
theres a young girl to see you
what does she want
i dont know
well ask her
she wont talk to me
she says she has to speak to you
mozart comes out
framed in the doorway from outside stands lorl the maid we noticed in salieris house
from his bedroom leopold peeps out to watch
mozart goes to the girl
are you herr mozart
my name is lorl sir
im a maidservant
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you
theyll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous
what do you mean
i cant tell you that maam
are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesnt want us to know who he is
i can live in or out just as you wish
mozart turns to his father
papa is this your idea
the old man emerges from his bedroom
his son looks at him delightedly
are you playing a trick on me
i never saw this girl in my life
to lorl is this a kind of joke
not at all sir
and i was told to wait for an answer
young woman this wont do at all
my son cant possibly accept such an offer no matter how generous unless he knows who is behind it
but i really cant tell you sir
oh this is ridiculous
what is ridiculous
wolfi has many admirers in vienna
they love him here
people send us gifts all the time
but you cant take her without reference
its unheard of
well this is none of your business
to lorl whoever sent you is going to pay no
thats right maam
so now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house
constanze looks furiously at him then at lorl
who is we
who is letting who
to lorl could you please wait outside
lorl goes outside and closes the door
constanze turns on leopold
look old man you stay out of this
we spend a fortune on you more than we can possibly afford and all you do is criticize morning to night
and then you think you can stanzi
no its right he should hear
im sick to death of it
we cant do anything right for you can we
you wont have to do anything for me ever again
dont worry im not staying here to be a burden
no one calls you that
she says i sleep all day
and so you do
the only time you come out is to eat
and what do you expect
who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day
oh now im a bad housekeeper
so you are
the place is a pigsty all the time
to mozart do you hear him
explosively she opens the door
to lorl when can you start
right away maam
youll start with that room there
indicating leopolds room its filthy
she leads the maid into leopolds room
mozart steals back into his workroom and gently closes the door
leopold is left alone
im sorry i spoke
im just a provincial from salzburg
what do i know about smart vienna
parties all night every night
dancing and drinking like idiot children
mozart stands trying to blot out the noise of his fathers shouting from the next room
dinner at eight
dinner at ten
dinner when anyone feels like it
if anyone feels like it
the ensemble of ah tutti contenti
saremo cosi from act iv of figaro resumes coming to his aid and rising to greet the listener with its serene harmonies
relieved mozart languidly picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table he is sucked back into his own world of sound
the music fades
we see lorl dressed in a walking cloak sitting before a desk talking to someone confidentially
theyre out every night sir
till all hours
a hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits
on its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to salieri
taking one oh thank you sir
do any pupils come to the house
not that ive seen
then how does he pay for all this
does he work at all
oh yes sir all day long
he never leaves the house until evening
he just sits there writing and writing
he doesnt even eat
what is it hes writing
oh i wouldnt know that sir
of course not
youre a good girl
youre very kind to do this
next time youre sure theyll be out of the house let me know will you
confused the girl hesitates
he hands her a pile of coins
oh thank you sir
she accepts them delighted
the final movement of mozarts piano concerto in e flat k
to its lively music the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men who run
off with it down the street
following them immediately appear wolfgang constanze and leopold all three dressed for an occasion
they climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte piano
as soon as it goes lorl appears in the doorway peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight
then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction
an outdoor concert is being given
mozart is actually playing the final movement of his e flat concerto with an orchestra
listening to him is a sizable audience including the emperor flanked by strack and von swieten
the crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood it is a delightful open air scene
we hear the gayest and most complex passage
leopold and constanze listen to mozart who plays his own work brilliantly
we stay with this scene for a little while and then a carriage clopping through the streets
lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver
inside the vehicle we glimpse the figure of salieri
we hear more of the concerto
perhaps the slow interlude in the last movement of k
mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood
abruptly we lorl is opening the door admitting salieri
they go in
the door shuts
the room is considerably tidier as a result of lorls ministrations
salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity
i think ive found out about the money sir
she opens a drawer in a sideboard
inside we see one gold snuff box it is the one we saw mozart being presented with as a child in the vatican
he kept seven snuff boxes in here
i could swear they were all gold
and now look theres only one left
and inside sir look i counted them tickets from the pawnshop
six of them
salieri turns to look around him
where does he work
in there sir
she points across the room to the workroom
salieri crosses and goes in alone
salieri enters the private quarters of amadeus
he is immensely excited
he moves slowly into the holy of holies picking up objects with great reverence a billiard ball a discarded wig a sock a buckle then objects more important to him
standing at mozarts desk strewn with manuscripts he picks up mozarts pen and strokes the feather
he touches the inkstand
he lays a finger on the candlestick with its half expired candle
he touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved
he is in awe
finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves
stealthily he picks them up
cu the pages
we see words set to music
against each line of notes is the name of a character contessa susanna cherubino
then another page the title page written in mozarts hand
le nozze di figaro comedia per musica tratta dal francese in quattro atti
cu the word figaro
he stares amazed
mozart is playing the cadenza and coda of piano concerto k
he completes the work with a flourish
there is loud applause
the emperor rises and all follow suit
mozart comes down to be greeted by him
thank you sire
well done mozart
really quite fine
he sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd
leopold is signaling insistently
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour
what is it
may i introduce my father
he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg
he would so much like to kiss your hand
it would make his whole stay so memorable for him
by all means
leopold comes forward eagerly and fawningly kisses the royal hand
to leopold we have met before herr mozart
thats right your majesty
twenty years ago
no twenty two
and i remember word for word what you said to me
you said you said he searches his memory
yes bravo of course bravo
everybody always says bravo when wolfi plays
like the king of england
when we played for the king of england he got up at the end and said bravo
and the pope four
four bravos from the holy father and one bellissimo
all the courtiers around are looking at him
im talking to his majesty
your majesty i wish to express only one thing that you who are the father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers
it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us honour your father and mother that your days may be long upon the earth
there it is
the director sits at his table with salieri and bonno
ive just learned something that might be of interest to you herr director
mozart is writing a new opera
an italian opera
and thats not all
he has chosen for his subject figaro
the marriage of figaro
you mean that play
hes setting that play to music
you must be mad
what is this marriage of figaro
its a french play kapellmeister
it has been banned by the emperor
he crosses himself wide eyed with alarm
are you absolutely sure
ive seen the manuscript
i know we banned this play but frankly i cant remember why
can you refresh my memory herr director
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
oh yes yes
and that was
well the play makes a hero out of a valet
he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher
do you see the implications
this would be in a grander situation as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor
the emperor stands in the middle of the room in close conversation with von strack orsini rosenberg von swieten and bonno
salieri is not present
a door opens and a lackey announces herr mozart
they all turn
mozart approaches rather apprehensively and kisses josephs hand
sit down gentlemen please
they all sit save mozart
the room suddenly looks like a tribunal
joseph is in a serious mood
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre
yet we hear you are making an opera from it
is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions
is it true
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
well majesty it is only a comedy
what you think mozart is scarcely the point
it is what his majesty thinks that counts
but your majesty motioning him to be silent mozart i am a tolerant man
i do not censor things lightly
when i do i have good reason
figaro is a bad play
it stirs up hatred between the classes
in france it has caused nothing but bitterness
my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people
i do not wish to see the same fears starting here
sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story
i have taken out everything that could give offense
i hate politics
i think you are rather innocent my friend
in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
the others look at their king solemnly all save mozart
but majesty this is just a frolic
its a piece about love
ah love again
but its new its entirely new
its so new people will go mad for it
for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling
suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation
duet turns into trio
then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in
trio turns into quartet
then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on
on and on sextet septet octet
how long do you think i can sustain that
i have no idea
imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
well six or seven minutes
how about twenty
twenty minutes of continuous music
mozart ignoring him sire only opera can do this
in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time its just noise
no one can understand a word
but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and its not noise its a perfect harmony
isnt that marvelous
mozart music is not the issue here
no one doubts your talent
it is your judgment of literature thats in question
even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce
why waste your spirit on such rubbish
surely you can choose more elevated themes
what does that mean
the only thing a man should elevate is oh excuse me
but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things
old dead legends
how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
aroused because they do
they go on forever at least what they represent
the eternal in us not the ephemeral
opera is here to ennoble us
you and me just as much as his majesty
oh bello bello bello
come on now be honest
wouldnt you all rather listen to your hairdressers than hercules
all those old bores
people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble
govern your tongue sir
how dare you
all look at the emperor
forgive me majesty
im a vulgar man
but i assure you my music is not
you are passionate mozart
but you do not persuade
sire the whole opera is finished
do you know how much work went into it
his majesty has been more than patient signore
how can i persuade you if you wont let me show it
that will do herr mozart
just let me tell you how it begins
herr mozart may i just do that majesty
show you how it begins
a slight pause
then joseph nods
mozart falls on his knees
theres a servant down on his knees
do you know why
not from any oppression
no hes simply measuring a space
do you know what for
his wedding bed to see if it will fit
mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of figaro and susanna in the opening bars of the first act of the marriage of figaro
we watch figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor singing and susanna looking on trying on the countess hat
orsini rosenberg and bonno are sitting with salieri
well mozart is already rehearsing
the emperor has given him permission
well gentlemen so be it
in that case i think we should help mozart all we can and do our best to protect him against the emperors anger
about the ballet
excuse me didnt his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
is there a ballet in figaro
yes in the third act
it is a full orchestral rehearsal
mozart is conducting from the harpsichord with his hands he does not use a baton
the singers are all in practice clothes not costumes
we are in the act iii and we hear the recitativo exchange just before the march begins
orsini rosenberg and bonno sit watching chairs
suddenly the march starts
peasants and friends start to dance in and at the same moment orsini rosenberg gets up and comes down to mozart
he is accompanied by an anxious bonno
herr mozart may i have a word with you please
certainly herr director
he signals to the cast to break off
five minutes please
the company disperses curious
the musicians look at orsini rosenberg
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
yes but this is not a ballet
this is a dance at figaros wedding
but surely the emperor didnt mean to prohibit dancing when its part of the story
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majestys edicts
give me your score please
mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting
he rips out a page
bonno watches in terror
what are you doing
he rips out three more
what are you doing herr director
taking out what you should never have put in
he goes on tearing the pages determinedly
a servant opens the door to announce
mozart brushes past him straight towards salieri who rises to greet him
the little man is near hysterics
ive no one else to turn to
he grabs salieri
wolfgang what is it
sta calmo per favore
whats the matter
the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music
pages of it
i dont know
they say ive got to re write the opera but its perfect as it is
i cant rewrite whats perfect
cant you talk to him
why bother with orsini rosenberg
hes obviously no friend of yours
oh i could kill him
i mean really kill him
i actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
you burned the score
my wife took it out in time
its not fair that a man like that has power over our work
but there are those who have power over him
i think ill take this up with the emperor
oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart
oh thank you
he kisses salieris hand
withdrawing it imitating the emperor no no no herr mozart please
its not a holy relic
mozart giggles with relief and gratitude
im sure i dont need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor
i went to the theatre ready to tell mozart that his majesty had flown into a rage when i mentioned the ballet when suddenly to my astonishment in the middle
of the third act the emperor who never attended rehearsals suddenly appeared
in the background the same recitativo before the march
the emperor steals in surreptitiously with von strack his finger to his lips
he motions everyone not to rise and slips into a chair behind salieri orsini rosenberg and bonno
the three conspirators look at each other wide eyed
the recitativo summons up the march but instead there is silence
mozart lays down his baton
the musicians lay down their instruments
the celebrants of figaros wedding come in with a few pitiful dance steps in procession only to come presently to a halt lacking their music
the singers try to go on singing but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment
everyone on stage looks lost though they attempt to go on with the story for a while
consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators
mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre
finally the emperor speaks in a whisper
what is this
i dont understand
is it modern
majesty the herr director he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place
it is your regulation sire
no ballet in your opera
mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot
do you like this salieri
it is not a question of liking your majesty
your own law decrees it im afraid
well look at them
we do look at them
the spectacle on stage has now ground to a complete halt
no no no
this is nonsense
let me hear the scene with the music
but sire oblige me
orsini rosenberg acknowledges his defeat
orsini rosenberg rises and goes down to where mozart sits anxiously with the musicians watching his approach
can we see the scene with the music back please
oh yes certainly
certainly herr director
he looks back deliriously at salieri trying to indicate his gratitude
salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle nod
orsini rosenberg returns to his king
ladies and gentlemen were going from where we stopped
the count anches so
right away please
the singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again
to orsini rosenberg what i hoped by that edict director was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in french opera
there it is endless as you know
quite so majesty
cut back to mozart at the forte piano raising his hands
the musicians raise their bows
with a flourish the happy composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut out
the music of the march begins faintly the celebrants of figaros wedding start to enter as the count and the countess sit in their chairs
in the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the emperors face sullenness and defeat on the courtiers
then suddenly without interruption on a crescendo repeat of the march we the theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public performance of figaro
everybody is there the emperor von strack bonno orsini rosenberg von swieten even madame weber and her daughters in a box
the musicians all wear imperial livery the actors on stage are now in costume
mozart conducting wears his order of the golden spur
the company wheels in and around to the music of the restored march which reaches a triumphant climax
to vogler so figaro was produced in spite of me
and in spite of me a wonder was revealed
one of the true wonders of art
the restored third act was bold and brilliant
the fourth was a miracle
the descending scale of strings in the final ensemble ah tutti contenti
saremo cosi fades in
we see the tableau on stage with the count kneeling to the countess
all are singing
i saw a woman disguised in her maids clothes hear her husband speak the first tender words he has offered her in years only because he thinks she is someone
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre conferring on all who sat there a perfect absolution
god was singing through this little man to all the world unstoppable making my defeat more bitter with each passing bar
cu salieri in his box tears on his cheeks
he watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment
finally it fades but continues underneath the following and then suddenly a miracle
the ensemble reaches its climax and fades away to the very quiet slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final chord
salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are asleep and many mare are apathetic
in the near silence we see the emperor yawn behind his hand
those nearby look at him
orsini rosenberg smiles
father did you know what that meant
with that yawn i saw my defeat turn into a victory
and mozart was lucky the emperor only yawned once
three yawns and the opera would fail the same night two yawns within a week at most
with one yawn the composer could still get mozart is pacing up and down
salieri is listening sympathetically
thats all its had and withdrawn
i know its outrageous
still if the public doesnt like ones work one has to accept the fact gracefully
but what is it they dont like
well i can speak for the emperor
you made too many demands on the royal ear
the poor man cant concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
what did you think of it yourself
did you like it at all
i think its marvelous
its the best opera yet written
i know it
why didnt they come
i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend
do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
i know i know
perhaps you should give me some lessons in that
fuming i wouldnt presume
all the same if it wouldnt be imposing i would like you to see my new piece
it would be a tremendous honour for me
oh no the honour would be all mine
bowing grazie mio caro wolfgang
grazie a lei signor antonio
he bows too giggling
a performance of salieris grand opera axur king of ormus
deafening applause from a crowded house
we see the reception of the aria which we saw cavalieri singing on the stage near the start of the film
cavalieri in a mythological persian costume is bowing to the rapturous throng below her is salieri
we see the emperor von strack orsini rosenberg bonno and von swieten all applauding
we hear great cries of salieri
cu salieri looking at the crowd with immense pleasure
then suddenly at cu mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly
behind him seated are schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in mozarts apartment
cu salieri staring fixedly at mozart then mozart still clapping apparently with tremendous enthusiasm
what was this
i never saw him excited before by any music but his own
could he mean it
to vogler would he actually tell me my music had moved him
was i really going to hear that from his own lips
i found myself actually hurrying the tempo of the finale
salieri conducting the last scene from axur king of ormus
on stage we see a big scene of acclamation the hero and heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing of the people
the decor and costumes are mythological persian
the music is utterly conventional and totally uninventive
cu mozart watching this in his box with schikaneder and the three actresses
he passes an open bottle of wine to them
he is evidently a little drunk but keeps a poker face
the act comes to an end
great applause in which mozart joins in standing and shouting bravo
then he leaves the box with schikaneder and the girls
to schikaneder well
mock moved sublime
that kind of music should be punishable by death
a crowd of people rings salieri at a respectful distance
the emperor is holding out the civilian medal and chain
i believe that is the best opera yet written my friends
salieri you are the brightest star in the musical firmament
you do honour to vienna and to me
salieri bows his head
joseph places the chain around his neck
the crowd claps
salieri makes to kiss his hand but joseph restrains him and passes on
cavalieri smiling adoringly gives him a deep curtsey and he raises her up
the crowd all flock to salieri with cries and words of approval
all want to shake his hand
they tug and pat him
but he has eyes for only one man he looks about him searching for him and then finds him
mozart stands there
eagerly salieri moves to him
it was good of you to come
how could i not
did my work please you
how could it not excellency
i never knew that music like that was possible
you flatter me
one hears such sounds and what can one say but salieri
explosive laughter as mozart and schikaneder enter the apartment very pleased with themselves and accompanied by the three actresses
the front door opens very gingerly
mozart still rather drunk sticks his head into the room anxious not to make a noise
he sees the strangers and breaks into a smile
weve got guests
ive brought some more
he opens the door wide to admit schikaneder and the girls
well have a little party
you know herr schikaneder
to a girl this is
a very nice girl
standing up wolfi
yes my love
these gentlemen are from salzburg
we were just talking about salzburg
to the two men jubilantly if youve come from my friend the fartsbishop youve arrived at just the right moment
because ive got good news for him
im done with vienna
its over finished done with
your father is dead
your father is dead
the first loud chord of the statue scene from don giovanni sounds
the second chord sounds
on stage we see the huge figure of the commendatore in robes and helmet extending his arms and pointing in accusation
the second chord sounds
on stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of a painted dining room set
the giant armoured statue of the commendatore enters pointing his finger in accusation at don giovanni who sits at the supper table staring his servant leporello quaking with fear under
singing don giovanni
the figure advances on the libertine
we see mozart conducting pale and deeply involved
music fades down a little
so rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera
there on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out repent
the music swells
we see salieri standing alone in the back of a box unseen in semi darkness
we also see that the theatre is only half full
music fades down
and i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold raised from the dead
wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world
it was terrifying and wonderful to watch
music swells up again
we watch the scene on stage as the commendatore addresses giovanni
then back to salieri in the box
music down again
now a madness began in me
the madness of a man splitting in half
through my influence i saw to it don giovanni was played only five times in vienna
but in secret i went to every one of those five all alone unable to help myself worshipping sound i alone seemed to hear
and hour after hour as i stood there understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave i began to
see a way a terrible way i could finally triumph over god my torturer
on stage don giovanni is seized and gripped by the statues icy hand
flames burst from obviously artificial rocks
demons appear and drag the libertine down to hell
the scene ends
cu salieri staring wide eyed
we see huge and attractive posters and billboards advertising schikaneders troupe
the camera concentrates on the one which reads as follows impresario de luxe the celebrated an evening of music
who personally will appear in every scene
noise smoke the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville
mozart constanze and their son karl now about two years old and sitting on his mothers lap are watching a parody scene by schikaneders troupe
they are rowdy bawdy and silly incorporating motifs situations and tunes from mozarts operas which we have seen and heard
before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer plates of sausages etc
on stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in don giovannis palace shown before
schikaneder as don giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from don giovanni end of act i played by a quartet of tipsy musicians
leporello is handing around wine on a tray
suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside
the music slithers to a stop
all look at each other in panic
leporello drops his tray with a crash
all go quiet
one more knock is heard
then all musicians actresses don giovanni and leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all
the table rocks
schikaneder is pushed out
he is terrified
he shakes elaborately
three more knocks are heard louder
who is it
one more knock
c c c come in
in the pit a chromatic scale from the overture to don giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp
this grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down
an absurd pantomime horse gallops in
it has a ridiculous expression and is manned by four men inside
standing precariously on its back is a dwarf wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the commendatore
he sings in a high nasal voice singing don giovannnnnnnnnni
he tries to keep his balance as he trots in but fails
he falls off onto the stage
he beats at the horse trying to get back on
bewildered the horse looks about him but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight
the horse amidst laughter from the audience fails to locate him
exasperated the dwarf signals to someone in the wings
a tall man strides out carrying a see saw on his shoulders stands another man
the dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see saw
there is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse only backwards so that he
is facing away from don giovanni
the two men bow to the applauding audience and retire off stage
the commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude and at the same time turn around to face don giovanni
this he finds difficult
singing don giovannnnnnnni
who the devil are you
what do you want
singing ive come to dinnnnnner
how dare you
i am a nobleman
i only dine with people of my own height
are you drunk
you invited me
and my horse
here he is
the horse takes a bow
the dwarf almost falls off again
the three girls rush to his aid and reach him just in time
they sing in the manner of the tree ladies later to be put into the magic flute
running and singing be careful
running and singing be careful
running and singing be careful
close harmony hold tight now
they grab him
angry leave me alone
im a famous horseman
and im a famous horse
he gives the ladies a radiant smile
the three ladies sing as before in close harmony
singing hes adorable
an orchestral chord
the three ladies turn to ottavio and sing to him
singing together give me your hoof my darling and ill give you my heart
take me to your stable and never more well part
singing four male voices im shy and very bashful
i dont know what to say
singing together dont hesitate a second
just answer yes and neigh
ottavio neighs loudly and runs at the girls
speaking stop it
what are you doing
remember who you are
youre a horse and they are whores
boos from the audience
speaking this is ridiculous
i wont have any of it
youre turning my house into a circus
a trapeze sails in from above
on it stands a grand soprano wearing an elaborate turkish costume like a parody of cavalieris in il seraglio
she comes in singing a mad coloratura scale in the manner of martern aller arten
speaking shut up
women women women
im sick to death of them
he marches off stage
singing dramatically dash me
at last i will be freed by death
swinging and singing kill me
at last i shall be freed by death
at last i shall be freed by dea the commendatore pulls out his sword reaches up and thrusts her through with it
the soprano collapses on the bar of the trapeze
the audience applauds
at the same moment eight dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water
they sing as they march to the sound of the march that was cut from act iii of figaro
they are dressed as miniature copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are wearing cooks hats
singing were going to make a soprano stew
were going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
any stupid soprano will do
any stew stew stew stew stew
any stewpid soprano will do
they set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage
the trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the stage
we hear the chromatic scale from the don giovanni overture again repeated and repeated only now fast and tremolando
to this exciting vamp schikaneder suddenly rides in on a real horse waving a real sword
with this he cuts the string of the trapeze and the soprano falls into the pot
a tremendous splash of water
schikaneder rides out
all the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb up the sides of the pot
the three girls produce labeled bottles from under their skirts
the first is salt
they throw them into the pot
speaking to the dwarves how long does it take to cook a soprano
all together five hours five minutes five seconds
speaking i cant wait that long
speaking four voices so am i
schikaneder marches in as figaro
singing to the tune of non piu ante in the pot i have got a good dinner
not a sausage or stew but a singer
not a sausage or stew but a singer
is the treat that ill eat for my meat
oh shut up
im sick to death of that tune
cu mozart laughing delightedly with the audience
singing again to the horse give me your hoof my darling and ill give you my heart
im sick of that one too
all the dwarves climb up the rim of the pot
as they climb they all hum together the opening of eine kleine nachtmusik
and that one too
the soprano rises dripping with water in the middle of the pot
singing oil me
all the dwarves beat her back down into the pot with their long wooden spoons
from inside the pot soil me
i cant eat her
sopranos give me hiccups
i want some hay
singing to schikaneder hey
singing to schikaneder hey
singing to schikaneder hey
singing to la oi daram give him some hay my darling and ill give you my heart
we want some hay prestissimo
leporello where are you
the table is raised in the air by leporello sitting under it on a bale of hay
singing to horse behold
singing to horse behold
singing to horse behold
ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to the hay
holding on hey
the vamp starts again vigorously
the horses rear end swings around on a hinge to turn his hind quarters straight on to the audience
the rest of him stays sideways
his tail springs up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding his arsehole
schikaneder offers him a handful of hay
the horse eats it and out the other end comes a long viennese sausage
the audience roars with laughter
another handful of hay and out of the other end falls a string of sausages
then a large pie crust and all
then a shower of iced cakes
schikaneder produces an egg from his pocket
ottavio the horse rears up in disgust
leporello pries open the horses mouth
schikaneder pops the egg into it
a breathless pause as a drum roll builds the tension up and up and up and then suddenly out of the horses rear end flies a single white dove
it flies into the audience
immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from figaro tutti contenti
more and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre
everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat
the end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical and then suddenly the tempo changes and the coarse strains of ich mochte wohl der kaiser take over and the
whole company is dancing frantically
a general dance as the curtain falls
it rises immediately
the audience including mozart is delighted
they applaud vigorously
schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe
among much whistling and clapping he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where mozart sits with his family
on stage a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old german tune
some of the audience joins in singing it
well how do you like that
mozart is smiling he has been amused
constanze has been less amused and is looking apprehensive
indicating his baby son he liked the monkey didnt you
yes well its all good fun
i liked the horse
schikaneder sits at the table and drinks from a bottle of wine
isnt he marvelous
he cost me a bundle that horse but hes worth it
i tell you if youd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success
im not joking
these people arent fools
you could do something marvelous for them
id like to try them someday
im not sure id be much good at it
course you would
you belong here my boy not the snobby court
you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better
thats what people want you know fantasy
you do a big production fill it with beautiful magic tricks and youll be absolutely free to do anything you want
of course youd have to put a fire in it because ive got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest
water effects you ever saw in your life
oh and a few trick animals
youd have to use those
i tell you i picked up a snake in dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches just like a paper fan
its a miracle
you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs ill guarantee youll have a triumph de luxe
mind you itll have to be in german
what else do you think they speak here
no no i love that
id want it to be in german
i havent done anything in german since seraglio
so there you are
what do you say
how much will you pay him
ah to mozart i see youve got your manager with you
well madame how about half the receipts
half the receipts
im talking about now
how much will you give him now
who do you think i am
whoops i have to go
he rises in haste for his next number
stay where you are
youre going to like this next one
well speak again
triumph de luxe my boy
he winks at mozart and disappears toward the stage
mozart looks after him enchanted
youre not going to do this
half the house
we need money now
either he pays now or you dont do it
i dont trust this man
and i didnt like what he did with your opera
it was common
to karl well you liked it didnt you
monkey flunki punki
half the house
youll never see a penny
i want it here in my hand
dirty stanzi manzi ill put it in your hand
ill not let you put anything in my hand until i see some money
he giggles like a child
dogs are barking wickedly
michael schlumberg comes in from his salon
mozart stands there looking very unwell and bewildered
he is also drunk but making a careful attempt to keep his composure
what a surprise
what can i do for you
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man
perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
what is this mozart
whats the matter with you
since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
well this is hardly the way to go about it
no doubt sir
but i am endowed with talent and you with money
if i offer mine you should offer yours
ill give it back i promise
my answer is no mozart
his voice becomes mechanical
von swieten and salieri stand close together
several scholars and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the other end of the room
keeping his voice down this is embarrassing you know
you introduced mozart to some of my friends and hes begging from practically all of them
it has to stop
i agree baron
cant you think of anyone who might commission some work from him
ive done my best
i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts
he got a fee what i could afford
cant you think of anyone who might do something for him
no baron no
im afraid mozart is a lost cause
he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna
he is constantly drunk
he never pays his debts
i cant think of one person to whom i dare recommend him
its tragic isnt it
such a talent
just a moment as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him
a very appropriate person to do so
the opening measures of the piano concerto in d minor steal in
this is exactly the same shop which mozart and constanze visited with leopold
now salieris servant stands in it waiting
we see a few other customers being served by the staff renting masks costumes etc
one of the staff emerges from the back of the shop carrying a large box which he hands to salieris servant
the servant leaves the shop
through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy street full of passers by carriages etc
the d minor concerto continues
salieri alone eagerly opens the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark cloak and hat that leopold wore to the masquerade only now attached to the
hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a frown not a laugh
it presents a bitter and menacing expression
he puts on the cloak the hat and the mask and turns his back
suddenly we see the assembled and alarming image reflected in a full length mirror
the music swells darkly
as the tutti of the d minor concerto continues we see salieri dressed in this menacing costume dark against the snow stalking through a street which is otherwise lively with
people going to various festivities
some of them wear frivolous carnival clothes
mozart sits writing at a table
he appears now to be really quite sick
his face expresses pain from his stomach cramps
there is a gentle knock at the door
he rises goes to he door and opens it
immediately there is a shock cut the dark frowning mask stares at him and at us
the violent d minor chord which opens don giovanni is heard
salieri in costume stands in the doorway
the second chord sounds and fades
mozart stares in panic
i have come to commission work from you
a mass for the dead
who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger
do you accept
you will be paid well
salieri extends his hand
in it is a bag of money
another fifty when i have the mass
do you accept
almost against his will mozart takes the money
how long will you give me
and be sure to tell no one what you do
you will see me again soon
he turns away
mozart closes the front door
instantly we hear the opening of the requiem mass also in d minor
mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on the wall
the portrait stares back
constanze opens the door from the bedroom
she sees him staring up
he looks at her with startled eyes
the music breaks off
who was that
i heard voices
he gives a strange little giggle
whats the matter
she sees the bag of money
pouncing on it who gave you this
how much is it
wolfi who gave you this
im not telling you
youd think i was mad
he stares at her
she stares at him
old salieri is now wildly animated totally driven by his confession to vogler
my plan was so simple it terrified me
first i must get the death mass and then achieve the death
vogler stares at him in horror
his funeral imagine it
the cathedral all vienna sitting there
his coffin mozarts little coffin in the middle
and suddenly in that silence music
a divine music bursts out over them all a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri
what passion in the music
salieri has been touched by god at last
and god forced to listen
powerless powerless to stop it
i at the end for once laughing at him
do you understand
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing
how does one do that
how does one kill a man
its one thing to dream about it
its very different when you have to do it with your own hands
he raises his own hands and stares at them
the raging dies irae from mozarts requiem mass bursts upon us
mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music
his whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever
he pours wine down his throat spilling it and grimaces as it hits his stomach
all around him are manuscripts
there is a banging at the front door
mozart does not hear it the music raves on
another knocking comes louder
constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her distracted husband
the knocking is repeated again even more violently and insistently
he looks at her
the music breaks off
an enormous bang at the door startles him
constanze moves to open it
dont answer it
mozart springs up
he is clearly terrified
tell him im not here
tell him im working on it
come back later
he runs out of he room into his workroom and shuts he door
now a little scared herself constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously
schikaneder stands there floridly dressed as usual
lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen
am i interrupting something
not at all
peering into he room wheres our friend
hes not in
but hes working on it
he said to tell you
i hope so
i need it immediately
he pushes her into the room
is he happy with it
he sees he manuscript on the table and goes to it eagerly
is this it
he picks up a page without waiting for a reply
what the devil is this
does he think im in the funeral business
mozart opens he workroom door
we see him as schikaneder sees him wild eyed extremely pale and strange
leave that alone
put it down
what is this
put it down i said
its nothing for you
what have you got for me
is it finished
the vaudeville whatd you think
can i see it
because theres nothing to see
he giggles triumphantly
schikaneder stares at him
look i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes
well we can
so let me see it
where is it
mozart with a bright rather demented smile presents his head to schikaneder
its all right here in my noodle
the rest is just scribbling
scribbling and bibbling
bibbling and scribbling
would you like a drink
schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels
look you little clown do you know how many people ive hired for you
do you know how many people are waiting
leave him alone
im paying these people
do you realize that
hes doing his best
im paying people just to wait for you
you know whats ridiculous
your libretto thats whats ridiculous
only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff
and whats so intelligent about writing a requiem
shes mad wolfi
oh yes and who are you
hes worked for kings
for the emperor
shouting who are you
schikaneder suddenly takes mozart by the arms and speaks to him with intense appeal
just write it down
its no good to anyone in your head
and fuck the death mass
a frightened and tearful lorl sits before salieri
now calm yourself
whats the matter with you
im not working there anymore
what has happened
you dont know what its like
herr mozart frightens me
he drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse
i dont know
he has pains
here in his stomach
they bend him right over
is he working
im frightened sir
when he speaks he doesnt make any sense
you know he said he saw he said he saw his father
and his fathers dead
is he working
i suppose so
he sits there all he time doing some silly opera
please dont ask me to go back again
im very very frightened
insistently are you sure its an opera
the overture to the magic flute begins grandly
to the music of the slow introduction we see the room lit by a few candles appears dirty
the camera shows us again leopolds portrait on the wall looking down upon a scene of disorder
papers litter the table dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace on the forte piano lies mozarts masonic apron woven with symbols
to the more lyrical passage of the introduction we see mozart take up a candle and enter we watch him stand beside constanze who lies asleep
mozart now looks very ill his wife appears worn out
tenderly he touches her hair
then he moves to the cot where his son karl lies asleep and kneels pulls up the childs little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside
constanze opens her eyes and stares at him
mozart rises and returns to the introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins
instantly mozart starts to dance to it all alone gleefully like a child
he looks up at his fathers portrait and makes a silly rude gesture at it
he is briefly an irresponsible and happy boy again
then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door
the music fades down
warily mozart crosses and opens he door
the familiar dark chords from don giovanni cut across the happy music
before him stands the masked stranger
i dont have it yet
its not finished
im sorry but i need more time
are you neglecting my request
i promise you ill give you a wonderful piece the best i ever can
he turns and looks
constanze has come into the living room
nervously mozart indicates her
this is my wife stanzi
ive been sick but im all right now
arent oh yes sir
hes all right
and hes working on it very hard
give me two more weeks
salieri contemplates them both
the sooner you finish the better your reward
he turns and goes down the stairs
mozart shuts the door he closes his eyes in fear
wolfi i think you really are going mad
you work like a slave for that idiot actor who wont give you a penny and here
this is not a ghost
this is a real man who puts down real money
why on earth dont you finish it
he will not look at her or reply
give me one reason i can understand
i cant write it
its killing me
he looks at her suddenly
no this is really awful
youre drunk arent you
be honest tell me youve been drinking
and im so stupid i stay here and listen to you
suddenly she starts to cry
its not fair
i worry about you all the time
i try to help you all i can and you just drink and talk nonsense and and frighten me
its not fair
her tears flow
mozart looks at her helplessly
go back to bed
let me sit here
let me stay here with you
i promise i wont say all word
ill just be here so you know no ones going to hurt you
she sits down tearfully staring at him
we hear the rex tremendai majestatis from the requiem and see on the wall the portrait of leopold mozart looking down
the camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table
mozart is writing the music
he looks up and sees that constanze is fast asleep in her chair
mozart gets up quietly
he puts on his hat and cloak takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house
without stopping the music changes from the heavy requiem to the light hearted patter of the papa papa duet from the magic flute
this little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the weiden
inside we see a table chairs a forte piano bottles and a chaos of papers
strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses giggling
schikaneder and mozart both drunk are singing the duet of the two bird people
the actor sings papageno and the composer in a soprano voice sings papagena at the keyboard
absurdly they end up rubbing noses and fall on each others necks
mozart drunk and happy staggers back through the snow
there are a few people about
he goes into his apartment building
he comes through he door and stares across the living room at an open bedroom door
puzzled he crosses
the bedroom is also empty
we see constanzes empty bed karls empty bed empty closets
stanzi marini bini
he looks about him puzzled
frau weber sits grimly talking
mozart sits also completely exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech
shes not coming back you know
shes gone for good
i did it and im proud of it
leave i said
take he child and go just go
heres the money
go to the spa and get your health back thats if you can
i was shocked
shocked to my foundation
is that my girl
can that be my stanzi
the happy little moppet i brought up that poor trembling thing
oh you monster
no one exists but you do they
you and your music
do you know how often shes sat in that very chair weeping her eyes out of her head because of you
i warned her
choose a man not a baby i said
but would she listen
hes just a silly boy she says
silly my arse
selfish thats all you are
selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish
and with a scream madame webers voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the queen of the night in the magic flute
on stage we see the queen of the night fantastically costumed furiously urging her daughter to kill sarastro
as she sings we see the interior of the theatre now re arranged from when we last visited it to watch the cabaret
an audience of ordinary german citizens stands in the pit area or sits they are rapt and excited
the theatre also possesses boxes some of these show closed curtains their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies
in one of them sits salieri
singing furiously a hellish wrath within my heart is seething
death and destruction flame around my throne
if not by thee sarastros light be extinguished
then be thou mine own daughter never more
rejected be forever
so sundered be forever all the bonds of kin and blood
hear god of vengeance
hear thy mothers vow
thunder and lightning
she disappears amidst tremendous applause from the audience
on the poster for the magic flute the name emmanuel schikaneder should appear very very large and the name of mozart quite small i
weiden theatre the actors of the imperial and royal privileged theatre of the weiden have the honour to perform a grand opera in two acts by emmanuel schikaneder the cast
list the music is by herr wolfgang amadeus mozart
herr mozart out of respect for a gracious and honourable public and from friendship for the author of this piece will today direct the orchestra in person
the book of the opera furnished with two copperplates of which is engraved herr schikaneder in the costume he wears for the role of papageno may be had at the
box office for kr
prices of admission are as usual to begin at oclock we cut to the scene immediately before papagenos song ein madchen oder weibchen
papageno played by schikaneder dressed in his costume of feathers is trying to get through a mysterious door
a voice calls from within
if only i knew by which door i came in
to audience which was it
was it this one
come on tell me
now i cant go forward and i cant go back
oh this is awful
he weeps extravagantly
in the pit mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor
he slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage
we follow him
over the scene we hear papageno being addressed by the first priest in stern tones
on stage man thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth
the gentle gods have remitted thy punishment but yet thou shalt never feel the divine content of the consecrated ones
oh well im not alone in that
just give me a decent glass of wine thats divine content enough for me
an enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth
we follow mozart into the wings
actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes
we see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about
also the scenery door of a temple with the word wisdom inscribed on the pediment
mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals and a musician waiting to play it
silently mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself
on stage schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the first priest
man hast thou no other desire on earth but just to eat and drink
laughter from the audience
well actually i do have a rather weird feeling in my heart
perhaps its just indigestion
but you know i really would like i really do want something even nicer than food and drink
now what on earth could that be
he stares at the audience and winks at them
now papagenos aria ein madchen oder weibchen begins
it is interpolated as he pretends to play his magic bells with the glockenspiel actually being played off stage by mozart
schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see mozart conducting
he looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement
he sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papagenos wish
a willing billing lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish
be my most tasty little dish
be my most tasty little dish
then that would be eating and drinking id live like a prince without thinking
the wisdom of old would be mine a womans much better than wine
then that would be eating and drinking
the wisdom of old would be mine a womans much better than wine
shes much better than wine
shes much better than wine
encore lightly as before a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papagenos wish
a willing billing lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely
but if she wont fly to my aid then into a ghost i must fade
i need to net one birdie only but if she wont fly to my aid then into a ghost i must fade
to a ghost i must fade
to a ghost i must fade
encore a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papagenos wish
a willing billing lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish
at present the girls only peck me
their cruelty surely will wreck me
but one little beak in my own and ill up to heaven be flown
at present the girls only peck me
but one little beak in my own and ill up to heaven be flown
up to heaven be flown
up to heaven be flown
at certain moments we see the stage from salieris point of view schikaneder singing then pretending to play and then we see mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in
then suddenly the actor mimes playing and no sound comes
he mimes again but still nothing comes
he looks offstage in anxiety there is evidently some commotion
people are looking down on the floor
the song comes to a near halt
then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it
at this moment salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box
we see the actress playing papagena wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face
she is looking worriedly down at mozart who is lying unconscious on the floor
a few people around him are trying to revive him
one has put a wet handkerchief around his temples
another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts
there are voices saying doctor
take him to a dressing room
someone call a carriage
take him home
papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager
suddenly we hear the voice of salieri
ill take care of him
he steps forward
i have a carriage
the actors step back respectfully
he stoops and picks up the frail composer in his arms
mozart is quite limp and salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck
all this is watched nervously by schikaneder on stage whilst performing his scene with papagena as an ugly old woman
here i am my angel
who the devil are you
ive taken pity on you my angel
i heard your wish
well thank you
some people get all the luck
the actress raises the little painted cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty young one to the audience
now youve got to promise me faithfully youll remain true to me forever
then youll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
nervous i cant wait
well promise then
what do you mean now
of course now
right away before i get any older
well i dont know
i mean youre a delicious delightful delectable little bird but dont you think you might be just a little tough
amorously oh im tender enough for you my boy
im tender enough for you
a waiting sedan chair
mozart has recovered consciousness but looks exceedingly ill
salieri has set him down in the winters night
snow is falling
is it over
im taking you home
youre not well
i have to get back
i have he starts to collapse again
salieri helps him into the sedan
the door is shut
the chair sets off and salieri strides beside it through the mean street
a lantern with a candle swings from the chair
the door opens
salieri enters carrying the lantern from the sedan chair
he is followed by mozart carried in the arms of one of the porters
the room is now really in complete disarray
the table is piled high with music the pages of the requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles
the porter carries mozart into this room is miserably neglected
the bed is unmade clothes lie about on the floor
a sock has been stuck into the broken pane of one window
the porter lays mozart down on the bed as salieri lights candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half eaten food and other signs left by a man whose
wife has departed
it is obviously very cold
another very small bed nearby belongs to the child karl
handing the porter the lantern thank you
the porter leaves the room
vaguely singing papa
he opens his eyes and sees salieri staring down at him
he helps him to sit up and takes off his coat and his shoes and puts a coverlet around him
where is your wife
shes not well either
she went to the spa
you mean shes not coming back
youre so good to me
i mean to come to my opera
you are the only colleague who did
he struggles to loosen his cravat
salieri does it for him
i would never miss anything that you had written
you must know that
this is only a vaudeville
it is a sublime piece
the grandest operone
i tell you you are the greatest composer known to me
do you mean that
i have bad fancies
i dont sleep well anymore
then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill
the doctor thinks i am
im too young to be so sick
there is a violent knocking at the front door
mozart starts and looks around wildly
shall i answer it
no its him
the knocking increases in loudness terrifying mozart
tell him to go away
tell him im still working on it
dont let him in
salieri moves to the door
ask him if hed give me some money now
tell him if he would that would help me finish it
salieri leaves the room
salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal schikaneder who has obviously come straight from the theatre
he still wears his bird make up and under his street cloak his feathered costume is clearly seen
he has with him the three actresses also looking anxious and also in make up as the three attendants in the magic flute
yes i am looking after him
can we come in
well hes sleeping now
but hes all right
hes just exhausted
he became dizzy thats all
we should let him rest
well tell him we were here wont you
and say everything went wonderfully
a triumph de luxe say that
tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times
ill call tomorrow
to the actresses and congratulations to all of you
it was superb
thank you excellency
schikaneder produces a bag of money
oh by the way give him this
this is his share
that should cheer him up eh
goodnight to you all now
it was perfection truly
delighted goodnight your excellency
they bob and curtsey
schikaneder stares at salieri uneasily vaguely suspicious
salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door
he stays for a moment thinking
he contemplates the money
mozart is sitting up in bed staring at the door
he holds in his hand the bag of money
salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet
he said to give you this
and if you finish the work by tomorrow night he will pay you another hundred ducats
mozart looks at the coins astonished
but thats too soon
did he say a hundred
can i could i help you in any way
actually you could
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but youd have to swear not to tell a soul
im not allowed
you know its all here in my head
its just ready to be set down
but when im dizzy like this my eyes wont focus
i cant write
then let us try together
id regard it as such an honour
tell me what is this work
a mass for the dead
trivial dance music is playing
constanze is doing a waltz with a young officer in military uniform
at the moment we see her she stops abruptly as if in panic
what is it
i want to go
i want to go back to vienna
i feel wrong
i feel wrong being here
laying a hand on her arm what are you talking about
mozart is sitting up in bed propped against pillows
the coins lie on the coverlet many candles burn in the necks of bottles
salieri without coat or wig is seated at an improvised worktable
on it are blank sheets of music paper quills and ink
also the score of the requiem mass as so far composed
mozart is bright eyed with a kind of fever
salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as mozart can dictate them
where did i stop
consulting the manuscript the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis
when the wicked are confounded
flammis acribus addictis
how would you translate that
consigned to flames of woe
do you believe in it
a fire which never dies
burning one forever
he takes his pen
we ended in f major
so now a minor
salieri writes the key signature
salieri writes this and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can at mozarts dictation
he is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates
his speed however can never be too fast for mozarts impatient mind
start with the voices
second beat of the first measure singing the note con fu ta tis
speaking second measure second beat
singing ma le dic tis
speaking g sharp of course
third measure second beat starting on e
singing flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis
speaking and fourth measure fourth beat d
singing ma le dic tis flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis
speaking do you have that
i think so
sing it back
salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line
after the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice
now the tenors
fourth beat of the first measure c
singing con fu ta tis
speaking second measure fourth beat on d
singing ma le dic tis
speaking all right
fourth measure second beat f
singing flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis
his voice is lost on the last words as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack singing their whole line from the beginning right to the end of the
sixth measure where the basses stopped but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them
salieri writes feverishly
we see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible the ink flicks onto the page
the music stops again
now the orchestra
second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses
identical notes and rhythm
he hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line the first bassoon and tenor trombone labouring to keep up please
just one moment
mozart glares at him irritated
his hands move impatiently
salieri scribbles frantically
it couldnt be simpler
finishing first bassoon and tenor trombone what
with the tenors
the instruments to go with the voices
trumpets and timpani tonic and dominant
he again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning conducting
on the soundtrack we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top playing the tenor vocal
we also hear the trumpets and timpani
the sound is bare and grim
it stops at the end of the sixth measure
salieri stops writing
and thats all
now for the fire
he smiles strings in unison ostinato on all like this
he sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato
speaking second measure on b
he sings the second measure of the ostinato
speaking do you have me
i think so
salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato
excitedly good good yes
put it down
and the next measures exactly the same rising and rising c to d to e up to the dominant chord
do you see
as salieri writes mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment
yes yes go on
the voca me
suddenly sotto voce
write that down sotto voce pianissimo
voca me cum benedictis
call me among the blessed
he is now sitting bolt upright hushed and inspired
sopranos and altos in thirds
altos on c
singing the alto part vo ca vo ca me vo ca me cum be ne dic tis
sopranos up to f on the second voca
yes and on dictis
he writes feverishly
and underneath just violins arpeggio
he sings the violin figure under the voca me bars
speaking the descending scale in eighth notes and then back suddenly to the fire again
he sings the ostinato phrase twice
speaking and thats it
do you have it
you go fast
urgently do you have it
then let me hear it
all of it
the whole thing from the beginning now
the entire confutatis bursts over the room as mozart snatches the manuscript pages from salieri and reads from it singing
salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment
the music continues right through the following scenes to the end of the movement
a carriage is driving fast through the night
snow lies on the countryside
the carriage is filled with passengers
among them constanze and karl her young son
they are sleepless and sway to the motion of the vehicle
mozart lying in bed exhausted but still dictating urgently
we do not hear what he is saying to salieri who still sits writing assiduously
mozart is looking very sick sweat is pouring from his forehead
the carriage moving through the night to the sound of the music
mozart still dictating salieri still writing without stop
the carriage has arrived
constanze and her son alight with other passengers
postillions attend to the horses
she takes her boys hand
it is a cold wintry dawn
the music stutters to a close
end of the confutatis
do you want to rest a bit
im not tired at all
well stop for just a moment
then well do the lacrimosa
i can keep going i assure you
shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
im not leaving you
i am so ashamed
i was foolish
i thought you did not care for my work or me
mozart closes his eyes
salieri stares at him
constanze and karl approach along the cobbled street hand in hand toward their house
snow lies in the street
mozart lies asleep in the bed holding the last pages of the manuscript
salieri lies across from him on karls small bed in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat
the childs bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position
constanze and karl arrive at the door
it is as disordered as before save that the table previously littered with pages is now completely bare
constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom
mozart is asleep in the bed
salieri is dozing on the nearby childs bed
the room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles
startled by constanzes entrance and her young son salieri scrambles up
as he does so he attempts to button his waistcoat but does it ineptly so that the vestment becomes bunched up making him look absurd
what are you doing here
your husband is ill maam
he took sick
i brought him home
i was at hand
well thank you very much
you can go now
he needs me maam
no he doesnt
and i dont want you here
just go please
he asked me to stay
and im asking you she notices a movement from the bed
he sees constanze and smiles with real joy
forgetting salieri she goes to her husband
wolfi im back
im still very angry with you but i missed you so much
she throws herself on the bed
ill never leave you again
if youll just try a little harder to be nice to me
and ill try to do better too
this was just silly and stupid
she hugs her husband desperately
he stares at her with obvious relief not able to speak
suddenly she sees the manuscript in his hand
what is this
she looks at it and recognizes it
oh no not this
not this wolfi
youre not to work on this ever again
she takes it from his weak hand
at the same moment salieri reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on the table
she stares at him trying to understand suspicious and frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound
mozart makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages
the coins brought by salieri fall on the floor
karl runs after them laughing
to salieri this is not his handwriting
i was assisting him
he asked me
hes not going to work on this anymore
it is making him ill
she extends her hand for the requiem as she stands up
with extreme reluctance it costs him agony to do it salieri hands over the score of the requiem to her
she marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the room opens it throws the manuscript inside shuts the lid locks it and pockets the key
involuntarily salieri stretches out his arms for the lost manuscript
but but but she turns and faces him
he stares at her stunned
i regret we have no servants to show you out herr salieri
respect my wish and go
madame i will respect his
he asked me to stay here
they look at each other in mutual hatred
she turns to the bed
mozart appears to have gone to sleep again
she moves to the bed
the child is playing with the coins on the floor
faintly we hear the start of the lacrimosa from the requiem
salieri watches as she touches her husbands hand
as the music grows we realize that mozart is dead
cu constanze staring wide eyed in dawning apprehension
cu salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated
the music rises
cu the child on the floor playing with the money
the lacrimosa continues through all of the following a small group of people emerges from the side door into the raw wet day accompanying a cheap wooden coffin
the coffin is borne by a gravedigger and schikaneder in mourning clothes
they load it onto a cart drawn by a poor black horse
all the rest are in black also salieri von swieten constanze and her son karl madame weber and her youngest daughter sophie and even lorl the maid
it is drizzling
the cart sets off
the group follows
the group has already passed beyond the city limits following the miserable cart
the lacrimosa accompanies them with its measured thread
the drizzle of rain has now become heavy
one by one the group breaks up and shelters under the trees
the cart moves on toward the cemetery alone followed by nobody growing more and more distant
they watch it go
salieri and von swieten shake hands mournfully the water soaking their black tall hats
schikaneder is in tears
constanze is near collapse
salieri moves to assist her but she turns away from him seeking the arm of cavalieri
madame weber takes karls hand
the music builds to its climax on dona eis pacem
we cut back to morning light fills the room
old salieri sits weeping convulsively as the music stops
tears stream down his face
vogler watches him amazed
why add to your misery by confessing to murder
you didnt kill him
no you didnt
i poisoned his life
but not his body
what difference does that make
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer
is that your penance
from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me
whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing
and thats my immortality at last
our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy
at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god
oh my son my poor son
dont pity me
you serve a wicked god
he killed mozart not i
took him snatched him away without pity
he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory
he doesnt care
god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses
he broke mozart in half when hed finished with him and threw him away
like an old worn out flute
the rain has eased off
a local priest with two boy acolytes is standing beside an open communal grave
mozarts body is lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack
we see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks
the gravedigger throws the one containing mozart amongst the others
an assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of them
the acolytes swing their censers
the lord giveth
the lord taketh away
blessed be the name of the lord
why did he do it
why didnt he kill me
i had no value
what was the use keeping me alive for thirty two years of torture
thirty two years of honours and awards
he tears off the civilian medal and chain with which the emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and throws it across the room
being bowed to and saluted called distinguished distinguished salieri by men incapable of distinguishing
thirty two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room watching myself become extinct
my music growing fainter all the time fainter until no one plays it at all
and his growing louder filling the world with wonder
and everyone who loves my sacred art crying mozart
bless you mozart
the door opens
an attendant comes in cheerful and hearty
good morning professor
time for the water closet
and then weve got your favourite breakfast for you sugar rolls
to vogler he loves those
fresh sugar rolls
salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest who stares back
ill speak for you
i speak for all mediocrities in the world
i am their champion
i am their patron saint
on their behalf i deny him your god of no mercy
your god who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill
he may forgive me i shall never forgive him
he signs to the attendant who wheels him in his chair out of the room
the priest stares after him
the corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses and nuns
they form a long wretched strange procession some of them are clearly very disturbed
as old salieri is pushed through them in his wheelchair he lifts his hands to them in benediction
mediocrities everywhere now and to come i absolve you all
finally he turns full face to the camera and blesses us the audience making the sign of the cross
underneath we hear stealing in and growing louder the tremendous masonic funeral music of mozart
