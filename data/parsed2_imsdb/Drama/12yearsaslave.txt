written by john ridley we are close on a pair of black hands as they open a we cut to the hands stringing a violin
its not a high end piece but it is quite nice
we cut to a wide shot of the study
sitting in a chair with violin in hand is solomon northup a man in his late twenties
everything about solomon his mien and manner is distinguished
but he too seems a hardy individual
someone who has known manual labor in his time
solomon begins to lightly play his violin as if testing the strings their tuning
satisfied solomon begins to play vigorously
as he does we make a hard cut to we come in on a lively affair
a dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house
in attendance are eight couples
all are white and all are fairly young in their early twenties
the men and women are dressed in very fine attire
we should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means
the furniture has been set aside in the living room
at the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a the music they are dancing to is being played by solomon having cut directly from the tune he
was previously playing
he plays with a light determination and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude
solomon concludes the reel and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all
it should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for solomons abilities
it is a saturday morning
clad in her finest attire is anne solomons wife a few years younger than he
we see also the northup children margaret who is eight and alonzo who is five
they are handsome and well groomed kids
anne straightens up the children
she rises up and stands behind them almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait
they all wait a moment then solomon enters the foyer
he stands and looks admiringly at his family
it isnt that he doesnt have love for them he does as well
but in the moment he truly admires his greatest accomplishment a family that is healthy and well and provided for
he goes to his children and hands each a coin then goes to anne
gives her a kiss on the cheek
the children giggle at the sight
solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of saratoga
the streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling
most are white but there are blacks as well
they are freed blacks who mingle fairly easily though not always completely with the whites
we see too a few black slaves who travel with their white masters
these pairings are largely from the south and despite the fact the blacks are slaves they are not physically downtrodden not field hands
they are well dressed and leading apparently an easy life comparatively speaking as they trail their masters
as they walk solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic
solomon and his children easily jump across the muck
anne stands at the lip of the puddle calls for solomon to help her across
solomon turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward come anne
the children now smiling as well egg their mother on
you can make it
ive done it
you can make it
i will not ruin my dress
solomon moves close holds out his arms
yet theres still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes
anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which solomon replies
i will catch you anne
again lightly stern you will
and with that anne takes the leap
solomon catches her swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children
that done solomon takes annes hand and leads her on
as solomon and his family make their way among the slaves on the street we see one in particular jasper
as he trails his master he cant help but note solomon and his family as they enter a store
his intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious
with his master occupied jasper moves slyly toward the store
frozen on the spot jasper looks on admiringly
suddenly a voice barks out jasper
we are inside the store of mr
cephas parker a white man and a supplier of general goods
solomon greets him mr
with money in hand the northup children move quickly about the store looking for items to purchase
anne looks over some silks and fabrics
parker suggests a new cravat solomon
pure silk by way of the french
we are in need of a fresh carry all for the mrss travels
a years passed
off to sandy hill
using a long pole mr
parker fetches down a carry all from an upper shelf
something to suit your style but sturdy enough for the forty miles round trip
handing the bag to anne she is immediately taken by it
at what price
we will take it
children come see what your father has just purchased for me
as the children run over chattering excitedly about the new gift they run past jasper who has quietly entered the store
at the checkout counter sits a portrait of william henry harrison the edges draped in black crepe
before the book sits a ledger
parker asks of solomon if you would sign our condolence book
my hope is to find a way to forward it to the widow harrison
sad days for the nation
harris and her children
i hope brighter times ahead
jasper looks scared timid
its as though hed like to engage but is unsure of as to how
noting jasper parker a moment sir and you will be assisted
if we could discuss the price
forgive me mrs
a customer waits
to jasper with good nature shop well but mind your wallet
ignore the gentlemans nonsense
now may i interest you in a new cravat
pure silk by way of the before parker can finish the door opens
its jaspers master fitzgerald
hes stern clearly displeased
my regrets for the intrusion
fitzgerald looks to solomon
it is a cold glare as though he wasnt speaking to and has no interest in a response from a black man
looking back to parker good day sir
anne busy in the kitchen puts the final touches to the meal which is just about to begin
solomon in the meanwhile sits at the head of the table reading from a newspaper
he reads to his children solemn news of the funeral arrangements for the recently deceased president harrison
thus has passed away from earth our late president
solomon starts from the top of the article
during the morning from sunrise the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust
our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man
one who was by the wishes of a large majority of our people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift
william henry harrison
a long moment of quiet the family continuing to eat
then from margaret will you read it again
not just now darling
anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table
as she takes a seat all heads are bowed
for food that stays our hunger for rest that brings us ease for homes where memories linger we give our thanks for these
margaret that was wonderful
thank you papa
alonzo do you have something to say
yes i helped momma make this
yes and you were such a good help
especially making the gravy
papa i would very much like to learn how to play the violin
could you teach me
yes but i asked papa first
both of you calm down
we will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner
and on that note lets start eating
the family all tuck in to their meal
the scene is one of warmth and happiness
solomon and anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed
they are tucked in and each given a kiss good night
as margaret lays down to sleep anne blows out the candle darkening the room
silhouetted in the doorway solomon takes anne in his arms holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple beautiful gift that is their children
now alone together we see anne and solomon wrapped in each others arms
beyond being physically close emotionally close they are just so very comfortable with one another
they are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other
they look at each other for a prolonged time
it is the custom
i wonder what youll do without me
i wont stay idle
solomons eyes lower
darling its good money
if only i didnt have to share your cooking with other people
anne holds his gaze
we are just outside the northup house
a carriage waits with a driver
anne and the children are dressed for travel anne sporting her new carry all
the driver loads bags into the carriage
for her parting gift anne gives her husband a kiss
anne and the children loaded up the driver chides the horse and the carriage heads off
solomon waves a hearty good bye to his wife and children
solomon is now out for a stroll
he passes two men two in particular who stand outside conversing with mr
moon himself merrill brown and abram hamilton
brown is about with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence
hamilton is closer to a man of fair complexion and light eyes
both are finely if perhaps a bit garishly dressed
hamilton as solomon describes him slightly effeminate
moon spotting solomon call the devils name
there he is now
i have two gentlemen who should make your acquaintance
brown and hamilton
northup these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals and i was just this very moment telling them that solomon northup is an expert player on the violin
he was indeed
moon is being overly gracious
taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse sir
we make a jump to a green space
solomon brown and hamilton are sitting at a bench
that is our usual employee
the company currently in the city of washington
circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel
it is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed
creatures from the darkest africa as yet unseen by civilized man
acrobats from the orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners
and i myself in aide of mr
brown an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation
we are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions
the reason for our inquiry with mr
we had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our
men of true talent seemingly in short supply
thank you sir
if we could persuade you to accompany us as far as new york
we would give you one dollar for each days service and three dollars for every night played at our performances
in addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from new york here to saratoga
you understand this is all very sudden
consider it an opportunity to see its intriguing
if there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer
solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration
the payment offered is enticement enough as is my desire to visit the metropolis
we are delighted sir
though we would add that our travel plans we would like to depart with haste
as luck would have it my wife and children are traveling
i will write her of our plans
i would beg you collect yourself then we may proceed
back in his house we see solomon packing putting some clothes in a travel case and collecting his violin as well
solomon sits down to write a letter pen poised over paper with already a few lines written
but solomon thinks better of it
with little thought he tears the solomon enters the buggy carpet bag in hand
brown and hamilton are waiting
they ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of noble horses
no letter to post
my return will coincide with my familys
were off then
we find ourselves in a roadside pub
it serves the purpose of drinking and diversion and little more
as solomon plays his violin brown and hamilton perform a decent paired magic routine before a sparse audience not
after the show the pub now fairly empty solomon hamilton and brown sit down to eat
hamilton and brown drink but again solomon abstains
though solomon remains cool hamilton and brown put up a great show of being disappointed as hamilton counts out what little money was collected
not an additional tip from a one of them
they expect to be entertained for nothing
and not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for
its the national mood
theres too much grief to make room for frivolity
my sincerest apologies solomon
you were promised opportunity and you were given none
the opportunity is with the circus
a two man show poorly promoted what were we to expect
but the circus bills itself
i have told you of the circus with which we are connected
creatures from the darkest of africa
acrobats from the orient who you have described it yes
we need to return immediately to washington
i believe us familiar enough now but forgive me if i am bold
would you consider making the trip with us
solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea
entertaining at pubs and inns has its place but a man of your skills deserves better
and more importantly you would build your own name and following
the circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations
an introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward
now would be the time
with your family away an opportunity presents itself
said as fellow artists as well as businessmen
well worth the effort at least
you present a flattering representation
as my family will be traveling back shortly perhaps i might commit only to one trial engagement
oh very good sir
i cannot recall being so excited
there is a practical concern
if you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers
here in new york no
but we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution
its to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being
six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later
well go to the customs house in the morning then travel on
good business all around
the city is a swarm of people
at the moment the populace is displaying both sorrow and anticipation
sorrow for the loss of the president
many are dressed in black and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere
black armbands are frequently seen and the occasional american flag hung at half mast
as well there are portraits of harrison at varying locations
having arrived in washington solomon hamilton and brown a decent though crowded boisterous and smoke filled joint
solomon hamilton and brown are among several parties drinking in the hotels bar
as with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes accessorize the background
brown counts out
in coin on the tabletop
solomon is astonished by the amount
forty three dollars
all to you
its far more than my wages amount to
consider the remainder an advance from the circus
i cannot tell you
i honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when i described your abilities
he was fairly overcome with excitement
you should have invited him to sup with us
i did but so many preparations before the company is to depart
tomorrow we shall prepare for our washington debut
but tonight our thoughts are with the great man for whom this city prepared solemn memorial
he has passed from the praise of men to receive the plaudit of his heavenly father
a fine man has passed
let us remember him with a drink
both hamilton and brown hold up their tankards to drink
solomon a bit reluctantly does the same
our departed president deserves all the salutation we can imbibe
hamilton and brown drink again and solomon does as well
we make a hard cut to solomon outside of the pub in an alley with brown and hamilton in silhouette back lit by the street lights
he is violently ill hunched over and retching horribly
thats all right solomon
no shame in it
no shame at all
hamilton and brown help solomon to lumber up the spiral staircase passing the occasional bemused guest
hamilton is placing a spittoon near solomons bed where a prone and reeling solomon lays
hamilton sits on the bed
as he strokes solomons sweaty face hamilton speaks sweetly
im afraid that brown and i havent brought you much luck
but rough waters bring smooth sailing
eventually they do
we wont hear it
let him sleep
a good nights sleep
tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again
hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to solomon for browns taste
with more than a bit of hamilton
nothing more we can do for him
such is the pity
displaying an odd sort of disappointment hamilton slinks away from the bed
he crosses to and blows out a candle
the room goes dark with a blackness more than night
brown and hamilton exit
solomon lays in the dark and moans
his sounds becoming more and more
solomon stirs then slowly awakes to his new circumstances
he finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry
there is a thick and well locked door a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter
the only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned dirty box stove
as solomon rises he sees that his hands are cuffed the chain running to a bolt in the ground and his legs in irons
at first solomon is incredulous
but that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic
he begins to pull on the chains fight against them
he does so with increasing desperation
solomon flails about the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry
he grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh but he cannot pull himself free
after several minutes of intense effort solomon tires slows then finally he collapses
and in this collapsed state he remains
solomon again awakens
he hears sounds beyond the door
eventually the door opens
enter james burch who runs the slave pen and ebenezer radburn who works as a turnkey and overseer
as the door opens this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near black room
the shine is painful to solomons eyes
with no salutation whatsoever burch well my boy how yah feel now
solomon rises up as best he can
with all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact i am solomon northup
i am a free man a resident of saratoga new york
the residence also of my wife and children who are equally free
i have papers
you have no right whatsoever to detain me yah not any and i promise you i promise upon my liberation i will have satisfaction for this wrong
produce your papers
with confidence solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers
he searches one then the other but they are empty
he feels quickly about himself but clearly his papers have been lifted
solomons confidence shifts but to resolve rather than fear
papers or none he will not be easily cowed
still burch asserts yah no free man
and yah aint from saratoga
yah from georgia
not a word spoken among the trio but solomon and burch do some serious eye fucking neither man yielding
burch says again yah aint a free man
yah nuthin but a georgia runaway
burch waits for solomon to acquiesce
solomon does not in any way
both men exchange a long and daring stare
the two are clearly at an intellectual stand off
burch leans to radburn says something which we cannot radburn walks off camera and returns with a pair of instruments a paddle the flattened portion which is about the size
in circumference of two open hands and bored with a small auger in numerous places
he also carries a whip
a cat o nine tails a large rope of many strands
the strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each
burch says again yah a runaway nigger from georgia
solomon stands with a quiet stoicism
he will say nothing of the kind
as that is the case solomon is seized by both men
he is pulled over the bench face downward shirt still on his back
radburn then steps on his chains holding solomon down in a bent position
with no preamble burch begins to beat solomon about the back with the paddle
burch strikes him wordlessly no taunting no sneering
solomon screaming against each blow
his back immediately swelling with welts and this beating continues on and on and on until quite literally burch wears himself out with the effort
dripping in sweat and panting
yah still insist yah a free man
burch regrets hearing this
not from sympathy but rather because hes nearly too tired to go back to beating solomon
yet as if returning to work burch returns to pummeling solomon
burch punctuates the blows yah a slave
yah a georgia slave
burch continues to strike and strike
this time until the paddle snaps in half
burch then grabs the whip
hardly missing a stroke he whips solomon relentlessly the flails cutting into solomons back
again burchs arm tires before solomon breaks
are yah slave
burch goes back to whipping and whipping and whipping
oozing with blood
finally burch can whip no more
he pours sweat and sucks air leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and exit
radburn lingers for a moment
he takes the irons off solomons legs
opens the window some
as he makes these gestures in a patronizing and confidential manner one wrought with poor sincerity i seen a good many of the black kind just where yahre
make me sick
often times the situation was resolved and i think what was all the beatin and abuse for
things end as they should and the violence was for naught
so why cause trouble when they aint no cause for it
be of a cooperative nature and things dont need be particularly unpleasant
or yah can carry on like yah been and i fear yah wont live to see sunday next
with that thought radburn exits
but to rest seems like giving in to defeat
he begins pulling
on his chains
but for all his struggling the chain loosens none
solomon calls out help me
someone help me
if anyone at all hears him they do not respond
solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance
beginning with a tight shot on the shuttered barred window of burchs dungeon solomons cries barely eking beyond the space the camera pulls back from the building onto the city
until clearly visible is the nations capital
its icons of freedom the white house the capitol building fairly mocking solomons captivity
simultaneously barren at the early hour and cluttered with litter and the remains of previous days procession the city is a bleak and forboding sight
it is day now
the door to the yard is thrown open
the harsh white light floods all over solomon
it is a yard just beyond burchs
the yard is hemmed in by a brick wall
in the yard are two men and a boy
the oldest is clemens ray a man of about years of age
he is well educated
john williams is about years old
he is born and bred a slave is lacking in education and overwhelmed with fear of the situation
finally there is a child about years of age who answers to the name of randall
solomon clemens ray john and randall all stand naked
though they try to cover their privates a bit they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty
radburn is present
he has before him a couple of buckets of cold water
he throws water on the naked men
the men soaking in humility as well as water begin to scrub with a single bar of harsh soap passed among them
the boy too
get him clean
solomon takes some soap and rubs it over randall
git em clean
solomon scrubs harder
randall clearly cold and uncomfortable appeals to solomon
do you know when my mama will come
hush him up
seeing solomon has no answer for him randall begins to cry
is she going to come
doing all he can to spare the child from a certain quiet please
randall is becoming nearly inconsolable
saying anything to keep the boy quiet your mother will come i swear she will but you must be silent
on the seeming strength of solomons promise randall goes silent
solomon looks to radburn who just throws water on the soapy men
radburn brings food in to solomon a shriveled piece of meat and some water
just barely enough to sustain solomon
radburn also has a shirt
that old thing of yours is just rags and tatters
need something proper to wear
solomon doesnt move for the clothing
put it on
with slow defiance solomon does as instructed
he removes what remains of his old shirt the one he was wearing when first kidnapped and puts on the one radburn brought him
the shirts ill fitting and dirty
despite that radburn says there
got no gratitude
yah keep bein proper yahll see how things work out
radburn starts to take the old shirt
it was from my wife
rags and tatters
rags and tatters
taking the shirt the rags and tatters as he calls them radburn exits locking the door behind him
solomon sits with the plate of food before him
he pushes the plate away rather than eat
sitting together out in the yard are clemens ray john and solomon
over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another
at the moment solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation
randall wanders about in the background
as usual he calls out for his mama
by now however his calls should feel like little more than background noise
this cant stand
it is a crime
i believe now someone lay in wait for me
my drink was altered
we are free men
they have no right to hold us
solomon waits for a response from the others
they give none
we need a sympathetic ear
if we have an opportunity to explain our who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear
the two men i journeyed with
im certain theyre making inquires at this very moment
i would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place
they were not kidnappers
they were artists
you know that
you know for certain who they were
the fact is solomon cant say for certain
how i reckon the situation whatever past we had
well thats done now
the reality to come is us being transported southward
new orleans if i were to venture
after we arrive well be put to market
well once in a slave state i suppose theres only one outcome
i dont say that to give you empty agitation john
for yall they aint nothin but that
but john wasn kidnapped
john bein hold as debt thas all
massa pay his debt and john be redeemed boy our masters will not come for us
john is nearly beside himself with panic
johns sorry for yall but thas how it be
where yall goin yah goin witout john
massa take care of me
massa take care
all three men turn and look
at the moment randall doesnt call out emptily
at the door to the yard is burch along with two women
one in her late twenties eliza
she is arrayed in silk with rings upon her fingers and golden ornaments suspended from her ears
though a slave eliza was a mistress and has to this point lived well
this is reflected in her airs and her speech
the other is a little girl light in skin color of about seven or eight
this is emily randalls half sister
as she enters the yard eliza squeals with high delight then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy
clearly this is mother and child being reunited
as burch locks the yard door eliza clutches randall
she is overcome with emotion
my sweet sweet baby
later in the evening
solomon now shares his space with eliza and her children
as the children rest eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to solomon who lends a sympathetic ear
both slyly and with a bit of aggrandizement when i say i had my masters favor you understand
above even his own wife i had it
do you know that he built a house for me
built it on the sole condition that i reside there with him
the added promise in time i would be emancipated
and for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life
displaying the finery she still wears silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us
such was our life and the life of this beautiful girl i bore for him
but master berrys daughter
she always looked at me with an unkind nature
she hated emily no matter she and emily were flesh of flesh
as master berrys health failed she gained power in the household
eventually i was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed
if i had known what waited to be sent south
i swear i would not have come here alive
eliza turns to her children my poor poor babies
its the deep of night all are sleeping
a key turns in the lock and the door opens
burch enters with radburn beside him
both carry lanterns with them
hardly giving solomon and eliza a moment to rouse themselves come on
get yer blankets
sensing that things will not end well no please dont
i dont want to hear yer talk
get in the yard
aint no need for all that
putting hand to randalls head
jus takin a lil trip thas all
dont want to frighten the chilren none over a lil boat ride do yah
eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative
git yerselves up
we now have solomon clemens john eliza and the children
they are being cuffed together
as john is cuffed he pulls back
he beings in johns massa gunna pay his debt
johns massa gunna come for him
not wanting to hear any of this talk burch strikes john several times in the head with a sap like instrument
weakened but again johns massa gunna burch again strikes john until hes quiet
curiously emily and randall dont even flinch
why would they
they are quite used to seeing this kind of violence
not a word out of none a yah
not a word
burch and radburn begin driving the shackled slaves from the yard
the slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and carriage
they are made to lay down side by side
we stay with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them obscuring and blacking out their view
at that moment the screen is blackened and we hear the sound of the cart moving in haste
led by burch the group of slaves arrive to a dock
they are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat orleans as the captain crew and a mulatto woman watch but do not interfere
the slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight
burch comes around and checks the chains makes sure they are all secure and locked
satisfied he heads up out of the hold
alone in the dark in the hold john cries as does eliza
solomon stares down burch for as long as he can as if wishing bad things
as if wanting to exact some measure of revenge
but the greater insult is that burch and radburn engaged in conversation take no notice of solomon whatsoever
he is that insignificant to them
that fact that reality makes solomon boil with a rage he cannot express in words
we are now in the engine room of the steamboat pistons pumping black oily cogs turning the power and the rhythm are both aggressive and hypnotic
a shovel comes into view feeding the furnace
the steamboat is en route between washington and norfolk
we tilt up from the violent water foam to the powering paddles of the boat
down in the hold the slaves eat pray
the mulatto woman moves among them catching elizas eye
cheer up and dont be so cast down
clemens ray and solomon watch as the mulatto woman returns to top deck the trapdoor locked firmly behind her
clemens ray turns to solomon with a deadpan stern expression
if you want to survive do and say as little as possible
tell no one who you really are and tell no one that you can read and write
clemens ray turns away from solomon eyes lost into the distance
unless you want to be a dead nigger
solomons face is one of a confused despair
we see a flat overhead view of the port of norfolk
sardines are laid out to dry in rows glittering in the days sun as if like silver pennies
a chain of slaves enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked vessel
more slaves about in all of various genders and ages are brought on board
chief among them is robert who fights viciously with his captors
with all haste is shoved down into the hold
having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to burch and radburn depart
they do so without a word spoken to solomon or the others
with this new and sizable batch of slaves on board the crew again casts off and the orleans makes its way again
solomon is back cleaning in the galley
as he cleans he again watches robert prep food
roberts skill with a knife is not lost on solomon
the hold is packed tighter now
muzzle covering his face robert is shackled with his hands tied behind his back
solomon and clemens ray look on
a sailor descends the staircase and takes off roberts muzzle shooting him a forbidding look
solomon clemens ray and robert now in mid conversation
i say we fight
robert delivers this in a hushed voice
the crew is fairly small
if it were well planned i believe they could be strong armed
three cant stand against a whole crew
the rest here are niggers born and bred slaves
niggers aint got the stomach for a fight not a damn one
all i know we get where we travelling well wish wed died trying
survival is not about certain death it is about keeping your head down
solomon looks at clemens ray agitated his voice now raised above the previous whispers
grits his teeth
days ago i was with my family in my home
now you tell me all is lost
tell no one who i really am if i want to survive
i dont want to survive i want to live
the steamboat paddles pound the water filling the whole frame
the vessel ploughs on south
the slaves are asleep
a sailor descends the ladder approaching eliza
he bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face
solomon rouses and looks across to witness the scene
from his vantage point we see eliza stand to interrupt the sailor
the sailor looks at eliza eliza looks back at him
knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold
as she does so eliza passes robert who jumps up to stand between eliza and the sailor
stretching out a firm hand to the sailors shoulder roberts look says no you dont
clemens ray is awake now watching
there is an odd moment of stillness between the sailor and robert an impasse
we focus on the sailors face
slowly a greasy smile erupts upon it
back now to roberts face a look of incomprehension
robert looks down
we follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between roberts ribs
the sailor withdraws the bloody blade
a wide shot of the two men
robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes
clemens ray and solomon react
we are back up on the deck of the ship
solomon and clemens ray dump roberts body over the side of the ship
solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the wake of the vessel
then sinks beneath the water
clemens ray with no sentimentality better off
better than us
solomons pov from the back of the steamship of roberts corpse slipping gracefully into the water
a white male fairly smart with broad shoulders stands clemens
we are in the port of new orleans one of the busiest in the young nation
on the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships
its a bit of controlled chaos as a variety of languages are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the orleans to a holding pen
solomon and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them
two men among many are awaiting the arrival of the orleans
they are jonus ray clemens rays master and davis who is the solicitor of mr
they both look like they mean business
the moment the gangplank is laid ray yells for clemens
clemens seeing his master is nearly crazy with delight
he is uncharacteristically beside himself
ironically his master now represents freedom
master ray sir
clemens pulls on his chain
as he does so several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master like dominos
who is in charge of this vessel
i am the captain
i am mr
my solicitor has documentation verifying that the negro named clemens ray is my property
as he reads papers handed to him by davis i know nothing of you are ordered by court to return that property immediately or face charges of thievery
my duty is to transport goods
i am not responsible for their origin
remove these contraptions
to his mate free him
biddee does as ordered
once free clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child
its all well now clemens
you will return home with me
to the captain consider this notice and warning
ray davis and clemens head away
solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from clemens and ray
but there is none forthcoming
ray and clemens continue on clemens not so much as even looking back in solomons direction
solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight
the slaves sit off on one side of the dock baking in the sun awaiting their fate
theophilus freeman a tall thin faced man with light complexion and a little bent moves along the deck calling out names from a list
the slaves stand as they are called
solomon does not respond
freeman looks around
he spots solomon
captain who shipped that nigger
freeman steps to solomon
he gives him a looking over
solomon does as told
you fit the description given
why didnt you answer when called
my name is not platt
my name is freeman strikes solomon hard across the face
your name is platt and i will teach you your name so that you dont forget
to the captain shackle my niggers
get them to my cart
solomon is carted off along with the rest of burchs stock eliza and her children john and solomon
as they move off from the port in a make shift cart it opens up to the frenzic busy port
for the first time solomon sees true and severe slavery
these are not visiting servants such as jasper was back in saratoga
these are humans held in strict bondage herded like cattle chained together as if in a chain gang
slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin
the residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere
blacks almost universally display scars untreated brands and are often missing limbs
blacks are held in all types of shackles from simple chains to elaborate bindings to neck collars that are spiked
some are muzzled or forced to wear bits
one slave is attacked by a dog and the slave owner
the dog pulls and tears at the slaves clothes
these images should be a norm
they should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed but that there is an entire system of oppression in place
burchs stock arrive at freemans slave pen
they are led in by freeman and his house slave cape a mulatto
the yard is enclosed by plank standing upright with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with burchs
including burchs group there are about slaves in the pen
solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces
three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals
one attempts to speak but all that comes out is a muffled unintelligible sound
the slaves are in various states of undress men and women alike
they clean themselves scrubbing with soap and water
women wash their hair
men shave skin is oiled
freeman walks among them inspecting them as they primp themselves
the slaves are given new clothes by cape
the men are given hat coat shirt pants and shoes
frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads
its an odd ironic scene
the slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within freemans house
cape plays a painful tune on a fiddle background music as freeman tries to line up a small group of the slaves he becomes less patient jittery and nervous knowing
that his livelihood is at stake he wants his slaves to make a good impression
sometimes his patience gets the better of him and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves
the business has the air of an etiquette class though what freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more sellable
he works with them in groups of five or so
tallest to smallest understand
are you taller than her
then youd go before her
to the group keep your heads up
a sense of direction thats how you look smart
none of those saucer eyes
rid yourself of that smile
look like a goddamn grinnin monkey
put the least thought in your head
think of somethin
weary of capes playing solomon moves to cape
he asks can you play a reel
i dont know no reel
if i may
cape looks to freeman he sick of your caterwaulin
let him play boy
lets see what he can do
cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to solomon
solomon tunes it a bit then begins to play
his fingers stiff at first he takes a moment to warm up
but as he warms up he is despite the circumstances masterful
the slaves all clap along
some dance along
all admire his work
freeman chief among them
solomon continues to play
a damn sight better than you cape
a damn sight better
cape looks bitter as solomon plays on
we come in on an odd sort of sight a jumble of activity
customers have come to see freemans lot the room all gussied up with flowers
freeman moves among them displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel
freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up look smart as he previously admonished them
they are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies turn them about and ask what skills they possess
the customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth
at times a male or female slave are taken off to the side stripped and inspected more minutely
one of them john is stripped and inspected
cape as hes done previously plays his fiddle
a buyer william ford a man of middle age and an attractive nature in his tone of voice consults a list hes drawn up and asks of freeman what is
the price for the ones platt and eliza
a thousand for platt he is a nigger of talent
seven hundred for eliza
my fairest price
you will accept a note
as always from you mr
eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family
she begs of ford
please dont divide my family
dont take me unless you take my children as well
you will have the most faithful slave in me sir
the most faithful slave that has ever lived but i beg that you do not separate us
a buyer interrupts the skirmish and approaches freeman and delivers coolly eyeing randall your price for the child
you see how fit the boy is
like ripe fruit
he will grow into a fine beast
randall is made to run and jump by freeman exhibiting his activity and his condition
six hundred and thats fair and final
he reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet counting out six hundred dollars placing them into the already extended hand of freeman
ford sees the distress and panic in eliza it visibly touches him
he now tries to buy emily to console her
how much for the little girl
you have no need for her
one so young will bring you no profit
i will not sell the girl
theres heaps n piles of money to be made off her
she is a beauty
one of the regular bloods
none of your thick lipped bullet headed cotton picking niggers
her child man
for gods sake are you not sentimental in the least
my sentimentality stretches the length of a coin
do you want the lot mr
ford or do you pass on them all
i will take the ones platt and eliza
eliza grips her children tight
i will not go without my children
you will not take them from me
as if to prove her wrong freeman puts a foot to eliza and harshly kicks her away from emily
freeman to cape take her out of here
cape drops his fiddle begins to pull eliza away toward the door of the room but her screaming and pleading do not abate
it is clearly unsettling to the other buyers
keep her quiet
cape tries to muzzle her with his hand but eliza continues to scream for her children as emily does for her mother
get the fiddle and play
as ordered solomon takes up capes fiddle and begins to play lightly
solomon plays harder and more loudly
still it is barely enough to drown out elizas cries
freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with solomons playing
emily frees herself and runs back crying but endeavoring to be strong dont cry mama
i will be a good girl
i will keep my head up and i will look smart
i will always look smart
make merry all of you
goddamn it cape
keep her quiet or its your damned hide i will take it out of
cape pulls a rag stuffs it in elizas mouth
clamping both hands over her mouth he hauls eliza from the room by the head
it is an ugly ugly scene
driven in a horse drawn wagon by ford are solomon and eliza
eliza is sullen to say the least
with the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of
they arrive to the ford plantation
the main house of the plantation the great house as they are commonly called is sizable
two stories high with a piazza in front
in the rear are also a log kitchen poultry house corncribs and several slave cabins
the plantation is described as a green spot in the wilderness
with the arrival of master ford there is a flurry of activity the excitement of a new delivery
chapin a white overseer instructs a slave named sam
sam call to the mistress
mistress they arrivn
mistress ford exits the house along with her attending slave rachel who is a cook as well as sams wife and travels to her husband kisses him then laughingly did
you bring all those niggers
two of them
you got two
make me something to eat dear
the day has taken it from me
let me get a look at them
chapin this ones cryin
why is this one cryin
separated from her children
it couldnt be helped
poor poor woman
chapin tomorrow you will take these two up to the mill and start them workin
for now make them
adequate fix them a meal and have them rest themselves
to the slaves cmon now
something to eat and some rest your children will soon enough be forgotten
john tibeats stands before the slaves
chapin hovers to one side
my name is john tibeats william fords chief carpenter
you will refer to me as master
tibeats nods in chapins direction mister chapin is the overseer on this plantation
he is responsible for all of fords property
you too will refer to him as master
this plantation covers many hundreds of acres and you will traverse the texas road between the forest site and the sawmill in double time
any clever nigger on that path that gets a little lightfooted i will remind him that on one side men and bloodhounds patrol the border and on the other the
bayou provides a hard living with alligators and little to eat or drink that wont kill you
no slave has escaped here with his life
youre here to work niggers so lets commence
tibeats begins to sing the song run nigger run mockingly
we cut to solomon chopping logs and into the montage of the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the sawmill
lyrics for run nigger run oh run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you run nigger run well you better get away run nigger run well the pattyroller will
get you run nigger run well you better get away nigger run nigger flew nigger tore his shirt in two run run the pattyroller will get you run nigger run well you better get away nigger run run so fast stoved his head in a hornets nest run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you run nigger run well you better get away nigger run through the field black slick coal and barley heel run nigger run the pattyroller will get you run nigger run well you better get away some folks say a nigger wont steal i caught three in my corn field one has a bushel

run nigger run well you better get away nigger run run so fast stoved his head in a hornets nest run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you run
nigger run well you better get away we are in a wooded area
there is a gang of slaves chopping trees into timber
it is hard laborious work made no more easy by the sweltering heat
solomon is among them as well as sam
the slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon
again hard work done under the ever present sun
as sam drives the wagon the other slaves trudge along side by foot
we should get the sense the travel is long and tedious
it is a sizable work area on the edge of indian creek
there is much work being done the slaves primarily employed in piling the timber and chopping it into lumber
as before there is little doubt about the rigors of the job at hand
working as a carpenter at the work area is john tibeats
there are also various customers who move about placing orders
its sunday morning
all of fords slaves are dressed with their finest clothes brightly colored and as free as possible of defect
the slaves are gathered on
the lawn just beyond the piazza
mistress ford is present as well
as the slaves listen ford reads to them scripture
his tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion
but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god
of isaac and the god of jacob
god is not the god of the dead but of the living
and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine
then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law
jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
despite the lightness with which ford speaks and the hope in his words eliza sits off to the side self secluded we should be able to see in mistress fords
eyes that elizas constant crying is unsettling
the slaves have broken for lunch
they snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds
as they lunch solomon reads from sams bible to the other slaves
but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve
for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth
is not he that sitteth at meat
but i am among you as he that serveth
a white customer winslow irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading scripture crosses over
he grabs the bible
from where did you thieve this
suh the book is my property
the white customer has no interest in sams answer
with flailing hands he starts beating on sam
solomon tries to stop him
that only makes the situation worse solomon now the target of the mans ire
take your hands from me
ford comes running over
what is the commotion
your niggers are either brazen or rebellious
this one was readin scripture and this one claims it to be his
a gift from his mistress
you condone this
i encourage it
as a christian i can do no less
you can do no worse ford
a slave that reads is dangerous
winslow moves off
he yells back at ford and the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers
handing the bible back to sam very matter of factly pay him no mind
the word of god applies to all
in that you may take comfort
sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to fords work area
slaves trudge alongside same as it ever was
its not quite the same
sam brings the wagon to a halt
he and the slaves look up the road ahead of them
standing in the middle of the road is a group of chickasaws indians
they are in their usual dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors buttoned from belt to chin
they have with them dogs and horses
they carry with them the carcass of a deer
the two groups stare at each other for a long moment
the groups of slaves and chickasaws are now intermingled
they break bread actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire
as well the group share a smoke on a pipe
one of the chickasaws is playing a tune on an indian fiddle
the chickasaws perform a customary dance trotting after each other and giving utterance to a guttural sing song noise
the slaves enjoy the respite from work solomon particularly taken by the music
if not entirely enthralled by it
after a bit solomon rights himself and heads from the group
solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river
lowering his trousers solomon squats to defecate
as he does he stares out toward the flowing waters of indian creek
after a few moments as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him solomon stands and replaces his pants
oddly solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed
just beyond the work area solomon speaks with ford as tibeats listens
solomon is drawing in the dirt making rough diagrams for ford as he explains himself
the creek is plenty deep enough to sail even with a boat full of load
the distance from the work area to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land
it occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially materially diminished
if we use the waterway
its a scheme
plenty of engineers have schemed similarly
the passes are too tight
i reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow
wide enough for a tub to traverse
a team of niggers can clear it out
and you know what of transport and terra formin
i labored repairing the champlain canal on the section over which william van nortwick was superintendent
with my earnings i hired several efficient hands to assist me and i entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from lake champlain to troy
ill admit to being impressed even if you wont
collect a gang see what good you can do
we have a series of scenes in which we see solomon and a team of blacks working on the creek chopping trees along the banks widening out the shore
its all just a trial for now
the work is diligent but it is basic to this point
still under solomons direction the slaves go at it like theyve got something to prove
and rightly they do
solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber
once this is constructed he personally sails them up ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks just beyond the work area
all are expectant in their manner
a long moment passes with no sign of solomon
then from up river we see solomons raft of lumber winding its way
slaves cheer and ford literally applauds the effort
tibeats looks pissed
he has just been shown up after all
as we come into the scene ford is presenting solomon with a fiddle
not as grand as the one he previously owned in new york but a fine instrument none the less
it is a gift of thanks for his hard work
solomons gratitude is easily expressed
my great thanks master ford
my thanks to you and it is the least of it
my hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years
following the statement solomons not sure how to react
he remains grateful but the thought of over the years is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself
the slaves eat
all tired from a days work they conduct themselves in silence
all except for eliza who slipping into permanent depression as always weeps
the sound of her sobbing edging him up particularly after master fords over the years observation
solomon goes to her grabs eliza
she does not stop
as if to force the misery from her solomon shakes eliza stop it
its all i have to keeps my loss present
you let yourself be overcome by sorrow
you will drown in it
have you stopped crying for your children
you make no sounds but will you ever let them go in your heart
they are as my flesh
then who is distressed
do i upset the mistress and the master
do you care less for my loss than their well being
master ford is a decent man
he is a slaver
under the circumstances under the circumstances he is a slaver
christian only in his proclamations
separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars
but you truckle at no
you luxuriate in his favor
i will not fall into despair
woeful and crushed melancholy is the yolk i see most
i will offer up my talents to master ford
i will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune
ford is your opportunity
do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest
but he does nothing for you
you are no better than prized livestock
call for him
call tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you
eliza uses solomons name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self
solomon get her meaning
yet he says nothing
again pointedly so youve settled into your role as platt then
my back is thick with scars from
protesting my freedom
do not i accuse you of nothing
i cannot accuse
i too have done so many many dishonorable things to survive
and for all of them i have ended up here
no better than if i had stood up for myself
father lord and savior forgive me
oh solomon let me weep for my children
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
the slaves are again gathered in the rose garden near the front of the house to hear the word of the lord as read by master ford
and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as
little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
the phrase seems to trigger elizas tears
she begins to sob uncontrollably
ford turns to rachel in a hushed whisper i cannot have that kind of depression about
solomon pretending not to have heard slowly turns to eliza with worry
ford continues to preach over elizas keening
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were
drowned in the depth of the sea
woe unto the world because of offences
for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
seasons have passed
it is winter now and very grey out along the bayou
ford and tibeats who we have seen working around the work area stand with solomon tibeats giving solomon an inspection
ford carries much lament
raise yer shirt
solomon does as instructed
tibeats looks at solomons back at the scars from lashings he bears
hes a good carpenter and quick witted
i am familiar with his cleverness
you wont find a nigger more humble
aint found a nigger yet i caint humble
tibeats heads off
solomon highly curious over the preceding
sir have i done something wrong
not your concern platt
i say with much
shame i have compiled debts
i have long preached austerity but find myself hypocritical in that regard
youll be in the ownership of mr
you are his now
serve him as youd serve me
and your faithfulness will not be forgotten
pride and want have been my sin
loss of you is but one of my punishments
we see solomon working as a carpenter helping to erect a weaving house that stands off to the side of the plantations great house
at the moment solomon is nailing on siding
tibeats arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work
make them boards flush
they are sir
they is no such thing
solomon runs his hands over the boards
as smooth to the touch as a yearlings coat
callin me a liar boy
only a matter of perspective sir
from where you stand you may see differently
but the hands are not mistaken
i ask only that you employ all your senses before rendering judgement
whats tibeats to do when faced with fact
all he can do is spew invectives
you are a brute
you are a dog and no better for followin instruction
ill do as ordered sir
then youll be up at daybreak
you will procure a keg of nails from chapin and commence puttin on clapboards
tibeats wheels away
solomon goes back to his work
after a few moments solomon notices a bit of commotion in the drive of the great house
it involves an inconsolable eliza who is being herded by sam onto a cart driven by a white man
mistress ford and rachel watch
solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days as a free man is driven away to a location unknown
it is day break
as ordered solomon is up and working
chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for solomon
if tibeats prefers a different size i will endeavor to furnish them but you may use those until further directed
as the day gets on to mid morning the sun already baking in the sky tibeats makes his way over to solomon
even before arriving to solomon his mien is one of belligerence out of sorts and something less than sober
i thought i told yah ta commence ta puttin on clapboards this morn
i am about it
i have begun on the other side of the house
tibeats walks around to look over solomons work
he is picayune as if purposefully looking for fault
didnt i tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of chapin
and so i did and chapin said he would get another size for you if you wanted them when he came back from the field
tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it
moving toward solomon with a great passion goddamn yah
i thought yah knowed somethin
solomon perhaps inspired by his moment with eliza is in no mood for tibeats
i did as instructed
if theres something wrong then its wrong with your instructions
yah black bastard
yah goddman black bastard
in an inconsolable rage tibeats runs off to the piazza to fetch a whip
solomon looks around
he is alone other than rachel and mistress ford who shocked by that which she witnesses runs out to the field to fetch chapin
solomons instinct is to run but he stands his ground as tibeats marches back whip in hand
strip yer clothes
solomon does no such thing
i will not
with concentrated vengeance tibeats springs for solomon seizing him by the throat with one hand and
raising the whip with the other
before he can strike the blow however solomon catches tibeats by the collar of his coat and pulls him in close
reaching down solomon grabs tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back with the other hand
tibeats tumbles to the ground
a violent struggle takes place as solomon puts a foot to tibeats throat and then in a frenzy of madness snatches the whip from tibeats and begins to strike him
with the handle again and again and again
yew will not live ta see another day nigger
this is yer last i swear it
solomon ignores the threats continues to beat tibeats
blow after blow falling fast and heavy on tibeatss wriggling form
the stiff stock of the whip wraps around tibeatss cringing body until solomons arm aches
tibeatss cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and then pleas for mercy murder
lord god help me
god be merciful
and then suddenly tibeats shrieks papa im sorry
chapin comes riding in from the field fast and hard
solomon strikes tibeats a blow or two more then delivers a well directed kick that sends tibeats rolling over the ground
what is the matter
tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on master tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails
you gave me
whats the matter with the nails
with a mix of shame anger and embarrassment tibeats says as if being exposed theyre
theyre too large
i am overseer here
i told platt to use them and
i shall furnish such nails as i please
do you understand that mr
tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist
this aint done by half
i will have flesh and i will have all of it
tibeats moves off toward and then into the house
a long moment solomon stands alone
he looks around not sure what to do to stay or to flee
anxiety mounts on his features
a moment more and tibeats exits the house
he saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil
or worse to fetch him
chapin comes running back out of the house
he is visibly excited and when he speaks he is quite earnest
though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble
do not stir
do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever
but if you run there is no protecting you
if you run platt there is no protecting you
chapin runs off to join rachel
the two converse at a distance from solomon then they head off for the log kitchen
solomon is now very much alone and he waits for what is to come
and we wait with him
and we wait and we continue to wait
moment by moment the dread of the unexpected mounts
solomons eyes begin to well
he has beaten a white man and he knows that death awaits him
throat but he is too choked up to fully speak it
chapin has now returned to the piazza
he stands and watches but does not move to solomon
solomon waits and waits
we hear the sound of distant hoofs which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder
he returns with two accomplices ramsay and cook
they carry with them large whips and a coil of rope
thas the one
dismounting they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence
solomon tries to fight back but he is strong armed and tied by tibeats his wrists and then ankles bound in the same manner
in the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within solomons elbows running it across his back and tying it firmly
solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree
a lynching is in store
the naked horror of it intensely palpable
solomon looks toward the piazza but chapin is now gone
tears of fear flow down solomons cheeks
he is on the verge of panic a man heading toward his own execution he begins to struggle and fight
a rope goes around solomons neck then is tossed over the branch of the tree
the trio begin to hoist solomon
he gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him
with suddenness chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand colt paterson
caliber holster pistols with barrels
chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob
he is sharp and matter of fact
with the guns in hand he really doesnt need to be much more demonstrative
whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man
i am overseer of this plantation seven years and in the absence of william ford my duty is to protect his interests
ford holds a mortgage on platt of four hundred dollars
if you hang him he loses his debt
until that is canceled you have no claim to his life
directing his attention to ramsay and cook
as for you two if you have any regard for your own safety
i say begone
ramsay and cook dont need to be told twice
the pistols chapins gripping make the situation real clear
without further word they mount their horses and ride away
tibeats remains and his anger with him
yah got no cause
platt is mine and mine ta do with as i please
yah touch my property i will ave yah strung up as well
tibeats mounts up and departs
there is a surreal moment as chapins not sure what to do about solomon
he chooses to do nothing
solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as chapin calls to sam in the sam
get the mule
you must ride to master ford
tell him to come here at once without a single moments delay
tell him they are trying to murder platt
bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so
sam mounts up and rides off the mule demonstrating much speed
hours have passed
the sun is now at its apex
the sight and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was left
the scene is both tranquil and horrific
life on the plantation continues
the other slaves work in the field
children make their way playfully in the yard
it should all underscore the fact that a black hanging even partially from a tree is nothing unusual in this time and space
chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands
clearly he fears tibeats returning with more and better assistance
and yet he does nothing to alleviate solomons suffering
he heeds tibeats words and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute he offers no further aid
solomons head lolls to one side
he looks toward the sun
the bright light flares off the leaves and branches of the tree from which solomon hangs
the glare in solomons eyes offering him more pain than solace but he cannot help but look upward
as he does his eyes flutter between life and lifelessness
solomon continues to hang
by now he is drenched in sweat and nearly delirious with dehydration
his lips dry and parched
he may not die from hanging but he may very well expire before the day is over
eventually rachel comes over timidly and as though she were acting contrary to orders and offers a drink of water from a tin cup pouring it in solomons mouth for
she then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the water which clings to his lips
rachel then retreats and leaves solomon to hang
the sun is just now arching for the horizon
solomon remains as though his torture will not end
ford trailed by sam finally comes riding up
he dismounts and moves swiftly over to solomon
with great heartache platt
my poor platt
ford produces a blade and cuts solomon loose
solomon attempts to carry himself but he cannot
he falls to the ground and passes out
as we come into the scene solomon lays on a blanket on the floor
eventually his eyes flutter then open
he is in the foyer of the ford house
as he gets his bearings he looks around the interior
the space is handsome and well decorated
it is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings shacks and dungeons solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery
it will be the first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted during his twelve years of bondage
solomon doesnt have much chance to luxuriate in his surroundings
he hears a dog barking just outside and is unnerved
has tibeats returned to finish what he started
from a study master ford appears with a gun in hand
he goes to the door opens it and looks outside
he can see nothing
satisfied ford crosses back over to solomon
he is frank with solomon regarding the situation
i believe tibeats is skulkin about the premises somewhere
he wants you dead and he will attempt to have you so
its no longer safe for you here
and i dont believe you will remain passive if tibeats attacks
i have transferred my debt to edwin epps
he will take charge of you
desperate urgent master ford you must know i am not a slave
i cannot hear that
before i came to you i was a freeman
i am trying to save your life
i have a debt to be mindful of
that now is to edwin epps
he is a hard man
prides himself on being a nigger breaker
but truthfully i could find no others who would have you
youve made a reputation of yourself
whatever your circumstances you are an exceptional nigger platt
i fear no good will come of it
from the back porch we come into the scene on edwin epps a repulsive and coarse man
his language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education
epps reads the bible to his slaves eight of them altogether
abram a tall older slave of about sixty years
wiley who is forty eight
phebe who is married to wiley
bob and henry who are phebes children edward and patsey
patsey is young just years old
though in the era not as young as in the present day
she is the offspring of a guinea nigger brought over to cuba in a slave ship
she nearly brims with unconversant sexuality
mistress epps eppss wife is also present
she sits with holds quite lovingly some slave children
with them she is very motherly
we also see eppss overseer treach
treach constantly sports a loaded pistol
though epps reads the word of the lord he lacks the tone of compassion with which ford read
and that servant which knew his lords will
which knew his lords will and prepared not himself
prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes
dye hear that
that nigger that dont take care that dont obey his lord thats his master dye see
that ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes
now many signifies a great many
forty a hundred a hundred and fifty lashes
picking cotton ferociously
as we move out we identify patsey a year old striking black woman
the camera moves out again to a wider shot
this reveals several lines of slaves picking cotton with patsey way out in the lead
we cut to another pair of black hands
this time revealing solomon clumsy and unskilled hands picking cotton
a lash bears down on him
it is august cotton picking season
we are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom
it presents a visual purity like an immaculate expanse of light new fallen snow
the cotton grows from five to seven feet high each stalk having a great many branches
shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow
there is a slave to each side of the row
they have a sack around their necks that hangs to the ground the mouth of the sack about breast high
baskets are placed at the end of the furrows
slaves dump their sacks of cotton in the baskets then pick until their sacks are again filled
pick that cotton
move along now
heat and a spiritual sung by the slaves
despite the heat there is no stopping for water
the slaves are driven by edward who is himself driven by treach
drive dem niggers
edward moves among the slaves applying the whip to them without regard
pick dat cotton
move along now hear
the days work is done
the slaves are now assembled in the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are being weighed by treach
there is anxiety among the slave the reason for which soon becomes apparent
two hundred forty pounds for bob
what yah got for james
two hundred ninety five pounds
thas real good boy
thas real good
one hundred eighty two pounds for platt
epps does not look happy
treach says again
one hundred eighty two
how much can even an average nigger pick a day
two hundred pounds
this nigger aint even average
epps pulls solomon aside
five hundred twelve pounds for patsey
five hundred twelve
yah men folk got no shame lettin patsey out pick yah
the day aint yet come she swung lower than five hundred pounds
queen of the fields she is
two hundred six pou i aint done treach
aint i owed a minute to luxuriate on the work patsey done
born and bred to the field
a nigger among niggers and god give er to me
a lesson in the rewards of righteous livin
all be observant ta that
one hundred thirty eight pounds for phebe
hit one forty five yesterday
pull her out
two hundred six pounds for wiley
how much he pick yesterday
two hundred twenty nine pounds
wiley is pulled from the line huddled with solomon
in the distance a flogging is going on
solomon phebe and wiley are stripped placed in a stockade and now being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by another evening but the day is not yet done
slaves attend their various evening chores feeding livestock doing laundry cooking food
there is no respite from a slaves charge
a fire is kindled in the cabin
the slaves finally fix their own dinner of corn meal
corn is ground in a small hand mill
the corn meal is mixed with a little water placed in the fire and baked
when it is done brown the ashes are scraped off
bacon is fried
as the slaves eat abram goes on in great length and with much emotion about general jackson
hold my words general jackson will forever be immortalized
his bravery will be handed down to the last posterity
if ever there be a stain upon raw militia he done wiped away on the eight of january
i say da result a that days battle is of mo importance to our grand nation than any occurrence fo or since
great man in deed
we all need pray to heavenly father da general reign over us always
the slaves are sleeping
there is a loud commotion
epps enters drunkenly forcing the slaves awake
get up we dance tonight
we will not waste the evenin with yer laziness
despite the lateness of the hour the slaves are up and now fully dressed
they take up position in the middle of the floor
they wait poised like actors
solomon strikes up a tune henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance
they do so very wearily
the whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure
epps whip in hand wheres yah merriment
move yer feet
as the slaves twirl about epps keeps an attentive eye on patsey
it should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view patsey twirl about the floor
this fact is not lost on mistress epps
a few moments of eppss lust on display is all that the mistress can bear
jealousy mounting she snatches up a carafe
with all her might she throws it at patsey
it hits patsey square in the face
too thick to shatter it leaves her bloody and writhing on the floor
the dancing the music stop
the slaves however react as though it is not the first time theyve seen as much from the mistress
mistress epps screaming like a hellion sell her
you will sell the negress
youre talkin foolish
sell little pats
she pick with more vigor than any other nigger
choose another ta go
i will not
you will remove that black bitch from this property er ill take myself back to cheneyville
back to that hogs trough where i found you
oh the idleness of that yarn washes over me
do not set yourself up against patsey my dear
thats a wager on which you will not profit
and settle for my affection cause my affection you got
cause i will rid myself of yah well before i do away with her
mistress epps stands irate lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do
eventually optionless she storms away
for a few beats there is only the sound of patsey sobbing
that damned woman
i wont have my mood spoiled
i will not
epps sends the whip in solomons direction
solomon responds by playing
treach literally drags the prone patsey from the floor blood still spilling from her face
the slaves as ordered return to dancing
the sun has only just risen above the horizon
from the great house the horn is blown signaling the start of another day
slaves are in the field picking cotton
they accompany their work with a spiritual
as the slaves make their way in from the field the mistress calls to solomon
she has a piece of paper in
can you find your way to bartholomews
i can maam
handing solomon a sheet of paper
this is a list of goods and sundries
you will take it to be filled and return immediately
tell bartholomew to add it to our debt
i will mistress
solomon looks at the list
in a careless moment solomon reads quietly from it
he catches himself but not before the mistress notes his action
with high where yah from platt
i have told you
tell me again
who were yah master
master name of freeman
was he a learned man
i suppose so
he learn yah ta read
a word here or there but i have no understanding of the written text
dont trouble yer self with it
same as the rest master bought yah to work
and any morell earn yah a hunred lashes
having delivered her cool advice mistress heads back into the house
solomon walks along a well worn path shopping bag draped over one shoulder
we see his feet
as the walk slowly gathers pace solomon suddenly turns left into dense foliage
his tread is now a full blown sprint trees flash past as solomon attacks his way through the woods
the sound of branches cracking underneath
his feet heartbeat and breath almost deafening
he is desperate
the violence of his advance abruptly stops there is silence
we see in a clearance a posse of patrollers preparing for a lynching of two young men
solomons eyes meet theirs
the two men look back at solomon with a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose around their neck
suddenly the bloodhounds start barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of solomon
solomons whole body shakes with anticipation
boy where are you going
almost tripping over to the store sir to bartholomews
i was sent there by mistress epps
the patroller reaches out for solomons free pass around his neck yanking him forward
he looks at it
get there and get there quick
the patroller kicks solomon hard sending him on his way
solomon walks on looking one more time at the two young men again there is a moment of connection
the two men are hoisted up kicking and spitting behind his shoulder
solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards bartholomews his face now full of shock and trepidation
he walks fighting to calm himself down
we move behind him as he continues his journey a lonely figure
a general store in the township of holmesville
solomon stands at the counter as bartholomew fills mistress eppss order
among the items set before solomon is a the items are collected for solomon and placed in a sack
solomon giving little thought to them other than getting them back to the mistress
as he turns he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints of all different guises chains muzzles for sale
solomon returns and delivers the items to the mistress
sitting on the grand houses piazza patsey is having tea with mistress harriet shaw who is a black woman
though once a slave she is now comparatively refined though not wholly so
the table where they sit is adorned with white linens and they are attended by a house nigger
it makes for a tranquil surreal scene
solomon is running flat out along the road
running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner
still running slick with sweat solomon comes upon the as solomon arrives platt epps good sunday morning
good morning master shaw
ive been sent by master to retrieve patsey
may i approach
solomon makes his way over to the piazza
excuse me mistress shaw
patsey master wishes you to return
is free ta roam
but the master sent me running to fetch you and said no time should be wasted
thank you mistress but i dont dare
would you knowed massa eppss consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return
sit and drink the tea that offered
solomon knows better but he sits and the mistress has tea poured for him
whatn was eppss concern
id rather not say
lil gossip on the sabbath be fine
all things in moderation
solomon is not sure what to say
he struggles to be as diplomatic as possible
as you are aware master epps can be a man of a hard countenance
there are times when it is impossible to account for his logic
you know he has ill feelings toward your husband
master epps has somehow come to believe as incorrectly as it may be that master shaw is
that he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man
a misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters no doubt
if not born outta truth itself
the mistress waves to shaw
shaw unsuspecting of the conversation waves back
im certain patseys well being is master eppss only concern
nothin epps desire come outta concern
i meant no disrespect
he aint heard you
i meant no disrespect to you mistress
you worry for me
got no cause to worry for my sensibilities
i aint felt the end of a lash in mo years than i cain recall
aint worked a field neither
where one time i served now i got others servin me
the cost to my current existence be massa shaw broadcasting his affections n me enjoyin his pantomime of fidelity
if that what keep me from the cotton pickin niggers that what it be
a small and reasonable price to be paid fo sure
looking toward patsey speaking with great empathy i knowed what it like to be the object of massas predilections and peculiarities
and i knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence
a lusty visit in the night or a visitation from the whip
and wit my experience ifn i can give comfort then comfort i give
and you take comfort patsey the good lord will manage epps
in his own time the good lord will manage dem all
yes lordy theres a day comin that will burn as an oven
it comin as sure as the lord is just
when his will be done
the curse on the pharos is a poor example of all that wait fo the plantation class
mistress shaw turns her head to the side catching a slaves attention
as she does so the slave a young woman commences to pour tea
as if to punctuate her thought the mistress takes a sip of her tea
solomon and patsey are returning from shaws
waiting on the porch of the great house a drunk epps beckons for patsey his lewd intentions obvious
do not look in his direction
epps does not care to be ignored
he lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage
solomon moves between epps and patsey cutting epps off as patsey continues on
playing up his ignorance of found her master and brought her back just as instructed
whatd you jus now tell her
whatd you say to pats
no words were spoken
none of consequence
saw you talkin with er
i cannot speak of what did not occur
epps grabs solomon
ill cut your black throat
solomon pulls away from epps ripping his shirt in the process
epps gives chase
solomon begins to run around the large pig sty easily keeping his distance
epps however is undeterred
he moves after solomon as speedily as he can which isnt very speedily at all
and quickly he tires
epps is forced to bend over and suck air
solomon maintains his distance barely breathing hard
his breath returned to him epps starts up the chase again
solomon runs on out of reach
shortly epps again stops gets his breath
and now in what should be quite comical epps again runs after solomon
again eppss vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave
dropping down to the dirt in a show of regret and piety
platt liquor filled me
i admit that it did and i done over reacted
its the lords day
aint nothin christian in us carryin on like this
help me ta my feet and let us both pray to the lord for forgiveness
epps extends a hand to solomon
cautiously solomon moves close but not too close
as solomon draws within striking distance epps lunges for him
he chases solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down
and again offering a treaty im all done in platt
i have met my limitations and i aint equal to em
i concede to yah but in the name of valor help yer master to his feet
solomon cautiously moves closer to help
again he is attacked by epps this time by knife
epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade and chased far around the field by epps
all of the mistress epps comes running from the house to the pair
whas the fuss
a misunderstanding is all
it began when i was sent to retrieve patsey from where shed taken sabbatical at master shaws
upon returning master epps believed patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not
i tried to explain but it lead to all this
what is it
ya caint remain the sabbath without her under your eye
ya are a no account bastard
hold a moment
a filthy godless heathen
my bed is too holy for yah ta share
whas he been tellin yah
of yer misbegotten ways
and he would know what of anythin
i aint even spoken with him today
platt yah lyin nigger have i
discretion being the better part and all solomon remains silent
there theres all the truth he got
epps pushes his way past the mistress
with the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton
as before they sing a spiritual the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand
but there is no distracting from the heat
we see henry begin to falter before it
and eventually collapse right in the dirt
though the other slaves take note none move to help him
from treach rather matter of factly get him water
edward runs to fetch a gourd
he carries it to henry roused henry rights himself
unsteadily henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton
he joins in again with the spiritual as if the song is all that can keep him going
the slaves are asleep
epps arrives again without knocking with his whip in hand
the slaves stir
uncle we dance tonight massa
epps remains quietly focused on patsey
and its clear from her apprehensive expression just what it is hes come looking for
this time there is no escaping it
as if to acknowledge the badness to come phebe lightly cries
on top of a wood pile in the back of the smoke house epps shoves patsey
he stops stands as if gathering his manhood then hes all over patsey
he is rough and clumsy
it looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter
patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from epps but otherwise remain as still as possible
if there is such a thing she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness
eppss frustration mounts until as the mistress shaw had cautioned he crosses the line from passion to violence
he begins slapping patsey to get a response from her
when that fails he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing patsey mercilessly
still she gives him nothing
beaten patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton epps deep breathing above her
the desire for sex now having left him
epps heads from the field
patsey is left where she is
as before solomon waits as bartholomew fills mistress epps order
among the items set before solomon is another quantity of foolscap
solomon is making his way back to the epps plantation
he carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the store
as he walks solomon looks around casually
when he is certain he is alone he sets down the sack opens it and appropriates a single sheet of the paper which he folds and places in his pocket
that done he cinches up the sack and continues on his way
solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle
perhaps the safest place he can think of
he acts as though hes hiding away found gold
in reality its more than that
for solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom
its another night of eppss forced revelry
coming in quick from the previous scene we go from solomon holding his fiddle to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance
mistress epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries
she sets them down on a table
a moment from the dancing
come sample what i baked for yall
the slaves thankful for the rest as much as the food file toward the tray reciting a chorus of thank you mistress
as patsey moves toward the pastries therell be none for you patsey
patsey merely turns away
her non responsiveness however serves only to incite the mistress
screaming yah see that
did yah see the look of insolence she give me
seen nothin but her turn away
are you blind or ignorant
it was hot hateful scorn
it filled that black face
yah tell me yah didn see it then yah choose not to look or yah sayin i lie
whatever it was it passed
is that how yah are with the niggers
let every ill thought fester inside em
look at em
they foul with it foul with their hate
you let it be itll come back to us in the dark a night
yah want that
yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep
epps isnt sure how to respond to the inchoate berating
its an invitation for the mistress to continue
you are manless
a damned eunuch if ever there was
and if yah wont stand for me id pray youd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from em
epps does nothing
the mistress lets her anger loose
she moves quickly to patsey drives her nails into the the moment marked with appropriate screams
patsey collapses on the floor covering her bleeding face
beat it from em
thoroughly cuckolded by the mistresss actions epps takes his whip and pulls patsey out of the house
his intentions are plain
all the slaves remain silent
the mistress however displaying high satisfaction entreats the others eat
and then we dance
the slaves eat but without a hint of levity
we come up on the slaves who lay sleeping
all except for patsey
she rises from her bedding goes to a corner of the cabin and removes something from a secretive location
she then moves over to platt
platt you awake
i have a request an act of kindness
patsey displays what she took from hiding
it is a i secreted it from the mistress
it yours platt
for what cause
all i ask end my life
take my body to the margin of the swamp solomon looks at patsey as though she were insane
take me by the throat
hold me low in the water until is still n without life
bury me in a lonely place of dyin
i will do no such thing
the gory detail with which i thought on it long and hard
it is melancholia nothing more
how does such despair even come to you
how can you not know
i got no comfort in this life
if i caint buy mercy from yah ill beg it
there are others
im begging you
why would you consign me to damnation with such an un godly request
there is god here
god is merciful and he forgive merciful acts
wont be no hell for you
do what i aint got the strength ta do myself
solomon says nothing
clearly hes not about to do the deed
with nothing else to do knowing she is damned with every breath she draws patsey crawls back to her spot on the floor and lays herself down
hard times on the planation
where previously the field in bloom was a carpet of white it is now patchy and under grown
the slaves move through the field picking not cotton but rather cotton worms from the plants
the cotton worms have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop
we see the cotton worms in extreme close up moving among and destroying the cotton crop
epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined field
it is a plague
its damn biblical
two season god done sent a plague to smite me
i am near ruination
what i done that god hate me so
do i not preach his word
the whole bayou sufferin
i dont care nothin fer the damn bayou
epps looks among his slaves at work his enmity growing
its that godless lot
they brought this on me
i bring em
gods word and heathens they are they brung me gods scorn
crazed epps runs into the field taking himself from slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay his hands on
damn you all
henry bob uncle abram and solomon sit in the back of a cart
solomon has his fiddle with him
epps has delivered the men to judge turner a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on bayou salle within a few miles of the gulf
epps and turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as henry bob uncle abram and solomon wait and watch
one of the slaves whisper under their breath
i hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton
but at least well be away from master epps
boy you two have no sense
epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting salutation
yer judge turners for the season
more if need be until my crop return
yahll bring no disrespect to me and yahll bring no biblical plagues to him
be decent ere mark my words i will deliver an ungodly whippin
slaves are crammed into the shack literally on top of each other as they try to sleep
some lay some sit up
packed in like cattle there is barely room to move let alone draw a deep clean breath
there is a real risk of suffocating in the mass
some cough and wheeze
among them is solomon who must believe at this point that his life has reached its very lowest point
the odds of survival are slight let alone the chance of actually ever returning to his family
this clearly weighs on him as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space in the pen
an overseer is explaining to the new slaves solomon among them how to cultivate cane
with a knife in hand he demonstrates the process draw the cane from the rick cut the top and flags from the stalk understand
leave only that part which is sound and healthy
cast off the rest
about thirty slaves are working the field
they are divided into three gangs
the first which draw the cane the next lay the cane in the drill the last then hoe the rows after
solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts and he moves with speed and skill
certainly more so than he displayed picking cotton
standing with his overseer judge turner watches
again the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together
as he tries to rest sleep is nearly impossible solomon finds himself face to face with a woman anna
she is awake
for a few beats she avoids eye contact with solomon
she seems like solomon to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them
eventually her eyes meet solomons
she makes no sound but great apprehension spills from her eyes
whatevers next whatever horror awaits she can barely stand to face
they drive her hand to solomons
after a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact the woman takes
solomons hand and presses it to her breast
solomon tries to jerk his hand away but anna holds it in place
manipulating solomons hand she begins to massage her breast
solomon takes no real pleasure in the act really neither does anna
there should be a true sense the need quickly compounds
anna presses her lips to solomons
eventually she directs his hand beneath her dress and between her legs
solomon with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages begins to manipulate anna with his hand
the act remains more perfunctory than passionate
we can see anna moving toward climax and eventual release
but more or substantially less than joyous sex it is really just a drug like inoculation against reality
but the feeling quickly fades
all that remains as with most chance encounters is regret
and there is shame too
this is put on display as anna turns away from solomon
as quickly as it began it is as though the act had not happened at all
solomon waits outside the house on the porch
a house servant zachary approaches and admonishes solomon
off the porch
like a dog shooed away solomon steps down
eventually judge turner exits the house and crosses to solomon
platt is it
have you cultivated cane previously
no sir i have not
you take to it quite naturally
are you educated
niggers are hired to work not to read and write
turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives solomon a wary looking over
you play the fiddle
willard yarney a planter up the bayou celebrates his anniversary in a three weeks time
i will hold out your name to him
what you earn is yours to keep
mind yourself platt
work over the slaves congregate to eat
as solomon eats he takes note of the juice from some solomon plays with a piece of cane fashions it into some kind of writing tool testing it in the
he then brushes over the dirt with his hand
secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting by a small fire solomon takes the slip of paper from his fiddle
it is yellowed showing age but still usable
dipping the piece of cane a quill into the crushed berries solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper
the berry juice too free flowing is unusable as ink
solomon returns the paper to the fiddle
he has some scraps of food with him which he snacks on
we see a sharp object scratching onto a surface
the tool moves on to form another mark
the sound is repetitive and almost unbearable
as we move out we see the names anne margaret alonzo
they are engraved onto the violin in the hidden area where solomon would rest his chin
solomon looks at it for a moment moving his fingertips across the engraving
his face full of loss
sadly he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning his head to the side as if to play
a party has commenced at the noble home of one mr
a group of revelers have gathered and are on the dance floor in fancy dress
their faces are covered with a variation of decorative masks
the party is a feast of celebration
as entertainment solomon accompanies a group of musicians no more than three
and as he does so they all play with jovial liveliness
clearly a good time is being had by all
his playing done for the evening solomon is returning to judge turners on foot
there is only the moonlight with which to light the way
as he walks solomon eats from a hearty chuck of bread
obviously part of his haul from the evening
solomon again hears noises coming from the brush just up ahead of him
solomon tears off some of the bread kneels and holds it out before him
this time there is no dog
instead from the dark and the brush step two black men
he looks the men over their clothes tatters and they themselves covered in dirt
it becomes quite clear they are not just slaves
a fact confirmed when they step menacingly toward solomon one with a shiv in hand
at first it seems they want solomons food or money
worse they go for his fiddle
solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is attacked taking a cut to the arm
solomon fights back picking up a pine knot and striking his attacker over the head
that takes the fight out of him and both men retreat back the way they came leaving solomon be
outside of the slave shacks solomons wound tended by uncle abram
as he works on it runaways i would expect
the bayou full with em
they nothin mo dangerous than a nigger in flight
they acted out of desperation
act outta lunacy
heads fulla stories bout life up north
yah ever been north platt
and never should yah be
i hope that yah never bear witness the sorry condition of the northern black
got neither no purpose nor direction
they jus fall about the streets in search of sustenance of both body and spirit
you know this to be so
two of my massas tolt me
alone out on the edge of the bayou solomon is playing a low air on his violin while snacking on scraps of bacon
as he plays something appears in the distance
from the edge of the bayou coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth is celeste
she is a young woman of about years of age and far whiter than most blacks
feature the slightest trace of african blood
beyond that she is pale and haggard but still lovely
dressed in a white gown she emerges from the water
draped on her dress her period
a line in her skirt
its very visible but not shocking
a ribbon of red in her dress
celeste moves to solomon without fear or hesitation
as solomon startled takes her in celeste says quite i am hungry
give me food
who are you
solomon gives celeste some of his food
celeste famished devours it
what is your name
my name is celeste
what are your circumstances
i belong ta massa carey and ave been two days among da palmettoes
celeste is sick and caint work and would rather die in the swamp
than be whipped to death by the overseer
so i took myself away
massas dogs wont follow me
the patrollers ave tried to set dem on me
but dey a secret between dem and celeste and dey wont mind the devilish orders of the overseer
celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws
do you believe me
there are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow
give me more food
this is all my allowance for the give it to me
almost as if compelled solomon does as ordered
as she eats celeste aggrandizes herself most slaves escape at night
the overseers are alert for such chicanes
but celeste tricked dem n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest
the place of my concealment now deep in the swamp not half a mile from massas plantation and a world apart
a world a tall trees whose long arms make fo a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun
it twilight always in celestes world even in the brightest day
i will live there and i will live freely
the overseers are a cowardly lot
dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night
others will join me in the twilight and we aint gunna be slaves no mo forever
solomon isnt sure what to say
before he can say celeste will come to you again in the night
you will have food for her
celeste departs the way she came as though she were a vision
solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed
dried and smoked meats are hung and milled corn is about
taking out a handkerchief solomon begins to load it with food
not too much
not so much his thievery will be readily noticed but he does avail himself
solomon plays his violin but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits
then as before a figure appears in the distance
it is celeste coming out of the night
she makes her way directly to solomon
with no greeting she says i am hungry
solomon gives celeste the handkerchief hes filled
she opens it and begins to devour the food
as she eats i was rude and didnt even ask yo name
solomon is my true and free name
was you free
solomon exposes his wrist displays his tattoo as he i remain free in my heart
giving a laugh as though its the silliest thing shes free heart means nothin ifn yo body gunna die a slave
i will not
celeste knows you aint gunna run
celeste knows it aint your nature
i have a plan
i have a letter
howll yah mail da letter
who yah trust to post it
a nigger that can read and write is a nigger thatll hang
there is a pause
solomon cant answer this question
it is the glaring hole in his plan
having finished eating
celeste will come again in de night
you will bring her mo food
i risk discovery to take more
you will bring celeste mo food
and with that celeste again moves back into the darkness
solomon is picking at the bark off a white maple
in a tin cup over a fire solomon boils the white maple bark in just a bit of water
as others sleep by the light of dying coals solomon uses the quill to test the boiled bark
the liquid holds as a form of ink
it is no
t ideal but it is legible on the page
armed with this solomon writes his letter
solomon sits with celeste
he relates his news to her
i have my letter
yah has your freedom then
all that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office
when celeste speaks she is quite melancholy
i have resolved to return to my massa
solomon gives an unnerved look
this is not good news
is it more food you need
i live in fear
none will come after you in the swamps
it aint the patrollers i scared of
at all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps
at first their calls were welcomin
dey too was free n i thought dey greeted me like a sistah
lately dey cries have turned horrifyin
they mean to kill celeste
the solitude plays tricks
its your impression nothing more
if you go back to your master you could face the same
my freedom been nothin but a daydream
so was celestes thoughts of slaves conjoinin in the bayou
better the loneliness
you have been free most of the summer
return now and your master will make example of you
it is lonely dwellin waiting for others who wont never come
make your way by night
itll only be worse ifn celeste dont go back of her own will
you wont be caught
the dogs wont track you
you are unique
you got alternatives solomon
to return is to die
celeste got no one to write a letter to
as if to punctuate her resolve without a word more celeste departs toward the swamp
solomon starts on into the swamp after her
solomon continues after celeste wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters
celeste i will guide you north
wait and i will take you
celeste is too nimble
she outpaces solomon continues on and disappears into the night
let me take you
let me go with you
solomon runs on then splashes to a stop
he stumbles around disoriented calling into the blackness celeste
not a human one
there are sounds and echoes some in the distance some perhaps moving closer which moment by moment become more and more frightening
soon solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head the water first chest deep then neck deep
with no way to orient himself no means to guide him in the dark solomons reserve begins to crumble
he thrashes in the water trying to find his way
back to shore
no longer trying to save celeste solomon calls to her desperately for assistance
come to me celeste
in that moment solomon is quite certain he is nearly done that he will not find land nor aid and that this is his final moment
his panic should be that tangible
it is either force of will or survival instinct
or maybe just pure luck that carries solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground then firm footing
hauling himself onto the swamps edge solomon finally collapses in a drenched worn heap
his life spared but celeste never to be seen again
we come up now outside of master eppss plantation
epps stands in the drive
hes in surprisingly good spirits as solomon uncle abram henry and bob trudge their way wearily toward epps and his other slaves who are gathered
the cotton field is in full bloom the crop fully returned
a joyous day
a joyous day
dark times is behind us
clean livin n prayer done lifted the plague
indicating to the cotton as thick n white as new england snow
n now my niggers is returned to me
heard judge turner gave you favor
oh did you beguile him platt with your slick nigger ways
well yah wont stand idle boy
not on my land
much work to do
days of old long since eh
throughout eppss welcome solomons focus is on patsey who is lined up with the other slaves
she is now more haggard than when we last saw her
her face and arms display many new scars
its clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for epps and the mistress
the slaves are out working on the field
white hands appear picking cotton armsby
he is wholly unskilled at picking cotton and he puts little effort into the job
as we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short on self motivation
in anachronistic terminology hed be called a slacker
he joins in with the slaves singing a spiritual
as epps said it is days of long since
the slaves are back to having their cotton weighed in the gin house wiley
two hundred sixty pounds
three hundred forty pounds for bob
five hundred twenty pounds
thas a girl
dont never let me down
one hundred sixty pounds
before treach is even done announcing the weight epps has pulled solomon aside to where uncle abram already awaits his fate
sixty four pounds
epps speaks to armsby sternly but nothing of the manner in which he would address the slaves
a good days labor would average two hundred pounds
im sure in time yll develope as a picker but it takes effort boy
put some damn effort into it
to treach regarding solomon and abram take em out
get to whippin
no force is needed
the slaves understand the situation
they follow treach out of the gin house
we come in after the punishment has been dealt
patsey tends to uncle abrams back as armsby applies liniments to solomons
as he does armsby muses its a tragedy
how does such come to pass
working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand
im of a damn sight better station
and my desires never lacked for a grandiose component though i will admit they have at times been short on ingenuity
but only at times
ive worked as an overseer you know
i did not sir
not owed more than any other in the field
i worked plantations from virginia down into alabama
i could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so
but to toil in the field
never thought that would come to pass
but times are desperate
where once i had said no to epps and his merger offerings i returned cap
look at what ive become
how did you arrive at such a place if i may ask
its just conversation
from a pocket armsby produces a flask
i became a little too dependant on the whisky a little too undependable on the job
before you say im just a sorry drunkard let me state my case as reliable employment as overseeing is its no easy chore on the spirit
i say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in and day out without shredding at his own self
takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected
or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations
well i trampled
armsby takes a drink
and with frequency
where is your place of birth
have you traveled there
i cannot say that i have
more seasonal than the bayou
a deal less humid
why did you leave it
to make my fortune of course
i gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity that were the lore of the southern states all thats needed being a patch of land and a few good growing
and then locating a proper bank in which to store your riches
but such profitable outcomes are reserved for the plantation masters
its the lot of the rest of us to serve
so i settled on being an overseer and failed as well at that
in the meantime my dreams gave way to reality
now i want nothing more than to earn a decent wage
and get myself home
armsby takes another drink and leans back
we again hear the sound of the horn blowing signaling the start of the work day for the slave
with the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton
as before they sing a spiritual the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand
but there is no distracting from the heat
we see uncle abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the ground
treach calls to edward get him water
edward runs to fetch water which he carries to abram and at this point the sounds of the singing from the others tapers off as they realize abram isnt getting
we are beyond the main of the plantation the cotton field in the background
we are at the slaves cemetery a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground
solomon bob and henry now much visually older than when we first saw them are digging a grave in the dirt
the uncovered body of abram lays near
having dug down an appropriate distance the three men take the body and very unceremoniously place it into the ground
the shovel in his hands and resting it by his feet bob tilts his head down and closes his eyes
the others do the same
almost stutteringly not really knowing what to i just want to say something about uncle abram
he was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little
god bless him
god love him
and god keep him
that done they begin to cover it with dirt
it is all the more of a funeral that abram will receive
a female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo went down to the river jordan
a response of oh yeah quickly follows
again the singer continues where john baptized three
the same faces we have seen on epps plantation but now filled with rapture appear
its as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence
it seems to transcend and translate in a strange way joy
a joy which has un yet been seen on screen
a joy which has been hidden but a joy which is undoubtedly there
its captivating infectious
this should be a moving part of the film which stirs the audience and for a moment relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment
the singer continues well some say john was a baptist some say john was a jew but i say john was a preacher because the bible says so too preach
and with that the rest of the congregation chant i believe
oh i believe
solomon goes to retrieve the small package from under a rock at the base of a tree
solomon returns the letter to hiding
he takes the money with him and cautiously moves from the area
the door opens
armsby is surprised to see him
so much so he isnt sure what greeting to give
solomon gives a blunt introduction
re the the proceeds of my fiddling performances
a few picayunes but all i have in the world
i promise them to you if you will do me the favor i require
but i beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request
what do you ask
first your word sir
on my honor
it is a simple enough request
i ask only that you deposit a letter in the marksville post office
and that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever
the details of the letter are of no consequence
even at that there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known i was the author
a patron is what i require sir
wheres the letter now
it is not yet written
i will have it in a day
two at most my skill with composition as poor as it is
armsby considers the request
i will do it
and will accept whatever payment is offered
in the moment hes not so sure he can wholly give himself over to trust
to assist you i put my own self at risk
i will do so but fair compensation is all i ask
solomon hands over the money
draw up your letter
we will meet again
in two days
in two days
solomon and the slaves pick cotton
armsby is conspicuously not laboring in the field
as solomon works he is watched by epps
watched more than he normally is
for a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective solomons unease over his actions
but soon epps is joined by armsby
the two men stand and talk their looks locked toward solomon
whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long long moment
but epps makes no move toward solomon
solomon continues with his work
the slaves are at rest
gripping his whip epps enters without so much as a knock at the door
for a moment theres curiosity is he there for a dance for patsey
looking right to solomon get up
epps heads back out into the dark
he says nothing but his directive is clear follow me
solomon comes out into the dark
nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter epps
despite the lack of light eppss malevolence is quite clear
his whip attached to his hip
as he speaks he stokes himself with swigs from a flask
epps puts his arm around solomon as if consoling a friend and guides him into the woods
i understand ive got a larned nigger that writes
letters and tries to get white fellows to mail em
solomon hardly missing a beat plays this off
well armsby tol me today the devil was among my niggers
that i had one that needed close watchin or he would run away
when i axed him why he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to
what have yah got to say to that
all i have to say master is all that need be said
there is no truth in it
how could i write a letter without ink or paper
there is nobody i want to write to cause i haint got no friends living as i know of
that armsby is a lying drunken fellow
you know this just as you know that i am constant in truth
now master i can see what that armsby is after plain enough
didnt he want you to hire him for an overseer
he wants to make you believe were all going to run away and then he thinks youll hire an overseer to watch us
he believes you are soft soap
hes given to such talk
i believe hes just made this story out of whole cloth cause he wants to get a situation
its all a lie master you may depend ont
its all a lie
for a tense moment we are unsure which way eppsll go
increasingly it become apparent that shallow minded and equally soused solomon has been able to fold eppss thoughts
in a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions
revealed is a pocket knife which all through the conversation unknown to us the audience was pushed up against solomons stomach
as epps speaks he closes it and taps it on solomons shoulder
ill be god
were he not free and white platt
were he not free and white
epps heads off
solomon is left to exhale a deep breath
having found a lonely spot solomon has struck a small fire
he has in his hand his letter
with no ceremony he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn
and with it at this time seems all chance of him ever being free
he stands and looks at it as if forever as ashes descend into the night sky
the slaves are now employed working on an extension to the great house
the slaves work under the direction of mr
samuel bass a between forty and fifty years old of light complexion and light hair
he is cool and self possessed fond of argument but always speaking with extreme deliberation as well as a canadian accent
as the slaves continue to work there is a conversation going on between epps and bass
bass much skilled in the art of sophistry while eppss arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone
though at first epps does little more than joke his way around the facts
solomon working still cant help but overhear as epps offers bass a drink which bass waves away
you look unsettled
no shame in taking respite from the heat drink shade
its ungodly for travelers
hearty or otherwise
bass gives a laugh
i meant no joke
your humor is inadvertent
sensing perhaps basss laughter might be at his expense epps presses
then share whats funny
or what ills you
im here to complete the work at hand
as requested and as paid
something rubs you wrongly
before i take further offense i offer you the opportunity to speak on it
you ask plainly i will tell you plainly
what i find amusing you worry about my well being in the heat but quite frankly the condition of your laborers the condition of my
what in the hell are you it is horrid
its all wrong
all wrong sir
they aint hired help
theyre my slaves
you say that with pride
i say it as fact
if the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not theres no justice nor righteousness in slavery
i wouldnt own a slave if i was rich as croesus which i am not as is perfectly well understood
more particularly among my creditors
theres another humbug the credit system
no credit no debt
credit leads a man into temptation
cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from
but this question of slavery what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point
i bought em
i paid for em
of course you did
the law says you have the right to hold a nigger but begging the laws pardon
is everything right because the law allows it
suppose theyd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave
that aint a supposable case
because the law states that your liberties are undeniable
because society deems it so
social systems crumble
universal truths are constant
it is a fact it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all
white and black alike
whoa whoa whoa
yah compare me to a nigger bass
yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon
now i seen one of them critters in orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger i got
yahd call them fellers citizens i spose
look here you cant laugh me down in that way
these niggers are human beings
if they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals you and men like you will have to answer for it
a fearful ill resting on this you betray yourself a foreigner
that will not go unpunished forever
there will be a reckoning yet
you like to hear yourself talk bass better than any man i know of
yahd argue that black was white or white black if anybody would contradict you
a fine supposition if yah lived among yankees in new england
but yah dont
you most assuredly do not
its the sabbath
the slaves are left to themselves to do their own chores
at the moment the female slaves are washing their clothes in large cauldrons slapping their clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry near to their living quarters
behind the plantation
it is a sight of ritual
missing from the field of labor is patsey for whom epps hollers
a drunk epps asks of the slaves where is she
where is patsey
no one answers
talk damn you
we know nothin of her massa
the hell you dont
you know where she is
she run off aint she
shes escaped and you miserable black dogs stand like
the deef and dumb
not a word spoken
my best cotton picking nigger
id give yah all up for her
where she gone
the slaves say nothing
there is nothing for them to say
they dont know where she is
eventually epps drops into true sorrow
my pats gone
epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn
he looks up only to see patsey returning to the plantation
epps steps up to greet her with anger rather than relief
as they hear his angry voice the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry
treach is near as well
run off did you
you miserable wench
where you been
i been nowhere
lies to your misdeeds
the sabbath day massa
i took me a walk to commune wit da lord
bring the lord into yer deceptions
comin from shaws plantation werent yah
yah took yerself ta pleasure shaw
yah gave baser passion to that unblushin libertine
solomon tries to intervene now yah speak
now that yah want to add to er lies yah find yer tongue
epps goes to strike solomon but patsey pulls his arm back
do not strike him
i went to massa shaws plantation
yah admit it
and you know why
patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress
i got this from mistress shaw
mistress epps wont even grant me no soap ta clean with
stink so much i make myself gag
five hundred pounds a cotton day in day out
more than any man here
and fo that i will be clean that all i ax
dis here what i went to shaws fo
the lord knows thats all
and you blind wit yer own covetousness
i dont lie massa
if you kill me ill stick ta that
ill learn you to go to shaws
treach go get some line
treach runs quickly to the tool shed
in short order he returns with the rope in hand
strike her bare n lash her to the post
mistress epps has now come from the great house
she gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction
now tied to the post epps stands behind patsey with his whip
yah done this to yerself pats
epps hoists the whip to strike holds it high
but no matter his rage epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow
he looks to mistress epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on
strike the life from her
epps again hoists the whip
it trembles in his hand ahead of the act
but he does not have it in him to deliver such a beating
turning to solomon thrusting the whip at him beat her
solomon doesnt move
epps shoves the whip into his hand
give her the whip
give it all to her
patsey begging to solomon id rather it you platt
strike her or yahll get the same
solomon takes a step back
he unfurls the whip
he begins to whip patsey
lash after lash patsey squirms before it
epps eyes fill with tears he is nearly too distraught to watch
but the mistress
she is not satisfied with solomons half hearted effort
there aint barely a welt on her
thats what your niggers make of yah a fool fer the takin
eppss grief is replaced by fury
epps grabs the pistol from treachs holster and draws down on the slaves
yah will strike her
yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal or i will kill every nigger in my sight
solomon cant strike a blow even if it means his life
but from the ground from patsey do it platt
dont stop until i am dead
what else can he do
solomon begins to whip to truly whip patsey
her back welts then tears
patsey screams in agony
solomon strikes again and again
after a full thirty lashes solomon looks to epps who is not satisfied
until i say no more
i aint said nothing
solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times
by now as promised patseys back has been reduced to little more finally solomon holds low the whip
he can and will do no more
solomon will not
epps takes up the whip and whips patsey with ten fold greater force than he had
the painfully loud and angry curses of epps load the air
patsey by now is terribly lacerated literally flayed
the lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground
at length patsey ceases struggling
her head sinks listlessly on the ground
her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan
it would seem that she was dying
solomon screaming at epps thou devil
sooner or later somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin
though epps fronts rage there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved pats
there is no sin
a man does how he pleases with his property
at the moment platt i am of great pleasure
you be goddamn careful i dont come to wantin to lightenin my mood no further
by contrast to this horror the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight
the birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress
peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere
epps leaves patsey to herself
he says not a word to the mistress as he passes
the mistress herself heads back into the house
solomon unties patsey lifts her and takes her to the cabin
patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony
phebe applies melted tallow to her wounds and all try to assist and console her
in time patsey opens her eyes
she looks to solomon
she does not say a word
she just looks at him
and then her eyes close again
solomon and bass are working together alone on the extension
from the amount of work thats been done on it it should be obvious that days have now passed
solomon makes a cautious approach to bass
as casually as he can he inquires master bass i want to ask you what part of the country you came from
no part of this land
i was born in canada
now guess where that is
oh i know where canada is
i have been there myself
montreal and kingston and queenston and a great many places
and i have been in york state too
buffalo and rochester and albany and can tell you the names of the villages on the erie canal and the champlain canal
bass gives solomon a long and curious stare
well traveled for a slave
how came you here
master bass if justice had been done i never would have been here
tell me all about it
i am afraid to tell you though i dont believe you would tell master epps if i should
every word you speak is a profound secret
solomon holds a moment
hasnt he heard the same promise before
prior to solomon stating his case we fade to hours have passed
bass reflects on the story that epps has told in the intervening
how many years all told
just passed eleven
your story is
it is amazing and in no good way
do you believe sir in justice as you have said
that slavery is an evil that should befall none
i believe so
if you truly do i would ask
i would beg that you write my friends in the north acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers or take such steps as they might
consider proper to secure my release
bass looks at solomon holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat
my daughter margaret is possibly now and my son alonzo
i miss them so
it would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again
bass hands solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder as if to camouflage the conversation by work
they both lift it toward the floorboards
finally bass speaks
i have always forgone relationships and family
i did once have a sweetheart who i loved deeply
bass points to a measuring tool which solomon immediately hands over
but that was a long long time ago
ive been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years
my freedom is everything
the fact that i can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure
i see the aching in your eyes the pain of not being attached to your loved ones
my life doesnt mean much to anyone but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people
what you have just said to me scares me and i must say sir i am afraid
not just for you but for me
they continue working fixing the floorboards in unison
solomon slightly confused
i will write your letter sir for if i could bring freedom to you it will be more than a pleasure
it will be a duty
now would you be so kind as to pass me those nails sir
we pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure
they continue to work as if the conversation had never occurred
solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or more on his way back from bartholomews sack familiarly slung over his right shoulder
drearily he walks
his eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left
almost simultaneously his eyes retract back to the path towards epps
as he passes out of shot the evidence of what he was looking at is revealed
feet hang at the top right hand corner of the frame
a woman who has been lynched
to a now virtually complete half painted white gazebo
slaves continue to work on it
as they do so bass peels away from the structure to have an overview
he beckons solomon toward him out of earshot from the slaves who are continuing to work on the gazebo
as solomon approaches bass shouts and bring those markers
solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches bass
no letter yet
you are certain
bass takes a marker from solomon and slides it into the earth
i have inquired thoroughly
more than is safe for either of us
bass takes another and pokes it into the ground improvising a pathway towards the gazebo
i have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly
the work here has grown sparse
bass doesnt need to spell things out for solomon
solomons understanding of the finality of the situation should be very clear
you must know wherever i am i will press your cause
on top of these years
no cause remains
if there is any chance
i will continue to write your go home knowing you have tried
the weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men
nothing more to do nothing more to say bass takes surreptitiously knowing full well he cannot be seen making contact with a slave
but in the strength of their collective grip in the emotion in which they hold each others eyes we should be able to easily see how greatly bass wanted to
be able to help solomon
equally we can see the depth of regard solomon has for bass
the moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither man can openly speak his regret or thanks
a moment longer and then bass releases his grip and makes his way marching toward the gazebo pointing instructions
solomon is left markers in hand alone
solomon sits on a secluded part of the road fiddle in hand
he stares across the expanse
his eyes fixed on something that is a million miles away
slowly solomon tunes his fiddle turning the tuning peg tighter and tighter
as the strings are taut the sound is almost unbearable as solomon tightens bit by bit as if bones are being cracked one by one
just beyond the breaking point of sound there is a snap
he then repeats the action
solomon holds the neck of the violin
sliding his thumb and forefinger down the neck he methodically cracks it at the base
he carefully snaps the neck and removes it from the body then snaps it in two placing it on the ground
he then starts on the body
heaving it on the ground it falls apart
methodically he breaks the violin into small bits silencing the instrument with a hushed display of violence rather than aggressive
seems almost to be in an odd way respectful
the slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field making their way in the trying soil
solomon too focused to note the arrival of two men by carriage parker and the while the sheriff makes his way to the field parker remains with the carriage
the sheriff calls platt
where is the boy called platt
the sheriff crosses to him
your name is platt is it
pointing off to the distance
do you know that man
solomon looks toward the carriage
he has to shield his eyes from the sun
recognition is slow coming to him
but when it does it hits him as a rush
solomon starts for parker but he is pulled back by the sheriff who is keen to determine solomons true identity
as he does epps makes his way over
that man received a letter compiling many accusations
you look me in the eye and on your life answer me truthfully have you any other name than platt
solomon northup is my name
have you a family
whats all this
its official business
my nigger my business
your business waits
tell me of your family
i have a wife and two children
what were your childrens names
margaret and alonzo
and your wifes name before her marriage
i am who i say
solomon pushes past the sheriff
as solomon moves toward parker his pace quickens with each step until his personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run
the two old friends make contact with each other wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace
it if finally broken by epps who has moved over with the sheriff
you will unhand em
platt is my nigger
he is solomon northup
he belongs to no man
you come here unfamiliar to me and make claims
i have no doubts
this is solomon northup a resident of saratoga springs ny
to hell with that
my nigger and ill fight you for em
as is your right
as it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts
by this time the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses
they stand behind the cabin out of sight of epps
mistress epps also bears witness standing on the veranda next to her house slave
her face is of a strange mixed emotion
epps looks to solomon
solomon icily stoically holds his ground
he makes it quite clear in his countenance that nobody owns him
sheriff hand on his gun is there to back solomon up
epps with no other recourse than to you think this is the last youll see of me boy
whatever paper you hold about his freedom it dont mean naught
he is my nigger and i will have my day in court sir
as god as my witness i will have my day in court
epps calls to bob saddle my horse
and bring her up here
epps walks back into the plantation
the trio starts for the carriage
solomon is pulled back by the call of patseys voice platt
disregarding parker solomon crosses over to patsey
under the circumstances neither really knows how to engage
finally suddenly patsey throws her arms around solomon and they embrace
epps now mounted on his horse witness the encounter
kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse he rides off furiously
calling from the carriage mindful of epps solomon
if we know whats wise we should depart
a moment longer solomon and patsey hold each other
they separate solomon heading back to the carriage
he and parker alight
the sheriff chides the horses and they
as they move on patsey sinks down to the ground where she remains in a weary and half reclining state the other slaves around her
we stay with solomon as he travels further and further from the slaves who are diminished by distance
solomon waves a hand to them but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more
we now see solomon in front of a door
a door we have seen before at the very beginning of our story
solomon aged significantly since then stands nervously swallowing and adjusting his attire
he breaths in and holds his breath
he blows out and closes his eyes
a tear falls from his cheek but this is not the way he wants his family to see him
he gathers himself and looks to his right
there stands mr
he places his hand on solomons shoulder
he says gently are you ready
solomon swallows and nods
the door to the room opens
parker enters solomon behind
we first see anne in her finest attire the northup children alonzo who is now seventeen and margaret who is now twenty she carries with her a bundle
also present is margarets husband
the family waits patiently dutifully
anne rises to greet him but holds back
all around the body language of the family is stiff and awkward
they are after all after twelve years little more than familiar strangers
i apologize for my appearance
i have had a difficult time of things these past many years
solomon looks among his family trying to recall them as much as they look to see familiarity within him
to his alonzo
you do not recognize me do you
do you even remember the last time we saw each other
i put you on a carriage with your mother
margaret tearing hugs her father
solomon almost breaks but he keeps himself together
looking to the and who is this
he is my husband
it is very good to meet you sir
we have much acquainting to do
margaret rises she presents her bundle to her father
and this is your grandson
solomon northup staunton
the fact his grandson carries his name is overwhelming
solomon breaks down
but anne is there to catch him
as she holds him solomon says to anne with all his heart forgive me
there is nothing to forgive
the pair joined now by the whole family hold on to each other for life
and one would think for all the rest of their lives
upon gaining his freedom solomon northup located and attempted to seek legal justice against the men who kidnapped him
the case was tried in washington dc where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying
the charges against the kidnappers were eventually dismissed
northup spent the rest of his life working as an abolitionist and with the underground railroad
solomon northup most likely died between and
the exact date place and circumstances of his death remain unknown
