screenplay by kenneth lonergan the shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the faces of mr
prescott a pleasant looking couple in their late thirties dressed up for a night out
prescott drives them along a dark hilly two lane highway
why do they always put braces on teenage girls at the exact moment when theyre the most self conscious about their appearance
i dont know
up ahead near the top of the oncoming hill a red pickup truck is poking its nose out of the short exit lane
tom i see him
the pickup lurches into the road with not nearly enough time to spare
prescott swerves over the double solid white line and clears the truck as another pair of headlights from an oncoming truck rises up over the hill directly in front of
them screams tom
prescotts foot stomps on the brake
we black out and there is the sound of a terrible crash
the shadow of a big man looms up onto the front door
a big finger rings the bell
amy a thirteen year old baby sitter with braces opens the door and looks up
in the b
we see two children sammy samantha and terry prescott in their pajamas lying on their stomachs in the living room watching television
sammy is eleven
terry is eight
reverse darryl the sheriff a portly fellow with glasses and a mustache looks down at amy
puzzled hi darryl
thinking amy would you please tell the kids youll be right back and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for a minute
to kids be right back you guys
youre not supposed to go out amy
shes going to smoke a cigarette
amy closes the door and looks expectantly up at darryl
darryl doesnt know how to start
credits begin over a blustery april day
the steeple of the little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky
its a small church and a small congregation but its full
theres a choir of mostly senior citizens arrayed in the back
two closed caskets are laid out in front of the minister a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt and pepper hair who is giving a eulogy mos
among the mourners in the second row sit terry and sammy both redeyed and uncomfortable in their dress up clothes
their aunt ruth a pinch faced woman in her forties sits next to them
sammy and terry are holding hands tightly
terry wipes his eyes with his free hand
the minister addresses her remarks to the children
sammy is hanging on the ministers every word terry is shifting his eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another minute
on the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green country sammy twenty seven years old now puts flowers on her parents graves with quick practiced movements
she is a nice looking young woman of a neat appearance saved from primness by an elusive pleasantly flustered quality
an unsuccessfully neat person
she is dressed in office clothes white blouse dark skirt high heels light raincoat over everything
she picks out a couple of weeds and then bows her head and closes her eyes
scottsville is a small town
run down old stores next to a new bank a couple of chain stores a few restaurants of varying ambitions
civil war statue
world war i statue
world war ii statue
residential streets wandering away from main street up and down hills
you know theres a minimall somewhere nearby
a fair amount of activity during the daytime
sammys car pulls up across the street from where an eight year old boy in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school knapsack is waiting at the curb
this is her son rudy
sammy calls out the car window
rudy come on
im really late
rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car slinging his knapsack into the backseat
how was school
why do you say that
were supposed to write a story for english homework but they didnt tell us what its supposed to be about
what do you mean
i mean they didnt tell us what its supposed to be about
they said do whatever you want
so whats wrong with that
i just think its unstructured
smiles well im sure youll be able to think of something
if you cant ill help you
sammy stops the car outside a heavily thicketed driveway carols house and rudy gets out
dont forget your backpack
rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back
its not a backpack its a knapsack
dont forget your knapsack
rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back
give me a kiss
rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and squeezes her neck
he withdraws slams the door
as sammy drives away he slogs up the long twisting driveway
sammy gets out of her car which is parked in one of the half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for bank employees
she hurries toward the employees entrance fixing her skirt as she goes
sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past mabel a pleasant faced fellow employee
guess whos been asking for you
oh no really
mabel nods and passes by
sammy knocks on a big door that says manager and has half the letters of the previous branch managers name taken off it
inside yeah come in
sammy swings open the door
brian everett the new branch manager is unpacking a box
sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good looking in a boyish sort of way he wears shirt sleeves and tie and a wedding
im samantha prescott im the lending officer
yeah hi how are you
come on in
sammy comes into the office and sits
i am so sorry i was late
yeah we missed you before
i got held up
believe me it is not something i make a habit of
im sure its not
actually could you just could you close that door for me
sammy gets up and closes the door
sammy sits in front of brians desk
brian is behind the desk listening
so i always just run out at to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitters house
anyway larry never minded about it and i was just hoping it would be ok with you too
well samantha i realize that scottsville is not exactly a major banking center
no its not
no i know its not
but its kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards wed be trying to
meet if we were the biggest branch in the state
and that means i dont want anybody running out at or or whenever the bus happens to come in that day
now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school
does your husband work in the area
do you oh no rudy sr
isnt on the scene
so to speak
well i can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement but
i understand what youre saying and i think its great
because theres a lot of things around here that could use some attention
but ive honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes and if i take the time out of my
id really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement
brightly ill do my best
brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head
how olds your son
thats a terrific age
sammy and rudy drive home in silence
the orange sunlight flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive along
the same house that sammy grew up in with sixteen years more wear on it
sammys car swings expertly by the mailbox and rudy reaches half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail
sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries
rudy follows looking through the mail
sammy passes through the house and goes into the kitchen
you got a letter from uncle terry
her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter
she tears it open and reads it with growing excitement
sammy opens her file drawer
inside are tax files household files miscellaneous files
she puts terrys letter away in a very full file marked terry correspondence
the folder is stuffed with other letters on all different kinds of stationery from all over the country all from terry
sammy and rudy are eating dinner
its a biggish house for just two people
whose room is he gonna stay in
he can stay in the little room
pause but you know what
hes not going to live here
hes only gonna stay for a little while
and its ok if you dont remember him because you were only six the last time he was here
but itll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit
dont you think
rudy looks worried and doesnt answer
rudy is on the floor writing in his school composition notebook
sammy comes downstairs
would it distract you if i put on some music
she puts on a cd sits down and picks up a book
she looks at rudy who is writing away
did you think of a story
whats it about
what about your father
its just a made up story about him
can i read it when youre done
its not very good
dont say that
rudy keeps writing
sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine and reading rudys story
it upsets her
sammy sits on the edge of her bed not dialing the phone
she catches a glimpse of herself in her parents floor length mirror with the worn heavy wooden frame
against her better judgment she picks up the phone and dials
sammy and bob steegerson are eating dinner at dawsons the only fancy restaurant in town
bob is in his mid thirties a realtor a decent ordinary guy
anyway bob its sort of this adventure story and rudys father is this secret agent or something working for the government
and it just made me feel weird
because i never really say much to him about rudy sr
because i dont know what to say
and i dont know whether i should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine or whether i should sit him down sometime and tell him you know that
his father is not such a nice person
i dont know sammy
what have you told him already
he knows i dont have the highest opinion of him
and he knows i dont want to see him or know anything about him ever
but i tried to keep it kind of neutral
i could go into a lot more detail believe me
its an interesting problem
but i dont really know what to tell you
its a little outside my personal field of expertise
id be glad to give it some thought
he is smiling at her
im just glad to see you
im glad you called me
i bet you were surprised
um a little
bob drains his wineglass
sammy cuts at her steak
sammy and bob lie in bobs bed a few minutes after having made love
they are very far away from each other but trying with difficulty not to let on
i should get going
ive got the baby sitter
thanks for a lovely evening
she kisses him
she tries to make it sexy but hes not into it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing
sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the mirror
she brushes vigorously looking at herself while she brushes
the corner window of a grim little apartment building on a very grim street in a grim little city
a tiny apartment with a bed chair table fridge and not much else
one window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out
terry prescott comes in
he is twenty five years old a real mess with a certain natural appeal
he wears old jeans very old hiking boots and a lumberjack style coat
he takes a wool hat off his head
his hair is longish and dirty
sheila sadler is sitting at the table by the fridge
she is barely eighteen frail and damaged
terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly
she smiles back
whered you get the hat
oh i got it on the street for a dollar
well you know its pretty much your standard woolen hat
yeah i had a very similar reaction to it
sheila looks away
can i get that money from you
as she opens her purse terry takes a few vague steps toward her
she takes out a tiny hippie ish woven wallet and gives terry all the money in it a twenty and two ones
is that all you have
can you borrow some cash from your brother
um yeah but that would involve speaking to him
well im definitely gonna be gone for a couple of days at least sheila
why do you have to stay so long
because my sister is not a bank you know
i cant just show up and ask her for you seem to think my brothers a bank
oh sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap
ill be back just as soon as i can
i am not the kind of man that everyone says i am
i know youre not
ill call you tonight
dont you wanna tell me you love me
i love you
that was really convincing
i think after this is over you should seriously consider moving back home
short laugh oh yeah
gives up all right
you gonna call tonight
she puts her arms around him and holds on
wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead
a greyhound bus drives into the shot along the curve of the highway
terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom smoking a joint
he takes a huge hit and holds it in for as long as humanly possible
he blows out whats left takes another equally huge hit and holds it in
the bus whooshes along a smaller heavily wooded roller coaster road
terry looks out the window at the passing scenery
the sunlight flickers on his face
pov terry the bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery
terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat
pov terry the welcome to scottsville sign whizzes by
houses start dotting the side of the road
terry starts getting very agitated
terry stands at one end of main street backpack over his shoulder as the bus drives off
he looks around at the town going about its saturday afternoon business
loud country western music is blaring as sammy wearing an apron sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and hurries to the oven
there are also cookies a pie evidence of massive fancy cooking
she puts on her oven mitts and takes a lasagna out of the oven as the phone rings
she picks up
into phone hello
sammy practically bursts out the front door
she has changed into nice clothes
terry secrets himself in a small dark alley
he takes out his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it
smoking he looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley
terry fairly well stoned walks along main street
a skinny man emerges from his hardware store to greet terry and shake hands
terry says hi but keeps on walking
he passes some other people
he almost runs right into sheriff darryl sixteen years fatter and grayer
the sheriff recognizes terry and breaks into a big smile
how you doin
gimme a cuddle
the sheriff gives terry a big bear hug
terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling
he pats the sheriffs back
how you doin darryl
which way you headed
im just goin to see sammy at dawsons
can i walk with you a little
sure yeah so sammy says you been out in alaska
yeah i was workin out there for a little while
the sheriff walks along with terry
terry very self conscious about smelling like pot fumbles to light a cigarette
the sheriff does not seem to notice
sammy says shes gettin postcards from all across the country
yeah ive been all over the place
they stop outside dawsons
well its good to have you back here ill tell you that
keep enforcing the peace
well thatll be a little harder now that youre home but ill do what i can
no man im reformed
good to see you kid
darryl walks away
terry stands outside the restaurant looking for sammy
behind him in the restaurant sammy is sitting at a table talking to the waitress
she sees terry and gets up immediately smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door
terry turns and sees her
he breaks into a big smile tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant
through the window we see them make their way toward each other
sammy throws her arms around him
he hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the glass door slowly closes
terry is studying the menu over intently
sammy is beaming at him
sorry about yesterday i dont care i was studying the bus description
and i just
i got on the wrong bus i mean i missed my stop i dont care terry
im just so glad to see you
im glad to see you too sammy
are you coming from work
um no its saturday
yeah no its just
youre dressed so formally
you know i just thought id you know i thought it was a special occasion
which it is
no its good
i thought id dress up too
he gestures to his shitty clothes
you look fine
a strange unsuccessful joke yeah this is the haute cuisine of garments
so how are you
were fine terry
how are you
pause i mean yeah
where have you been lately terry
i know i havent been i got a postcard from you from alaska
yeah i was up there for a while
but that was in the fall terry
yeah i know ive been out of touch
i was a little worried
pause i mean oh i been a lotta different places
i went down to florida for a while
i was doing some work in orlando
ive been all over the place
i just wish you would have let me know you were ok
i didnt realize itd been so long
he looks around the restaurant
beaming again are you gonna stay in town for a while
well i dont know
i got all these things i gotta do back in worcester
yeah so im probably not gonna be able to stay more than a day or so
thats all right
im kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts
its a long and worthy story but i wont trouble you with it right now
he twists around and looks all over the restaurant
she watches him
are you expecting someone
who would i be expecting here
you just keep looking around thats all
no i was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments actually
he looks up at her
ive actually got to confess to you sammy
that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that ive been kind of unable to write
on account of the fact that i was in jail for a little while
you were what
a couple of people in the restaurant look at them
terry notices but sammy does not
well i did a little time i guess in florida
for uh just for bullshit
it was just bullshit
what did you do
i didnt do anything
does it occur to you that maybe i was wronged
well could i please oh my god
would you please let me what happened
i got into a fight in a bar down in florida
which i was not the one who instigated it at all
but they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months
i didnt write you because i didnt want you to get all upset about it
i just figured youd figure i was on the road for a little while
i know it was stupid and im sorry
i really didnt mean to make you worry
but you know what
i cant run around all the time doin stuff or not doin stuff because its gonna make you worry
because then i come back here and i tell you about my fuckin
traumas and i get this wounded little ive let you down bullshit over and over again and it really just cramps me
like i just want to get out from under it
and here i am back in this fuckin hole explaining myself to you again
ok can you please stop cursing at me
i mean i realize im in no position to uh basically say anything ever but its not like im down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument
with some strippers boyfriend and i suddenly think hey
maybe thisd be a good time to really stick it to sammy and get myself locked up for a few months
me too man
i mean welcome home
hey you dont write me for six months i have no idea where you are im sorry i dont know if youre alive or dead im sorry and then you
show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail
im sorry im sorry im sorry sammy im really sorry
the patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to look
im in the midst of a slight predicament
what do you need
i gotta get back to worcester tomorrow
i got this girl there and shes kind of in a bad situation
i just need to borrow some money
whatever you can spare
pause ill pay you back
ill pay you back man
i really wish mom was here
so do i man
nobody knows what to do with you
i know how they feel man
silence except for the sounds of the restaurant
can i ask you something
with some difficulty well i mean do you ever go to church anymore
come on sammy can we not talk about that shit
um no sammy
can you tell me why not
because i think its ridiculous
well can you tell me without like denigrating what i believe in
because i think its primitive ok
i think its a fairy tale
well i mean have you ever considered that maybe thats part of whats making things so difficult for you
that youve lost hold of well not just your religious feeling but lost hold of any kind of anchor any kind of trust in anything
i mean no wonder you drift around so much
what could ever stop you
how would you ever know if you had found the right thing
well uh im not really looking for anything man
im just like trying to get on with it
the waitress approaches with their salads
here we go
she sets them down on the table
sammy and terry thank you
the waitress leaves
terry picks at his salad
sammy doesnt touch hers
she watches him miserably
terry watches while sammy inserts her card in the atm and punches in her code
she punches in
the machine grinds out her cash
she gives him the money
thank you sammy
im really gonna pay this back
she takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet
sammy and terry get in the car
sammy isnt saying anything
where we going
to pick up rudy
she puts on her glasses and her seat belt
she wont look at him
do you not even want me to visit now
cause i can catch the bus at five oclock if thats what you want
well of course i want you to visit you idiot
ive been looking forward to seeing you more than anything
ive been telling everyone i know that you were coming home
i cleaned the whole fucking house so it would look nice for you
i thought you were gonna stay for at least a few days
it didnt occur to me that you were just broke again
i wish you would have just sent me an invoice
terry is now totally contrite
terry sits in the tub
water drips from the faucet
he is staring blankly up at the pristine blue and white tiled wall and the neatly folded matching towels
sammy and rudy are in the living room
rudy is playing with a game boy type game
in the b
terry is dialing the phone
he looks clean and shaved his hair is neatly combed
into phone hi is that malcolm
hi this is terry prescott
i been trying to get ahold of sheila and theres no answer and i was just wondering if she she what
he sits down
into phone when
well is she all right
well could i talk to her
well could you give her a message that i click
he is hung up on
he slowly hangs up
sammy notices that somethings wrong
he looks at her from across the room
that girl im with tried to kill herself
she tried to kill herself
terry is sitting on the bed addressing an envelope to sheila
he puts the in the envelope and seals it
he sees sammy standing in the doorway
he starts to unlace his boots
do you have everything you need
i think so
sammy comes into the room and sits next to him
he is very busy with his laces
what are you going to do
i dont know
send the money i guess
maybe you should stay home for a little while terry
yeah maybe thatd be a good idea
he starts crying
sammy pats him
a bright clear blue skied sunday morning in scottsville
inside the little white church theyre singing
people are filing out of the church
we also see a couple of the bank employees including brian and his very pretty six months pregnant wife nancy
we find sammy and rudy
sammy is chatting to some neighbors
rudy is bored out of his mind waiting for her
terry is lying on the sofa smoking with his feet up and boots on watching sunday morning tv
on the coffee table are his dirty ashtray dirty bowl and spoon rice krispies box and a milk carton
crickets buzz loudly outside the house
sammy in her bathrobe comes down the stairs into the living room
terry is on the sofa playing with rudys game boy
he barely looks up when she speaks to him
im going to bed
do you have everything you need
terry im really glad youre home
terry tries to smile at her
yeah me too sammy
he goes back to his game
she hesitates then heads back up the stairs
sammy terry and rudy sit at the kitchen table
sammy is dressed for work
rudy is dressed for school
terry is also fully dressed drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee
he is tired but listening to sammy very carefully as if receiving difficult and critical instructions
so well drop rudy off at the bus then all you have to do is drop me off at the bank and just pick rudy up at in front of
town hall and drive him over to carols house
and thats it
shes on harvey lane right past where the dewitts used to live
rudy knows where she lives
terry glances at rudy then back at sammy
sammy walks past mabels desk carrying a big stack of files
she drops three of them on the desk
mabel is typing away at her pc
the colors are a garish purple background with green letters
god mabel dont those colors hurt your eyes
oh no they keep me fresh
sammy proceeds down the hall and into brian is at his desk busy working between stacks of papers
she knocks on the open door
looks up hi sammy
what can i do for you
did you want us to turn this time sheet in at the end of the day or do you want it at the end of the week
oh yeah end of the dayll be fine
seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork
brian hesitates shrugs and smiles
i like paperwork
sammy looks at him with a blank smile
sammy sits down at her desk and notices the time
she reaches for the phone then decides not to call
the clock on the front of the town hall reads
the school bus pulls up across from the town hall and disgorges a handful of kids
rudy comes out with his knapsack looking around
pov rudy terry across the street sits on the hood of sammys car smoking
rudy walks over to him
you showed up
looks that way
terry and rudy drive in silence
terry glances at rudy
put on your seat belt
it pushes on my neck
it pushes on my neck
well when somebody slams into us and you go sailin through the windshield thats liable to be uncomfortable too
so put on your seat belt
rudy puts on his seat belt
moms parents died in a car accident
theyre my parents too
your mom is my sister
yeah i know
so that means we have the same parents
they drive in silence for a moment
terry glances down at rudy
sammy laden with files plops down at her desk as mabel is passing by
mabel puts a phone message down in front of her
um carol just called
she said terry and rudy never showed up at her house
youve got to be kidding me
a moment later brian talking to an employee sees sammy across the bank hurrying out the employees exit
sammy doesnt hear and exits
terry and rudy are banging nails with ray a young guy terrys age
terry hammering with swift accurate blows glances up and watches rudy for a second
rudy is hammering away with no great skill
he moves rudys hand down toward the end of the handle
you hold it further down youre gonna get a lot more power
you should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits
look with two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood
thats not the way i hold it
well the way you hold it is wrong
why cant i just do it my own way
terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment
shrugs you can
he goes back to work
rudy resumes hammering
after a moment he switches his grip and starts hammering terrys way
terry looks up and watches him
sammy pulls up fast and gets out of the car
hearing the hammering from the backyard she walks quickly around the side of the house and stops short when she sees rudy hammering happily away with terry and ray
she watches them working unobserved with mixed annoyance and relief and finally with quiet pleasure because its a very cheerful sight
half the staff has gone home
sammy in her coat picks a note up off her chair
it reads sammy stands in front of brians desk
did you want to see me
i was kind of wondering what happened to you today
oh didnt mabel i had a false alarm about my son
yeah i kind of thought you were gonna work that out
well i did work it out more or less then whyre you running outta here in the middle of the day without a word of explanation to me sammy
brian dont yell at me
im im not yelling
im just gettin a little frustrated here
well brian sorry could you close the door please
sammy closes the door
sammy terry and rudy sit at dinner
the atmosphere is lively and cheerful
and eddy dwyer lives in buffalo with his wife and two sons if you can believe it
that is depressing
he just never struck me as the marrying type thats all
who are you talking about
wild kids we used to know
were you a wild kid
not compared to your mom
you dont believe me
mom were you
rudy is amazed
terry looks at him like told you so
sammy is asleep in bed
rudy is asleep in bed
terry sits at the bar drinking beer
there are a few locals in the place but its pretty dead
he looks around his energy is too restless for the near empty bar
the door opens and terry comes in smoking a cigarette
he looks around the room
looks at rudys toys
picks up some superhero comics and sits on rudys bed
then he spies rudys composition book picks it up and starts reading it
what are you doing
terry looks up
rudy is half sitting up in bed
oh just readin some of your compositions
why are you smoking
because its bad
dont ever do it
you know this used to be my room
pause do you want it back
rudy is very relieved
terry keeps reading
rudy watches him
did you fight in vietnam
i wasnt even born yet
were you ever in the army
my father was in the army
unfortunately he didnt fight in vietnam either
were you friends with him
we had some friends in common i guess
i didnt like him very much
well he wasnt very likable
why do you say that
i dont know
he was always he always had to be better than you at everything
like if you were all playing basketball or something everybodys havin like a friendly game and hes like ready to kill somebody if his team didnt win
or like if you told like a joke or a story he always had to tell a better one
kinda gets annoying after a while
plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you
he was a prick
probably still a prick
fortunately for you though your mom is like the greatest
so you had some bad luck and you had some good luck
pause you mind if i ask you a personal question
i dont know
do you like it here
i mean in scottsville
i dont know
my friends are here
i like the scenery
i dont know
i know i know but its so
theres nothing to do here
yes there is
no there isnt man
its a dull narrow town full of dull narrow people who dont know anything except
what things are like right around here
they have no perspective whatsoever
they might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea whats going on and if you try to tell em that they wanna fuckin kill
what are you talking about
i dont know
terry lies on his back and smokes
youre a good kid
theres a note on sammys chair
sammy just arrived at work and still in her coat looks down at the note
sammy listens to brian
this doesnt apply to you directly sammy but ive noticed that some of the employees have their pc monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors
purple and polka dots or what have you
and its not a big deal but really this is a bank
its not really appropriate
so im just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future
sammy looks at him blankly
like i say it doesnt really apply to you
no my computer palettes pretty conservative
mabel is typing angrily at a gray screen with black letters
sammy walks by
mabel is so mad she doesnt even look up
sammy sits agitated for a moment
she makes a decision picks up the phone and dials
bob is in his little realty office with two clients a husband and wife
he picks up his ringing phone
into phone bob steegerson
on phone what are you wearing
into phone mom
terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling
sammy passes by and stops
terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling
do you know you have an enormous leak from the upstairs hall
he pokes again
a portion of the ceiling collapses on his head in wet chunks of plaster and muck
um yeah thanks i did
sammy in front of the mirror finishes dolling herself up for her date
we hear loud banging
sammy puts on her earrings and goes into are you guys sure youre gonna be yes
sammy approaches rudy and terry
they are bent over a big nasty trench in the floorboard
there are wood shavings and greasy pipe segments all over and black smeary smudges on the walls nearby
what is happening here
its just the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall
so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down
why dont i just call the plumber
hes not gonna do anything different than what im doing
were making it worse
no were not
terry yanks the wrench and a spray of filthy water comes out of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and sammy with gritty gray water
she looks at them
thank you both
bob and sammy cleaned up and wearing a different outfit are bustling out the front door
terry stands by
now call if theres any problem and if im not there im either on my way or on my way back home
sammy gets into her coat
bob opens the front door
to terry so lights out at ten
and dont spend the whole night watching tv
nice to meet you bob
to sammy whats your idea of the whole night
two hours tops
bob holds the door for sammy and smiles at her
there is some confusion about who should go out first
finally she goes and bob follows
the atmosphere between them is fairly awkward
terry and rudy are watching tv from the sofa
whats your feeling about bob
i dont really know him that well
terry looks at his watch
i have bad news for you
he picks up the remote
and turns off the tv
they sit there in the sudden silence
what are we supposed to do now
do you know how to play pool
ive played it
the wild moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the stars
terry and rudy get out of the car
rudy looks apprehensive
i dont think they let kids in there
well were not allowed to watch any more tv so its this or nothing
but if we run into any trouble let me do the talking
terry swings the door open
pov rudy a lot of men and women at the bar or in booths eating and drinking
smoky crowded and very loud
as he follows terry through the crowd various patrons notice him some of the looks are friendly some blank some cold i
whats a kid doing in here
at the pool table terry and rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table
terry waves a few bills
i got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here
only we gotta get the next game cause hes gotta be in bed by ten oclock
a moment later rudy very nervous and the st pool player are side by side shooting for break
terry is behind rudy coaching him
just hit it nice and soft
nice and soft
they hit the balls
rudy just clips his ball and it doesnt go anywhere
st pool players ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back
to terry sorry
god damn rudy
i thought you said you could play
rudy doesnt answer
terry winks at him
a moment later st pool player breaks whack
the balls scatter
terry steps up to the table chalking up his cue
boys its all over but the cryin
quick cuts of terry running the table and everyone watching
three ball in the side
one ball in the corner
nine ball off three cushions and into the corner and the eleven ball into the side
rudy watches him
bob and sammy sit at bobs dining room table
the little bachelor apartment looks pretty good
tablecloth candles wine everything
bob has just dropped a huge bombshell
are you serious
i dont know what to say
i i mean i know i havent exactly been the most
in the past
i dont know im tired of foolin around
and i love you
i dont know what to say
well you could always say yes
pause or you could think about it first
thats it i want to think about it
terry has sunk everything but the eight ball
he leans over to sink it
its a fairly easy shot
he lines it up carefully and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the corner pocket
a few moments later terry and rudy sit side by side watching as the nd pool player passes back and forth between them and the camera running the table
oohs and all rights emit from the spectators
then the clack of the balls connecting
a great common groan goes up
rudy looks up at terry
its all yours baby
rudy looks at the table the eight ball is two inches off the corner
the cue ball is a few inches away from it
a piece of cake for an adult
rudy looks deeply unconfident
he gets up and tries to line up the eight ball
terry is right next to him
just make sure to hit it really gentle
and hit it a little low so you get some backspin
dont even hit it
just kiss it
a long moment
what do you mean kiss it
i mean tap it
firm but very very softly
and dont shoot until you know its going in
everyone is relatively quiet
rudy takes a few practice strokes and then hits the cue ball straight but too softly
it crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner slower and slower hangs there and drops
a general heyyy
goes up and everyone claps and cheers
terry grabs rudy
rudy smiles ecstatic
that was great
at the bar darryl the sheriff in his civvies drinking a pint of beer notices rudy and terry
at the pool table terry picks rudy up and turns him upside down
the house is dark
terry and rudy are walking from the car to the house
we creamed those guys
we creamed them
stopping suddenly ssh
a car is coming
they break for the door terry fumbling for his key
he gets the door open
he and rudy run inside the house
the lights go on
bobs car pulls into the driveway
rudy runs up the stairs
wait a minute gimme your jacket
rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught in the sleeve
he tries to shake it off
what are you doing
i cant get my sleeve out
they hear bobs car doors slam
terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time
outside the house sammy waves to bob
bob waves back as he drives off
sammy goes to the front door opens it terry and rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs shaking rudys arm and sleeve frantically
trying to get the jacket off
sammy comes in
what is going on in here
um we were just out doing some star gazing and uh rudy lost track of the time
which i totally warned him about
to rudy you are a bad kid
rudy is brushing his teeth
terry pokes his head in
in a low voice hey i think its ok
just dont tell her where we went cause shell be really mad at me
suddenly dark hey im not kidding rudy
terry gives him a you better not look then leaves
rudy continues brushing his teeth
sammy is tucking rudy in stroking his hair
did you know my mommy used to take me and uncle terry out at night to look at the constellations
did you see that one whats the one it looks like a big w
sammy comes out of rudys room smiling
she sees a light on under terrys door
she walks toward it and steps into the trench falling down violently
terry is putting a butterfly band aid on sammys wound
its a nasty bloody gash just shy of needing stitches
ive got a great idea
why dont you let me call the plumber
do whatever you want
oh does that make you mad
rain patters on the roof as sammy limps back and forth across the room changing into her nightgown
terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside the window
rain falls on his head
the rain is still falling
only a few cars are in the employee parking lot yet
the rain runs down brians office window
brian in a wet raincoat turns on his light
a moment later brian turns on his pc
the screen lights up
the colors are a garish green and orange
later sammy and brian are both on their feet
the door is closed
brian get off my ass
i didnt change the colors on your stupid computer screen
well thats all you gotta say
on thats there is nothing wrong with the work i do here
i have been doing just fine the whole time before you came here and if you think that riding people in this petty ridiculous way is the way to improve
service in this bank or anywhere else i think youre out of your mind
i didnt say there was
could i please could i please may i respond
no thats really all i have to may i respond
beat first of all i dont appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language
thats not the way i talk to you and id appreciate it if you wouldnt talk that way to me well second of all if you say you didnt change
the colors on my computer screen then of course i accept your answer
but you and i are gonna have to find a way to work together brian but thats not gonna happen with the attitude its not gonna happen with the lateness
its not gonna happen by fighting me every step of the way ok well not you youre not late but too much of that stuff goes on around here i am not late and i do not have an attitude well then dont tell me im late if im not late
id really like to finish
outside brians office the whole staff is listening to the muffled raised voices from inside the office
mabel especially is listening guiltily
the rain falls on main street
the rain comes down hard on orrins construction project
tarps cover everything
no work today
the rain comes down on the sheriff looking through the restaurant window at sammy eating lunch alone at the counter
he goes inside shakes the rain off himself and goes over to her
they start talking
we hear they were where
the rain on the roof makes a sleepy pleasant country sound
terry is lying on the sofa smoking a joint watching tv in a funk
we loud banging on the pipes
later a young plumber about terrys age comes thumping down the stairs and goes into the living room carrying his toolbox
terry looks up at him
ok youre all set
terry glares at him
the plumber turns and goes out
rudy is waiting in a doorway for terry
he is wet and cold
the rain pours down
brian is showing his wife nancy the bank
he is very solicitous of her nervously introducing her to the employees who are not responding very warmly
nancy is not in a warm mood either shes very testy with brian
this is chuck
chuck this is my wife nancy
nice to meet you
this is mabel
nice to meet you
sammy at her desk watches brian and nancy make their progress through the bank
nobody is being very friendly and brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable
brian and nancy reach sammys desk
this is sammy our lending officer
sammy this is my wife nancy
its nice to meet you
brian i gotta sit down
sure lets go in my office
he glances nervously at sammy as he leads nancy away from her desk and toward his office
he murmurs something to nancy who responds in a low but very testy voice im fine
she roughly pulls her arm away from his
sammy watches them go into his office
rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the center of town
he is completely drenched
sammy knocks on brians open door
sammy sees to her left down the hallway rudy
rudy is at the end of the hall drenched and shivering but cheerful
rudy is in the car somewhat dried off waiting
sammy and terry stand in the employee entrance doorway
look im glad you guys are getting along so well like you have no idea but if i cant rely on you to remember to get him once a day
and what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night and then telling him to lie to me about it
i dont know
terry and rudy pull up in front of the driveway
terry is in a silent rage
the rain has let up
get out of the car
what are we doing
youre going to carols house and im going home
why cant i come with you
because if youre such a baby you gotta tell your mommy about us playin pool when i totally asked you not to and i gotta listen to her shit all
day then youre goin to the baby sitters so you can stay at the baby house
but i didnt tell her
you know what
dont even fuckin talk to me
just get out of the car
he leans over rudy roughly and pushes open the door
rudy gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway
he bursts into tears
terry watches him go then drives off
sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into brians office
brian is at his desk
youre working late
how did your wife like the bank
she wasnt feeling so great
thats too bad
no i dont mean shes not ill
i dont know
it can make you kind of cranky
listen im sorry weve been stepping on each others toes i im not actually that bad a guy yeah i am too
i know youre not brian but youre driving everybody crazy
well i im just trying to do my best here and im gettin it from all sides
i know you are
well work it out
i could use a beer
i could use a tranquilizer
brian and sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly lit pub
its a medium noisy place with various locals drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners
last i heard rudys dad was living over in auburn
but that was last year
must be so tough raising a kid on your own
although im beginning to get the idea my wife wouldnt mind a crack at it
its just the hormones
well no it isnt
but never mind
the waitress brings them two boilermakers
sammy and brian thanks
sammy and brian pick up their shots
well heres to improved employee management relations
they click shot glasses and drink
you cant judge all of scottsville by the people in that bank believe me
well lets lets not talk about the bank
lets just forget about the bank for tonight
they sip their drinks smiling
sammy looks at him appraisingly
sammy and brian are making out in the front seat of his car
this goes on for a while getting heavier and heavier
i want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen
ill never tell
they start kissing again in the cramped space
brian bangs his head
we pull back and away from the car
the sodden trees spout faucets of water down on the car
the kitchen is dark
sammy comes in her hair a little wet and turns on the light
she goes to the telephone
theres a note in terrys handwriting where were you
sammy jumps startled
terry is in the kitchen doorway
i had dinner with my boss
kind of a late dinner aint it
how was rudy
did the plumber come
yes the fucking plumber came
terry give me a break
whats the matter with you
im just tired
you want to smoke some pot
no i dont
why you got some
sammy and terry stand side by side on the porch passing a joint back and forth
it has stopped raining but the trees and roof are still dripping
the crickets are chirping loudly
bob asked me to marry him
pause are you going to
i dont know
if hedve asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes
but the minute he said it i dont know i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me
pause plus terry
whispers i fucked my boss
and his wife is six months pregnant
jesus christ sammy
i know i know
he passes her the joint
he puffs away
the water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp
she puts her head on his shoulder
he puts one arm around her and puffs away with the joint in his free hand
terry im sorry i got so mad before
i just dont want him you know terrified of telling if theres uh well thats not really his problem sammy
sammy straightens up
whats his problem
his problem is that hes like totally sheltered because you treat him like hes three instead of eight so thats how he behaves
and how do you think he should behave
i think he shouldnt have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like for one thing
and what do you on and i mean i took him to play pool
it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun
it wasnt like a big secret i mean who cares
i was actually trying to be nice to him
but hes so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin shit all day when
i didnt even fuckin do anything
first of all he didnt tell me anything darryl did
second of all i dont really give a shit if you took him to play pool i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop
in the rain
but no i dont want you telling him not to squeal because i dont want him put in that position
losing ground well
is a perfect example of what im talking about
you are in idiot
they stand apart now
darryl told you
they stand there
the rain gutters drip
sammy coat on arrives at her desk and puts her purse down
theres a note on her chair
tracking sammy coat off carrying a stack of folders as she walks from her desk around the corner down the hall past a couple of employees and to brians open
she taps on it
brian is at his desk
yeah good morning
could you get the door
outside the office sammy shuts the door
mabel and doris standing near the door look at each other i
sammys in trouble again
inside the office sammy stands by the closed door
brian comes out around his desk
listen i just brian kisses her
she drops her folders and they make out against the door
outside the office the employees click away at their pcs
mabel exchanges a quiet word with chuck
inside the office brian has sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way
its not so easy in their office clothes
sammy tears away
brian thats enough
brian falls back breathless
he lunges at her again
they kiss some more
outside the office
a moment later sammy comes out of the office more or less composed carrying her folders
she heads down the hall past the other employees including mabel and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched up underwear
sammy and bob sit at lunch
sammy is picking at her food
youre awfully quiet
have you thought at all about what i said
of course ive been thinking about it
or do you still want to think about it some more
well i mean i dont know bob
i mean we havent exactly been going steady the last few months if you know what i mean yeah no i know and then we see each other twice and
you suddenly say you want to get married
no youre right youre right what are you talking about
i dont know
maybe this is
last year i sort of thought you were possibly interested in that
but i was the one who you know wasnt ready at that point so thats why i thought things kind of slowed down with us
dont make me feel bad for you
bristling i dont want you to feel bad for me
sammy terry and rudy are all watching tv
sammy and rudy are in pajamas
nobodys happy and nobodys talking
the phone rings
sammy goes to it and picks up surprised because of the hour
into phone hello
on phone its brian
sammy turns away and lowers her voice so terry and rudy wont overhear her
where are you
brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station
im buying milk
i just thought id say hello
we cut between them
sammy doesnt say anything
look i know its probably too late but is there any way you can come out for a little while
brian i think youre going crazy
i know i am
can you meet me
sammy comes down the stairs fully dressed into the living room where terry and rudy are still watching tv
um i have to go out for a minute
do you want anything
i dont know
where are you going
yeah where are you going
i just have to go out for a little while
i just have to go to mabels house
you know what rudy
this is a personal matter that has to do with mabel
i just have to go see her for a little while
terry gives sammy a look like youve got to be kidding
sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back
she goes out
terry and rudy sit in front of the tv alone
im sorry i said you squealed on me
i was totally out of line and i really owe you an apology
pause did you hear what i said
staring at the tv i dont care
sammy drives listening to music
she shakes her head at herself
sammys car and brians car are parked side by side outside a roadside motel
in the motel room sammy and brian half clothed make love rather hurriedly on top of the unmade creaky bed
outside the motel sammy and brian get into their respective cars and start their motors
sammy drives in the other direction
she breaks into a smile and then she laughs
then she stops
sammy lies awake plagued by guilty feelings
sammy heads toward the little white church building
ron the minister and sammy drink coffee in silence
gently whats on your mind sammy
well a lot
i was just wondering if you had an opinion
if you know someone in your family or just someone you really care about and they just cant seem to get ahold of themselves
the sun shines on main street
rudy watches wide eyed as terry places on the sales counter two rods and reels a bunch of lures two fishing hats a box of swivels a knife and a
you know who this is for
thats right my little friend
to the saleslady hello
were going fishing
sammy terry and rudy are all putting away the groceries
everybody seems to be getting along
i got a new rod and reel five lures i got a hat i got a knife and i got a fish scaler
thats great honey
the doorbell rings
sammy starts to move toward the door but terry is closer
ill get it
sammy watches him go
terry opens the door
its ron the minister in his civvies
rudy is playing basketball by himself
terry sammy and ron sit in the living room
sammy and ron are drinking coffee
through the window we see occasional glimpses of rudy playing basketball in the backyard
there is a heavy silence in the room
im not really sure why youre here ron
i mean i realize i havent exactly been a model citizen since i got here but compared to how things have been goin for me lately i thought i was
doing pretty well
he turns to sammy
and i also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think i need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you so much so that youre willing
to disregard the fact that i dont believe in any of this stuff at all well
i didnt mean to discourage you i mean its really kind of insulting
can i say something here
pause sammy asked me to come and talk to you because its her opinion that youre not gonna find what youre looking for the way youre looking for it how
would she know
but im really not here to try to get you to do anything or to believe anything
and ill tell you the same thing i told her which is that as far as im concerned the only way she can help you is by her example by
trying to be a model for you by the way she lives her life
and that doesnt mean shes supposed to be a saint either if thats what youre smiling about
i didnt realize i was smiling
you know terry a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems
drugs alcohol marital problems sexual problems health problems great job you got
i like it
because even in this little town i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of peoples lives
im not saying im always mr
effective but i dont feel like my life is off to the side of whats important
i dont feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people
i dont feel like a negligible little scrap floating around in some kind of empty void with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever
little philosophies i can scrape together on my own
well can i ask you terry do you think your life is important
you mean like me personally my individual life
im not sure what do you mean
its important to me
and like to my you know the people who care about me
but do you think its important
do you think its important in the scheme of things
not just because its yours or because youre somebodys brother
because i dont really get the impression that you do
well i dont think
i dont particularly think anybodys life has any particular importance besides whatever you know whatever we arbitrarily give it
which is fine
i mean we might as well
i think im as important as anybody else
i dont know a lot of what youre saying has a real appeal to me ron
a lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids
but i dont want to believe something or not believe it because i might feel bad
i want to believe it because i think its true or not
id like to think that my life is important
or that its connected to something important
well isnt there any way for you to believe that without calling it god or religion or whatever term it is you object to
i believe that
sammy terry and rudy are all eating dinner
terry is drinking a beer
his mood is dark
so sammy what example will you be setting for us tonight
sammy doesnt answer
terry sammy and rudy are watching tv
terry has another beer
what time are we getting up to go fishing
were not going fishing
what do you mean
i think you should go fishing with father ron
i dont want to go fishing with father ron
well im not takin you
sammy starts to say something to terry stops herself
ill take you sweetie
rudy doesnt answer
sammy and terry are in the hallway
sammy holds a stack of folded sheets
i realize that youre mad at me deadpan im not mad at you
but he didnt do anything to you
and you cannot promise a little boy that youre gonna on boy i just you know after all that religious conversation i just realized its probably not so good for
him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesnt believe his life is important in the scheme of things would you please
practically choking listen
pause i am sure if you put your mind to it you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this
so would you please just give it some thought and take him fishing tomorrow
i would sammy i just dont think itd be good for him
she throws the sheets at him and storms away
terry walks through the living room and out the front door slamming it behind him
sammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe
she picks it up and intercut brians living room
nancy watching tv on the sofa with brian picks up the ringing phone
into the phone hello
sammy hangs up
she gets up walks around sits down again
picks up the phone and dials
intercut bobs kitchenette
bob making a sandwich for himself picks up the phone
into the phone hello
sammy hangs up
she sweeps the telephone and answering machine off the nightstand
she calms down and puts them back
the ancient answering machine is clicking convulsively
she whacks it and it stops
the congregation is coming out of the church and milling around at the steps
sammy with rudy at her side is saying good bye to some neighbors
she watches pregnant nancy and brian go down the steps
pov sammy beyond brian and nancy terry pulls up at the curb in her car
he rummages around and produces fishing rods which he waves somewhat sheepishly
reverse at top speed rudy runs away from sammy and the church toward terry and the car
terry and sammy exchange a look from the distance
services are over
everyone has gone home
sammy sits with ron
i dont know what the churchs position is on adultery and fornication these days but i felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before so
what is the official position on that stuff these days
its a sin
good i think it should be
but we dont tend to focus on that aspect of it right off the bat why not
well i think you should
well maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss and were really mean to you and told you
what a terrible thing it was
maybe itd be better if you told me how im endangering my immortal soul and if i dont quit im going to burn in hell
dont you ever think that
well its a lot better than all this why do you think youre in this situation psychological bullshit you hear all the time
why do you think youre in this situation
with which one
all of them
i feel sorry for them
pause isnt that ridiculous
ron shrugs i
terry and rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a wide running stream fishing
the sunlight slants through the canopy of trees the birds are chattering its gorgeous and peaceful
ive never been so bored in my life
we really shoulda been out here around seven or eight a
what time is it now
the birds sing
was my father a good fisherman
yeah your father was good at all that stuff
he knew everything about the woods everything about fishing everything about hunting and everything about cars
if he wasnt such a pain in the ass he wouldve been a lot of fun to be around
maybe hes nicer now
i doubt it
well i think he is
how would you know
did you ever meet him
were you ever curious to meet him
i guess so
well he doesnt live very far from here
i thought he lived in alaska
no i lived in alaska
your dad lives in auburn
far as i know
pause we could look him up in the phone book
ok but im sure i dont have to say this but im not kidding man dont tell your mother
bob is standing by his kitchenette extremely nervous
sammy sits on his sofa
do you want to go for a walk or a drive
its really nice out
im not gonna stay long
bob i dont want to get married
ive really thought about it a lot and if you had asked me last year im sure i would have said yes
but im not sure it would have been a good idea then either
im going through a really hard time right now and i just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self destructive thing
i could possibly do
and i really think you have to grow up
well how about we fix up my personality some other time
pause i really hope we can still be friends
quietly sarcastic oh yes me too
she looks at him miserably
this is so crazy
i dont even understand why you
i dont even get it
what do you want me to say
everything you said about me was true sammy
i was just a big chickenshit jerk and now im payin the price
she goes over to him
he gets up
well i dont know
i dont know
sammy i love you
i wish i could say it in a more interesting way
i just i love you
well i mean i love you too he puts his arms around her and kisses her
she responds very warmly
just as things are heating up she suddenly remembers something and jolts away
whats the matter
i gotta go
im sorry where do you have to go
off the top of her head im supposed to i gotta get mabel back her car
i dont understand
how are we leaving things
oh god i dont know
call me later
brian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some daytime sunday show on the motel tv
there is a knock at the door
he gets up turns off the tv and opens the door
sorry im so late
yeah i was just about to give up on you
well maybe it wouldve been better if you had
she comes into the room and starts walking around briskly and nervously
i mean look i dont mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation whatever it is but im just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to
stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions they might end up having a lot less trouble generally
hey thats what ive been trying to tell you guys at the bank
well i really dont think i can do this anymore
brian and sammy lie under the starchy sheets
brians eyes are shut
sammy is very upset with herself
this is incredible
that is not what i mean
terry and rudy drive along
terry looks down at rudy and smiles
rudy is tense and wont look at him
over terry and rudys shoulders as terry drives slowly past dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential area
terry is scanning the house numbers
maybe we should call first
well were right here
he pulls up outside a small plain run down ranch style house with a lot of junk out front and gets out of the car
rudy stays in
rudy gets out of the car and comes around
terry waits for him and then they walk up to the front door
the buzzer says kolinski
there he is
his last name is kolinski
ring the bell
rudy pushes the doorbell
theres some noise inside and some voices
the sound of walking
the door opens
janie a tired looking young woman around terrys age opens the door
were looking for rudy
who should i say is calling
an old friend
who is it
he says an old friend
how old is he
appears behind janie
hes around thirty wiry dressed in jeans and an old shirt
he doesnt look good
he recognizes terry
sees rudy who is looking up at him
his face falls
rudy doesnt answer
to janie hi im terry
and this is rudy
you dont say
rudy meet rudy
looks away shaking his head
janie moves away from the door
ill just be in the kitchen
nice to meet you
janie goes into the kitchen
watches her go
ok if we come in for a minute
what the hell are you doin
what do you mean what am i doin rudy sr
starts walking toward terry to make him go back out the door
could you step away from the door please
well we just wanna could you step away from the door please

they all go outside
pulls the door closed behind him
what are you doin here

terry belts him and suddenly they are throwing wild punches at each other
rudy goes sprawling in the dirt
terry knocks rudy sr
down and starts pummeling him brutally
janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back trying to pull him off
get your fuckin hands off him
terry throws janie off him grabs rudy sr
again and resumes beating him up
janie jumps back on top of him
two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up
a few moments later the cops have arrived
the st cop is talking to rudy and janie
the nd cop is talking to terry
s face looks puffy and beaten up
a rd cop stands apart with rudy who is watching the whole thing
we cut rapidly and jerkily through this section and youre not the boys legal guardian
i dont even know if thats my kid

i used to know his sister i just came down here to talk to the guy and all of a sudden he starts shovin me
youre gonna have to step back and just calm down to rudy sr

a moment later the nd cop puts handcuffs on terry

he started the whole thing and youre arresting me
now listen up
terry stop talkin
a moment later as the rd cop walks rudy to one cop car rudy watches the nd cop guide the handcuffed terry into the other car
rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at rudy sr
and janie talking to the st cop
is looking at him over the st cops shoulder
idea where we might be able to contact his mother
no because hes not my goddamn kid
the cop cars doors slam first on terry and then on rudy
the room is dark
sammy and brian are asleep half under the covers
sammy wakes with a start
what time is it
startled awake whats the matter
sammy looks at the clock radio
oh my gosh
a few moments later sammy and brian are on opposite sides of the bed getting dressed
hey you know nancys gonna be gone for the rest of the week

nods tersely mm hm
the crickets are chattering
the phone is ringing inside the house
the phone is ringing on the nightstand
the battered answering machine clicks convulsively but does not pick up
sammy is on the phone in her bathrobe
around two oclock this afternoon
yeah a ninety three toyota tercel
new york plates v ac
sammy dressed now opens the door for bob
she is very anxious
thanks for coming over
i just want to have a car handy just in case
sammy is on the phone
bob sits at the table
into the phone well what about other towns
i called the highway patrol four times
well what am i supposed to do all night
sammy and bob sit silently in the living room waiting
she is smoking
the clock reads
sammy is going crazy with anxiety
the phone rings inside the house as the early morning sun slants through the trees around the house
the ringing phone wakes bob on the sofa in his clothes and sammy half asleep on top of her bed also in her clothes
she grabs the phone
into phone hello
bob drives sammy along the highway
she stares out the window
she turns and watches bob drive for a long moment
brian walks through the morning bank activity and stops at mabels desk
anyone hear from sammy this morning
well if anyone ever hears from her ever again will you let me know
on the steps of the police station sammy rudy and bob wait as sheriff darryl shakes hands with the auburn sheriff
the auburn sheriff goes inside
darryl comes over to sammy
its gonna be all right
we got on the phone and talked to rudy sr
a little bit and hes calmed down just wants to forget about the whole thing
darryl i really appreciate this
the sheriff nods but hes not thrilled to be here
the phone is ringing
sammy comes in the front door terry and rudy behind her
she snaps on the lights hurries to the phone and picks up
behind her rudy goes upstairs and terry plunks down on the sofa and turns on the tv
yeah its brian
brian what the hell happened to you today lady
sammy is about to answer but she just hangs up instead
brian is stunned into sheer gaping fury
feverishly he hangs up and dials again
sammy picks up
she hangs up again
sammy is tucking rudy into bed
is there anything you want to ask me about your father
oh that wasnt my father
that wasnt him
i heard him tell the cops
no rudy that was him
but that was him
i wish it wasnt but it was
very quiet no it wasnt
yes it was
your fathers name is rudy kolinski
he lives in auburn
sammy comes out of rudys room shutting the door softly
we hear the tv going downstairs
she stands at the top of the stairs for a moment
terry is watching tv on the sofa with his feet up on the coffee table
sammy comes down the stairs and into the living room
he keeps watching tv
she doesnt sit
she is trembling
could you turn that off for a minute please
he turns off the tv
you dont have to say anything sammy
i want you to leave
terry looks at her
what do you mean
i mean i dont think you should live here anymore
i dont think you know how to behave around an eight year old and i dont know how to make you stop so i think you shouldnt live here
i dont know what else to say
i dont know how to behave around an eight year old
thats right i think you dont know how to behave around an eight year old
are you out of your mind
now you just listen to me
i may not be the greatest mother in the world but im doing the best i know how
and he doesnt need you to rub his face in shit because you think its good for him
hes going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough and without any help from you
sammy tries to get ahold of herself
her voice is shaking
i think you should get your own place
i thought if you want you could ill be glad to help you out financially what do you mean get my own place
i mean i you mean in scottsville
why would i do that
why dont i just leave period
if thats what you want to do thats fine
but thats not what im saying
you are a very important person to rudy and you are the most important person to me
but im saying that i cant take any more of this well i thought maybe you could sell your half of the house to me and i could pay you
whatever it is over a certain amount of time and that way no you know what
ill just go
he turns the tv back on
very quietly well thats not what im saying
terry shrugs and watches tv
terry is packing his bag
rudy is watching
where are you going
i dont know
i just want to get out of this town
and if youve got any sense when you get old enough youll get out of here too
your moms gonna live in this town for the rest of her life and you know why
because she thinks she has to
dont ask me why but thats the truth
she thinks theres all these things she has to do but you want to know one thing about your mom
shes a bigger fuck up than i ever was
i mean i know i messed up
you think i enjoy getting thrown in jail because i wanted you to face that prick your dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he
i know i got a little carried away and i lost my temper just a little bit which is not the end of the world either by the way just
for future reference and now shes kickin me out of my own house because you know because i fucked up a little bit
which i totally admit
i was like totally ready to admit that
he is finished stuffing his clothes into his backpack
i could go with you
well thanks man
but i uh i cant really take care of you
sammy is flipping channels on the tv
the doorbell rings
she is surprised
she gets up
terry comes thundering down the stairs carrying his backpack

yeah im just gonna stay at rays till i take off
you dont have to do that
well thats what i wanna do so well but are you gonna come back to say good bye
no im just gonna take off
ill see you later
well terry opens the door
ray is there
terry closes the door behind him
sammy listens to the pickup truck drive off
the sound fades
terry is bunked down on rays horrible sofa
in the b
there is a light on in the bedroom
terry fluffs his pillow and shuts his eyes
dressed for work and school sammy and rudy walk to the car
i know youre upset about uncle terry leaving and so am i
but hes just not in control of himself and i dont want him hurting your feelings anymore or mine
and you may not like it but thats how its gotta be
i dont care
you dont care
i dont care either
sammy sits in front of brians desk
im sorry youre havin all this trouble
but you made a pretty good speech to me yesterday about people sticking to their commitments
you made a commitment to this bank sammy
to this job
i know id and to working things out with this tough new son of a bitch boss of yours
and whatever might have passed between us after hours doesnt mean you just walk away from that commitment yeah even when you have a legitimate family emergency
im really sorry i didnt which is why i think in the calm cold light of day we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want
to continue on here at merchants national trust
youre not serious
youre not happy im not happy its not good for you and it sure as heck isnt good for the bank
you know youre the worst manager weve ever had
come on sammy
by far the worst
i dont wanna trade insults with you
well i dont want to be fired brian
ive been working here for seven years
well and if i were you id be a little nervous about firing an employee i just had an affair with
thats dont threaten me sammy im not threatening you
i its just an area i think we should explore
im not thr you explore it
im going back to work
she heads for the door stops
oh and i have to pick up rudy today because theres no one else to do it
but ill find someone as soon as i have time
why dont you just take over the whole bank
sammy hesitates in the doorway
this thought has never occurred to her before
she goes out
through the window we see sammy and bob having lunch
sammy watches him eat full of mixed feelings about him
sammy is at the stove making pancakes
she puts a last pancake onto rudys plate and brings it to him
well i called where uncle terry said he was gonna stay and there was no answer so i dont know if hes still in town or not
rudy doesnt answer
are you not speaking to me
rudy doesnt answer
well im sorry youre so mad at me but i only did what i thought i had to do and i hope you dont stay mad at me for the
rest of your life
he opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes
rudy thats too much
he keeps pouring
she grabs the bottle from him and upsets some of the dishes on the table
you gotta cut this out
what did i do
you dont know what youre talking about
there was nothing else i could do
i cant explain it better than that but you cant go on like this because you dont know anything about it and you dont know what youre doing
frightened ok im sorry
i dont want you to be sorry i just want you to stop it
im stopping im sorry
he comes around the table to her
im not doing it
hes very alarmed
sammy looks at him for a long moment
terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his way up the hill through the tombstones
he reaches his parents graves
he looks at the tombstones for a moment
he puts his hand on top of one headstone then the other
he sits down and smokes
he looks up at the sky
its a beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds
he looks out over the hilly scenery
after a moment he shakes his head a few times
he doesnt even know hes doing it
he sits there
the phone is ringing as terry walks into the house
he walks past it to the fridge gets a beer and opens it
it keeps ringing
he picks it up
into phone rays house
sammy is at her desk on the phone
we cut between them
terry doesnt say anything
i didnt know if you left yet

sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes
rudy is finishing up his cereal
the clock reads
you should get your sneakers on
sammy comes out and looks up and down the road
rudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket
his knapsack is on the floor beside him
he looks at the clock
sammy comes into the living room and looks at him
sweetie im sorry we have to go
why cant i miss school one day
they hear the pickup pull up outside o
rudy gets up immediately
terry jumps out of rays pickup
sammy opens the front door and rudy runs out toward terry
hey hows it goin man
rudy stops short in front of terry
terry looks at sammy in the doorway
sorry im late
the car stops across the street from the bus
the last kids are getting in
sammy honks for the bus driver and sammy terry and rudy all get out
if i write you a letter will you write me back
ok well thats gonna be pretty nice for you because i write a pretty goddamn interesting letter

rudy hugs terry
terry hugs him back
he is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of rudys head
rudy walks to the bus and gets on
the bus pulls away
alone now sammy and terry are not that comfortable
he moves to get back in the car and she does the same
sammy and terry sit on a bench near the bus stop
terrys backpack is by his side
do you need some cash for the bus
no i got a few bucks

pause terry i dont even know where youre going
oh well i didnt really have a concrete plan yet

she looks at him
remember when we were kids remember what we always used to say to each other
pause remember when we were kids
of course i do
she throws her arms around his neck
he pats her gently
the doors open and terry comes up the steps and into the bus
outside sammy watches him pay the driver and move through the bus toward his seat
the bus doors close
sammy waves till the bus drives all the way down main street turns a corner and is gone
terry in his seat turns forward and watches the view go by
he smiles a little
the morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into the car as sammy drives along toward work
she passes the town hall clock and sees that its
she dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her window to let the morning breeze blow through
squaring her shoulders a little she drives through town at a slow and easy pace
