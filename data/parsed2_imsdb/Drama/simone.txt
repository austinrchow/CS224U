href b b simone by andrew niccol by andrew niccol the colored shapes dart around the screen the impression of looking through a kaleidoscope
as the image comes into sharp focus we discover that we are inside a candy bowl
a mans fingers are frantically removing all the cherry flavored pieces of candy
the man performing this curious task is writer producer director viktor taransky forties conservatively dressed in suit and tie
he sits alone at an empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage some distance from the rest of the film set a breeze blows the tables paper cloth
viktor finishes sorting
finding no trash can to deposit the rejected cherry candy he scoops them into his pocket
a young headset clad p
he looks ill
taransky viktor reads the young p
s panicked expression
dont tell me shes walking
blood slowly draining from his face she is not walking
she cant walk
nicola anders twenty something a list actress beautiful face scowling is supervising her assistant ferrying clothes from a movie trailer to a limousine
viktor desperately follows after nicola
how was your massage
youre in breach
is this about the new pages
i made the changes you wanted youre in virtually every scene wheeling on him its not the size of the role viktor
suddenly very cool am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set
regarding the enormous silver fish behind them confused its the biggest on earth
its a foot airstream they dont make them any longer than that
viktor looks up in horror
the trailer next to nicolas does indeed appear to be fractionally taller
walking away youve insulted me for the last time
viktor looks to the tires
his face suddenly brightens
nicola its just the tires theyre over inflated
i can fix it
viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen
air hisses out
see its lower already
nicola ignores viktor marching towards her limo with her publicist
abandoning the trailer viktor hurries after her
i beg you
you cant do this to me
looking back i had three other offers
i only signed on to this picture out of
then show some
theyll shut me down
opening the car door it wasnt working anyhow
the scene with the thousand geese i dont understand this film
i dont think anyone will understand it
i already put out a press release citing creative differences
viktor stops nods resignedly suddenly very calm
you know what nicola youre right
picking up her last piece of luggage here let me help you with that
holding the door for her you ought to go
the truth is i dont deserve you
this film doesnt deserve you
frankly it deserves much much better
the reason its not working is because youre not about the work
nicola is stunned
to the limo driver to hell please
the door slams and the limo roars away
viktor looks to the still hissing trailer tire
the crew regards viktor apprehensively
to the crew what are you looking at
get back to work
the crew is uncertain what work there is to do
in an ornate bedroom nicola lies on her death bed under a veil of netting
a distraught man hal sits close by
are you there
im right beside you
a nun enters
to hal you should really go now
no its alright
please let him stay
the nun withdraws
hal holds his face in his hands almost breaking down
a glance to heaven what kind of cruel god is it that would take you away from me
the same one who brought me to you
i cannot accept it
if something like this can happen
struggling to find the words what is it for
smiles through her pain why are we here
is that what youre asking jack
why are we here
nicola dies peacefully
viktor sits with leading man hal three executives and studio head elaine christian watching a rough assembly of the film
it ends with a close up of nicola anders
the lights go up
the image of nicola fades off the screen
you can hardly tell shes reading off a teleprompter
ignoring him ive analyzed the footage
weve got almost everything we need in the can
if we rework the script we can finish the film without her
forceful shake of the head according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today
theyll sue if the film is released with nicola in a single frame
more anxious so well re cast
nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role
incredulous its a re make hal
anders is not bigger than this picture
elaine finally speaks up
of course she is
no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her
we dont need a name
well cast an unknown
i wont play opposite an unknown
we cant sell an unknown
nicolas soured on the project and we have to accept that
if we ever want to be in the nicola anders business again we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture
the executives leading man and director nod sagely
you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch
a wince addressing everyone but viktor excuse us
elaine ushers viktor out of the screening room
elaine and viktor talk in the shadow of an enormous soundstage
they speak more freely in each others company
why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself
he produces a handful of candy from his pocket
referring to the candy do you know what these are elaine
talking a piece of candy and eating it hmm
mike and ikes
not just any mike ikes cherry mike ikes
do you know why i viktor taransky two time academy award nominated director viktor that was short subject
overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike ikes
elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as viktor paces
i have a feeling youre going to tell me
ill tell you why
it is because miss nicola anders supermodel with a sag card gods gift to cinema has it written into her contract that all cherry mike ikes be removed from her
candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels her nanny must fly with her first class
whats wrong with that
elaine she doesnt have any children
grabbing her arm dont you see
were being held hostage by men and women who someone somewhere has decreed are the a list
the public decides whos on that list
its the truth
those superstars are our insurance policy
we cant open cant make a profit without them
we can hardly make a profit with them
up front salary back end deal perks per diem percentages theyre mocking us elaine
were at their mercy
staring wistful into space we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars
we used to decide who would play what role
we told them what to wear what to say who to date
when they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to more than once
regarding him as if hes insane you realize youre nostalgic for an era you werent even born in
irritated at her infuriating logic well i do remember why i started out in this business you seem to have forgotten working in new york with cassevetes we were trying
to do something important shine a light in that darkened cinema rolling her eyes its called a projector
ignoring her illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
listen viktor i have good memories of those days too but this isnt about that or you or me or some high minded ideal
this is business
gesturing at the studio lot christ viktor look around
what do you think pays for all this
this is about investment and return
those days in new york
viktor reads elaines face
youre not renewing my contract
how can i
your last three pictures tanked
the board is giving me hell
no bankable star will work with you after this
if you just compromised
viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the news
rueful smile well its not every day youre fired by the mother of your own child
elaine also eats some more candy a curiously intimate moment between them
softening a heart to heart im not taking away your daughter just your deal
you and i both know after the divorce i kept you on for old times sake so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey
i called whats his name at warners
he said hed take a meeting in july
ive fought for you viktor
voice trails off you want to talk severance
staring off into the distance face hardening you can have everything office car assistants all i want is the picture
confused the pictures dead
so theres no problem i can have the rights the negative too
believing shes getting off lightly theyre yours
but how are you going to finish it
without a star theres no movie
i dont need a star
all i need is an actor ill reshoot the part cut out nicola and replace her with a real actor
a real leading lady
even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns viktor
if theyre good they get known
and then youre back to sorting their candy
kissing him on the cheek as she departs in her studio golf cart im sorry viktor
viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages left alone on the deserted lot
twenty nicola anders faces jiggle into frame
viktors face appears amongst them
they are cardboard figures standing together in the trailer of an electric cart
a workman is collecting the promotional standees from around the lot
viktor places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut out we sense he is about to rip her head off when a fourteen year old girl lainey appears
beside him carrying a laptop computer
slightly ashamed hello sweetheart
viktor embarrassed by his childishness steps aside for the suspicious workman who carries the standee away
lainey smiles sweetly
she hugs him
im sorry mom canned you
shrugging its really
not anything lainey
its just dont feel too bad
glancing to a standee mom runs the place and they still walk all over her
youre better off out of it
regarding his daughter you look very grown up
what are you doing
you meeting your mom for dinner
she glances towards the entrance where laineys mother elaine and her dependable uncomplicated businessman boyfriend kent wait beside elaines car
reluctant admission kent got tickets to the ballet
viktor shakes the idea of kent and elaine from his head
trying to convince himself as much as lainey im going to finish the picture sweetheart
not quite convinced i know youll do it dad
youre viktor taransky
lainey kisses the forlorn viktor goodbye
she runs to her mother and kent
to himself thats right
im viktor taransky
from a distance elaine and kent regard the lonely figure of you had no choice elaine
hes a liability
wistful look to viktor he also happens to be the most talented man ive ever known
elaine climbs in the car as lainey approaches
close up on a copy of variety
the front page banner headline anders rides out of sunset cites creative differences the man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on a studio tour
he wears a pair of spectacles with one lens blacked out his head tilted on one side
it is an item buried on the inside pages that catches hanks one good eye
directors future now in doubt the tram pauses
the tour guide keeps up a commentary
on your left the house where claris commodore uttered those now immortal words if that door doesnt hold stand behind me
and coming up on your right when the tram departs we discover that hank has exited the tram and is hiding in the facade of a new york subway entrance
the tag around his neck reads visitor stay with the tour
viktor wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding several framed black and white photographs of screen legends under his arm
hank hiding in the shadows of the soundstages spies viktor
he hurries towards him as viktor approaches his antiquated bentley
ive been trying to see you calling your assistant wouldnt put me through
i told her it was a matter of life and death
i was afraid i wouldnt get to you in time using his stack of film cans as a barrier please get away from me
i did it mr
i licked skin
i licked hair
i licked every part of her
more disturbed fearing he is dealing with a pervert you want me to call security
i have her mr
the answer to your prayers
producing the variety article conspiratorial the answer to this
regarding the article i was misquoted
i have your new leading lady
indicating the bulge in his pocket right here in my pants
viktor takes a step back concerned once again about the mans motives
trying to reassure its me mr
dont you recognize me
the future of film conference in san jose
i was keynote speaker
you must remember my speech
who needs humans
faint glimmer of recognition thats right
you were booed off the stage
thats got to be
eight years ago
in that whole time i never left my computer
wary good for you hank
referring to his covered eye good and bad
they think thats what caused this
me eye tumor
microwaves from the screen
its the size of a grapefruit
regarding the pathetic figure with the tilted head im sorry
it was worth it
hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket
viktor now understands the significance of the gesture
you have to see her
loading cans into the car ive seen them all before
not like this patronizing smile come on hank
a synthespian virtual actor
irritated we call them vactors
i need flesh and flesh is weak
a living breathing actor i cant work with a fake
viktor loads his film cans into the car
pointing to nicola in variety you already do
but my actor wont get old fat lazy or drunk wont throw tantrums demand a body double script changes or a bigger trailer
whispers conspiratorial the disney corporation has been using artificial actors for years
thats the point hank
no matter how good they are theyre still mickey mouse
it cant be done
it can with my new computer code you and me we can do it together
i dont know anything about computers
thats why youre so perfect
you have something i dont have
an eye for performance
you know the truth when you see it
ive seen your movies
i love your movies
straw god changed my life
you saw that
ive seen every frame of your work
youre the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision
you and me art and science
we are the perfect marriage
listen hank its been a rough day
climbing into his car ill call you about his next week
at the car window i wont be here next week
the tumors inoperable
ill be dead
winding down the window im already dead
viktors car roars away
he looks back at the forlorn hank in the rear view mirror
looking at his watch this week
a huge eye from a dismantled nicola anders billboard is wheeled away behind him followed by a huge pair of lips
a sea of ingenue headshots
black xs are drawn through all of them
viktor lies amongst the rejected faces talking on the telephone in his spartan bachelor beach house
into phone referring to a young womans headshot what do you mean she wont work with me
shes done nothing
she doesnt have a single credit from phone off camera better no credits than a taransky credit
no young actress is going to step into nicola anders shoes and risk ending her career before its even started
art you dont understand
ive mortgaged everything to finish this film creditors calling coming to the house for gods sake i need this the phone goes dead
viktor tries to re dial disconnected
sharp knock on his door
viktor peers through a curtain and spies an official looking man in a suit carrying what looks to be a legal notice in his hands
viktor slips out of the back door
viktor hurries along the beach
when he turns he discovers the man in the suit following him
as viktor runs the suit runs calling out to him
taransky calling back im not him
when he recovers the suit is on him
taransky sir i represent the estate of mr
showing him hanks obituary in the l
times it was mr
alenos last wish that you have this
the suit hands viktor a heavily sealed envelope
what is it
i have no idea sir
he wanted you to have it
the suit departs
viktor hesitates then breaks the seal on the package inside he finds a hard drive
the hard drive is labeled simulation one
a vacuum cleaner cleaning a tatty red carpet
on the other end of the vacuum cleaner is viktor
the red carpet leads to a rundown downtown los angeles cinema the venue for the premiere of sunrise sunset
to save money on posters viktor has altered the originals starring nicola anders crudely pasted over with introducing simone
viktor regards the sad little premiere
no paparazzi no limos no klieg lights
resorting to giving away tickets to passers by viktor approaches a homeless man sleeping in trash
want to see a free movie
he thinks no
a taxi pulls up
viktors daughter lainey steps out
kissing him hello hi dad
viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesnt have quite enough cash
lainey pays herself
your mother couldnt make it
shes at the premiere of a cold day in hell
but i think she send someone from acquisitions
she still with kent
this week anyhow
viktor escorts lainey down the empty red carpet regarding the pathetic premiere
as they walk by the bulb in viktors sole spotlight expires
not quite how i imagined it looking on the bright side you finished the film on your own terms thats what matters
did you really do all the post yourself
there was no other way
i missed you
i wondered if you were ever coming back
regarding the makeshift poster trying to lift his spirits well i cant wait to meet simone
whats her last name
you know i
is she here tonight
she cant watch herself
they are interrupted by the theater owner
hey we have to start
ive got tough love playing at ten
a foggy empty pier
a man is running through the mist shouting desperately
finally out of the fog a young woman in a black cape and hood her back to us
the camera pushes in music swells and she turns
she is exquisitely ethereally beautiful
in the near empty dilapidated theater sunrise sunset is playing on the screen
when simones face appears the faces of the audience members change
they are all visibly moved including the theater owner
some weeping some with curious smiles on their faces some opened mouthed
on screen approaching valarie what are you running from
enigmatic smile from valarie
suddenly a gunshot rings out
simone collapses to the ground
running to her valarie
viktor unable to watch paces up and down chain smoking while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth
viktor finally musters the courage to look inside the auditorium
the same scene that played in the studio screening room
however now when we cut from the leading man hal to the leading lady it is not nicola but the newly cast simone
why are we here
is that what youre asking jack
why are we here
on screen simone lies dying
now even lainey is affected by simones performance
she wipes a tear from her eye
viktor watches the backs of the heads trying to gauge the audience reaction
finally the credits roll
a dedication for hank
no one moves from their seats
viktor permits himself a brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the credits a film by viktor taransky still no one moves from their seats
viktor cannot stand it any longer
he runs to the restroom
face over the stained sink viktor splashes himself with water
he looks to the mirror horrified by his own reflection
he rehearses a courtroom speech
ladies and gentlemen of the jury i may be guilty of a crime but it was committed with the purest of intentions to send a message to the acting community
who put themselves above the work and above three audience members enter the restroom
they approach the urinals
continuing their conversation from the lobby so fake
viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits missing the end of their conversation
were really supposed to believe that was th century lisbon
whos looking at the sets when she is on the screen
all three nod in agreement and begin to urinate
viktor exits the restroom
almost all the audience members including lainey are waiting for him
pointing out her father there he is
thats my dad viktor taransky
viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group spontaneously applauds
they rush to shake his hand
she is magnificent
viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments
she wasnt too
or are you talking about the mother
a star like that who cares about the supporting cast
not of this earth
you should be very proud
not of this earth
a good way of putting it
and the film as a whole
the group drifts away leaving lainey and viktor alone
shes a miracle dad
where did you find her
vague i saw her picture on the er
interrogating his daughters face you really didnt notice anything unusual
only her brilliance
to be honest with what you had to work with i was expecting a train wreck
you really pulled it off
lainey regards the makeshift poster
i have a feeling mom is going to take you back after this
viktors head snaps around
back on the lot
viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding
viktor enters his sterile bachelor home carrying his mail
his answering machine blinks in the darkness the message light reads full
he hits the play button
viktor you bastard
i hear its great
beat seriously im happy for you
viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and elaine from happier times
he gazes at it as he listens to the message
i know people are going to be beating down your door but
well id love the chance to buy back something i gave away for free
dont you just love hollywood
viktor stops the machine dazed
he idly opens his mail
inside an envelope he finds a sag card with the new members name simone
a a line of audience members stretches outside the rundown movie theater as far as the eye can see
a dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie going audiences across the nation
b the front page of variety coming off the presses reads simone a revelation dawning of a new star in in her debut film sunrise sunset
c a teenage boy in a public library logs on to the first website dedicated to simone
her face is already posted on everything from websites to bedroom walls
d trendy teenage girls saunter past a swimming pool in simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat
her wardrobe has inspired a fashion craze
e in a third world back alley a young asian man shows an undercover reporter a pirated recording of simone on a camcorder
and bootleg copies of her film are being sold in back alleys all over the world
f a liquor store customer watches a tv behind the counter showing a clip of simone from sunrise sunset courtesy taransky productions
from tv but who is simone
we know so little about her
no details of her background have been released not even her age
she is somewhere between a girl and a woman
a fresh face and familiar both at the same time
g the entertainment reporter now stands outside a multiplex
the marquee has screens and looks like this is simone even her real name
and why the secrecy
all we know for sure is that she was discovered by little known director viktor tarinsky
viktor watching scene on a tv in the back of a limousine corrects the reporter
from the tv he has parlayed his relationship with the new sensation into a three picture deal with the very studio that dumped him only six months ago
and no wonder with the starlets performance breaking all box office records
outside the studio entrance a swarm of reporters photographers and fans rush viktors limousine hoping for a glimpse of simone
i love you
i want to be you
studio security guards hold them back as the limo enters the lot
elaine and an entourage of executives greets viktors limousine on the studio steps
a studio photographer has a camera at the ready
a banner reads welcome simone
a young assistant wheels a cake
viktor steps out of the car
elaine pushes past him into the limo
the car is empty
re emerging from the car where is she
good to see you too elaine
ignoring his sarcasm why isnt she with you
because she would never show up at something like this
shes intensely private
elaine sighs exasperated
dismissing her colleagues back to work everyone
shes not here
the reception committee disperses murmurs of disappointment
i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio
dont thank me
it was entirely simones decision
do you have simones check
i dont have it on me
anyway it means a lot
quickly changing tack have you read the reviews
theyre love letters
reading from a newspaper listen to this one
simone has the voice of a young jane fonda the body of sophia loren the grace of well grace kelley and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel
musing to himself almost right
i cant wait to meet her
i dont know if thats going to happen
confused why not
as i say shes
something of a recluse
thats how shes able to stay so pure by isolating herself in her art
face falling dont be ridiculous
i arranged a press conference
out of the question
a circus like that
viktor its my studio
shes my actor
there are other studios elaine
theres only one simone
leaving her on the steps leave the press conference to me
viktor strides up the studio steps
elaine stares after her ex husband she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance
the studio soundstages as a backdrop viktor approaches a podium and a forest of microphones revelling in his recent fame by association
tapping the microphone is this on
who are you
t a r a n s k y v i k t o r
yeah but who are you
patronizing smile i am a two time academy award nominated director with over eighteen films to my credit thus far including my latest release sunrise sunset
who are you
a reporter rolls her eyes at his pomposity
i will not be taking any questions
however i do have a statement to read on behalf of my leading lady simone
reading from his statement to whom it may concern
im deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to mr
at this time i will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances since i am really nothing without the beautiful worlds and characters mr
taransky creates for me
i politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself
all questions and inquiries should be directed to mr
taransky to whom i entrust all aspects of my career
yours very truly simone
the reporters all call out at once
viktor viktor whos simone dating
viktor whered you find her
is simone her real name
whats she got to hide
is she the new garbo
viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his hands
i thought i made it clear no questions regarding simone
bringing the press conference to a hasty conclusion now i would like to close by announcing that miss simone begins production today on her next film eternity forever
this project has been near and dear to my heart since i wrote it nine years ago
a tinge of bitterness then a smile i thank you
viktor exits the podium
a voice stops him in his tracks
who do you think youre fooling taransky
the voice belongs to over zealous crusading truth seeking investigative reporter max sayer accompanied by his assistant milton
do i know you
max sayer national echo
regaining his composure a smirk dont you have a real story to write
why arent you in latin america
this is the story
i remember when the echo had class the paper that could bring down governments
our leaders arent presidents anymore theyre pop stars and screen idols
if woodward and bernstein were alive today theyd be right here in hollywood with me
they are alive sayer
milton confirms that woodward and bernstein are still living
so theyre probably here
hardly missing a beat you might be able to sell this disappearing act to the rest of the world but im not buying it
whats really behind this simone woman
the public has a right to know
why is she staying out of sight
and why the hell is she with you
i dont want you to take this the wrong way viktor but youre not exactly cecil b
demille more run of the mill
maybe the reason shes with me is a little thing called integrity sayer
look it up
viktor walks away
calling after him oh i know all about integrity
i know even more about persistence
look that one up
max watches viktor depart with obvious suspicion
a large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage
closed set is the sign on the door a surveillance camera panning the entrance
a security guard also keeping watch nods a greeting to viktor as he pulls up in his studio golf cart script in hand
no one came in or went out just like you said mr
is miss simone coming today
shes already here
she arrived before you and shell leave long after youve gone
admonishing guard remember under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission
what if it catches on fire
let it burn
simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy
viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters the soundstage
the cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a tablet attached to a large projection screen monitor and two
viktor takes a seat in front of the monitor
to himself as he inserts his hollywood hard drive pay no attention to the man behind the computer
a title appears on his computer screen
welcome to with a satisfied smile viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to welcome to he presses enter and a face begins to build wire upon wire pixel
upon pixel until a completed synthespian emerges simone
she is indistinguishable from a flesh and blood actress
simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background titled visual loop
within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal
she looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long
to the screen good morning simone
good morning mr
a star is
only now do we observe that viktor is occasionally talking into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a key on his keyboard
when he speaks she speaks
simones voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to viktors voice
a scanning light on viktor allows simone to mimic his movements
you mean they buy it
nervous smile as he examines his first royalty check buy it
theyre paying for it
and around here thats how you really know they buy it
viktor fondly touches a photograph of hank that is taped to the terminal from the l
im only sorry hank isnt here to see this
viktor looks up simone mimicking his action
depressing the button every time he wants to express his thoughts through simone maybe he can
do you have any idea what this means simone
our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it
appearing to indulge viktor with a smile i am the death of real
pondering the enormity of the hoax you are birth of
a new era in show business
all i wanted to do was finish the film
and now look what youve started
and now look what youve started
and now look what youve started
viktors conversation with himself is not merely for his own amusement
he is adjusting and refining simones voice
a little less streep a little more bacall
viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars living and dead that comprise simone
viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen dedicated to simones audio incorporating the vocal deliveries streep bacall
he speaks once again as simone to test the adjustment
the voice patterns appear on his screen graphic representations of the sound waves
is that better mr
yes it is
viktor snaps back to reality himself
he scrolls through the list of screen legends
he clicks on the image of audrey while i think of it id like you to add something to your repertoire remember that thing hepburn does in breakfast at tiffanys
a clip of audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffanys plays on the screen
hepburn sitting on a fire escape looks up
from the screen an incomparable smile hi
pausing the moment lets hear you say hi like audrey
with a cut and paste viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly into a frozen simone
viktor presses play
imitating audreys performance perfectly hi
stretching god im so relaxed around you
you did create me
just helped bring someone elses dream to life
taransky we both know i was nothing without you
i was computer code ones and zeros
of course one doesnt want to boast
its a classic case of technology in search of an artist
thats all youve been waiting for an artist with integrity with a vision who can see
viktor gets up and starts walking around the room warming to his theme
simone moves in a visual loop on the monitor nodding attentively as if shes really interested
see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood
see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake the scales have tipped in favor of the fake
voice raising in excitement see that if the performance is genuine it doesnt matter if the actor is real
once a performance is committed to film the blood and bones are gone anyway
only the spirit the illusion remains
besides whats real anymore
these days most actors have digital work done to them so its a gray area
simone appears to look directly at her maker are you ever going to tell the truth about me mr
the only real truth is in the work
you know what im talking about
yes im going to tell the truth about you why wouldnt i
pondering his own question of course with hanks tragic passing the secret died with him
shaking the thought from his head i am going to tell the truth
after your next picture
feeling uneasy at the prospect viktor changes the subject
he pulls out his script for eternity forever
speaking of which this is the project id like you to do next
not eternity forever
the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made
id kill for that part
i was hoping youd say that
suddenly simone appears to talk on her own
ill do anything to please you mr
pretending to be hard of hearing im sorry i didnt catch that
what did you say
ill do anything to please you mr
on a side monitor we discover a highlighted box marked pre record viktors finger on the play button
he is unable to resist speaking another line
and i will never ever leave you
simone appears to indulge viktor by blowing him a kiss until we see that viktor has now highlighted a box marked viktor comes close to the monitor
he notices something about simones face
youre so beautiful
viktor accesses a program labeled distinguishing features
he adds a freckle and a mole
from a distance we watch him alone with simone in the vast empty soundstage
viktors face against the sky
as he walks we reveal that the sky is no more than a huge painted backdrop on the studio lot behind a parking lot
viktor hands his valet ticket to a fawning valet manager
just be a minute mr
we gave you a complimentary car wash theyre washing the engine now
viktor joins other industry movers and shakers waiting for their cars under an umbrella
a young talent agent approaches
look im sorry i didnt call you back last year
i was er
out of the country
strained moment but we should get together
my schedules wide open
the agents face falls
he gets in his car disconsolate
suddenly hal sinclair rushes over and hugs viktor
viktor im so happy for us
no reflections on nicola but simone and i we were just so right together
you never were together hal
and still the connection was undeniable
aside i havent read eternity forever but i know its brilliant
and i know i would be perfect for clive
correcting him clyde
lowering his voice as a matter of fact i ran into simone on the lot the other day
genuinely startled really
she didnt mention it
quickly covering im sure shes meeting with a lot of people right now
under his breath she is just as you described her viktor
i strongly sensed she thought i was right for it
behind his back viktor surreptitiously presses a button on his cell phone
the phone rings
viktor feigns surprise and answers
answering the phone he has just dialed louder than necessary hello
how are you sweetheart
a hush descends over the executives
hal is suddenly very uncomfortable
even the valets strain to eavesdrop on the conversation
winking to hal youll never guess who im with
you ran into him on the lot
it was more in passing
youre so far off
finally chuckles hal
your co star
no i dont think hes put on weight
a shrug of apology to the appalled hal anyway you think hes right for eternity forever
not the right type
a different direction
covering phone to hal ill try to talk her into it
the other industry people make a note of the remark
a mortified hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave climbing into his car
into phone listen this is a bad place to talk
sweetheart i know you have charity work you want to do i know you want to give back but remember your greatest gift is your talent
well talk about it at the beach house this weekend
im looking forward to it too
viktor hangs up
his car pulls up
he tips extravagantly and drives away
the industry people get on their cell phones
parked behind the sky facade is a curious car with shaded windows
inside the car max sayer and assistant milton scanner in hand are replaying viktors intercepted phone call on a computer
from the machine
you think hes right for eternity forever
not the right type
a different direction
to max a shake of the head im getting nothing from her side of the conversation
is it a jamming device
shrugs maybe hes talking to himself
dismissing the idea taransky isnt that good an actor
no theyre taking special precautions
some kind of new encryption
musing whatever it is its dark
they continue listening to the recording
well talk about it at the beach house this weekend
maxs eyes light up
he gazes to a photo of simone pasted to the inside of the car
viktor and lainey make breakfast
lainey is in her pajamas occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father prepares french toast
glancing to the computer cant you stop that
those things can be dangerous
staring at a screen all day you miss whats going on outside in the real world
you can lose yourself
you should get out more
how are you going to meet boys
shrugs coyly getting up i know plenty of boys
where do you meet them
in a chat room
how do you know hes not some middle aged freak
dad i can spot a middle aged freak a mile away
but you have to find a way to escape that thing
i cant tell you how happy i am to hear that
you were the one who insisted on it
reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four
you understood them
thats what was amazing
looking out the window its a nice day
lets eat outside
lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door
we hear a chorus of clicks
actually it may be nicer inside
viktor joins her at the doorway
stay here ill deal with this
unfazed lainey retreats into the house
boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full of telephoto lens toting photographers
the next door houses have lenses protruding through the drapes of the windows
viktor strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach soaking up the attention unable to resist waving extravagantly
suddenly a photographer losing his balance drops from a nearby rooftop
the photographer limps towards the fence
viktor calmly follows retrieving the photographers camera and ripping out the film with a flourish he is clearly relishing the attention
the photographer clambers over the fence where he joins several dozen other shutter bugs and videorazzi
that wasnt her taransky
where is she
you cant hide her forever
hurling the camera into the mob youll never find her
simone only appears when i want her to appear
max sayer from the national echo is at the head of the mob accompanied by assistant milton
she sounds like a prisoner taransky
are you holding her hostage
are you some kind of svengali
recognizing the reporter whos the hostage sayer her or you
you look kind of captive yourself
while youre spending every waking hour obsessing over simone guess what i guarantee she doesnt even know you exist
get off my property or ill call the cops
the cops read my column to know who to bust
were the only watchdog the public has
looking around at the photographers none of this is going away
well be here tomorrow and the day after that
until you slip up
and you will
you are looking at your shadow
getting in his face because all these elaborate precautions with simone every instinct in my body tells me its not natural
im just trying to help you sayer
i dont want you to be disappointed
it gets cold out here at night
if we cant get to her through you maybe your family will be more co operative
i can guarantee you taransky one way or another miss simone and i are going to get acquainted
turning away id like to see that sayer
viktor drives along a twisty mountain road lainey in the passenger seat
they have become so blase about the paparazzi they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle photographers risking their necks to stay up with the car
the rumor is simone is holed up in taranskys malibu home so far we havent seen so much as a glimpse switching off the radio honey im really sorry about
i dont know if its safe for you to stay the weekends
just until things settle down
shrugs okay dad
if anyone asks about simone i know i dont know anything
slightly irritated by her lack of interest dont you wonder where im really hiding simone
looking to him im sure youd tell me if you thought it was important
lainey gives her father a smile
through the car window behind her a motorcyclist appears to lose control and drops down a bank
viktors car pulls up to elaines imposing mansion
lainey gives her father a kiss and departs
elaine in the garden overseeing a gardener pruning roses approaches
from the car sorry i didnt get her back in time
she smiles do you want to come in
surprised pleasantly why not
viktor walks down a hall passing the dining room where kent is working on a computer
kent smiles blandly
disappointed to see him hello kent
viktor waits in an opulent drawing room
despite the eighty degree temperature outside a fire burns in the hearth
elaine enters waving a thick studio file
viktors face falls expecting a less business related conversation
viktor we simply have to talk about eternity
i still havent received simones script notes
there arent any
if the filmmakers are happy simones happy
she considers herself an
oh so shes really going to do all this nudity
shrugs if its on the page
elaine refers to her documents bewildered
well something has to be done about this budget
its completely unrealistic
referring to a column in the budget you allowed nothing for limousine service
shell drive herself
hair and make up
shell do her own
she was in the theater
ill send you her resume
al least a contingency for wardrobe
any woman can go up a dress size
i guarantee she wont gain an once
shes very disciplined
concerned by an entry in the budget well we have to do something about this stuntwoman
what about it
there isnt one
she does all her own stunts
skeptical even the fall from the plane
nonchalant even the fall from the plane
well shoot it on the last day
viktor regards elaine with a condescending look
as ive tried to explain to you elaine
simone isnt like any other actress youve ever known
shes about the work and only the work lives for the work
she wants all the money up there
gazing into space on the screen where it belongs
shed work for scale except i know you only respect people you pay a fortune
which accounts for your percentage
tossing the budget on the coffee table when do i get to meet this dream
shes learning her lines
glancing to elaines budget you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
smiles ill walk you out
elaine escorts viktor out to the lavish garden
elaines demeanor softens
she speaks to viktor quietly sympathetically
i want to talk to you now not as elaine studio head but elaine ex wife
correcting herself second ex wife
you got lucky this last time but you need to be careful
we both know you wouldnt be making this overblown art film of you hadnt convinced simone to be in it
elaine talking to you now not as viktor director but viktor ex husband
what the hell happened to you
exasperated experience viktor
ive seen this a hundred times young stars destroying the very people who discovered them
im worried about you thats all
this woman she controls your destiny
simone does not control my destiny
viktor i have a feeling
one of my feelings
theres something about her i dont trust
from her bedroom window on the mansions second floor lainey smiles at the sight of her mother and father together
viktor enters his office where hes greeted by his assistant sheepish thanks for taking me back mr
i know it looked like i sided with the studio but i always believed in you honestly
referring to the cast seated around a conference table theyre all here
viktor sits at the head of the table surrounded by hal lotus mac and three other cast members
a preliminary poster behind him coming this summer simone in eternity forever bears a huge photograph of simones face
i cant tell you how delighted i am to have this wonderful cast assembled for eternity forever
thank you all
now a reminder as a condition for working on this film you will not be rehearsing with simone shooting with simone and you are forbidden from contacting simone in any
way at any time whatsoever
the cast nods seriously
a thought occurs how will you do our love scenes
confused for her
addressing the entire cast i want you to know simone appreciates you all working for scale
but why am i thanking you
simone can thank you herself
she insisted on speaking with you before filming begins
shes on the line now
viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table a red blinking light on the phone
the cast reacts excitedly
pushing a button on the phone simone are you there
through the speakerphone i certainly am mr
unable to contain her excitement so are we simone
everyone laughs giddily
why dont you leave me alone with my co stars mr
taransky so we can get to know each other better
ill be back in a minute
dont be shy
the cast stares nervously at the speakerphone
mac breaks the silence
i turned down a bertolucci film to be here
my names lotus
god i cant believe im talking to you
were going to become such great friends
wonderful to be working together
the other cast members introduce themselves
viktor pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters
viktor races across the vast empty space to a digital player connected to a phone
simones pre recorded opening remarks graphically represented on the screen are almost completed
is that everyone
pause well obviously as you know
viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time speaking through the synthesizer
as usual viktors voice is automatically synthesized into the voice of simone
the other cast members laugh nervously
from viktors speakerphone obviously
from speaker phone i just want to start by apologizing for my process the cast are hunched over the speakerphone
im completely simpatico
on my last film i was playing a schizophrenic so i made them give me two dressing rooms
an aside so committed
well thank you for your understanding
i know its an unusual way to work but i just find i relate better to people when theyre not actually there
of course of course
i dont have much to say except that i know its going to be a great project if we all just trust mr
always do what mr
if in doubt do it the taransky way
they all nod vigorously in agreement
i know were going to make a wonderful movie together
nodding in agreement wonderful movie
viktor removes his own garbage from his soundstage
a young cleaning woman vivian wheeling a janitors cart tentatively approaches
referring to the stage no one goes in there
oh i know
vivian hesitantly hands viktor a publicity photo of simone
if its not too much trouble
hesitant about broaching the subject this last year i was
going through some things
shaking her head at the memory awful awful
but when i saw simone in sunrise
what she did
in the scene in the fireworks factory
face lighting up suddenly everything made sense
my friends family doctors nobody could reach me but simone she really
spoke to me
viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony
shell be happy to sign it
a green set
walls floor ceiling all green
a full cast shoots hal dressed in a futuristic suit tentatively crossing the green expanse
hal pauses looks longingly then impulsively dashes forward
hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the ground
viktor runs from behind the camera and confronts hal on the green floor
hal what are you doing
viktor clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene
he has to touch her
he has to
but shes right there
i must feel her
struggling to find an excuse theres
a wall between you an emotional wall i know
thats why no
a real wall
describing a wall with his hands within the green space you ran right through it
confused how did the wall get there
i cant explain it to you now youll see when its all put together
walking away anyway we got it a couple of takes ago
lets move on
hal dumbfounded tentatively touches the non existent wall
viktor digitally adds simone standing beside a sportscar with hal in a scene from eternity forever
he works on her close up
eyes welling with tears what you dont understand clyde is that love is like a wild flower but that flower only grows viktor hits stop and simone freezes
viktor brings up a menu and chooses from a range of emotional options
elated melancholy anxious jubilant tearful frightened giddy weeping petrified ecstatic blubbering loss of bladder inebriated kevorkian control reflective chaste seductive thoughtful virtuous lustful meditative angelic bestial stoic madonna madonna bored
out of her blessed virgin like a virgin skull he fine tunes simones performance sliding a cursor on a performance axis from broad to subtle
lets take it down a notch
what you dont understand simone freezes again
viktor make another adjustment
i like it
but still too big
making a correction smaller teardrops next time
simones tears retreat into her eyes
its not working
its not alive
lets try it again
she repeats the line
viktor mimes the performance
teardrops arriving on cue what you dont understand clyde is that love is like a wild flower but that flower only grows on the edge
dramatic pause of a very high cliff
viktor returns simone to her neutral background
im only sorry you still have to work with flesh and blood for the time being as user friendly as you are even i cant manufacture an entire cast
love simone viktor writes on the publicity shot
he applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo
viktor wipes his mouth and looks to simone on his screen she is waiting patiently as usual
we are going to have to change our plans simone you have no idea what an affect your performance is having on people
we cant stop now
theres too much to say these films they speak they speak to the human condition
were changing lives
no revealing the truth now would be too cruel
searching for more justification anyway when youre seeking a greater truth in the work you are not so concerned with the lesser truths along the way
simone doesnt appear convinced
youre going to get in a lot of trouble mr
irritated at her pricking his conscience why do you have to bring that up
theres always risk lifes a risk
its worth it
besides how could something so lovely be a crime
regarding her tenderly well i think weve done enough for today
youve been cooped up in there too long
how about you and me go out on the town
theyre expecting us
he turns to a copy of the echo
a photo of viktor at the gate of his malibu home
simone held captive self proclaimed svengali keeps star out of limelight
viktor puts simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase
viktor briefcase in hand strides through the lobby of an opulent hotel
he approached the concierge
im checking in a special guest
obviously conspiratorial miss enomis
the concierge straightens as he recognizes viktor from a copy of variety
headline taransky rides ingenues coat tails to three picture deal
miss enomis yes
miss enomis demands her privacy
you will switch off all surveillance cameras
i will escort miss enomis to her room alone via the rear exit
she will require no help with her luggage
she does not wish to be disturbed at any time for any reason
she will be departing for a function tonight at eight sharp
tipping him with a hundred dollar bill im sure i can rely on your discretion
do you understand
passing the key to viktor oh i understand
as viktor departs the concierge holds the registration card to the mirror
enomis becomes simone
the concierge picks up his phone
viktor enters the hotel suite
we see a montage of scenes viktor revelling in his masquerade
a viktor pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in the sheets to give it a slept in look
b viktor sprays cologne in the bed
c viktor tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet
d viktor eats several candy bars from the mini bar
e viktor puts one of his own movies in the dvd player
f viktor writes a note on the bedside pad
g in the bathroom shower running viktor attempts to open a tampon it shoots out of the applicator like a penny rocket
h viktor cuts a lock of faux hair from a simone wig and scatters it on the counter
i viktor shakes open a bag of toiletries the toothbrush bouncing into the toilet bowl
he retrieves it
j viktor looks through the drapes of the hotel window a jam of press photographers has congregated outside the rear entrance
k viktor shines a lamp against a doll casting a life size shadow on the drapes
a walking silhouette is visible to the media on the street
l viktor writes a message in lipstick on the mirror i viktor is interrupted by a knock on the door
he looks at his watch
peering through the peephole who is it
from other side of door its
viktor stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy young woman wearing a coat over her head
a hotel doorman keeps back the growing horde of reporters
viktors limousine waits at the curb
the coated woman starts towards the car but viktor holds her back
scrutinizing the crowd wheres matinee
there they are
okay i think everyones here
viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car providing a perfect albeit restricted photo op for the paparazzi
over here sweetheart
come one simone take it off baby
we got a job to do
the car door slams shut as the pack descends
max sayer and milton are amongst the frustrated reporters
the limo screeches away
a police motorcyclist prevents anyone following
the frustrated reporters assess their efforts
i think i got a piece of her ear
i didnt get shit
emerging from the pack to max ten feet from a living goddess
max sayer pays off the concierge
his assistant milton begins to collect evidence of the celebrity dusting for fingerprints etc
max rubs pencil into the impression on the bedside notepad revealing the message the meaning of life is that it ends
interrupting miltons work leave me for a moment
milton and the concierge depart
max is alone
he looks around the room
a max enters the bathroom
he picks up a drinking glass and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed plastic bag
b max examines the wet soap from the shower and also places it in a plastic bag
c max picks up the used toothbrush puts it to his lips before placing it in a plastic bag
d max gently places his hands on the toilet seat
e max enters the bedroom
he carefully removes a slip from a pillow
he folds it meticulously appearing to breathe in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag
f finally max kneels and gazes at simones unmade bed
he slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same sheets recently vacated by viktor
milton ear pressed against the door tries to listen inside
viktor and the coated woman have finally left the paparazzi in their wake
viktor gently removes the coat from over her head
although the woman is impossible beautiful she is not simone
faith is simones latest stand in and decoy
viktor and faith are still pressed together against one side of the limousine
not quite able to avert his eyes from her telescopic legs thank god for you faith
i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand in
you dont know what a service youre performing for simone shielding her from those animals
no thank god for you mr
how many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman
neither viktor nor faith seem inclined to move from their intimate position
you understand youll have to come back to my place to keep them off the er
his nose close to faiths neck scent
meeting her gaze you look so so
so much like her
yes of course but very beautiful in your own right
i do find myself physically attracted to you mr
their lips are now tantalizingly close
viktors head hits the sofa in his living room closely followed by faith on top of him
faith tears at his clothes and her own ravenous
viktor hardly resists
in the midst of the wild caresses faith murmurs in his ear
do whatever you do to simone
what did you say
do what you do to simone
what i do to simone
yes call me simone
still tearing at his clothes yes yes again again
do what you do to simone
i want to know what its like to be her just for one night
confused youre with me to be close to her
panting is that a problem
as viktor ponders the question faith begins to do simones deathbed speech from sunrise sunset
why are we here
is that what youre asking jack
why are we here
this is too much for viktor please put your clothes on viktor gets up from the sofa leaving the frustrated faith to straighten her clothes
the finished scene with simone and hal plays on a screen
viktor watches the rough cut of eternity forever with elaine and daughter lainey
as usual they are mesmerized by the breath taking beautiful simone
the scene ends
the light go up
the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up
turning to his daughter what did you think lainey
one thing bothered me
i know hal is as stiff as always
no not that
i was just wondering in the bedroom scene in reel two why did simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror
viktor is shocked busted
he covers it with a laugh
ashen faced i wondered if youd spot that
youve got a good eye lainey
im proud of you
elaine looks at viktor for an explanation
i got them to remove the reflection
the mirrors metaphor to show how her characters inwardly dead
thats genius viktor
was that simones idea
sarcastic annoyed at the suggestion who else
its always simones idea
not quite convinced so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six
viktor escorts elaine and lainey to elaines car parked outside the theater
as she gets into the car good night daddy
kissing lainey good bye night lainey
elaine and viktor linger a moment outside the car
drawing elaine aside elaine i dont know if its a good idea for lainey to come to the screenings mature content and all that
both look to lainey
from inside the car lainey watches her parents
impressed by his responsible attitude maybe youre right
gently teasing twelve years after your daughters born you decide to become a father
better late than never
softening i should fire you more often
the films looking wonderful
you really think so
to be honest i never quite saw this film before maybe its the way simone is playing it but what its saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life
how thats the only way we can love i think its really going to mean something
ill tell simone you liked it
id love to tell her myself
cajoling when are you going to let me meet her
everyone i know has met her viktor
everyone you know is lying
amused thats true
they instinctively kiss more affectionate than before
however their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera shutter from a nearby bush
the photographer has gone but so has the mood
you know how you can stop that
she has to get out more
climbing into the car see you at the premiere
elaine climbs into her car and drives away
the premiere for eternity forever is everything viktor had hoped for sunrise sunset
red carpet klieg lights searching the sky screaming fans and paparazzi
a limousine pulls up door opens and viktor steps out
the crowd screams with excitement
am expectancy in the crowd people crane their necks waiting for someone else to step out of the open car door
the door shuts
a disappointed murmer
the limo drives off
viktor walks down the carpet to little fanfare
talking to camera what a night
anyone whos anyone is here at the premiere of eternity forever but waiting for simone to show may take even longer
we do have her director viktor taransky
ushering him over viktor viktor is simone coming
slightly irritated by the focus on the star you know simone
other reporters force their way into the interview
i hope she does show up
some of her fans got here at dawn
we dont want to disappoint them
through a pained smile well im sure theyre going to love the movie
i got the inspiration however the reporters attention has strayed
the cameras pivot away from viktor
screen idol harry epson is walking up the carpet
can we have a minute
what brings you here tonight
waving to the fans i just came out to support my good friend simone
theres a rumor that youre more than just good friends
slightly irritated by the invasion weve been seeing each other sure but wed rather keep our relationship private
believing she has a scoop do i hear the sound of
suddenly losing it i cant believe you people
no wonder she never comes to these things
harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet
viktor watches him go flabbergasted
a packed glitzy party
viktor enters without an escort
despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone
he observes elaine champagne in hand and the younger kent schmoozing with a group of industry movers and shakers
the picture is a revelation
i mean it was a team effort viktor cannot resist taking elaines photo with a small pocket camera
elaine is unaware of the shot
viktor turns away just as elaine turns to look at him
viktor picks up a drink from the bar
a drunk woman perched unsteadily on a nearby barstool is knocking back jack daniels
she accidentally brushes one of her discarded glasses off the bar
viktor catches it
a hand taps viktor on the shoulder
hal stands there accompanied by his eternity forever co star mac
is she here
im fine hal
how are you
oblivious to his sarcasm somebody said she was here
mac spots the two glasses in viktors hands one glass lipstick smeared
oh my god thats her glass
impulsively smelling simones glass jack daniels straight up
she is my kind of woman
looking anxiously around the room viktor where is she
dawning on him glancing to the far side of the packed room jesus hal
shes in the ladies room
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions
unable to resist i know what you mean
anxiously looking to the restroom i have to talk to her about my experimental film
is that her
by the fountain
far across the party a woman with a simone type hairstyle her back to us is standing at the edge of a fountain
in fact between us she doesnt really exist
ignoring him calling out to the woman simone
several nearby guests including elaine overhear
they talk over each other
slightly the worse for drink when did she arrive
why didnt someone tell me
where is she
shes by the fountain
simone over here
the rumor races through the party like wild fire
the guests surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration
the simone lookalike herself spins around
she gets knocked into the fountain
several other guests also fall in the stampede
back at the bar the barman autograph book in hand deserts his station
viktor is left alone with the drunk woman
the limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced with ambulances
paramedics tend to guests bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by simones appearance
into microphone forget eternity forever the big news tonight was the surprise appearance of simone
even these seen it all superstars are apparently not immune to simone fever and the resulting stampede forced organizers to bring the event to an early end
i spoke with some of the departing guests about their encounter with hollywoods most reluctant superstar
cuts of interviews with various bruised guests
i would say even more beautiful in person you have to see her to believe her
i cant reveal what we spoke about
simone and i go back a long way
when she talks to you for that moment you are the only other human being in the room
dress torn i really dont know what the fuss is about
so over rated
shes done one film
talk to me when shes had the kind of career ive had
i do expect her to be nominated yes
we return to the live shot of the entertainment reporter
fortunately simone was not amongst the injured and was spirited away as mysteriously as she arrived
max sayers car is parked outside of the echo building
in the echo war room max sayer is agitated
he paces back and forth railing at a table of cowering staffers
she goes to a major hollywood a list party and we dont get an interview a comment we dont even get a photograph
is that what youre telling me
nobody got a photograph
nobody ever gets a photograph
weve got our best people on it mr
hour tail on taransky
shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes every concierge and maitre d on the take
but this simone woman is good
referring to a confidential fbi report obviously the name isnt real shes using an assumed identity travels under a false name checks into hotels with an alias
she never stays in the same place two nights in a row
anything on the satellite photos
irritated what about the fingerprints
what happened when we dusted that hotel suite
milton holds up a glass taken from the hotel
well we got some of taranskys fingerprints a lot of your fingerprints
but none of hers
interest piqued which means theyre significant
beat perhaps criminal
getting excited shes hiding her past
shes hiding her past
max ponders the revelation
of course no ones that perfect that pure
you know i had something on mother teresa
but then she died and it wasnt worth it anymore
approaching a computer i know how to flush out this simone a tell all story from her childhood
impressed my god youve got one
offering milton a seat in front of the computer i will when youre finished writing it
milton hesitates questioning his journalistic ethics
disappointed in his protege am i wasting my time with you
when she sues to protect her privacy shell have to appear in a public courtroom to do it
under his breath long live the first amendment
sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth
to his nervous photographer as for a photo if you cant do it i know twelve million people who can
close up on the echo magazine circulation million
million dollar reward for photo of simone
is the headline on the cover of the echo
viktor is reading the magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot
he looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his soundstage
a group of studio executives led by elaine is trying to break into the closed set
viktor runs towards the door throwing himself between the door and the executives
you cant go in there
we have to talk to her viktor
we know shes in there
viktor glares at the security guard who shrugs weakly
struggling to hold them back why
whats all this about
waving a spreadsheet weve got the tracking numbers for eternity forever
theyre in the toilet
she has to get out there and sell the film
what do you want her to do go door to door
even garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she was alive today
irritated its precisely because she doesnt crave the limelight that people love her
i told you shes only about the work
this is over shadowing the work
waving the front page of the echo thats the problem
shes more famous for her no shows than her shows
its starting to look like she doesnt support the film or you viktor
trying to squeeze past viktor if you cant handle her i will
blocking her path not now
her mother dies today
scene forty two of good for nothing
its not a good time
elaine and the executives are not convinced they overpower viktor
please dont go in there
elaine and the suits force the lock and enter
elaine and the executives stop in their tracks confronted with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the vast soundstage
a desperate viktor catches up with them
where is she
shes not here
elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile
so the secrets finally out viktor
i can explain
i dont think thats necessary
i think its perfectly clear
i should have guessed it all makes sense now
its why she never goes anywhere never seen in public
viktor lowers his head resigned to his fate
shes into computers
viktor looks up
nodding in agreement probably spends her whole life in chat rooms
its the one place she can be herself
viktor seizes on the opportunity
adopting a serious tone its worse than you think
shes extremely agoraphobic has a morbid fear of people and germs
in a way im relieved you
the executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation
the premiere was the first time ive convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares
concerned viktor you should have said something
she doesnt want pity
seeing a new side of viktor youre so good to protect her like this
viktor shrugs modestly
to the executives conceding ill tell you what
i know how much this means to you
ill try to get her to plug the film
beat im not promising anything but maybe shell do a talk show taped
oh make it live please viktor
maybe live but remote
shell never go to them
thank you viktor
give her our best
satisfied the executives make their way out of the soundstage
aside to a colleague that agoraphobia its like a plague
its out of control in europe
viktor and elaine are left alone
im sorry i didnt get a chance to introduce you to simone at the premiere
there wasnt time with the riot and everything
picking up a framed photo from the work station but she wanted you to have this
the photograph shows elaine slightly inebriated at the premiere simone standing slightly behind her
she was there
she didnt by any chance happen to mention me
she said you were very beautiful
blurting out elaine what are you doing tonight
would you like to go somewhere dinner
id love to
but arent you supposed to meet up with simone
dont i always
viktor watches elaine make her way back to her studio cart
viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the national echo the headline million dollar reward for photo of simone
accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter max an unattended shopping cart at the end of the frozen foods aisle begins to mysteriously roll towards us
we discover viktor pulling the cart with fishing line while at the same time shooting it with a video camera
viktors home video of the shopping cart plays on a tv
however now simone is pushing the cart
she wears sunglasses her hair in curlers under a scarf
simone takes a swanson chicken pot pie out of a cabinet
then a box of cereal off a display
max sayer watches the video in his office enraptured
he rewinds the tape and replays the moment
she likes apple jacks
just like me
assistant milton enters
he looks ill
irritated at being interrupted what do you want
sayer did we pay the million bucks yet
never averting his eyes from the screen cashiers check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning worth every penny too
who says theres no place for checkbook journalism
well be running stills of this for months then release the whole tape well get our money back maybe show it on an exclusive pay per view event
do you realize what we have here
we have the only independent footage of simone in existence
we used to
maxs head snaps around
holding a copy of the l
times calendar section simone live shes doing frank brand on thursday
the opening credits to frank brand live a global cable show plays against a starscape images of famous politicians and world leaders interviewed by frank
to camera tonight on frank brand live elaine kent and lainey watch the tv interview in elaines mansion with eager anticipation
since taking the nation by storm with her debut movie sunrise sunset
max sayer and assistant milton are also glued to their set
no ones managed to land a live tv interview with the fabulous new shooting starlet simone
casually tacked up on the monitor is the million dollar check from the echo
viktor face and body scanned by the computer is making a final test of his equipment
when he touches his hair bats his eyes moves his hands so does simone
viktor frantically tests several different backgrounds behind simone from a library of images
ritzy hotel suite
make up your mind viktor
make up your mind
he settles on the desert location
he also make a last second change to simones wardrobe selecting too tight sweater
frank brand talks to camera
im happy to say shes agreed to join us tonight from the set of her new film
turning to the tv monitor welcome simone
the just completed image of simone appears on brands monitor
wonderful to be with you frank
kent referring to simone forgetting or not caring that elaine is in the room
she is all woman
lainey shoots her mothers boyfriend a withering look
she gets up and leaves the room
during the interview we cut between frank brands studio viktors soundstage and various viewer locations including elaines mansion max sayers office and various worldwide locations a a lone afghani shepherd
gazing at a watchman
b a japanese couple watching tv in a capsule hotel room
c a catholic cardinal watching tv in the vatican
well no one could accuse you of being over exposed simone
why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight
shrugs i just think actors talk too much
does the world really want to hear your life story just because youve got a movie opening friday
of course the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more
viktor is in his element his effeminate gestures frighteningly convincing
from tv dont i know it
thats the only reason im here now to put the attention back where it belongs on mr
you dont secretly want the attention
im not even sure i deserve it
after tonight ill have almost as much screen time on your show as i do in my movies
how is that healthy for a performer
lainey has turned her back on the tv screen preferring to look through a book
from tv because you have to understand frank these interviews none of this is real
who i am on screen and who i really am are two totally different people
who are you really
thats a good question
beat as nietzsche said whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else
reading from a bookmarked page along with simone
he ends up finding it is difficult to be himself again
lainey regards the name written on the inside page viktor taransky
tv playing in the background max and milton are hurriedly leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps
focusing on the desert background behind simone i know where that is
change of topic
simone youve been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press mick jagger stephen hawking fidel castro
and most recently viktor taransky
is there a mr
right in there somewhere
id rather not discuss my private life
gently but viktor and i are inseparable
elaines face drops slightly hurt
you dog viktor
from tv i literally wouldnt be here today without him
viktor accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his excitement the cursor aimed at tears command
simones eyes start to well with tears a tear spills from her eye
would you like a moment simone
viktor notices quickly withdrawing his finger his startled expression instantly imitated by simone
no im okay
lets talk about the work that you care so much about
where would you like to start
how about the nudity
nudity has just never been an issue for me frank
for me clothes are just an option
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects
unable to resist a smile i suppose the thing i like most about the movies im in is that theyre not about special effects
frank nods sagely
theyre better for it if i may say
the smile is suddenly wiped off viktors face by a blinking alert the pixels that form simone start to break up
curiously it is only simone and not the background that is disintegrating
regarding the screen well we appear to be experiencing satellite difficulties
in case we lose you simone i want to thank you viktor speaks again his voice suddenly deeper
in horror viktor hurriedly pulls the plug
the feed goes blank on frank brands screen
viktor slumps over his computer in exhaustion
since simone is still synced to his movements the partially de pixelated simone also slumps
viktors cell phone rings
viktor picks up
hel he remembers at the last second to switch off his voice synthesizer
into phone hello
we cut between the two sides of the conversation elaine on the phone kent still watching post interview analysis on the viktor are you with her
is she there
an anxious beat
are you and simone
blurting it out getting married
taken aback by the suggestion no of course not
realizing the significance of the question why
would you care if we were
covering realizing she has given herself away well yes
from a studio point of view it would be better if simone stayed single
quick change of topic anyhow i thought she came across great tonight
intelligent well informed a natural
she was spectacular
viktor do you realize you always do that
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit
yes you do
shrug anyway tonight was a good start
its a crowded summer
we need every photo opp sound byte and column inch we can get
good night viktor
elaine hangs up
carefully broaching the subject mom do you miss dad
she thinks sometimes
but just when i think your fathers changing for the better i realize hes as self absorbed as ever
he took the credit for simone tonight
lainey coming to her fathers defense glancing at the nietzsche book in her hand
i think dad deserves more credit than he gets
viktor watches simone on screen
he is unusually anxious
as usual simone is wearing a skimpy provocative outfit as she awaits instructions on the screen
for some reason viktor becomes irritated by the image
to simone will you cover yourself up
he hits a button
a thick wool coat clicks over her body
the echo newscar streaks through the bronze and purple desert
max and his assistant milton emerge from the car
ive been here before
on my honeymoon with my ex wife
is that why she left you
max holds a video print of simone giving her frank brand interview
he compares her desert location to the one in front of him
pointing out a joshua tree you see thats the exact same tree and in the distance theres the
voice trailing away mountain
sure enough the joshua tree is identical but the mountain is now obscured by a ten story holiday inn
max and milton are mystified they look back at the photo
its a hotel
i dont understand
could they have built that hotel since yesterday
max shakes his head deeply concerned
get in the car
viktor has transformed his soundstage into a one man publicity machine
the floor is littered with photographs of simone in various states of dress and undress
using a sophisticated photoshop computer program viktor constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine spreads time people us life popular mechanics
angrily into phone we dont do the photo shoot you dont get the cover
written answers to written questions thats right
website interviews no problem
viktor calls up a dance option
choosing from a hula dancer a belly dancer and a classical ballerina he removes simones head and places it on the body of the ballerina
she begins to dance for him
he uses a program to construct childhood photographs of simone and other childhood memorabilia
he employs backgrounds from numerous on line library sources
with a quick cut and paste he is able to place simone on a beach in san tropez or a bicycle factory in calcutta
muttering to himself you want exposure elaine
ill give you over exposure
elaine watches tv in her office
she cannot change channels without finding simone sitting in a chair giving generic answers
i think eternity forever is my finest work
im most proud of my work in eternity forever
i think people are going to love eternity forever
viktor inspects a cut out photograph of simone in eternity forever costume
he speaks to the photo
forgive me simone
the photograph of simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink cup a pyramid of cups promoting eternity forever happy meals
beneath the plastic pyramid is a simone action figure in a convertible
screams the banner headline in variety
shouts the hollywood reporter
the trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of viktor who reclines on a leather sofa watching tv gazing lovingly at simone
of course being a movie star is wonderful but i have so many other ways i want to express myself various book titles are on display human kind the poetry
of simone a banner in a window reads
in stock simones easy wear fashion
mannequins model the clothes
we focus on the screen where viktor types in instructions a list of the number hits for the last forty years promptly appears on the screen along with photographs of
the artists carol king whitney houston madonna etc
beneath the title of each song is a graphic representation of the music pitch and resonance
viktor presses a button morph
the audio waves converge
viktor wearing headphones records his composite pop song
as usual when he sings into his microphone simone also sings
the catchy song is titled if you cant believe in yourself believe in me
the video for simones song plays on the video wall inside the record store
teenage girls buying cds dance adoringly in front of the screen unaware that they are gyrating to the vocals of a middle aged man
insert if you cant believe in yourself believe in me shoots up the billboard charts
close up on the name simone painted on the stern of a luxury yacht
viktor is at the helm breathing in the clean air at last a moment to savor his success
simones hit single plays on the yachts stereo
he looks at peace
a tourist has his arm around simone having his photograph taken
however we discover that the simone is only a lifesize cardboard cutout used by a street vendor to sell snapshots
he also has cardboard cutouts of the pope and max sayer and milton walk by
tying up his boat viktors mood is abruptly shattered by the sight of max and milton walking down the pier towards him
nice boat taransky
its a yacht
i know what youre up to
pushing past max i dont have time for this sayer
i think you do
holding up his video print of simone in the desert i know its a fake
got your attention now
max compares the shot to one of the current desert location with the holiday inn in front of the mountain
referring to the photographs its bogus
you used an old library shot for the background
ashen the background is
she was never in new mexico
she never left the studio
viktor is relieved that max is only accusing him of faking the background
referring to a large bundle of other shots under his arm ive done my homework
ive studied her
i bet you have
ive looked at every piece of publicity shes ever done the video in the supermarket theres no evidence shes ever left the studio
afterthought oh and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail
but i have obtained a copy of your bank accounts
i know you have power of attorney but so far you havent transferred one single solitary cent to her
im keeping it in trust
i know thats what youd like us to believe
but i got to tell you embezzlement is a serious matter
not to mention abduction
i dont buy the whole recluse scam
how are you doing it
what is it drugs
what do you do keep her locked in a box somewhere
viktor flinches at the remark
what is it exactly you want sayer
i want to see her
unless you show me simone live and in person i show these pictures to the authorities
viktor pauses considering the threat
alright sayer youve got a deal
viktor walks away leaving max confused
the breeze whips the photos of simone out of maxs hands and into the sea
a vast empty stadium
on the stage a lone microphone
viktor approaches gazing out at the vast arena
several promoters and technicians join him
all ready mr
this time tomorrow night shell be standing right here in front of a packed house
we could have sold it out twenty times
soundcheck went perfect
laser show ready to go
cautionary note i gotta say you ordered an awful lot of smoke
thats the way she likes it
the promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage where a barrier has been erected
after what you told us about the death threats the security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd
viktor hands each man a headshot of simone signed with a kiss
simone wanted you to have these
visibly moved by the gesture wish her luck from us
oh i will
afterthought remember no cameras no binoculars
in the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control truck tour bus satellite dishes on the roof the lights from the laser show inside the arena play off the
the control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd
the door to the truck is marked simone splendid isolation tour
viktor sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck
on his monitors a sea of humanity chanting
viktor produces the simulation one hard drive from his jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer
simone appears on the monitor
lets get you into hair and make up
simones hair rapidly grows in a number of styles eyelashes grow and are trimmed eyeshadow of various shades paints across the lids
viktor tries several outfits on simone the clothes appearing to fabricate themselves on her body
he settles for the most provocative outfit
finger poised over the keyboard viktor glances to a monitor showing elaine and lainey amongst the crowd clapping their hands stomping their feet and chanting
easier to make one hundred thousand believe than just one
he scrolls to a program marked hologram and pushes the enter key
smoke fills the stage
a strobe light show plays
a booming announcer is heard
ladies and gentlemen viktor taransky promotions is proud to present live on stage for the debut concert of the splendid isolation tour the one the only a spotlight falls on
the solitary figure of simone standing alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder the only accompaniment dwarfed by the huge stage
however on closer inspection the spotlight is actually a laser beam creating a hologram
clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid the illusion
the only clear view of simone for the audience is provided by the enormous video screens on either side of the stage
the crowd stares up at the jumbotrons blissfully unaware that they are watching a pre recorded event
some watch the event on portable tvs
close up on the computer screen
viktor scrolls down a list of options
houston miami new york l
from on stage i love you
he selects l
the crowd roars its approval
its great to be here
simone her voice a seamless blend of several divas begins to sing her hit song if you cant believe in yourself believe in me
a verse of the song is sung in perfect spanish
a on a jumbotron in tokyo simones concert plays live
b on a tv set on a west african beach children dance to c on a computer in a bombay taxi the driver and his passengers gyrate to simone webcast
viktors face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied crowd gazing up at the jumbotron singing along many in tears overcome with emotion holding cigarette lighters aloft
for a moment viktor is in awe of his own wizardry the grand illusionist
viktor is at the height of his powers
to the image of simone on his screen i dont know about you simone but ive never felt more alive
he snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone stand
he adjusts the beam the rapturous crowd transfixed by the tv screen apparently fails to notice
we focus on a face in the crowd max sayer
his journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten max is singing along and waving his arms tears rolling down his face swept up in the moment
simone finishes her final number
never stop believing
a bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars
fans exit the stadium through a tunnel
s i m o n e is spelt out on the bare chests of six teenage boys
other fans wear simone splendid isolation tour t shirts and carry posters
several concert goers speak to a i swear she looked right at me
she was like ethereal
one moment she seemed to walk right through her mike stand like it wasnt even there
the chanting crowd can be heard exiting
viktor wearing lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with simones signature kiss
he is interrupted by a knock at the door
viktor irritably opens it
i said i didnt want to be interrupt elaine and lainey stand at the foot of the trailer a security guard nearby
face brightening my two favorite girls
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate
regarding viktor closely elaines smile evaporates
shes lying down
suddenly cool i can imagine
viktor is confused by their reaction
elaine yanks lainey away
thank simone for the tickets
calling back as she is led away it was a great show dad
viktor waves disconcertedly
where are you
as he returns to the trailer viktor catches sight of his lipstick smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the trailer door
he slams the side of the trailer in frustration
elaine paces back and forth in front of her tv showing re runs of the simone concert
kent cannot take his eyes off the screen
i cant believe shes doing this taking advantage of him this way
obviously this cant last
shes going to dump him
viktor wont be able to take that
hes too sensitive
itll destroy him
elaine do you realize you cant stop talking about viktor
not hearing i have to talk to her
kent switches off the tv
ive been meaning to talk to you
behind the open door we find lainey eavesdropping
viktor deep in thought stands at the waters edge staring at the breaking waves
lainey joins him
gently teasing her hows your love life
i do okay
how about you
you know me married to my work
an awkward silence
dad you know i dont like to get between you and mom but shes feeling down right now
she broke up with kent
buoyed by the news really
she thinks youre with simone
lainey you know simone and i dont have a real relationship
i know but mom doesnt
maybe if it came from simone if simone spoke to mom she could straighten things out
shrug dinner maybe
a phone call
they have to meet face to face
ill see what i can do
a thought occurs you know lainey
i dont believe youve ever once asked to meet simone
dont you like her
i love her but that doesnt mean i need to meet her
viktor is confused
so i can tell my friends at school as if that validates my life somehow
whats simone going to say to a fourteen year old anyhow
shes going to be polite because youre my father but were not suddenly going to become friends we have nothing in common
its not going to be real
anyhow she gets more beautiful in my head every day
why kill the dream
what do they say dont get too close to your idols they always disappoint you
viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter so much wiser than her years
i love you lainey
i love you too daddy
a car horn sounds outside the house
kissing him on the forehead see you
she exits leaving viktor deep in thought
milli vanillis girl you know its true plays on a car radio
elaine wearing a red power suit drives home along the freeway in bumper to bumper traffic
her car phone rings
she turns down the radio and picks up
hello is this elaine
yes oh my god
is that you simone
ive been wanting to talk to you
well here i am
beat you look pretty today
red suits you
looking around the freeway where are you
right beside you
i borrowed viktors car
elaine looks to the inside lane
simone wearing sunglasses phone to her ear drives alongside
simone waves somewhat mechanically
elaine waves back
they keep driving as they talk
the sunglasses clad simone is a mannequin seated in the drivers seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her mouth right hand attached to the steering wheel
seat fully reclined on the passenger side viktor drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand occasionally sneaking a glance to the
he speaks on a phone through the simone synthesizer
id love to stop somewhere but im late
im on my way to see viktor now
no i understand
thats what i want to talk about
i dont know if you know this simone but viktor and i were married once
i cant imagine how you ever let a man like that go
i owe viktor everything
i think he owes more to you
but thats not important now
i know whats going on between you two
i want to reassure you elaine theres absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i
rueful smile you dont have to protect my feelings simone
i dont blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world
breaking character im not correcting himself hes not
viktor losing concentration on his driving drifts across his lane almost striking elaines car swerving back at the last second
my god are you alright simone
damn struggling to stay in her his lane yes i regaining control im just a little tired
listen elaine viktor and i its strictly a working relationship
we could never be anything else
were just so
youre a household name now
youre moving in entirely different worlds
thats why i hope youre not toying with viktor
it sounds like you still have feelings for him
we have a daughter together
i just dont want to see viktor get hurt
i dont know how many times i have to say this elaine but viktor and i are not in love
joking weakly i only make love to the camera
simone i recognize the shirt youre wearing
i gave it to viktor on his birthday
over correcting his steering viktor drifts into the next lane dangerously close to a pick up truck that has to swerve to avoid him
christ still struggling to stay on the road elaine i know how it looks but
blurting it out it would mean a lot to viktor if youd go with him to the oscars
if you wont do it for him please do it for me
reluctant frightened by simones erratic driving okay for you
sigh of relief thanks
this is my exit so i im glad we talked
viktors car swerves to the right
elaine looks back in her rearview mirror concerned
elaine just misses the sight of viktors car rear ending the truck in front of him
viktor anxiously watches a highway patrolman writing up the fender bender
however the patrolman is more interested in the simone mannequin
you dont have to explain
i know what the press is like
out of control
referring to the simone mannequin you do know im going to have to take this
viktor in his tuxedo sits in the front row of the packed auditorium beside an empty seat reserved for simone
elaine and lainey sit alongside lotus and mac nearby
hal stands at the transparent plastic podium with the best actress envelope
and the winner is
hal tears the envelopes seal momentarily confused as he reads the name
actually theres a tie
the audience gasps
milking the moment for all its worth the winners are
simone for sunrise sunset
the audience cheers enthusiastically but hal stills their applause
big smile and simone for eternity forever
the audience erupts
viktor accepts the congratulations of those around him
unfortunately simone cant be with us tonight
turning to the screen but thanks to the miracle of modern technology she is able to join us live via satellite from the location of her new film
the screen flickers to life
simone sits in a directors chair in the desolate wasteland location chosen by viktor
this means so much to me
im just sorry i cant be there with you
wiping away a tear first off i have to acknowledge my fellow nominees i dont even feel i belong in the best actress category let alone with these
wonderful human beings
composing herself i also have to thank my co stars the studio of course
but most of all i have to thank the audience for supporting what i do youre the only reason im here
the crowd applauds wildly
lainey is puzzled
she leans over to viktor
why didnt she thank you
confused she did
viktor glances to the simone sign beside him
the blood drains from his face
on the monitor simone reads the forgotten line from the speech
and of course i must thank my collaborator viktor taransky without whom none of this would be possible
viktor still in his tuxedo stares at simone on the screen
he holds the text of simones acceptance speech in his hands
to himself its written right there
why didnt i say it
how could i forget to say it
simone stares back at him blankly
a copy of variety is slid under the soundstage door
the front page headline no thank you simone snubs taransky at oscars
viktor pulls up to the gate of his malibu home
max is standing outside next to his car
viktor also spies an old woman in a wheelchair sitting beside the car milton closeby
viktor stops at the gate and reluctantly exits his car
what now sayer
smug smile noticing viktor noticing the woman looks familiar doesnt she
no one comes from nowhere taransky
you turn over enough rocks
the old woman appears drugged stares into space
i traced her to a nursing home
a young woman fitting simones description dropped her off five years ago
she looks a lot like you
undeterred she hasnt uttered a word that whole time until she saw the big show
max produces a shot of simone at the oscars and holds it in front of the old lady
pointing to simones picture catatonic my baby
putting his hand on his heart who would think that saint simone would abandon her own mother
ive been looking into the family history heartbreaking
most likely a biography to run over four issues
who knows maybe theres a pulitzer in there somewhere
viktor produces his own drivers license and holds it in front of the old lady
pointing to viktors face on the drivers license my baby
max hastily steps between viktor and the old lady
that doesnt prove a thing wait until i get a court order for a blood test
sensing an opportunity that wont be necessary
pretending to be resigned sooner or later i knew youd crack this thing max
you got me
recovering sure i do
taking viktor aside can we speak off the record
im a fair man
im willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story
i wouldnt want you to compromise your ethics
viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity
you love her dont you max
writes a check hands it to max this should take care of mother
viktor drives into his home
max very confused stares at the old lady
viktor escorts lainey blindfolded around the corner of his soundstage
he removes the blindfold
from laineys point of view we see the sportscar simone drove in eternity forever the car tied with a bow
happy birthday lainey
do you like it
taking in the car its fantastic its too much
its the car she drove in eternity forever
thank her for me
disappointed by her reaction its from both of us
of course youll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit lainey averts her gaze
i cant accept it
i dont want a car dad
clearly hurt not understanding why not
i can get you something else
what do you want
the old viktor taransky
finally blurting it out i liked you better before before all this
you were a loser dad but at least you had integrity
i cant stand to see you like this clinging to simones coattails it used to be about the work and now its all about her
and then shes not even grateful enough to thank you
no that was me
there you go again blaming yourself
cant you see what shes done to you shes taking advantage mocking you
you deserve better than simone
hasty exit ive got to go dad
viktor watches lainey depart towards the studio gates
viktor leans on his desk still reflecting on laineys remarks
ready for your casting session
viktor nods distractedly
jane shows in nicola anders
nicolas here for the role of simones sister
viktor offers nicola a seat staring at her as if he has never truly looked at her before she has a quality of simone
slightly uncomfortable by viktors scrutiny a lots happened since we last saw each other
i never apologized properly for what happened on sunrise
she hands viktor a peace offering a large jar of mike ike candy including cherry
its not important
after i saw what simone did with the role you know i fired all my people went into rehab took acting classes changed my whole look
she really inspired me
viktor continues to stare
referring to the script in her hands would you like me to read
yes id like that
nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down
she approaches viktor standing close to him playing the scene to him an immediate intimacy
her angry words are in opposition to her amorous actions who do you think you are carlos coming in here like this
with my husband sleeping in the next room
do you think i wont call out
do you think i will just give in to you without a fight like the last time and the time before that
she kisses his ear i wish you were dead
she kisses his lips i wish we were both dead
nicola immediately breaks character
viktor is mesmerized he has fallen back in love with flesh
finally able to speak you know youre really very good
i take back what i said
i mean youre really good
forgetting himself you could play the lead
confused but thats simones part
yes of course it is
gazing at her face you know you have a line here
not a wrinkle
actually more of a dimple
ive been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone
incredulous youd cosmetically alter simone to look like me
no of course not youre right
that would be crazy
viktor sits back down and stares out of the window
do you want me to do it again
viktor does not reply
nicola quietly leaves
the front page of variety is dominated by a large photograph of simone giving her acceptance speech via satellite
however elaine is gazing at a small inset picture of viktor herself and lainey arriving at the oscar ceremony
elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse
old home video of elaine
she is in a garden by a swimming pool laughing waving and sweetly flirting with the camera
elaine raises her skirt teasingly winks gestures the camera operator towards her with a beckoning finger finally blows a kiss to the camera
while the ever seductive simone waits patiently on screen for viktors instructions viktor is gazing at the smaller monitor the home video of elaine
viktor freezes the tape
elaine appears particularly beautiful
viktor electronically cuts out elaines mannerism and morphs it into simone
now simone blows the kiss and has the same dazzling smile
at her desk jane is busy trying to mimic simones hairstyle as she talks on the phone
into phone oh sure she comes in all the time
weve become close
she told me viktor enters the office
jane jane hurriedly hangs up
picking up a pile of scripts from the in tray im leaving early tonight
if you need me ill be at the beach house having dinner with a
jane tries to conceal her interest
as soon as viktor exits the office jane picks up the phone
into phone under her breath elaine christian please
we reveal viktor outside the door eavesdropping on his assistant pleased she has taken the bait
viktor dims the lights plays mood music
the doorbell rings
he checks himself in the mirror
in the reflection he spies an autographed photo of himself with his arm around simone
he hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door
elaine stands there
viktor im picking up lainey
elaine is over dressed for her supposed errand
elaine its wednesday
feigning absent mindedness is it wednesday
i dont know what i was thinking
with all the excitement lately
peering past him am i interrupting something
are you expecting company
ushering her inside as a matter of fact i am
when is she coming over
glancing to his watch about now
would you like a drink
i suppose i could stay just until she arrives
elaine takes a seat on the sofa
viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her close
they both knock back their wine in one long gulp both apparently in need of courage
trying to make conversation is simone back to earth yet
im sure youll keep her focussed
shes lucky to have you viktor
blurting out is she really having your baby
instantly regretting the remark i just read somewhere i know
theyll say anything
and she was positively glowing at the awards
making to leave i should be going shell be here soon viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her
she already is
simones not coming over elaine
not tonight not ever
holding her i want you back elaine
melting i want you back too viktor
elaine breaks the kiss suddenly consumed with doubt
this is crazy
who am i fooling
i cant compete with simone
what woman can
i would rather have you than simone
thats sweet viktor but i couldnt let you do that make that kind of sacrifice
meeting his gaze its strange
ive stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where i am it goes with the territory but for some reason i cant betray simone
i dont know any other way to say it theres a goodness to her
no there isnt
theres nothing to her
you say that now because were here alone like this
but in the morning youd go back to her
what man wouldnt
no i will end my relationship with her totally
but you dont understand
shell always be there at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen
shell never work again retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again
confused of course she will
her public will demand it
not if i dont let her
viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage
im going to tell you a secret now elaine
mustering all his nerve simone is not a real person
i invented her
misinterpreting his remark every actor is an invention viktor
dont embarrass yourself
no ones denying that you discovered simone
but its like finding a diamond in the desert
anyone can trip over it but its not the finder who sparkles
agitated no no i didnt trip over her
you dont understand ignoring him you just got lucky that shes loyal enough to stay with you
maybe shes staying out of pity who knows
she certainly doesnt need you
some people even say youre holding her back
wounded who says that
shaking off the insult never mind
you have to listen to me elaine
simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation
i inherited it from a madman i can show you how much wine have you had
shes a figment of my own imagination
i viktor taransky have perpetrated the greatest hoax the greatest sleight of hand sleight of mouth sleight of sleight in entertainment history
and still no one appreciates me recognizes what ive done even you
rolling her eyes youre drunker than i thought
are you doing that again
whatever talent simone has comes from me me
i swear as god is my judge
you dont know what ive been through
tens of thousands of mind numbing hours in front of that screen nights without end and look what its cost me
producing his spectacles why do you think ive been wearing these
i may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight and why
to extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being a human soul
a final explanation dont you see
i made simone
his words hang in the air
you made simone
a trace of pity viktor she made you
elaine gets up and walks out leaving the distraught viktor alone in his house
a hung over viktor enters his office
suddenly he stops and confronts the standee of simone
ill destroy you
jane stares in shock
she discreetly exits
viktor sits in front of his monitor smiling venomously at simone
he begins to digitally disrobe simone
a peering through a gap in the drapes of his malibu house viktor watches max dig through his trash
max finds a beat up reel of mm film
max holds the end up to the light his eyes pop
b the echo headline screams simones hard core past and shows censored film frames of a naked simone in a compromising position
viktor hovering at a supermarket check out line overhears two women discussing the article
sympathetic she must have been so desperate to do something like that so depraved
im still naming my baby after her
youre having a boy
it is not the reaction hed hoped for
c inside a theater viktor hovers by the door smirking
on screen we hear a farmyard scene simone in an empty farmyard on all fours grunting like a pig and foraging for muddy vegetables
the audience is shocked then suddenly breaks into spontaneous applause
viktor enraged exits into the lobby past the poster for i am pig starring simone
d a pretentious film critic talks to camera a film poster behind him
for simone to do something as brave as i am pig at this point in her career with so much to lose all i can say is i am pig
i am oscar
e in his soundstage viktor moves a slider that adds wrinkles to simone
f simone appears on a morning talk show as usual remote on a tv screen
however her squeaky clean image has gone hair unkempt bloated chain smoking and drinking during the interview
the hosts are smiling weakly
simone thats a rather controversial position
i just think all elementary schools should have a firing range so students can learn how to defend themselves
we could fit it inbetween recess and american history
another clip if theres a hole in the ozone layer why cant i see it
another clip immigration
god isnt it crowded enough
just as we always knew
simones not like other celebrities
she speaks her mind
g viktor driving along a city street suddenly slams on his brakes almost causing an accident
he stares numbly up at a twenty foot high smiling photo of simone on a billboard featuring a huge cover of time magazine
it reads simone woman of the year
to himself shes trying to kill me
realizing what hes said a thought comes into his eyes
an inscription on a headstone reads remembered virtually forever viktor kneels at hanks grave
he places a bunch of flowers there
referring to the flowers theyre plastic hank
i know thats the way youd want it
glancing to a simone billboard outside the cemetery wall she killed you hank
now shes killing me
shes a serial killer
ducking out of sight of the billboard as if simone is watching him but i dont know how to stop her
shes taken on a life of her own
i cant just come clean make some confession
ive defrauded millions theyd turn on me
and i cant put the genie back in the bottle
if she stopped working dropped out of sight theyd never let it rest
ive tried to kill her career but they like her even more
more desperate what am i going to do hank
a thought occurs to viktor
he slowly rises from behind hanks headstone revealing a forest of headstones
dont say another word hank
you are truly a genius
a sad but resolute viktor sits in front of his monitor simones face full screen
he speaks into the voice synthesizer simones face automatically speaking the words he speaks the final time he puts his words in her mouth
whats the matter viktor
you look so sad
dont you love me anymore
its over isnt it
he switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice
its the only way simone
if its any consolation youre going to live on in the publics heart like all the other tragic figures that went before their time
theres no love like posthumous love
on the screen simone is on the verge of tears
i know what youre thinking
its a phoney baloney world
the women are surgically enhanced the athletes are on steroids the singers are lip syncing if theyre even singing at all the news is entertainment the politicians are bought and
paid for were living one big lie
so why shouldnt you live too
youre more authentic than the people who adore you
a trace of despair and thats the problem
youre looking at the real fraud
i told myself this was all about the work but if that was the truth it wouldnt matter to me and it does
it wasnt that the artists had no respect for the art
they had no respect for me
someone like you you have so much love showered on you i just wanted to feel one tiny drop on my face
im sorry simone
here ive been trying to convince the world that you exist but i was really trying to convince them that i exist
its not that you arent human simone its that i am
viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked plague ver
he places the disc in the machine
viktor sees that simone is crying
he touches a tear on his own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own
viktor hesitates a moment of doubt then presses enter
the image of simones face gradually begins to deconstruct pixel by pixel as the virus takes hold
the pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen like dust
finally the dust is blown away in a single digital breath
for a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on his own desk
viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen
his hard drive now corrupted he picks up his original disc marked simulation one
he tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with hundreds of discs relating to simones software
he shuts the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door
viktors yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of santa monica bay simone written on the stern
viktor manhandles the trunk to the railing
a mournful pause then he heaves it over the side
the trunk sinks like a stone
heart heavy viktor stares into the inky depths
a throng of reporters and camera crews
a somber viktor enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones
it is my sad and solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of simone
a gasp from the audience
then an explosion of anguish
stepping forward mustering the courage to ask the question how did she die
a rare virus
pretending to compose himself on her goodwill tour of the third world
did she suffer
mercifully it was quick
at the back of the room are max sayer and milton
they are frozen in grief a tear spills from maxs eye
a simon gone fade to black reads the cover of variety
b the announcement of her death appears on local tv news shows around the globe
c a carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several yards wide completely surrounds viktors property including the driveway
viktor insensitively drives over the bouquets to the horror of the mourners including max sayer and milton
d in a remote mongolian encampment mongol horsemen crowd around a television showing a live picture of simones funeral
e the hearse carrying simones body and the funeral procession led solemnly by viktor proceeds through the studio lot
distraught studio staff toss flowers onto the hearse
f the same television picture is playing on a television sitting on a stool in a west african river
local women stop washing their clothes to watch
we tilt up from hanks headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an island in a lake
simones coffin is ferried across a bridge by pallbearers from the studio
numerous mourners follow behind
viktor elaine and a curiously dry eyed lainey walk behind the coffin
to elaine can i see you later go away for the weekend
horrified by the suggestion how can you bring that up at a time like this
the coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum
a priest rabbi and a buddhist monk turn to viktor
he nods and they start to carry the coffin towards the door
however the coffin is suddenly stopped by a police officer
a second police officer begins to jimmy open the lid
the coffin lid is pulled back
inside is a life sized cardboard standee of simone from eternity forever
the mourners gasp
everyone looks to viktor
jane sits in the interview room describing viktors assault on the standee
i heard him say die bitch
a max sayer distraught and weeping
he was a controlling madman she was a prisoner
i blame myself
i should have done more to stop it
b nicola gives a statement
it was strange
he wanted to replace her with me in his new movie
and i know im not that good
viktor sits in an interrogation room in a sea of simone
magazine covers cosmetics advertisements publicity shots interviews website print outs photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls stacks of film cans and tapes of
her numerous movie and television appearances
forgive me mr
im just trying to understand
all these films tv appearances magazine covers internet interviews publicity photos snapshots from her childhood all fake
referring to various items this is fake this is fake fake fake fake all fake
you understand perfectly
i will confess to fraud not murder
referring to oversize mail bags a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions also bogus
the fan club is real
but they were worshipping computer code ones and zeros
so of course you couldnt kill simone because there never was a simone
and this mr
hank aleno who you talk so much about a renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead perhaps the man you claim helped invent simone is an invention
viktor sensing his sarcasm does not reply
patronizing smile but not everyones imaginary are they mr
i refer of course to edith
the detective raises a window blind to reveal a next door room where the old woman from the rest home is being interviewed
the woman you admitted to a journalist is simones mother and for whose silence you paid a fortune
is she not flesh to you are her tears not wet
the old woman glances up and sees all the photos of simone through the window
the detective abruptly lowers the blind
viktor rolls his eyes at the detectives theatrics
he is suddenly enraged
this whole thing is insane
there is no simone
grabbing a simone poster even her name is fake
its not simone
he tears simones name in half to demonstrate its sim
the detectives sadly shake their heads
regarding simones face also torn in half you really hated her didnt you
the detective places a tape marked exhibit a in a video machine
perhaps you could explain this to me mr
taransky or is this tape doctored too
he plays a tape showing viktor dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his yacht
its footage from the marinas closed circuit camera on the night in question
altered of course
is that really what you expect us to believe mr
the detective freezes the tape
can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didnt exist
it wasnt her body
it was her body of work
why dont you just come clean viktor
tell the truth
youll feel better afterwards
i am telling the truth
coming close to him we all know what happened
in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you
i can prove it to you
ill take you to her
viktor sits handcuffed on a police boat with the detective and his lawyer
divers surface with the steamer trunk
viktors face lights up
the trunk is winched aboard
however as it lowers onto the deck we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar
all eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted
apart from a scrawny piece of kelp empty
panicky desperately grabbing the divers did you find anything else drivers discs
gazing to the water we couldnt stay down any longer
all eyes follow the divers gaze to several shark fins in the water
the newspaper is being read by viktors lawyer sitting opposite viktor in his cell
viktor is numb the likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him
plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court
its the best deal youre going to get
incredulous i could get the death penalty
you certainly will if you go to trial a jury in this kind of ugly mood
youve killed an icon for gods sake
i didnt kill anyone bernard there was no one to kill
musing an insanity defence
a figure sits at viktors computer
she scrolls through viktors files
elaine paces behind her
lets go lainey
theres nothing here
just a minute
elaine continues to pace as lainey works
god its so like your father
why cant people take responsibility for their actions anymore
i can almost forgive him for killing simone but denying her existence
i can never forgive that
because obviously she existed right
i know it as surely as youre sitting here sweetheart
she was the most vital woman i ever met
so you did meet her
what are you suggesting
i mean really meet her in the flesh
elaine regards her daughter curiously
i know its embarrassing to admit it mom but when i think about it honestly i havent
i mean it feels like i have
i know more about her than members of my own family
shes even in my dreams
but i realized going back through my diary they were all tv appearances near misses at parties second hand rumor gossip on the internet
ive never actually seen simone up close touched her been in her physical presence
unable to refute it well i we dont believe daddy because we dont want to believe we were taken in too
trying to shake the notion from her head lainey theres no evidence that simone isnt real
listen to what youre saying mom
is there any evidence she is
lainey finally tries another file
she presses eject
the plague disc spits out of the machine
regarding the disc theres one part of dads story that may have been true
simone may have contracted a virus
lainey smiles at her mother
certain viruses can be cured
viktor sits in his cell arms crossed quietly seething while his lawyer lays out his trial strategy
hushed tones referring to a thick psychiatric report listen ive found a psychiatrist in ventura well respected whos willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to
the trauma of your divorce ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child viktor fuming throughout this suddenly explodes
i cant go along with this horseshit
just tell them they can fry me
aghast looking around to see if anyone has heard what
it was premeditated i knew exactly what i was doing
i strangled her
i bludgeoned her
i set her on fire
i did it
i killed her
clearing his throat excuse me
the lawyer spins around guiltily
the detective stands outside the cell clearly overhearing the confession
viktor resigned to his fate couldnt care less
i think youd better see this
the detective switches on the tv set hanging outside the cell
vbc is playing breaking news a news anchor appears
from tv breaking news international media star simone is alive and well
her studio released this footage only minutes ago
the brief clip shows the front page of the l
times headlines hollywood suspends filming in memory of simone and d
seeks death penalty for taransky
the reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself simone on the studio lot looking more beautiful than ever
she winks to the camera
simone reading todays edition of the l
who says the only bad publicity is your obituary
details at the top of the hour
the tv is switched off
viktor stares at the screen trying to take it in
when he looks back to the detective he discovers him holding the cell door open
shaking his head in pity ill never get you hollywood people
a throng of reporters paparazzi and onlookers parts like a sea for viktor released from custody
one placard reads ask jesus to save you now
he is escorted to a waiting limousine where he is met by elaine and lainey
he hugs them both
viktor sits beside elaine
lainey sits opposite studying her laptop computer
outside the car reporters are pressed against the glass
relaxing back into his seat thank you
to lainey i dont know how you did it but thank you
putting her arm around him dont thank us too fast viktor
you know what we have to do
resigned smile why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast
now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things
viktor shrugs resignedly savoring his freedom
holding viktor close i was thinking what about you and
simone moving back in with me and lainey
meeting her gaze that sounds wonderful
to lainey how do you feel about all this lainey
beaming about you and mom
reluctant admission me and simone
what i did
sweet smile your mistake wasnt making something fake daddy
were fine with fake as long as you dont lie about it
once again his daughters words have a ghastly ring of truth
viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually forces its way through the reporters
he recognizes max and milton amongst the mob
max has hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the window will pay for exclusive
viktor looks away
kissing him on the cheek dont look so glum viktor
its not a death sentence
still staring out of the window a rueful smile no
frank brand conducts a remote interview with simone who appears as usual on a television monitor
simone the question on everyones mind is simply
frank you know as well as i do living in a fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media
frank nods sympathetically
with everything that was going on in my life i just needed to drop out of sight for a while i needed time
viktor bought me that time
i owe him so much
we all do
quickly returning to simone but now i understand youre eager to get back to work and not the kind of work that were all expecting
smiles coyly thats true
i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics
and what may i ask brought this on
simone holds up a beautiful baby boy to camera
i suppose this little man had something to do with it
viktor and i are both concerned about what kind of world our new son chip is going to grow up in
turning lovingly to viktor arent you viktor
on frank brands monitor the camera pulls back to reveal viktor sitting on a sofa an idyllic domestic scene
turning lovingly to simone yes
only we see the set where the interview is being recorded
viktor is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage smiling at a woman and child who are not there he is alone
