written by steve mcqueen abi morgan brandon sullivan early s lies staring up caught in a disarray of sheets until the peep peep peep of an alarm clock from deep
within a distant apartment
the muffled pad of footsteps crossing overhead brandon listens then gets up pulls blinds and heads out towards the bathroom the sound of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor
the murmur of an answer phone as we hear brandon peeing in a far off bathroom
brandon stands looking down watching until a sudden breeze the subway train oncoming brandon boards
the doors glide shut brandon just visible through the window of the train walking towards a distant seat
brandon sits eyes casually tracing over the faces in the crowded train
a homeless man sits further along the car haggard and grey and sleeping the seat empty either side of him
he looks more like a pile of clothes
brandon turns back
the reflection of an pretty subway girl caught in the glass opposite
brandon padding naked along a corridor
he flicks on an answer machine in passing hey
he enters the bathroom
we hear brandon peeing in the bathroom
the answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the toilet the shutting of the door and the shower being switched on
a homeless man head lolling sat alone at the end of a busy car
brandon considers catching the eye of a pretty subway girl seated opposite the whisper of a smile grazing her lips
brandons eyes teasing over the fall of the pretty subway girls hair the dip in her collarbone her nail polish with french manicure brandon looks at her
she looks away
brandon resumes staring
she looks back through the bodies of commuters
we see their eyes looking at each other
their seduction continues through the collage of colors and bodies
brandon sits in a packed meeting room a pitch just audible david fisher early late s brandons boss a kind of white noise and yet i find you disgusting
i find you inconsolable
i find you invasive
the it technician just visible wheeling a cart away with brandons computer
that is what the cynics used to say
companies would refuse to look to the future
theyd say can we stop this virus
the scratch of a pencil against paper
brandon sits distracted facing colleague
marianne mid late s seated further along the table steals a look at brandon
a glass door opens the pretty assistant brings in coffee sliding down a cup in front of brandon
as if it was a negative progression a descent into hell moving with stealth amongst those you need to affect growing more and more with a momentum that is unstoppable
brandon looks across the hall distracted by the it technician who is replacing the computer in his office
now some inane kid snorting the entire load of his mothers spice cupboard and posts that on you tube
they would watch as it would become the buzzword amongst high school kids everywhere
their cynicism would turn to awe
brandon to the front door and opens it to reveal an hi
brandon steps aside to let the attractive woman in
she walks into the apartment as he closes the door
no thank you
brandon picks up money from the table and give it to alexa
she counts it and nods to brandon
alexa puts the money in her bag
brandon gestures to his room
alexa turns and walks away
a tidy bedroom brandon lies on the bed watching waiting
alexa starts to take her top off
alexa continues slowly tosses it aside and continues taking off her bra and panties
finally putting her earrings on the bedside table
brandon reaches up to pull her onto the bed
the sound of brandon getting up the sound of blinds being raised close up of a discarded earring on the carpet
brandon padding naked along a corridor
the sharp tone of the answer machine flicked on in passing audible from the corridor hey its me
we hear brandon turn on the shower
brandon walks towards the kitchen and we hear him pour a glass of water
brandon crosses the hall and enters the toilet
brandon turns on the light puts down his glass and urinates
whispers brandon where are you
brandon finishes flushes toilet steps off screen this is me calling you
the caller hangs up brandon re appears and closes the bathroom door brandon in the shower a sense of movement his hand barely visible moving back and forth
the fall of the shower brandon stands letting the water wash over him
brandon sits looking over at the pretty subway girl sitting opposite the train moves on after a while stopping at another platform
people get on people get off
brandons eyes travel down over the pretty subway girls legs and up she opens them a little the dip of her skirt sinking deep between her thighs
she looks up senses brandon watching
she lets her fingers fall in her lap
brandon shifts a little in his seat to get a better look through the crowd
suddenly she stands and makes her way to the train door
hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole for stability revealing a wedding ring
brandons hand reaches for the pole too touching her as he stands behind her
there is a gentle unison contact
brandons breath heavy on her neck
both are frozen to the spot caught in a mutual moment
the train door bolts open and the pretty subway girl disembarks
brandon is blocked by a male passenger as he gets out in quick pursuit of the pretty subway girl
brandon is several paces behind now pursues
she turns left into a stairwell
its almost like fighting a downward river
people are walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the the tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs
a moment later brandon reaches the summit to be greeted by a wrought iron gate
he looks left at one staircase
he looks right at another staircase
other passengers ascend
people come in and out of the turnstiles on the right hand side
he has lost her
a sudden moment of disappointment crosses his face
he descends the staircase dejected
brandon walks into his office and to his desk stops in his tracks heart thumping a bare space where brandons computer once was and next to it a replacement computer
a pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck to the screen
brandon walks into a toilet cubicle shuts and locks the door
he cleans the seat with toilet paper flushes stands and starts to masturbate
a tap on the door brandon enters davids office david is lost in paperwork looking up from his desk
do you know whats going on with my computer
they took it
yeah i know
someone could have told me
some kind of virus
i walk in and its not there
and i get some kind of replacement
some kind of virus
theyre stripping it all out
brandon nods swigs a red bull in his hands cool
brandon is walking with shopping bags
he slows by the revolving doors spots a mother with buggy about to come out of the other door and hurries over to open the door for her
woman comes out nodding her thanks
brandon looks through his vast record collection and carefully puts a disk on the record player
the chink of beer bottles banging up against one another as brandon opens the fridge door brandon peers in considering the left over take out resting on the shelf
he takes it out flipping open a bottle of beer in a familiar move and banging the door shut with his back
a flyer for an fancy take out flaps under a magnet on the fridge door
a comfortable apartment brandon spoons chinese take out into his mouth sliding down in front a laptop resting on his desk
music continues to surround the apartment
the bright serenade of his laptop opening brandon resumes fingers absently tapping the keyboard a distant whir of a car alarm far off
brandon in the dark watching pornography on his laptop brandons cell phone rings
he ignores it
and then steady monotonous ring of a telephone close by brandon barely wavers as it clicks onto answer machine the heavy dead tone of the answer machine as the callers
message kicks in ok
i have cancer
i have one week to live
brandon smiles its the very worse kind of cancer
of the vulva brandon switches off the answer machine
sighs and returns to his laptop
thru computer moans a beautiful day brandons face now fresh passing a cute neighbor heading into the building lost in conversation on her cellphone in greeting hey
brandon juggling cellphone keys and satchel heading off to work watching the sway of her ass
marianne is on the phone in a busy office profile of mariannes bare back
brandon seemingly in a trance looking out across the office eyes fixed on marianne in her glass cubicle unaware of brandon staring
stevens reflection in the window we see him screw up a piece of paper and throw it at brandon
brandon shakes his head
youre such a dick what are you doing man
brandon once again looks up toward marianne
marianne on the phone
david now appears in front of brandon
from afar nods to him and greets a group of clients
whistles alright gentlemen if youll just please make yourselves at home
just visible in the conference room brandon inside with the clients and david
a sense of camaraderie
the meeting at an end
david slapping brandon on the back the sense of celebration
it falls upon me as your beloved boss to propose a toast
the thump of music brandon david and others wedged in a leather booth several shots and beer down the table littered with beers
i hope my wife appreciates it
all chink glasses get a new tie please

brandon turns to watch them on the dance floor

the pulsing thump of music the latest cutting edge sounds david pulls elizabeth into dancing at first playful and funny
david is insistent pulling her closer drawing her into a frenzied awkward dance
brandon looking on the suited womans eyes grazing his lingering on brandon as david stumbles

laughs rachel and loren walk off to the dance floor dance

elizabeth slow glances at brandon
we see brandon through the dancers watching
david struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve of his jacket pursuing elizabeth and her friends up the street

brandon comes out of the club doing up his coat
looks away at david haranguing the trio

david smiles gently coaxing her in the opposite direction brandon hails a cab

a cab pulls up

brandon opens the cab door and waits with the taxi
david walks towards brandon
hey man hes going uptown
david concedes throwing his arms up jacket half on
david paws brandon affectionately straightens brandons jacket gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab
ill see you tomorrow the cab pulls away
a car glides close to the kerb brandon head down walking hey
brandon smiles sure
brandon gets into the car
the incessant drone of cars steady overhead vast concrete supports edging the highway brandon presses elizabeth flat again the grit of the wall caught in the scissored half light they
move with glorious abandon the slice of passing headlights casting fractured light across their writhing state until elizabeth gasps her body shuddering leaning into his as they climax together sweat beading skin
brandon walking along the corridor he reaches for his keys suddenly hesitating on the thump of music coming from his apartment brandon tentatively turns his key and pushes the door
open brandon enters
he looks around nothing the turn of vinyl on the record player i feel love by donna summer steadily rotating brandon makes his way back to the corridor and notices
a light on in the bathroom from the slit under the door
he opens up an adjacent cupboard and fishes out a baseball bat and heads toward the bathroom
brandon steadily approaches the bathroom door considers he shoves it open hard baseball bat at the ready brandon running shrieking like a banshee blinding waving the baseball bat slicing air
roaring ill fucking kill you
sissy sullivan mid late s leaps out of the bath naked screaming and dripping wet screams what the

sissy holds her hurt elbow fuck

brandon stands shaking staring at his naked startled sister brandon

sissy dries her face

sissy throws the towel and brandon good to see you
brandon throws the towel back at her
lock the door next time
brandon turns to leave the room dont use all the towels i wont
brandon closes the door to the bathroom
we follow brandon as he walks through to the living room to the record player i feel love stuck in eternal groove
he gently lifts the needle off the record
he uses the baseball bat to pick up sissys scarf
he sniffs it
silence brandon stands considers later
brandon is watching pornography on his laptop hears sissy on the telephone

brandon sliding whisked eggs into a pan of sizzling butter sissy enters and sits on the kitchen counter wearing a long sleeved white t shirt and holding the earring left
by the pretty woman prostitute
dangling it in front of brandon
hiding his surprise brandon gets some juice out of the fridge passes it to sissy
brandon gives sissy a carton of juice
still sitting on the counter sissy grabs it with both hands almost like a childs bottle and starts drinking
brandon irritated says abruptly will you use a glass
brandon steps away takes a glass from a cupboard and shoves it towards her
sissy pours the juice into the glass and drinks
brandon steps back to the cooker preparing food
sighs youre going grey
do you think i look fat
brandon doesnt react
do you think i look fat
brandon nods in the direction of the table
she leaps off the counter and makes her way to the table
she slaps brandons behind
brandons face is one of despair and irritation
gasps fuck you
sissy slams her glass on an o s table and throws the earring away
im doing a couple of gigs
brandon walks towards her with a pan of food
brandon serves the food
sudden cutting in can i stay
brandon hesitates you want toast
just for a few days
brandon ignores her question and walks away to the kitchen
id stay with mark but hes being a fucking asshole
sissy stands and walks away following brandon
sissy wraps her arms around brandon from behind
exhales jesus sissy
brandon pushes her arms off turns and walks to the fridge with the juice
what do you expect

brandon pushes her down as she gives him a big kiss
sissy happy walks back to sit down at the table
we leave in fifteen
sissy sprinkles salt on her breakfast
she smile playful resumes eating reacting to food mmm
shouts so good
the door slams
sissy sighs and stares towards the front door a sadness hanging sissy stands toes edging over the platform
brandon pulls her back
stop fucking around
sissy stares at brandon
instinctively brandon feels her gaze
he turns and looks
they hold each others eyes for more than a beat
brandon turns away
sissy begins picking pieces of fluff off brandons shoulder
brandon visually irritated
sissy goes again
you have fluff
i like it there
a quick moment passes
brandon picks the fluff off his shoulder and puts it on sissys shoulder to her amusement
how are you for money
cause if you need some money

brandon nods at sissys hat
are you collecting mad hats
sissy smiles laughs you should come and hear me
yeah i will like yeah i will like last time
brandon takes off her hat
whered you get this anyway
yeah i can see that
sissy takes the hat and puts it on brandon
whispers do you like
brandon adjusts the hat
sissy gently bumps his shoulder with hers
sissy stamps her feet excitedly
sissy leans her head on brandons shoulder and he puts his arm around her
brandon hurries into the office area unbuckling his coat as he does so
david phone pressed to his ear mid way through a conference call clocks him throws some lewd gesture
brandon smiles throws up his hands hes late
what can you do
brandon continues into his office

brandon puts down his coffee and takes off his scarf
well well well

brandon puts his scarf in the closet and takes off his coat

brandon hangs up his coat
hey thats not cool
brandon laughs as he sits down at his desk
you should be so lucky
brandon sips his coffee
brandon stands in the coffee area making himself a generic filter coffee
marianne is seated in her glass office in the background at her desk
david approaches slapping brandon on the ass
heads up buddy
so howd it go last night
brandon pours coffee glancing at david behind him
went to bed
david looks at him shakes his head in a knowing fashion
lets do it again tonight
some place classier though
my sisters playing downtown somewhere
shes a musician
well shes a singer
you know what that sounds er
a lot of fun
taps coffee mug walking away and thatll ruin your enamel
brandon watches david walk into his office shutting his door behind him
he turns right abruptly pass the coffee area and then right again
a colleague is coming out of a door
he holds it open for brandon as he walks in
the door slowly closes exposing the mens sign for the bathroom
brandon and david not knowing what is to await them walk towards the doors of the beautiful setting of the boom boom that elevator musics like a bad acid trip
i have you on the list
ill have you follow me
brandon and david take off their scarves and coats
brandon and david give their coats to female staff member
there you are
right this way please
oh wow look at that ass
i could follow that forever
david glances back at brandon nice pick
sniggers whistles david and brandon walk on towards the bar
brandon and david enter a beautiful bar
a spectacular degree view of manhattan
the room has the most elegant decor
it is to die for metropolis meets blade runner a glittering new york skyline to the north of the room the grey endless black of the hudson river to the
it surpasses davids idea of classy
the murmur of conversation the shake of cocktails mixed oh
oh i forgot how beautiful this city is
brandon and david follow the hostess to take a seat at a far table
oh thank you thank you
a stunning leggy cocktail waitress walks up to the table dressed in silky s cigarette girl costume
how are you both doing tonight
what can i get you
are you from erm
looking around rio
brandon looks down and chuckles to himself
oh that is a beautiful city
laughs youve been there
once or twice

and a little bit later why dont you come by for a drink with us
ill make sure i get those drinks
the cocktail waitress smiles moving on shes heard it all before
david smiles clocks brandons look
she would be offended if i didnt try
brandon shakes his head and looks down
laughs david and brandon look around the room david and brandon are fortunate to be here
the clink of glasses the noise of laughter waft through the room
across the room a familiar face
her wavering a little at first on seeing brandon across the room
their eyes lock
she smiles with quiet surprise brandon looks away ignoring sissys gaze not wanting to look at her
sissy plays on inwardly crestfallen her fingers working across the piano keys
david leans back eyes grazing over sissy a kind of white noise to sissys beautiful music the seeping first bars of new york new york filtering through singing start spreading
im leaving today
i want to be a part of it
its a familiar song but in sissys hands every word punctures like an emotional fireburst sissys voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of conversation singing i want to wake
up in a city that doesnt sleep
and find im king of the hill top of the heap
sissys eyes dart back to brandon seemingly lost in his conversation but competing now with sissy and her song singing my little town blues suddenly sissys fingers drop from the
piano her whole body curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic slowly but quietly captivating
theyre melting away
i gonna make a brand new start of it
even davids listening now singing in old new york
sissys up moving now she is completely lost in the song and the room is coming with her brandon concedes looking back at sissy now holding the room
singing if i can make it there a kind of hushed still has descended singing ill make it anywhere
its up to you
new york new york
new york new york sissy comes closer walking between the tables flirting and laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the palm of her hand
singing i want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
and find im a number one sissy grazes past brandons table eyes catching on brandon singing for him now singing top of the list king of the hill brandon drinks
not looking at sissy
she closes her eyes tears stinging reeling back into herself singing a number one
sissy draws out the note bringing the song momentarily to a silence
sissys misty eyes open as brandon at last looks at her the moment oddly fragile between them brutal and yet tender
even david sensing something until singing these little town blues sissy turns makes her way back to the piano enjoying it now singing are melting away
fingers touching the keys once more masterfully picking up and improvising with the last few bars singing im gonna make a brand new start of it in old new york
sissy leans back
she is on fire now singing with every fibre of her heart and soul like no other rendition heard
singing and if i can make it there im gonna make it anywhere its up to you sissy holds brandon with a voice a sudden flickering emotion threatening to topple
her somehow in sissys hands this song is heartbreaking
singing new york new york quieter now new york
even quieter new york new york almost to a whisper new york new york
sissy strikes one last note lost deep within herself wow
sudden applause cheers overwhelming david turns to brandon
laughs shes good
brandon looks away eyes filling with tears
brandon puts down his drink blotting his coaster with the imprint of the deep red rim of his glass hes the only one not applauding
sissy is being congratulated by a hip media type and his wife
the scene is one of congratulations sissy is admired
sissy confident approaches david and brandon
she is bold and self aware
its a pleasure to meet you

brandon sits behind them

david takes sissys hand
brandon notices looking uncomfortable
a girl like you cannot be taking the bus
one of sissys sleeves rolls down to her elbow as she casually puts her hand under her chin charmingly tilting her head revealing a cross stitch of scars the trail
of self harm laced up her arm
waht happened to your arm here
when i was a kid i was bored
sissy takes her hand back
well you must have been really bored

beat listen why dont we
this is a celebration lets have champagne
champagne for everybody
for the whole table
brandon looks unenthusiastic champagne
brandon wedged in the back of the cab with david and sissy as they are lost eating one anothers faces
looking uncomfortable brandon frequently takes glimpses in the rear view mirror
david and sissy continue making out
its almost animal
a dimly lit street a cab is pulling up
david opens the door
ive got it ive got it
get out get out get out get out
david is wearing sissys hat
come here come here come here come here
finally sissy steps out of the cab david lifts her over his shoulder
yelps oh god
laughs strains come on come on with me come on
you wanted me to do that
how did that work
get off me
sissy starts to enter thru the revolving door
david follows ah come on come on come on come on come on
brandon is left alone to pay the driver
brandon waits in the lobby pressing the button for the elevator
an elevator arrives
he ignores it and sits down
darkness brandon enter his apartment door
he hears giggling from his bedroom
laughs well i am hot i am hot
you are hot
laughter and chatter brandon walks to his kitchen
he hits the kitchen cabinet in frustration
he walks into the living area and paces
brandon considers looking out through the window he sits on the ledge wringing his hands
youre cursing me
i need to take this off
i need to take it off
nice sheets arent they nice sheet
bed bath and beyond
more giggling hushed now more breathless what if i kiss you right here
brandon takes off his shoes and starts to undress
we hear sissy and david making love
brandon doesnt want to hear
brandon stands back against a wall as if transfixed as if he cannot take any more
his breathing is irregular
something of the past has come to the present
all of his distractions have now stopped and he is at once confronted with himself
his face bears the pain of something long passed but visually present
this wound has not healed
jolting himself out of his trance brandon hurriedly heads out into the corridor brandon pulls running gear from the hallway closet an exits leaving the rising breath of david and
sissy lost in furtive a dimly lit street
brandon just visible in his apartment block steady on the approach
he is dressed in running gear
pushing the glass doors open brandon hesitates and presses a button on the ipod nano on his arm
he stretches zips his top pulling his hood up
brandon slips his earphones on moving off
brandon running past illuminated windows and neon lights
the city is alive
brandon stays focused running music pumping in his head
later brandon enters his apartment checking for noises
the sound of movement in the bathroom
he pushes open his bedroom door
its like a murder scene
pale blue sheets in disarray the mattress nearly coming off the bed sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex
a lone condom disregarded on the floor
we see his bedside drawer ajar
he walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut
later brandon lies on his bed with clean white sheets sidelight on
brandon opens his eyes inwardly flinches
sissy gets into the bed covering herself with the white sheet
snuggles up to brandon i have to be up and out by seven
sissy inhales through her teeth
to herself its cold
sissy get out of my room
sissy doesnt move
sissy get out of my room
all this time brandon has not looked at sissy staring up to the blank ceiling
he screams at the top of his lungs sissy gets up deliberate as if rising from the dead and slowly walks around the bed
sissy slams the bedroom door on her exit
midday the office is in full flow brandon crosses it clearly worse for wear
a technician wheels a computer out of brandons office
in passing hey slacker your computers back

a childs painting stuck to the wall behind david
brandon lost in familiar routine pours sugar into his coffee hey brandon looks up marianne loiters
you like your sugar
nods smiles i do
marianne is still standing waiting
they look at each other
eventually she turns and walks out
brandon stands at the end of a long pier looking out toward the hudson river the lap of murky water audible
he hovers for a moment and considers then slowly makes his way back to the main road
the glittering lights of jersey stretching wide beyond
above the tall endless glass of the standard hotel scored with a honeycomb of windows randomly illuminated like tiny still lives
brandon comes to a corner lights a cigarette and leans
above him engraved in stone is
he looks up toward the tall building which appears like a stasi east berlin building
stark and authoritative
a kid slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window a filipino nanny ushers him away
a woman early s phone to her ear dressed in black jeans and t shirt paces along the window
catching sight of brandon she pulls the curtain along the length of the glass
a man stares blankly out clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged enjoying the view two floors up
a female cleaner just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster
and then brandon sees her a middle aged woman stands naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass high up overlooking the hudson river
the steady back and forth of the middle aged man behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck
brandon hesitates quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment brandons eyes lock with the middle aged womans dead gaze standing high above brandon turns his
its as if he comes back to himself
a distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street marianne waiting inside the bar seated with a drink clearly there for some time
her eyes checking the room with quiet concern
brandon stands watching from a distance brandon makes to cross hovering on the edge of the gutter until brandon enters the restaurant
laughs did you find it okay
yes im glad you made it
brandon sits down at the table where marianne is already seated
you look handsome
you look amazing
a waiter enters
waiter places the wine list in front of brandon and hands out menus
i have few specials on the menu if youd like to hear them
marianne smiles eyes darting to brandon playful
the waiter oblivious clearly on a roll
the soup of the day is tomato with basil oil and parmesan crostini
the special is marinated swordfish tabbouleh and moroccan chermoula
its really good
er were also serving a debragga and spitler new york strip with a side order of fries and the salad is snow pea and radish with a cider vinaigrette

brandon nods clears throat tap waters fine
ok and the wine menus right next to you
there you go brandon pulls out a wine menu hidden under his bread plate
you want some wine
the waiter hovers points to a red on the menu the pinot noir is er
if you like it like
the glide of a napkin across brandons lap the waiter a constant presence on the edge of irritating
ill be back
the waiter smiles at last moves off they sit looking at their menus
brandon steals a moment eyes tracing over mariannes fingers playing with the edge of her menu the flutter of her lashes nipples ghosting her dress
an ring indent around her wedding finger the shrink of skin
so clears throat where do you live
laughs laughs brooklyn
born and raised
where you from
where you from
i was born in ireland
we moved here when i was a teen
the waiter enters again with water

waiter pours water for marianne a couple of times
a big family

older and younger

brandon stares at marianne what
laughs are you nervous

marianne smiles holds his look
you look a little nervous

brandon shrugs its no big deal
it took me an hour to figure out what to wear
you chose wisely
marianne shrugs smiles brandon laughs the waiter returns i forgot to say the crab comes in the shell
the waiter pauses expectantly
i havent even looked at this
erm ill have the lamb
the waiter scrawls it down on a pad barely looking up
ill have the lamb too
that sounds great
erm no appetizer

marianne shrugs closes her menu
ok and how would you like the lamb
we recommend it pretty pink
the waiter waits brandon looks at marianne they giggle

the waiter takes the menus
marianne stares at brandon
the waiter exits
so you seeing anyone at the moment
why is that
i dont know
just er its just the way it is
its just the way it is
yeah i erm

the dip of skin soft under her chin a finger grazing over it nervously
kind of a recent thing
you were married for long
the waiter returns
did we decide on the wine
brandon hesitates on the edge but erm well yeah erm
was it the pinot noir you said
brandon scours the wine menu at a loss brandon looks to marianne she shrugs yeah great
the waiter nods at last moves off i wasnt married long
gave it a shot
it didnt really work out
well you just seem like
averse to the whole idea
i mean i just dont understand why people would want to get married
especially nowadays i mean its
i dont see the point
it doesnt seem realistic
marianne considers lips grazing the rim of the glass
are you serious
yeah i am really
laughs well then you know why are we here if we dont matter to one another
why are you here
the foods supposed to be really great here
laughs marianne nods doesnt look amused no no no no
im not saying it like that
i mean i just mean you know
one person for the rest of your life
i mean its
i mean you know you come to restaurants you see couples sitting together and they dont even speak to one another
they dont have anything to say they dont have anything
they probably dont have to speak because theyre connected
or theyre just bored with one another
the waiter approaches a bottle of wine in hand
here we go
the waiter uncorks the wine
whats your longest relationship
he pours a little into brandons glass
brandon gestures for the waiter to pour
you can pour
waiter fills brandons glass
waiter finishes pouring brandons wine and starts filling mariannes
you have to commit
you have to actually give it a shot
for four months
ill leave the bottle
the waiter slides the bottle down moving off for four months
a dirty grey street brightened by the glow of brandon and marianne seated inside the restaurant
brandon and marianne stand heady from the wine and a little awkward in the freezing cold they walk
brandon sneaks a side glance marianne smiles
theyre breath and bodies steaming as they walk
look touch that
brandon bows pointing to the back of his head
marianne turns to touch brandons head
as she does so he growls at her like a little dog
they both laugh
laughs oh no no no
laughs youre such a
she pushes him playfully
no seriously seriously
theres a massive knot on the back of his head
oh my god
do you feel that
yeah what is it
its a remnant
yeah from the neanderthals
theres only a few of us left since the homo sapiens took over
that would explain the forehead
whats that supposed to mean
whats that supposed to mean

chuckles no seriously how did you get it
coughs i used to play this game with my cousin
where i would sit on his feet and hed fly me through the air
i hit my head on the ceiling and i blacked out
they both laugh
marianne laughs hysterically
brandon laughs along
i was knocked out for minutes
i peed my pants
reacts sympathetically oh

what would you be
i always wanted to be a musician in the sixties
thats cool a musician
sixties is tough though
i saw gimme shelter recently you know the rolling stones documentary
it kind of seemed like hell
laughs yeah the sixties would be the last place id want to be
so where would you wanna and what would you wanna be
thats boring fuck you
laughs still walking along brandon thinks for a moment
brandon turns and stares at marianne holding his gaze
theres a silence as they walk on
they get to a subway entrance
well this is me
brandon nods hovers by the subway awkward and yet this is you
they stand heady from the wine and a little awkward
thank you very much brandon
thank you very much marianne
we should do this again
they loiter on the edge of something more
brandon hovers momentarily fragile the sting of uncertainty
marianne descends into the depths of the subway with a half wave
so is that a yes
the click of the door brandon enters
the sound of the record player which had finished hours ago rotates empty on the turntable
pulling off his jacket hello
brandon puts the needle back in its dock
he hangs up his jacket takes his bag heads towards the living room
he spies all sissys crap spilling out across the floor he sighs
heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge
the lock of the front door rotates
someone is entering the apartment
darkness sissy bursts through the door in a hurry
after a moment the bathroom door opens cutting a slit of light into the darkness
from the blackness we see brandon framed masturbating in front of the bathroom sink
sissy shocked stands with her hand still on the door handle transfixed by a naked brandon
as brandon instinctively turns sissy runs from view
sissy slams the door shut
brandon looks at himself in the mirror full of shame and bewilderment and deep embarrassment
slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage
he hits the wall in frustration
brandon opens the bathroom door with towel tied around his waist looking for sissy
are you fucking spying on me
laughs lock the fucking door brandon
are you fucking spying
mimicking him uhh
are you fucking spying
brandon leans over sissy pushes her down onto the sofa
what do you want
what do you want
brandon climbs onto sissy straddling her
oh you wanna fight
you wanna fight
you wanna fight
you wanna fight
you want some of this
you want some of this
brandons towel falls down as he forcefully pins her down
you wanna fight
you wanna fight
what do you want from me
what do you want from me
brandon shakes sissy by the shoulders
she reacts upset now
shouts what do you want
shouts get off me
shouts why did you come here
get off me
get off me
get of me
youre fucking hurting me
talk to me
you fucking bitch
fucking get the fuck off you fucking weirdo
brandon stands and exits
sissy shouting after him
brandon locks the bathroom door
he exhales letting the moment slowly pass until brandon brandon lowers himself onto the floow desperately struggling with his emotions he closes his eyes eyelashes fragile and flickering until brandon
opens them reaches a hand out almost mechanically turns up the shower the room now swirling in steam trying to drown sissys voice out
brandon im sorry
brandon closes his eyes tears pricking sissy walking back from kitchen resigned brandons laptop on and open on his desk
sissy approaches it sinking down in front of the illuminated laptop
she absently taps the mouse dragging open a series of held windows the shifting lights of the screen cast across her face revealing slowly sissys face changes a blurred smorgasbord
of porn sites graphic and obscene their colors reflecting across her face and body
an escalating collage of graphic images obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom
the images haunting brutal from the weird to the sadomasochistic
the open windows an endless stacking of obscene chatroom conversation emails posted with graphic sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of fucking disappearing into the screen in
sissy is taken aback and strangely intrigued suddenly a voice from the screen images briefly glimpsed a woman legs splayed
hey wheres brandon
are you brandons girlfriend
do you want to play
sissy looks closer mildly appalled
do you wanna play with my tits
i know brandon would really like it
and i know exactly what brandon likes
brandon picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom
sissy takes her coat and leaves the apartment
the thump of music brandon sitting on the edge of his bed the pumping music from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder hands grasping his hair
then suddenly he enters the whole contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag
then brandon moving like a dervish through the apartment a black garbage bag in his hand dumping pieces of paper post it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone
numbers on the back
brandon moves on picking up anything he can find
an old jacket elbows worn
a handful of old t shirts
he moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy grabbing more crap along the way one of sissys dirty thongs on the floor
he picks it up moving on
an open fridge brandon tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by date mush into the bag
cans of red bull crappy cereals jam with mould on top an old joint magazines all get dumped on route
brandon heads out picking up more detritus along the way old pens an old cellphone a pair of defunked headphones a pile of porn mags in a cupboard pulled out
as he heads down along the corridor
brandon strips the room pulling out an old pair of sneakers smelling and cracked from under a chair
he peers up looks around the room almost bare his laptop resting on his desk
brandon stops considers initially resistant and then something finally compels him to do it he picks up the laptop yanking the plug hard from the wall
dumping it inside the garbage bag he moves on picking up an ipod a gameboy ipod nano wires and cables and stuff
slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage he drags the heaving bag of crap out into the corridor
the slam of the front door brandon heading down the steps of his apartment heaving the swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on the sidewalk
a pile of black garbage bags already piled up along the street in waiting for collection
further down the street a young couple holds hands walks by the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk
a siren goes past the distant banter of a gang of kids
brandon heads back up to his apartment shutting the door firmly
brandon now the voyeur looks across the room into mariannes office
he studies her almost like prey
the moment seems to last a lifetime
there is much want in brandons face but from this distance seems unobtainable
suddenly and without any warning brandon walks into his dream entering mariannes office and pulls her behind a partition kissing her unapologetically and passionately
she responds startled but happy to be taken
they pull away looking at one another
she smiles laughing his spirit infectious drawing her on
brandon leads marianne away
brandon and marianne stepping out of a cab brandon leading marianne both giggling and tripping
where are you taking me
laughs come on
youll see marianne stops
she smiles quizzically allowing herself to be guided and yet no where are we going
laughs come on
brandon snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top of the white water tank in the toilet
exiting we see marianne looking out onto the hudson from the large hotel window
brandon enters the bedroom stopping to prepare a drink
watching marianne at the window
you wanna drink
he pours a drink from the mini bar
what are you looking at
the view is amazing
brandon approaches nervously standing next to her
marianne leans up and kisses brandon
marianne takes brandons hand and leads him to the bed
we see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender touches
marianne caresses brandons face and kisses both his eyes
brandon attempts to do the same to marianne slowly but surely
this ritual becomes more aroused clothes start to fall away revealing for the first time both each others flesh
brandon rolls up her skirt laughs at her panites
laughs are they vintage
a little bit
laughs the ritual begins to get more passionate as they feel for each others breasts and thighs
at the height of this passionate encounter brandons attention strangely slowly starts to fade
its as if the intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him
he recoils unable to continue
both lie on their backs silently in frustration breathing heavily
mariannes face is one of puzzlement and hurt
she looks at brandon for some kind of answer
he gets up
marianne unsure what to do sits up and pulls down her skirt adjusts her hair
late afternoon sunlight seeping across the room brandon sits at the edge of the bath looking out onto the view
marianne looks at him the moment fragile
she does up her bra
you know its cool
should i go
hurt marianne put on her top picks up her bag and makes to leave i can walk you down
brandon looks back out over the grey of the hudson river
brandons face is one of embarrassment and failure
the click of the door marianne gone
the hum of the traffic audible through an ajar window
brandon reaches his hand out catching the breeze peering down a man on the edge
brandon banging the life out of hotel lover doggy style tits pressed up against the glass of the window the distant screech of horns
the trawl of cars the grey of the hudson river brandon and the hotel lover just visible high above caught full frontal in the window brandon close to climax a
cold sweat beading brandons forehead as he comes face twisted before the slow seep of release
brandon withdraws laughs
the hotel lover laughs as well
brandon turns for a moment she is almost beautiful
hotel lover smiles already pulling on her underwear
brandon watches her pulling on a tiny thong
she looks up stares at him
brandon looks away fighting back the cold flutter of shame
can i get you a drink
hotel lover hesitates smile shakes her head
hotel lover fingers fastening a cheap nylon bra
need a hand
the hooks odd sighs there you go
brandon sits on the bed now alone caught in the half light of dusk the rise and fall of a distant lift
brandon is sitting on the couch watching a cartoon
sissy enters the apartment on her cell phone
brandon ignores her into phone david
i take it youre at your pottery class
sissy hangs up
have you eaten
are you hungry
sissy sits down next to brandon on the couch
can you just give me a hug
brandon puts him arm around her
she snuggles up to him

brandon makes his way to the closet taking his coat

no youll move out
and then ill never hear from you again
brandon exits the apartment
brandons reflection in the window as the train travels
we see that brandon has a nasty cut on his cheek
earlier that night brandon sits drinks alone at the bar an older guy paws a gaunt young woman plying her with drinks knocking them back much to his delight
brandon watches catching the eye of a girl carly walking towards the bar her friends playing pool hey hey
carly smiles as she leans against the bar her breasts spilling out of her t shirt
close to you want to get out of here
carly giggles i could take you somewhere
carly looks over at her muscular boyfriend just visible across the bar talking to a couple of guys
are you with someone
does he go down on you
thats what i like to do
carly looks at him sobering and yet brandons hand discreetly reaches down up and under the girls skirt shocking her a little and yet i like the way it feels
i like the way its just me and it
i wanna taste you
i like to slip my tongue inside you carly leans in closer her lips blotting the edge of a glass overfilled with beer
just as you come
carly hesitates the moment hangs dangerous between them
brandon sucks his fingers
want me to make you come
i can do that
want me to do that
brandon strokes her chin hey
from behind carlys muscular boyfriend approaches quizzical whats up babe
carly nods deflects i was just getting some drinks
i was just telling your pretty girlfriend here that id like to fuck her in that tight pussy of hers
i mean bone her real hard til shes clawing up my back
carly gently bars her muscular boyfriend trying to diffuse lead him away
after i fuck her hard up the ass i put my balls in her mouth while i come on her face
to carly you wont let me fuck you in the ass

brandon turns smiles provocatively knows whats coming next
the muscular boyfriend reacts as brandon shoves his fingers under his nose
the muscular boyfriend shoves brandon
jesus come on
you mother fucker
brandon laughs sips his drink brandon is rounding a corner doing up his jacket
the muscular boyfriend runs out after him
he spins brandon around and punches him
the slip and slide of brandons shoes his face smashed against the sidewalk
the muscular boyfriend comes in hard again kicking him sharp in the ribs
brandon recoils yet almost seems to want more as he struggles to stand
he spits on brandon
brandon walking aimless and bleeding the drone of taxis streaking past
two women seated outside a bar drinking and smoking lost in their laughing conversation oblivious brandon walks on a young man with a satchel roughly brushes past him the young
man wavers on seeing brandon is crying moving on brandons face head down wanting to get away
a rush of teenagers and middle aged couples spilling out of a cinema brandon walking disorientated jaywalking through the traffic
the screech of horns brandon ignores them he crosses streets traffic darting off the sidewalk into the road when human dog or stroller gets in his way until brandon walking
past a blur of yellow neon and glow of shop signs across the street a snaking queue of men wait in line outside a club
he keeps walking eyes scouring teenagers loiter in oversized clothes sunk under caps and hoods
a lively bar a couple of hot girls entering brandon considers goes to enter barred by bouncers who point him back along the cue he stands in line across the
street a thick set guy eyes him
he stands smoking outside a heaving bar
brandon looks away a gang of girls pass the bouncers let them in with ease
brandon reaches for his iphone tries to cover his face with his phone to get into the club woah
not tonight buddy
brandon ties to get in again
the bouncer stops him a second time
i said not tonight
the thick set guy over the street flicks out his cigarette eyes grazing over brandon as he re enters the heaving bar opposite
brandon considers hands sunk deep in his pockets
through the glass a heaving bar
brandon considers on the edge until he suddenly crosses the street narrowly avoiding a taxi streaking past
fluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a beam on a lighthouse a heaving dance floor of butch bears skinny boys and twigs arms raised dancing to the pulse
the thick set guy walks away waiting for brandon to follow
passing through a low hung door brandon moves along a dark labyrinth of corridors eyes grazing over dimly lit crevices men caught briefly in light lost in fellatio and stand
up fucking brandon keeps walking drawn towards a dark doorway an endless darkness punctured with groans from dark cubicles brandon hesitates foot slipping on the moist floor
suddenly a hand reaches out drawing him into the dark cubicle the thick set guy presses brandon up against the wall kissing him tongue searching his mouth rubbing along its
roof hungry and urgent
brandon pulls away hands gently yet forcefully pushing the thick set guy down on his knees
brandon looks beyond a thin boy down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole between walls
brandon stands legs splayed letting the thick set guy take him in his mouth
he is beautiful
the palm of brandons hand pressed against the side of the cubicle
he stands fucking the thick set guy in the mouth the pulse of music heaving the club rocking punctured by groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within
brandon throws his head back gripping the cubicle wall
the early hours brandon heading away
he clocks his phone several messages from sissy logged
brandon listens to his voicemail from sissy brandon its sissy
i really need to talk to you
brandon pockets his phone
please will you pick up the fucking phone
brandon stops and knocks on an apartment door
a woman opens and brandon steps in
brandon has sex with a blonde and brunette
throughout the images of the threesome we hear more of sissys voicemail
were not bad people
we just come from a bad place
thanks for letting me stay
brandon at climax his animalistic grimace turns to pain and anguish
the grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground brandon stands on a platform
its not the rush hour yet
the rattle of the subway pulling in brandon boards the train
a virtually empty car brandon sits a columbian woman across the car head lent against the window half asleep clearly at the end of a long shift
above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising life brandons eyes graze over the poster he stands his reflection mirrored back at him preparing for his stop the train
screeches to a sudden halt wheels screeching along the track the columbian woman wakes a young student plugged headphone on looks up from reading her book
brandon inwardly curses
the train sits in the station
doors not opening
the silence at last punctured by the shrill hum of the intercom ladies and gentlemen at this time due to a police investigation we have to discharge this train
please follow the conductor to the rear of the train
the long low ping of the intercom fading out they wait
and wait in silence
brandon leans his head against the glass closes his eyes a hangover kicking in
the other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly wondering why the doors arent opening in the station
details of the carriage appear
half drunken cup of coffee
an old new york post
graffiti on all the car windows
suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way through the carriage that brandons in with the conductor ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end
watch your step between cars
passengers asking whats going on
brandon finally makes his way down with the other passengers to the last carriage
as he steps out he looks down to his far left and sees a police caution line being unraveled and engineers and firemen making their way to the far front
of the train
a large black woman face bowed sits talking to a police officer giving a statement watch your step
several engineers stand further down the platform surrounding a traumatised driver follow me please
two platform attendants talk to police officers
watch your step
quickly this way
nothing to see
right this way please
brandon makes his way past the wrought iron gate with other passengers going up the stairwell
brandon climbs the stairs filing out of the subway eyes catching on a womans shoes like sissys earlier at the boom boom room discarded
brandon picks up his pace
the intermittent whir of sirens brandon emerging from the subway already reaching for his cellphone beyond the glow of an ambulance brandon keeps walking heading off up the road quietly
he taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his ear
the pulse of a distant phone ringing the answer machine kicks in this is sissy
leave a message
dont if youre an asshole
brandon flicks it off slips it back in his pocket
brandon picks up his pace
he flicks out his phone again
tries again this is sissy
leave a me brandon is running now heart beating fast now breath quickening a seeping panic threatening to unleash shit
suddenly he makes a dash for it weaving through the sidewalk at pace
his finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by doing so will make it arrive quicker
brandon enters into the elevator
the door shuts immediately behind him
exiting brandon heads along the faceless corridor reaching his front door
he is already pulling out his keys and pushing them into the door with growing dread the sound of running water from the bathroom
brandon stops with relief leaning his forehead against the bathroom door letting himself exhale sissy brandon hesitates a seeping concern pricking his skin brandon walks into the bathroom freezing on
seeing sissy sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the toilet the pump of blood seeping from her wrists already pooled across the floor brandon reaches for sissy gripping her wrists deep slashes scissoring the veins the flap of skin flaying brandon pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash blood seeping between his fingers brandon looks at her wrist every time he moves his fingers he releases the pressure the blood flows
brandon grips them tighter a quiet determination to stop the bleeding the skid of blood underfoot brandon cradles her in his arms grappling with his phone desperately calling
brandon desperately holds her cradled between his legs his fingers pressing her wrists temporarily stemming the flow of blood the phone wedged between shoulder and chin
the slip of sissys wrist through brandons fingers
he slams down the phone struggling to hold her in his grasp
she slips again
brandon head bowed
sitting by sissys bedside sissy lies sleeping skin white strapped to a drip
the gentle rise and fall of her breath
brandons gaze falling on sissy lying in the hospital bed her wrists bandaged
brandon eyes falling on the scars covering her arms
he reaches out a hand on the edge of touching them letting his fingers hover over them until finally a finger lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm
she stirs a little but sissys eyes just opening focusing on him until murmuring shithead
relief overwhelming brandon he laughs exhales on the edge
brandon turns to stroke sissys hair rests his head next to hers
she sleeps again
brandon now walking along the side of the river railings seemingly speeding up his journey
beyond the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch out toward the open river
the endless grey of the hudson river close now brandon walking along a concrete jetty a rusting building oxidized and stained salt green edging along the jetty until brandon reaches
the edge of the jetty looking out the lap of grey water beneath
brandon stands a hangover kicking in and at once brandon is crying the tears flowing slow at first until they rush like floodgates opening
he reaches for breath trying to stifle the howls emanating from his body inconsolable now flooded with emotion brandon sinks squat to the ground buckled in two body shuddering
the lap of the water steady now brandon sobs and sobs and sobs a mess of snot and tears as he looks out over the wide sweep of the hudson
far off the drone of the freeway the early evening trawl of traffic kicking in the froth of the tide back and forth rising and breaking back and forth
brandon stands in his familiar spot on the platform waiting for the train that will take him to work
wearing a vacant face the train pulls into the station
he takes a seat automatically as if pre programmed
the train leaves the platform
looking into no mans land brandon feels the heat of someones gaze
as he instinctively looks up to respond a mixture of surprise fear excitement and doubt across his face
the pretty subway girl who we met at the beginning of our story is staring down at brandon this time in a more engaging fashion
she looks because she wants to be looked at
again a dance begins
this time she leads
engaged active decisive
brandons face is fractured into many conflicting emotions
its as if a magnet is drawing him in but at the same time hes trying to resist
at this moment the pretty subway girl stands up eyeing brandon as she makes her way to the door blocking brandon as the train pulls in to her stop
the train pulls away from the station and disappears into the tunnel
we do not know if brandon is still aboard or has succumbed to his urges
