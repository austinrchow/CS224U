lose on ann lifting her head risking a quick look around

he shifts his weight half turning
ong glances at ann who has resumed her lifeless pose
kong doesnt appear to notice shes moved several feet
he continues ann again starts to edge forward
she is startled when some creepy insects swarm out of a crack in the flagstones inches from her face
with only a few feet left to go ann quietly rises and scurries towards the stairway
she clambers into the narrow passage finally out of kongs sight
glancing back over her shoulder ann hurries down the stairway towards freedom
ann pauses at the bottom of the stairs listening for sounds of kong
all is quiet
she glances back up the stairs
no sign of him there
gathering all her strength ann emerges from the passage and makes a bold run across the clearing towards the cover of the thud

ann starts to draw upon her vaudeville routine swaying drunkenly and falling then bouncing back up
working her timing around kongs reactions he grows increasingly engaged
ngle on ann bounces up
beads of sweat trickle down her face
her eyes dart between the jungle and kong shes looking for her chance
but kong is a demanding audience

in this moment an unfamiliar feeling wells inside him
a half formed emotion he hasnt experienced much in his long life he feels a connection to this tiny creature
the spark of rage goes out in kongs eyes
kong stares at ann as a confusion of feelings wash over him
ong pulls back from ann
overcome by sudden uncertainty
he knows only that she has somehow disarmed him
and this has in turn diminished his power
kong starts to back away from ann slowly at first until doubt and fear compel him to move faster
suddenly he turns away
ann watches as kong lopes off

he manages to grab onto a rocky shelf
angle on preston is nearest to the far bank
he leaps and manages to catch hold of some hanging vines hauling himself up to safety
angle on the log plummets into a web of vines which arrest its fall and sends it flipping end on end throwing the men clear into mid air
denham jack and lumpy land in soft mud which cushions the impact of the landing
ann suddenly spins around
the distant sound of approaching footsteps through the dense jungle
a flicker of hope in anns eyes
she starts hurrying towards the footsteps
close on ann sees a distant plume of smoke over four miles away she hesitates
she slowly turns towards the sound of the footsteps which are now very close
suddenly a large foot tall carnivorous dinosaur is in the glade before her
ngle on ann as she quietly backtracks
the carnivore pauses as if sensing something
its nostrils twitch
she ducks behind a ngle on ann peering around from behind the tree
there is another carnivore behind her
it snares at her
ann leaps away
she barely has time to start running before the angle on ann races past the first carnivore
the creature turns its head
and soon both dinosaurs are pursuing ann
ngle on ann desperately heads towards the tangled root system of a huge tree
she throws herself forward as the carnivores jaws snap above her head
ngle on ann rolls and scrambles into a hollow under the rotten angle on the carnivore claw at the tree trying to get at ann
ann is lying beneath the roots
all she can see are legs and slavering snouts
the dinosaur rams its nose into the narrow suddenly
ann sees the legs of one of her pursuers lift off the ground its taloned feet thrashing in mid air
he second carnivore turns and flees into the jungle as ann is forced to watch the twitching legs shudder and flail
the sound of bone crunching
the carnivores legs spasm and go limp
ann is completely still she dare not breathe
whatever killed the carnivore is now inches from her hiding place
close on anns face
as she sees something crawling above her
close on a dark hole beneath the tree
long feelers probe along the roof of the hole as a huge centipede crawls towards her
ann doesnt move as it inches towards her face
suddenly she feels another crawling up over her shoulder
she desperately scrambles away from the centipedes
rolls out on the other side of the tree and stands to run
towering above her with the dead carnivore hanging limply from its huge jaws is a tyrannosaurus rex
ann starts running
the tyrannosaur crashes after her with the dead carnivore still in its mouth
as she races through the jungle dodging trees leaping over fallen logs smashing through bushes the tyrannosaur pounding ever closer in pursuit
ann can feel its hot sour breath blowing on the back of her neck
the huge jaws of the huge beast open inches from anns head
ngle on ann slips down a muddy bank rolls over a log and crashes noisily through a thicket of palms
angle on anns lungs are bursting but the tyrannosaur is gaining on her
she manages to scramble onto a fallen tree that juts out over a small cliff
ann clings onto the mossy log and crawls towards the end
the tyrannosaur cannot possibly follow her
she falls amongst the roots lying as flat as possible praying the tyrannosaur doesnt see her
it seems to work and it walks off
ann hesitantly sits up thinking that she is at last free only to turn and discover another is behind her
with an almost delicate movement the tyrannosaur nudges the log with its head
causing it to lurch dramatically
the tyrannosaur pushes harder sending ann over the side
she just manages to grab hold of a branch as she falls
ann hangs on desperately
ann is helpless
the tyrannosaur positions its head for the final lunge gaping jaws open impossibly wide
kong meets the tyrannosaur head on at full speed
he swings with his foot smashing the tyrannosaur against the fallen log
ann loses her grasp and falls
as the dinosaur sprawls onto the ground beside her
in a flash kong catches her mid fall
rolling away as the tyrannosaur leaps up and tries to take another swipe
ast fevered action a pair of carnivorous dinosaurs leap towards her
they cling onto kongs arm clawing furiously snapping at lose on saliva flies from wild snapping jaws
wide on kong rolls over thumping his arm against a tree crushing a dinosaur
ann is winded
she clings to kongs fingers as he strangles the second beast with one hand snapping its neck with a bone crunching sound
a second tyrannosaur attacks
he comes charging into shot grabbing kongs arm in his jaws
kong roars sending both tyrannosaurs sprawling to the ground
the first tyrannosaur scrambles back to its feet
kong holds ann protectively as he braces himself for the fight of his life
the two tyrannosaurs circle him
a third tyrannosaur comes from behind
hey attack kong and ann
a breathtaking fight to the death
kong fights like a madman on three separate fronts
not only does he have to do battle with the tyrannosaurs he is also protecting ann constantly transferring her from one hand to the other as the tyrannosaurs snap at
kong punches and smashes with his fists but he also uses wrestling style headlocks and flips
for a brief moment ann rolls free on the ground and has to dodge foot dinosaurs and the gorilla as the frenzied fight thunders all around her
the first tyrannosaur is taken out when kong lifts up a huge boulder and smashes it against the tyrannosaurs head
kong and the two tyrannosaurs slide down on to a rocky outcrop
kong outs the second tyrannosaur in a headlock flipping it over his shoulder and throwing it down into the chasm
clinging onto as it falls it snaps at kongs foot
and more smashing against the chasm walls
she falls and wide on ann faces the tyrannosaur
suddenly kong thuds down both
and for a moment ann kong lock eyes
she then backs he tyrannosaur snarls at kong and he roars back
kong throws ann gently to the side as he and the tyrannosaur lunge at each other
kong grabs his jaws in both hands forcing it open and biting the tyrannosaurs tongue
he rolls the tyrannosaur over and over using all his strength to force the tyrannosaurs jaws open before ripping them clean apart at the hinge
the tyrannosaur sprawls back dead
kong is panting heavily
he has been bitten raked and cut
he puts his foot on the last tyrannosaur and beats his chest triumphantly with a deafening roar
his blood is up he is ready to take on the world
he stands next attention but he looks away

moving purposefully along a well known route to his lair kong launches himself across a low chasm
one hand reaching out to clutch at thick vines on the other side
the thick vines tear away from the side of the chasm wall
kong falls backwards
ann still clutched protectively to his chest he lands with a thud
ann looks up alarmed
kong scrambles to his feet growling
he places ann on the ground pushing her protectively behind him
kong pov looming out of the chasm wall is a huge face
close on ann as her expression suddenly changes from fear to ann walks past kong

the image of kong
ann turns back excitedly to kong trying to make him understand
ann contd look its you
this is you
kong looks from ann to the huge statue
kong pov ann is dwarfed by the stone monolith
