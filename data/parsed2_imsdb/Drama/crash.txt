screenplay by david cronenberg based on a novel by j
ballard we are moving through a small airfield full of parked light planes
there are no people around
we move through the cluster of planes toward a hangar on the edge of the field
we are still moving through light planes but now we are inside the hangar
some of the planes have their engine covers open parts strewn around
others are partially covered with tarps or have sections missing
there is even a sleek executive jet parked in one corner
as we float past the planes we notice a woman leaning against the wing of a piper cub her chest against the wings trailing edge her arms spread out to
each side as though flying herself
as we get closer we see that her jacket is pulled open to expose one of her breasts which rests on the metal of the wing
cu breast on metal
cu hard nipple and rivets
cu woman catherine
early thirties dark short hair stylish executive clothes
her eyes are wide open but unfocussed
a hand grips her shoulder from behind
we follow the hand down behind catherine and discover a man crouched behind her kissing her back
catherine is standing on a low mechanics platform and her skirt has been raised and hooked over the wings flap
she wears garters and stockings but no panties
the man handsome cruel looking rises up behind her enters her kisses her neck
catherine half closes her eyes
she rotates her pelvis gently against the thrusting
we are floating toward the modest gates of a small film studio the sign above the gates says cineterra in art deco script
we now float through a film set on which a commercial for a mini van is being shot
lights are being reset the van polished for a beauty tracking shot
we pick up an assistant director as he strides through the action looking for someone
im looking for james
has anybody seen james ballard
you know who i mean
the producer of this epic
a dolly grip with very close cropped hair looks up from a section of dolly track which he is adjusting with small wooden wedges
i think i saw him in the camera department
we float toward the door marked camera dept
inside the room we find a young woman a camera assistant wearing a t shirt and heavy woolen socks and work boots and nothing else
she is draped across a table strewn with camera parts stomach down head resting on a black crackle finish camera magazine her legs spread
camera parts and cases tripods changing bags everywhere
a man is behind her kissing the backs of her thighs
we hear the sound of the ad approaching with deliberately heavy footsteps
the ad pauses just outside the door
off screen james
james are you in there
could we please get your stamp of approval on our little tracking shot
the man james looks up from the womans thighs
be there in a minute
the camera girl twists around on to her back and throws her legs over jamess shoulders
itll take more than a minute
catherine stands at the railing of the balcony of the ballard apartment which overlooks a busy expressway near the airport
her arms are spread wide as they were in the airplane hangar only now it is james her husband who is standing behind her
they are both half naked and he is inside her
their sex making is disconnected passionless as though it would disappear if they noticed it
an urgent uninterrupted flow of cars streams below them
where were you
in the private aircraft hangar
anybody could have walked in
did you come
what about your camera girl
did she come
we were interrupted
i had to go back to the set
catherine turns toward james and pulls open her blouse exposing her left breast
she pulls jamess face down and presses her nipple against his cheek
pause what can i do about karen
how can i arrange to have her seduce me
she desperately needs a conquest
ive been thinking about that about you and karen
james lingers among racks of nightdresses outside a changing cubicle
monitored by a bored seen it all middle aged saleswoman james glances now and then through the curtains to watch karen help catherine try on underwear
karen catherines secretary a moody unsmiling girl is methodically involved in the soft technology of catherines breasts and the brassieres designed to show them off
karen touches catherine with peculiar caresses tapping her lightly with the tips of her fingers first upon the shoulders along the pink grooves left by her underwear then across her
back where the metal clasps of her brassiere have left a medallion of impressed skin and finally on the elastic patterned grooves beneath catherines breasts themselves
catherine stands through this in a trance like state gabbling to herself in a low voice as the tip of karens right forefinger surreptitiously touches her nipple
james sits in the car beside his wife
she watches as his fingers move across the control panel switching on the ignition the direction indicator selecting the drive lever fastening his seat belt
as the car moves off james puts his free hand between catherines thighs
james studies storyboards for an automotive battery commercial which are spread out over a broad architects table
he makes notes on each panel of the boards with a sharp pencil
as we move around him we reveal his secretary renata sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point of her corner chair her hand poised to write down anything
he might say in a small leather bound notebook
from her point of view we watch james from behind as he works
every movement he makes bending over to correct a panel manipulating the pencil touching the sharp point of the pencil to his lip straightening up again provokes a different tiny
response from renata so attuned to him is she
but he says nothing to her and she remains poised and vigilant
james settles into his car a boring american four door sedan running through his control panel routine like a pilot before driving off
this time his routine ends with the switching on of the windshield wipers because it has begun to rain heavily
driving home from the studio james hits a deep puddle at miles an hour and suddenly finds himself heading into the oncoming lane
the car hits the central reservation with a thump and the offside tire explodes and spins off its rim
in the car james fights desperately for control
the car hurtles across the reservation and bouncing and slamming down on its suspension heads up the high speed exit ramp
three sedans are barreling down the ramp toward james
james pumps the brakes and saws away inexpertly at the wheel
he manages to avoid the first two cars but the third he strikes head on
at the moment of impact the man in the passenger seat of the other car is propelled like a mattress from the barrel of a circus cannon through his own
windshield and then partially through the windshield of jamess car
the propelled mans blood spatters jamess face and chest his body coming to rest half inside jamess car its head dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell
jamess chest hits the steering wheel his knees crush into the instrument panel his forehead hits the upper windshield frame
as this happens james is vaguely conscious of the same thing happening to the woman driving the other car as though she is a bizarre mirror image
slammed back into their seats after the initial impact james and the woman look at each other through the shattered windshields neither able to move
the woman handsome and intelligent looking supported by her seat belt stares at james in a curiously formal way as if unsure what has brought them together
out of the corner of his eye james can see the hand of the dead passenger now his passenger caught on the dashboard and lying palm upwards only a few
inches away from him
james squints as he tries to focus on a huge blood blister pumped up by the mans dying circulation which has a distinct triton shape
james shifts his focus to the hood ornament of his car twisted up into the cold mercury vapor glare of the roadway lights but still intact
it is the same triton imprinted on the palm of the dead passenger the car manufacturers logo
traffic is beginning to back up behind the accident and a growing circle of spectators some of them pedestrians some drivers who have left their own cars begins to form
the more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at the seized doors of the two cars afraid really to yank them open in case the violence of that act
might trigger some further unnamed catastrophe
numbly watching james as she fumbles to undo her seat belt the woman in the other crashed car inadvertently jerks open her blouse and exposes her breast to james its
inner curve marked by a dark strap like bruise made by her seat belt
in the strange desperate privacy of this moment the breasts erect nipple seems somehow impossibly a deliberate provocation
we are close on a face having makeup applied to it
it is a very pale blotchy face and the makeup is smoothing it making it appear healthy and even slightly tanned
there are also some crude black stitches in this face and we realize that it is jamess face and that a very serious catherine is applying the makeup
jamess legs are up in a sling drainage tubes coming from both knees
wounds on his chest broken skin around the lower edge of the sternum where the horn boss had been driven upwards by the collapsing engine compartment a semicircular bruise a
marbled rainbow running from one nipple to the other
stitches in the laceration across the scalp a second hairline an inch below the original
unshaven face and fretting hands
catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline executive than to visit her husband in hospital
there thats better
james examines himself in her hand mirror staring at his pale mannequin like face trying to read its lines
catherine looks around her as she puts her makeup away
there are twenty three other beds in the briskly efficient looking new ward all of them empty
not a lot of action here
they consider this to be the airport hospital
this ward is reserved for air crash victims
the beds are kept waiting
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you
ill listen for you buzzing over
catherine crosses her legs and tries to light a cigarette with a heavy mechanically complex lighter with which she is obviously unfamiliar
referring to the lighter is that a gift from wendel
it has an aeronautical feel to it
to celebrate the licence approval for our air charter firm
i forgot to tell you
catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette
she takes a deep drag
james props himself up on his elbow breathing with transparent pain
thats going well then
pause youre getting out of bed tomorrow
they want you to walk
james gestures for the cigarette
catherine puts the warm tip stained with pink lipstick into his mouth
the other man the dead man his wife is a doctor dr helen remington
shes here somewhere
as a patient of course
maybe youll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk
and her husband
what was he
he was a chemical engineer with a food company
a dark haired student female nurse comes into the ward
she wags a finger at james
no smoking please
as catherine retrieves the cigarette from james and stubs it out in a glass the nurse examines catherines glamorous figure her expensive suit her jewelry
to catherine are you this gentlemans wife
you can stay for this then
the nurse pulls the bedclothes back and digs the urine bottle from between jamess legs
she checks the level and satisfied drops it back flips over the sheets again
both catherine and james watch her closely her sly thighs under her gingham the movement of her breasts as she bends to check the chart at the foot of the
bed the pulse in her throat
the nurse catches them watching her smiles enigmatically back at them and leaves
catherine pulls out a manila folder from her bag and slips a set of storyboards for a commercial out of it
aida telephoned to say how sorry she was but could you look at the storyboards again shes made a number of changes
james waves the folder away
catherine examines his body aloofly curious
wheres the car
outside in the visitors car park
they brought the car here
my car not yours
yours is a complete wreck
the police dragged it to the pound behind the station
have you seen it
the sergeant asked me to identify it
he didnt believe youd gotten out alive
its about time
after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda its almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident
james is taking his walk through the hallways trundling his iv stand along with him like an awkward pet
a white coated doctor vaughan steps into the ward from a room at the end of the hall
he is bare chested under his white coat
his strong hands carry a briefcase filled with photographs which he pauses to shuffle through as though checking a map
as james approaches this new visitor vaughans pockmarked jaws chomp on a piece of gum creating the impression that he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards pornographic x
ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses
he sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrifying act of violence
vaughan looks james up and down taking in every detail of his injuries with evident interest
vaughan shuffles his photos again
james manages to make out the shapes of a few crushed and distorted vehicles caught in lurid flash lit news style
vaughan flips through them distractedly then with an unexpected almost flirtatious flourish slides them back into his briefcase and tucks it under his arm
well deal with these later
he flashes james an enigmatic smile and walks off down the hallway
as james turns to continue a young woman comes out of the same room that vaughan appeared from and moves toward him using a dark wooden walking stick
she presses her face into her raised shoulder possibly to hide the bruise marking her right cheekbone
the woman is dr
helen remington whose husband died in her car crash with james
james stops as she approaches
he speaks without thinking
the woman looks up at james as she continues her approach
she does not falter but changes her grip on the cane as if preparing to thrash him across the face with it
she moves her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck deliberately forcing her injury on him
she pauses when she reaches the doorway waiting for him to step out of her way
james looks down at the scar tissue on her face a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long running from the corner of her right eye to the
apex of her mouth
james is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mauve bathrobe her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of white plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite
armpit like a classic hollywood ball gown
james steps aside
deciding to ignore him helen remington walks stiffly along the communication corridor parading her anger and her wound
catherine washes jamess body as he lies in his hospital bed gently exploring his bruises and his wounds
both front wheels and the engine were driven back into the drivers section bowing the floor
blood still marked the hood streamers of black lace running toward the windshield wiper gutters
catherine resoaps her right hand from the bar in the wet saucer on the bed tray a cigarette in her left
james strokes her stockinged thigh as she continues her monologue
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel
the instrument panel was buckled inwards cracking the clock and the speedometer dials
the cabin was deformed and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside
the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids
you should have gone to the funeral
i wish i had
they bury the dead so quickly they should leave them lying around for months
what about his wife
the woman doctor
have you visited her yet
no i couldnt
i feel too close to her
catherine and james travel home in the back seat of a taxi
learning against the rear window of the taxi james finds himself flinching with excitement toward the approaching traffic streams which now seem threatening and super real
catherine watches him aware that he is over exhilarated very excited herself by his new sensitivity to the traffic
james sits in a reclining chair on the balcony of his apartment looking down through the anodized balcony rails at the neighborhood ten stories below
cars fill the suburban streets choking the parking lots of the supermarkets ramped on to the pavements
two minor accidents have caused a massive tail back along the flyover which crosses the entrance tunnel to the airport
in one of them a white laundry van has bumped into the back of a sedan filled with wedding guests
james gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture this incomprehensible pinball machine
catherine comes on to the balcony kneels down beside him begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees
renata tells me youre going to rent a car
i cant sit on this balcony forever
im beginning to feel like a potted plant
how can you drive
you can barely walk
is the traffic heavier now
there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident
ive never really noticed
is renata going with you
i thought she might come along
handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine
im amazed that shell let you drive her
youre not envious
maybe i am a little
rising james ive got to leave for the office
are you going to be all right
james stands at the entrance to his apartment buildings underground garage
only about a dozen cars are there most of them have been driven to work
james walks among those that remain absorbing the details of the personal things left in them a silk scarf lies on a rear window sill a pair of sunglasses hooked
over a carpeted transmission hump
james stops in front of the empty bay marked balladr
he stares at the familiar pattern of oil stains marking the cement
a steering wheel an instrument panel a windshield
renatas hips gripped by the fabric of the passenger seat her legs stowed out of sight beneath her red plastic raincoat
james drives renata in a rented car his first drive since the accident
the rented car slows and stops on the concrete verge a few yards from the spot where jamess crash took place
are we allowed to park here
im sure the police would make an exception in your case
james unbuttons renatas raincoat and places his hand on her thigh
she lets him kiss her throat holding his shoulder reassuringly like an affectionate governess
theres still a patch of blood there on the road
did you see it
i saw the blood
it looks like motor oil
you were the last one i saw just before the accident
do you remember
we made love
are you still involving me in your crash
an airline coach passes the passengers bound for milan staring down at the couple in the car
renata buttons her coat
james steps from the car his right knee giving way after the effort of driving
at his feet lies a litter of dead leaves cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety glass crystals
a hundred yards behind them a dusty old lincoln is also parked on the verge
the leather jacketed driver watches james through his mudspattered windshield broad shoulders hunched against the door pillar
as james crosses the road the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers at james through the eye piece
spotting the man renata opens the car door for james
who is that man
is he a private detective
james gets back into the car
can you drive
i can drive
james shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the man with the camera
as they approach him he gets out of his own car ignoring them and kneels down to study the hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface
as james and renata drive past the kneeling man the sunlight highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around his mouth
the man looks up at james and he recognizes vaughan the young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport hospital
james proudly shows off his new car to catherine and karen at their offices at the airport
the car is identical to the one he crashed
james sits sideways in the drivers seat door open weirdly jaunty
i cant believe youve done this
this is the exact same car as your old one isnt it
yes it is
to james are you planning to have another car crash
im not thinking about the crash at all
james is telling the truth
what he is thinking about is the way that karens hip casually brushes against catherines hip without either woman seeming to be conscious of it
james enters the gate of the police pound on foot and shows his pass to the guard at the gate
his pass now stamped he hesitates for a beat before he enters
some twenty or so crashed vehicles are parked in the sunlight against the rear wall of an abandoned cinema
at the far end of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed as if the dimensions of space had abruptly contracted around the body
of the driver
unnerved by these deformations james moves from one car to the next until he comes to his own
the remains of towing tackle are attached to the front bumper and the body panels are splashed with oil and dirt
he peers through the windows into the cabin runs his hand over the mud stained glass
without thinking he kneels in front of the car and stares at the crushed fenders and radiator grill
two policemen cross the yard with a black alsatian dog
they watch james hovering around his car as if they vaguely resent his touching it
when they are gone he unlatches the drivers door and with an effort pulls it open
james eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat tipped back by the bowing of the floor
he nervously lifts his legs into the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the pedals which have been forced out of the engine compartment so that
his knees are pressed against his chest
the two policemen are exercising their dog across the yard
james opens the glove compartment forcing the shelf downwards
inside covered with dirt and flaked plastic are a set of route maps a mildly pornographic novel a polaroid of renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with
her breasts exposed
james pulls open the ashtray which promptly jumps on to his lap releasing a dozen lipstick smeared butts
someone passes in front of the car
a policemans voice calls from the gatehouse
through the windshield james sees a woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wrecked cars
the woman helen remington approaches the car next to his a crushed convertible involved in a massive rear end collision
james sits quietly behind the steering wheel
helen turns from the convertible
she glances at the hood of jamess car clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her husband
as she raises her head she sees james through the glassless windshield frame sitting behind the deformed steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband
helens strong eyes barely change their focus but one hand rises involuntarily to her cheek
she takes in the damage to the car then takes in james
without giving away anything she turns and moves toward a damaged truck then turns and comes back as james gets out of his car
she gestures toward the damaged vehicles then speaks to james as though continuing a conversation already in progress
after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one
pause im trying to find charless car
its not here
maybe the police are still holding it
their forensic people
they said it was here
they told me this morning
she peers critically at jamess car as if puzzled by its distorted geometry
this is your car
she reaches out a gloved hand and touches the radiator grill feeling a chrome pillar torn from the accordion as if searching for some trace of her husbands presence among
the blood spattered paintwork
youll tear your gloves
james gently takes her hand and moves it away from the grill
i dont think we should have come here
im surprised the police dont make it more difficult
were you badly hurt
i think we saw each other at the hospital
pause i dont want the car
in fact i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped
can i give you a lift
almost apologetically i somehow find myself driving again
james is driving helen remington away from the police pound
you havent told me where were going
to the airport if you could
at these words james is stricken by an odd feeling of loss
are you leaving
not yet though not soon enough for some people ive already found
a death in the doctors family makes the patients doubly uneasy
i take it youre not wearing white to reassure them
ill wear a bloody kimono if i want to
so why the airport
i work in the immigration department there
james is very aware that as they speak helen is intently watching his hands and feet operating the controls of the car perceiving these motions in a way that she
never would have before her crash with him
he in turn has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars which she now makes no attempt to hide
she pulls a cigarette packet from the pocket of her raincoat
she searches the instrument panel for the lighter her right hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird
having found the lighter her strong hands tear away the cellophane from the cigarette pack
do you want a cigarette
i started to smoke at the hospital
its rather stupid of me
suddenly very agitated look at all this traffic
im not sure i can deal with it
its much worse now
you noticed that did you
the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didnt understand
there seemed to be ten times as much traffic
are we imagining it
helen waves her cigarette in a gesture that takes in the whole interior of the car
youve bought yourself exactly the same car again
its the same shape and colour
they are now passing the spot where their crash took place
intimidated by the aggressive traffic around him james allows the front wheel of the car to strike the curb of the central reservation throwing a tornado of dust and cigarette
packs on to the windshield
the car swerves from the fast lane and veers toward an airline coach coming out of the exit ramp
helen quickly shifts to the left of her seat and pressing her shoulder against jamess closes her hand over jamess hand on the wheel
with helens help james just manages to pull the car behind the coach
they watch the cars swerving past on both sides of them horns sounding
turn up here into the car park
it wont be busy this time of day
the car winds its way slowly up the rampways leading to higher and higher parking levels
james finds the rhythm soothing and begins to calm down
ive found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic
i like to look at it
yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour
anywhere i said
we sat in a massive traffic jam under an off ramp
i dont think we moved more than fifty yards
pause im thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory
they need a medical officer
the salary is larger something ive got to think about now
theres a certain moral virtue in being materialistic im beginning to feel
well its a new approach for me in any case
the road research laboratory
where they simulate car crashes
isnt that rather too close
thats the point
besides i know i can give something now that i wasnt remotely aware of before
its not a matter of duty so much as of commitment
they have now reached the top level of the multi story car park and james pulls into a parking spot overlooking a major runway
an immense jumbo jet is maneuvering into its take off position
james turns off the car and puts his arms around helen
she offers no resistance as though the whole scenario were well understood and agreed upon
james kisses her mouth her eyelids unzips her dress
with the jet engines screaming for accompaniment helen lifts her right breast from her brassiere pressing jamess fingers against the hot nipple
helen now straddles him and awkwardly meshing with the technology around them they make love in the drivers seat of the car
james and catherine make love in the same position as in the preceding scene
jamess thoughts keep flashing back to himself and helen in his car the images mixing confusingly with his present lovemaking to catherine
james is back in his office but it is obvious that he is only nibbling at the work that has piled up in his absence
renata comes in
i almost forgot to give you this
probably because i know youre going to like it
renata hands james a brown manila envelope with no markings on it
what is it
a complimentary ticket for a special stunt driving exhibition
definitely not part of the big auto show
theres a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discreet about the location
what kind of exhibition is it
i suspect it involves re enactments of famous car crashes
you know jayne mansfield james dean albert camus
but youll have to take your new friend the female crash test dummy
she dropped it off for you
youre not jealous are you
you have to understand
helen and i had this strange intense
renata kisses him hard then bites his lip
james pulls away in surprise
weve had a few of those ourselves havent we
renata turns on her heel and floats out the door leaving james to contemplate the contents of the envelope
we are looking at the words little bastard written in black script on silver metal enamel on unpainted aluminum
we pull back to reveal the entire metal object which is a porsche spyder race car
it is small and curvaceous and is being fussed over by several men in overalls
the number is painted on its hood and doors
the porsche sits on a country road two lane blacktop heavily wooded lit by a series of movie lights
on the hills lining the road a few rough wooden stands have been erected
a blond man vaughan stands near the rear of the porsche a microphone in his hand
his voice floats eerily out of the woods from speakers mounted on a series of pine trees
over speakers dont worry that guys gotta see us
these were the confident last words of the brilliant young hollywood star james dean as he piloted his porsche spyder race car toward a date with death on a lonely
stretch of california two lane blacktop route
dont worry that guys gotta see us
the year the day september thirtieth the time now
helen and james sit in a half empty stand looking down at the road from amid the trees
helen has her arm around jamess waist her face touching his shoulder
its strange i thought all this would be far more popular
helen is consulting a yellow program sheet
the real thing is available free of charge
besides its not quite legal
they cant advertise
over speakers the first star of our show is little bastard james deans racing porsche
he named it after himself and had his racing number painted on it
who is that
do i know him
he talked to you at the hospital
i thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research
he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash
when i first met vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems
i dont know what he is now
over speakers the second star is stuntman and former race driver colin seagrave who will drive our replica of james deans car
seagrave a coarse and burly man wriggles his way behind the wheel of the delicate little race car without acknowledging the cheers of the crowd
he wears james dean clothes a red windbreaker a white t shirt jeans loafers prescription glasses with clip on sunshades
as he talks vaughan tours the phalanx of tripod mounted cameras to check their placement and chats off mike with the pair of cameramen with hand held cameras
he seems to be more the director of the event possibly the ringmaster than an actor in it
over speakers i myself shall play the role of james deans racing mechanic rolf wutherich sent over from the porsche factory in zuffenhausen germany
this mechanic was himself fated to die in a car crash in germany twenty six years later
and the third and in some ways most important party the college student donald turnupseed played by movie stuntman brett trask
trask slim and wiry wearing loafers and a blazer waves his hand and gets into a replica of turnupseeds two tone black and white ford sedan
he starts up the ford which smokes badly and drives it up the hill about yards
over speakers turnupseed was on his way back to his home in fresno for the weekend
james dean was on his way to an automobile race in salinas a dusty town in northern california
the two would only meet for one moment but it was a moment that would create a hollywood legend
at this point vaughan who is dressed in light blue cotton s mechanics overalls sees james and helen in the thin crowd and waves to them as though they were
long standing aficionados of crash spectacles
he doesnt wait to see if they react but immediately steps into the passenger side of the porsche microphone still in hand
over speakers youll notice that we are not wearing helmets or safety padding of any kind and our cars are not equipped with roll cages or seat belts
we depend solely on the skill of our drivers for our safety so that we can bring you the ultimate in authenticity
all right here we go
the fatal crash of james dean
vaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who also functions as an assistant and then sinks down into the silver car
seagrave starts the porsche which settles quickly into a husky idle
a few blips of the throttle and then the porsche is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road
when the porsche stops the excited crowd goes quiet
an assistant with a walkie talkie kneels beside the silver car on the drivers side co ordinating the start with his opposite number standing next to the ford over the
there is a calculated pause before anything happens and then the porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the hill
from their vantage point in the stand james and helen can clearly see that the ford has also started and that the two cars are headed toward each other each
in its respective lane
the porsche accelerates hard the ford lumbers along at a moderate pace swaying clumsily on its soft springs
as the cars approach each other james notices a fresh clearing at the side of the road at just about the point where they seem likely to pass
sure enough when the cars are about thirty yards apart the ford wanders over the center line
as the porsche approaches it it seems to move back into its own lane but then suddenly swerves again as though making a left turn
the porsche in its turn swerves to avoid the big american car but they collide the immense chrome grill punching into the side of the fragile race car crumpling it
like a wad of tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road into the clearing that has been prepared for it
as the porsche hobbles to a stop vaughan seems to stand up on his seat and then throw himself out of the car rolling over whats left of the front
hood on to the ground
seagrave remains slumped in the drivers seat
vaughan lies still where he lands a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of the race car
the door of the ford opens and trask stumbles out
he begins to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner and the crowd which has been buzzing goes silent again
trask walks away from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the edge of the road
there is no movement from either seagrave or vaughan
james is not sure how to react but helen seems genuinely worried
is that part of the act or are they really hurt
i dont know
you can never be sure with vaughan
this is his show
a stills cameraman runs out of nowhere and kneels beside the apparently stricken vaughan in the weeds at the side of the road
it is not clear whether he is taking his picture or ministering to him
it soon becomes clear that he has handed him a radio microphone because vaughans low melodramatic growl now ripples out of the woods from the tree speakers
over speakers rolf wutherich was thrown from the porsche and spent a year in the hospital recovering from his injuries
donald turnupseed was found wandering around in a daze basically unhurt
james dean died of a broken neck and became immortal
vaughan now leaps to his feet hands raised in triumph
seagrave stirs behind the wheel then raises his hands
trask emerges from the woods waving to the now supercharged crowd
seagrave tries to get out of the collapsed porsche but is jammed behind the wheel
without missing a beat vaughan dances over to the car and begins to haul seagrave out of his seat
i cant stand up
helen stands up as the crowd buzzes
i know that man seagrave the stunt driver
i think hes genuinely hurt
helen makes her way down the rickety grandstand steps toward the road and james follows her
just as james and helen step on the road six police cars lights flashing and sirens wailing converge on the lit stretch of road three from each end
they screech to a halt and dozens of cops pour out of the cars
the crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to the road
a loudspeaker mounted on one of the police cars begins to blare
over loudspeaker this is an illegal and unauthorized automotive demonstration which is in contravention of the highway traffic act
you are all liable to fines and possible arrest and confinement
disperse at once
disperse at once
because james and helen are just in advance of the first wave of spectators they manage to link up with vaughan as he helps haul a still groggy seagrave off
the road and into the woods
helen takes seagraves free arm
to vaughan whats the matter with seagrave
hit his head i think
his balance is off
the police spread out through the crowd collaring people at random before they are able to escape into the woods
james and helen help vaughan hustle seagrave through the woods
the din of the roadway fades away behind them
why are the police taking this all so seriously
its not the police
its the department of transport
its a joke
they have no idea who we really are
in the gathering darkness of the woods it is apparent that james doesnt really know who they are either
vaughan drives the lincoln through a scarred bleak landscape
in the front seat with him are helen and james
seagrave is lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed
that was glib wasnt it
james dean died of a broken neck and became immortal
but i couldnt resist
vaughan puts his hand between helens thighs
she seems not to notice but her eyes close dreamily every once in a while
james watches microscopically
sometimes when the flow of traffic allows vaughan stares intently at james while his hand works away between helens thighs and james looks away flushed like a schoolgirl
the lincoln turns into the forecourt of seagraves garage and showroom
his business which has clearly seen better days is hot rodding and customized cars
behind the unwashed glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a s brooklands racer faded bunting stuffed into the seat
they get out of the car helping the woozy seagrave through the door at the side of the showroom which leads to the stairway up to the apartment above the
the seagrave apartment is dirty and depressing featuring cheap cigarette scarred leatherette furniture
james watches helen and vaughan steer seagrave into the living room where two people sit on a couch watching television with the sound turned off gabrielle a sharp faced young
woman who is rolling a hash joint and seagraves wife vera a handsome restless woman of about thirty
vera stands as they come in and rushes over to the shaky seagrave
here lie down
vera and helen lay the confused seagrave down on the three seat sofa while vaughan sits next to gabrielle and helps her prepare another hash joint
james awkwardly left standing notices long scars on veras thighs and legs
they did the james dean crash
it seemed to go perfectly
but he started to feel nauseous on the way back
im sure its concussion
were familiar enough with that then arent we
james watches gabrielle and vaughan
as she rolls a small piece of resin in a twist of silver foil vaughan brings a brass lighter out of his hip pocket
gabrielle cooks the resin and shakes the powder into the open cigarette waiting in the roller machine on her lap
on gabrielles legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus scars faint circular depressions on the kneecaps
she notices james staring at her scars but makes no effort to close her legs
on the sofa beside her is a chromium metal cane and as she shifts her weight james sees that the instep of each leg is held in the steel clamp
of a surgical support
it now becomes obvious from the over rigid posture of her waist that she is also wearing a back brace of some kind
gabrielle rolls another cigarette out of the machine but does not offer it to james
instead vaughan gets up and takes it over to seagrave who has managed to sit up
id really like to work out the details of the jayne mansfield crash with you
we could do the decapitation her head embedded in the windshield and the little dead dog thing as well
you know the chihuahuas in the back seat
ive got it figured out
seagrave takes the lit joint and draws heavily on it
he holds the smoke in his lungs for a while studies the grease on his hands before he answers
you know ill be ready vaughan
but ill want to wear really big tits out to here so the crowd can see them get cut up and crushed on the dashboard
james turns to go leaving helen to her conversation with vera but vaughan follows him through the door holding his arm in a powerful grip
dont leave yet ballard
i want you to help me
james follows vaughan down a cramped corridor to a photographic workshop formed out of a warren of small rooms
vaughan eases james into the first room and then carefully closes the door behind them
do you live here
laughs i live in my car
this is my workshop
pinned to the walls and lying on the benches among the enamel pails are hundreds of photographs
the floor around the enlarger is littered with half plate prints developed and cast aside once they have yielded their images
vaughan makes a sweeping gesture that takes in all the photographs
and this is the new project ballard
as vaughan hunts around the central table turning the pages of a leather bound album james looks down at the discarded prints below his feet
most of them are crude frontal pictures of motor cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway collisions surrounded by spectators and police and close ups of impacted radiator grills and
vaughan opens the album at random and hands it to james
he leans back against the door and watches as james adjusts the desk lamp
the first thirty pages record the crash hospitalization and post recuperative romance of the young woman gabrielle a social worker the photos suggest who is currently getting very stoned in
the next room
by coincidence her small sports car had collided with an airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the site of jamess own accident
vaughan had obviously been there shooting film moments after the crash
the incredibly detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy instructor
the remainder of the album describes the course of jamess own accident and recovery and includes his sexual encounters with renata helen remington and his own wife catherine
vaughan stands at jamess shoulder like an instructor ready to help a promising pupil
james closes the book
what kind of help can i possibly be to you
you seem to be everywhere at once as it is
at that moment there is a knock at the door and then gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room on her shackled legs
she holds out a couple of joints to vaughan
thought you might be missing these
to james so here you are at the nerve centre
vaughan makes everything look like a crime doesnt he
vaughan takes the joints and lights them both
he hands one to james who takes it gratefully
what exactly is your project vaughan
a book of crashes
a medical study
a sensational documentary
its something were all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology
james watches renata and catherine talking animatedly at the other end of his office
he cant hear what they are saying but renata is showing catherine layouts of ads involving images of private planes flying in formation
they touch each other from time to time without seeming to notice it but james notices it
james and catherine set off for home in their own separate cars
at times they are within sight of each other and james watches her microscopically as though he didnt know her as though perhaps she isnt human
at one point he sees her with her hands resting on the steering wheel her right index finger picking at an old adhesive label on the windshield
and then abruptly james is aware of the dented fender of vaughans lincoln only a few feet behind catherines sports car
vaughan now surges past james crowding along the roadway as if waiting for catherine to make a mistake
startled catherine takes refuge in front of an airline bus in the nearside lane
vaughan drives alongside the bus using his horn and lights to force the driver back and again cuts in behind catherine
james moves ahead along the center lane shouting to vaughan as he passes him but vaughan is signalling to catherine pumping his headlights at her rear fender
without thinking catherine pulls into the courtyard of a filling station forcing vaughan into a heavy u turn
tires screaming he swings around the ornamental flower bed with its glazed pottery plants but james blocks his way with his own car
heart racing catherine sits still in her car among the fuel pumps her eyes flashing at vaughan
james steps from his car and walks across to vaughan who watches james approach as if he had never seen him before scarred mouth working on a piece of gum
as he gazes at the aircrafts taking off from the airport
vaughan what the hell are you doing
are you trying to create your own famous crash
vaughan hooks his gear lever into reverse
it excited her ballard
your wife catherine
she enjoyed it
vaughan reverses his car in a wide circle almost running down a passing pump attendant and sets off across the early afternoon traffic
james and catherine lie naked in bed she with her back to him buttocks pressed into his groin
he is inside her
he must have fucked a lot of women in that huge car of his
its like a bed on wheels
it must smell of semen
do you find him attractive
hes very pale
covered with scars
would you like to fuck him though
in that car
but when hes in that car
have you seen his penis
i think its badly scarred too
from a motorcycle accident
is he circumcised
can you imagine what his anus is like
describe it to me
would you like to sodomize him
would you like to put your penis right into his anus thrust it up his anus
tell me describe it to me
tell me what you would do
how would you kiss him in that car
describe how youd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans then take out his penis
would you kiss it or suck it right away
which hand would you hold it in
have you ever sucked a penis
do you know what semen tastes like
have you ever tasted semen
some semen is saltier than others
vaughans semen must be very salty
they both have huge orgasms within moments of each other
we are close on the distracted solicitous face of helen remington
have you come
helen remington and james are having sex in the back seat of helens car helen sitting on jamess lap with her back to him
she dismounts him and touches his shoulder with an uncertain hand as though he were a patient she had worked hard to revive
helens car is parked on the upper level of the airport car park which is currently quite busy
streams of traffic both pedestrian and vehicular flow past the car
james lies against the rear seat of the car while helen dresses with abrupt movements straightening her shirt around her hips like a department store window dresser jerking a garment
on to a mannequin
please finish your story
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital
then the husband of a colleague of mine then a trainee radiologist then the service manager at my garage
and you had sex with all of these men in cars
only in cars
i didnt plan it that way
and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts
as though they were traffic accidents
laughs they felt like traffic accidents
we are witnessing a spectacular road accident re created under laboratory conditions in the immense confines of the road research lab
a motorcycle is in the process of having a head on collision with a sedan bearing a family of four an extremely violent and disturbing crash despite the use of
cradles dummies rails cables and extensive metering and recording technology
among the many witnesses to the crash including numerous engineers technicians and transport ministry officials are james helen and vaughan
vaughan is energetically masturbating through his jeans shielded by a sheaf of publicity folders which he holds in his other hand
there is a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle strikes the front of the sedan
the two vehicles veer sideways towards the line of startled spectators
the motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the car and strike the windshield then careen across the roof in a black mass of fragments
the car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to rest astride its rails
the hood windshield and roof have been crushed by the impact
inside the cabin the lopsided family lurch across each other the decapitated torso of the front seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured windshield
the engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move toward the motorcycle which lies on its side fifty yards behind the car
but it is vaughan a black jacketed figure striding on long uneven legs who arrives first at the bike
for a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up pieces of the motorcyclists body
and then turns away completely and rejoins helen and james
vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand outs in his grip
get all the paper you can ballard
some of the stuff theyre giving away is terrific mechanisms of occupant ejection tolerances of the human face in crash impacts
helen takes jamess arm smiling at him nodding encouragingly as if urging a child across some mental hurdle
we can have a look at it again on the monitors
theyre showing it in slow motion
an audience of thirty or so gathers at the trestle tables to watch a slowmotion replay on a huge television monitor
as the hypnotic grotesque ballet unfolds the crowds own ghostly images stand silently in the background hands and faces unmoving while the collision is re enacted
the dream like reversal of roles makes them seem less real than the mannequins in the car
james looks down at the silk suited wife of a ministry official standing beside him
her eyes watch the film with a rapt gaze as if she were seeing herself and her daughters dismembered in the crash
james rides in vaughans car
vaughan drives aggressively rolling the heavy car along the access roads holding the battered bumpers a few feet behind any smaller vehicle until it moves out of the way
ive always wanted to drive a crashed car
you could get your wish at any moment
no i mean a crash with a history
camuss facel vega or nathaniel wests station wagon grace kellys rover
fix it just enough to get it rolling
dont clean it dont touch anything else
is that why you drive this car
i take it that you see kennedys assassination as a special kind of car crash
the case could be made
they approach a major intersection
for almost the first time on this drive vaughan applies the brakes
the heavy car sways and goes into a long right hand slide which carries it across the path of a taxi
flooring the accelerator vaughan swerves in front of it tires screaming over the blaring horn of the taxi
as they settle down vaughan reaches behind him and lifts a briefcase off the back seat
take a look at this and tell me what you think
james opens the briefcase and slides out a thick packet of glossy photographs all of them marked up with coloured ink pens
the photos are culled from a variety of sources newspapers magazines video stills film frames blown up to uniform x size
each one depicts a famous crash victim in the prime of life and each one has the wounds to come marked up very explicitly lines circling their necks and pubic
areas breasts and cheekbones shaded in section lines across their mouths and abdomens
handwritten notes complement the circles and arrows
a second packet of photographs shows the cars in which these famous people died
each photo is marked to show which parts of the cars destroyed or fused with which famous body part for example a close up of the dashboard and windshield from
the camus car michel gallimards facel vega is marked nasal bridge soft palate left zygomatic arch
im not sure i understand why
its the future ballard and youre already part of it
for the first time a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us
for example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity
impossible in any other form
to fully understand that and to live that
that is my project
what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology
i thought that was your project
a crude sci fi concept that floats on the surface and doesnt threaten anybody
i use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology
the traffic has jammed up to a walking pace
using his horn vaughan forces the drivers in the slower lanes to back up and let him across on to the hard shoulder
once free he accelerates past the lines of traffic occasionally scraping the right flank of the lincoln against the cement divider
in the distance the airport car park looms
the lincoln spirals its way up toward the upper levels of the airport carpark
james just spots a sharp faced young woman in a very short skirt an airport whore provocatively bent over a railing ostensibly to watch airplanes land and take off when
vaughan slams on the brakes and jumps out of the car
the startled james numbly obeys sliding over into the drivers seat as vaughan approaches the whore and begins to negotiate with her
james gingerly maneuvers the boat like car to one side to allow traffic to pass as vaughan returns with the gum chewing whore in tow
as the girl with short black hair and a boys narrow hipped body opens the passenger door vaughan hands her a joint and lights it for her
then lifting her chin he puts his fingers in her mouth and plucks out the knot of gum flicking it away into the darkness
lets get rid of that
i dont want you blowing it up my urethra
james drives the lincoln along the bizarrely lighted roads that ring the airport
vaughan and the whore are in the back seat
james adjusts the rear view mirror so that he can see into the rear seat
vaughan is having strange disconnected sex with the whore
james realizes that he can almost control the sexual act behind him by the way in which he drives the car
it is in that sense a sexual threesome or more properly a foursome because the sex between vaughan and the whore takes place in the hooded grottoes of the luminescent
dials surging needles and blinking lights of the black brooding lincoln
james and renata sort through some storyboards together at the architects table
renata takes a few cast offs and walks past the window toward the filing cabinet
she takes a quick peek out the window on her way
your friends still out there
james leaves the table and looks out the window
vaughan is sitting in his car in the center of the parking lot
most of the staff are leaving for home taking their cars one by one from the slots around vaughans dusty limousine
what does he want from you
hard to say
im going to leave now
do you want a lift
ill go with vaughan
james walks out into the nearly deserted parking lot to find two cars parked in front of vaughans lincoln a police patrol car and catherines white sports car
one policeman is inspecting the lincoln peering through the dusty windows with vaughan fidgeting beside him
the other stands beside catherines car questioning her
james slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to vaughan
catherine spots james and walks crisply over to him
theyre questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport
they think he was run over intentionally
vaughan isnt interested in pedestrians
as if taking their cue from this the policemen walk back to their car
vaughan watches them go head raised like a periscope
youd better drive him
hes a bit shaky
ill follow in my car
where is yours
i couldnt face all this traffic
id better come with you then
are you sure you can drive
as catherine and james walk toward vaughan he reaches into the rear seat of his car and pulls out a white sweatshirt
as he takes off his denim jacket the falling light picks out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest a constellation of white chips that circle his body from
the left armpit down to his crotch
the lincoln has entered an immense traffic jam and brake lights flare in the evening air
vaughan sits with one arm out the passenger window
he slaps the door impatiently pounding the panel with his fist
a police car speeds down the descent lane of a flyover headlights and roof lamps flashing
ahead two policemen steer the traffic from the nearside curb
warning tripods set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic slow
eventually they begin to edge past the accident site which is lit by a circle of police spotlights
three vehicles a taxi a limousine and a small sports sedan have collided where an on ramp joins the main roadway
a crowd has gathered on the sidewalks and on the pedestrian bridge that spans the road
beside the taxi its three passengers lie in a group blankets swathing their chests and legs
first aid men work on the driver an elderly man who sits upright against the fender of his car face and clothes speckled with drops of blood
the limousines passengers still sit in the deep cabin of their car their identities sealed behind the starred internal window
catherine has half hidden herself behind the passenger seat
her steady eyes follow the skid marks and loops of bloodstained oil that cross the familiar macadam like a battle diagram
vaughan by contrast leans out the window both arms ready as if about to seize one of the bodies
in some recess in the back seat he has found a camera which now swings from his neck
siren whining a third ambulance drives down the oncoming lane
a police motorcyclist cuts in front of james and slows to a halt signalling him to wait and allow the ambulance to pass
james stops the car
ten yards from them is the crushed limousine the body of the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it
three engineers work with surreal hand tools and hydraulic cutting and prying equipment at the rear doors of the limousine
they sever the jammed door mechanism and pull back the door to expose the passengers trapped inside the compartment
the two passengers a pink faced man in his fifties wearing a black overcoat and a younger woman with a pale anemic skin still sit upright staring blankly in the
a policeman pulls away the traveling rug that covers their legs and waists
the womans legs are bare the older mans feet splayed apparently broken at the ankles
the womans skirt has ridden up around her waist and her left hand holds the window strap
as the older man turns to the woman one hand searching for her he slips sideways off the seat his ankles kicking at the clutter of leather valises and broken
the traffic stream moves on
james eases the car forwards
vaughan raises the camera to his eye lowering it from sight when an ambulance attendant tries to knock it from his hands
the pedestrian bridge passes overhead
half out of the car vaughan peers at the scores of legs pressed against the metal railings then opens the door and dives out
as james pulls the lincoln on to the verge vaughan runs back to the pedestrian bridge darting in and out of the cars
james and catherine get out of the car
as james closes the door he notices that the blood of one of the accident victims has somehow been splashed on to the door handle and that some of it
is now on his hand
he finds a section of newspaper at the side of the road and wipes the blood off his hand
when he looks up he realizes that catherine has followed vaughan back to the accident site
james walks back alone eventually spotting them among the throng of spectators catherine watching vaughans scarred face intently provocatively as he photographs every aspect of the accident
there is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air among the onlookers and even a congregational feeling as one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan
prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the heads of the occupants
and now vaughan poses an only slightly reluctant catherine against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she were one of the shaken survivors of the accident
when the roof of the sports sedan is levered up the hair of the driver its only passenger comes off with it as though scalped stuck to the roofliner with
but its soon apparent that its not hair but rather a cheap tangled platinum blond wig
vaughan makes his way over to the sedan intrigued by the dangling scalp which is almost phosphorescent in the road rescue work lights
catherine trails obediently behind him like a harshly disciplined puppy
when the body of the driver is exposed to the lights the effect is doubly grotesque for not only is the driver dead and partially crushed but he is also
a cross dresser seagrave in jayne mansfield drag
his long greasy hair is tied up in a knot on his head he is unshaven his huge fake bosom is bloody and askew his bloated muscular body strains against
the pink s skirt and jacket the blue suede boots with high heels
there is also a dead chihuahua bitch inside the car with seagrave which vaughan manages to move with his foot until a cop outraged shoos him away
the dog is stiff with rigor mortis obviously dead long before the crash
an excited vaughan has spotted james and now approaches him breathless
he was worried that we would never do jayne mansfields crash now that the police were cracking down
so he did it himself
vaughan turns back to look at the wreck again almost reverent
this is seagraves own solitary work of art
shakes his head the dog god the dog is brilliant perfect
i wonder where he got it
now vaughan turns to james his face flushed incandescent with joy
come with me james
i have to document it
vaughan lopes off toward the seagrave wreck
but james hangs back watching as the passengers from the taxi are carried on stretchers to an ambulance
the dead chauffeur of the limousine lies with a blanket over his face while a doctor and two ambulance men climb into the rear compartment
beyond them vaughan begins to snap away at every possible aspect of seagraves wreck beginning with the dead chihuahua
some time later as the crowd disperses and the traffic begins to flow normally james kneels beside the lincoln and shows vaughan the blood on his door
catherine sits in the back seat
we must have driven through a pool of blood
if the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed
vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood
youre right ballard
theres an all night car wash in the airport service area
vaughan rises and holds the door open for james who sits behind the wheel expecting vaughan to walk around the car and sit beside him
instead vaughan pulls open the rear door and climbs in beside catherine
as they set off vaughans camera lands on the front seat
as they drive james watches catherine in the rear view mirror
she sits in the center of the back seat elbows forward on her knees looking over his shoulder at the speeding lights of the expressway
at the first traffic light she smiles at james reassuringly
vaughan sits like a bored gangster beside her his left knee leaning against her thigh
one hand rubs his groin absent mindedly
he stares at the nape of her neck running his eyes along the profiles of her cheek and shoulder
near the airport the lincoln joins a line of cars waiting their turn to pass through the automatic car wash
in the darkness the three nylon rollers drum against the sides and roof of a taxi parked in the washing station water and soap solution jetting from the metal gantries
fifty yards away the two night attendants sit in their glass cubicle beside the deserted fuel pumps reading their comic books and playing a radio
the car ahead advances a few yards its brake lights illuminating the interior of the lincoln covering the trio with a pink sheen
through the rear view mirror james sees that catherine is leaning against the back seat her shoulder pressed tightly into vaughans
her eyes are fixed on vaughans chest on the scars around his injured nipples shining like points of light
james edges the lincoln forward a few feet
when he turns around he sees that vaughan is holding in his cupped right hand his wifes bare breast
james fumbles for change as vaughan caresses catherines nipple in the back seat
catherine looks down at this breast with rapt eyes as if seeing it for the first time fascinated by its unique geometry
their car is alone in the washing bay
a voice rings out
cigarette in hand one of the attendants stands in the wet darkness beckoning to james who inserts his coins in the pay slot and closes the window
water jets on to the car clouding the windows and shutting the trio into the interior
within their blue grotto vaughan lies diagonally across the back seat
catherine kneels across him skirt rolled around her waist
the light refracted through the soap solution jetting across the windows covers their bodies with a luminescent glow like two semi metallic human beings of the future making love in
a chromium bower
the gantry engine begins to drum
the rollers pound across the hood of the lincoln and roar forward to the windshield driving the soap solution into a whirlwind of froth
catherine settles over vaughan and as the rollers drum against the roof and doors vaughan drives his pelvis upwards almost lifting his buttocks off the seat
in the mounting roar of the rollers she and vaughan rock together vaughan holding her breasts together with his palms as if trying to force them into a single globe
when his hands move away to her buttocks james can see that her breasts have been bruised by vaughans fingers the marks forming a pattern like crash injuries
at just this moment catherine looks into jamess eyes in an instant of complete lucidity
her expression shows both irony and affection an acceptance of a sexual logic they both recognize and have prepared themselves for
james sits quietly in the front seat as the white soap sluices across the roof and doors like liquid lace
catherine cries out a gasp of pain cut off by vaughans strong hand across her mouth
he sits back with her legs across his hips slapping her with his free hand
his sweaty face is clamped in an expression of anger and distress
the blows raise blunted weals on catherines arm and hips
james drives the lincoln home along a deserted motorway
the street lamps illuminate vaughans sleeping face in the rear of the car scarred mouth lying open like a childs against the sweat soaked seat
catherine sits forward freeing herself from vaughan
she touches jamess shoulder in a gesture of domestic affection
in the mirror james can see the weals on her cheek and neck the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile
the lincoln pulls up at the ballards apartment building
james and catherine get out and stand in the darkness beside the now immaculate black car
vaughan is still asleep in the back
james takes catherines arm to steady her holding her bag in his hand
as they walk toward the entrance vaughan gets up and climbs unsteadily behind the steering wheel
without looking back at james and catherine he starts the engine and quietly drives off
in the elevator james holds catherine closely lovingly
that night james kneels over catherine as she lies diagonally across the bed her small feet resting on his pillow one hand over her right breast
she watches him with a calm and affectionate gaze as he explores her body and bruises feeling them gently with his fingers lips and cheeks tracing and interpreting the raw
symbols that vaughans hands and mouth have left across her skin
james and the crippled gabrielle visit the annual auto show which occupies the immense halls of the airport convention center
he watches appreciatively as she swings herself on her shackled legs among the hundreds of cars displayed on their stands
gabrielle approaches the imposing mercedes stand and pivoting about on her heels seems to take immense pleasure from these immaculate vehicles placing her scarred hands on their paintwork rolling her
injured hips against them like an unpleasant cat
she soon draws the attention of a young salesman who tries hard not to notice her scars and braces
is there something here that interests you
the white sports model
could you help me into it please
id like to see if i can fit into a car designed for a normal body
both james and gabrielle enjoy the salesmans discomfort as he helps her into the mercedes sports car
she does her best to make it difficult deliberately snagging her leg brace clips on the soft leather of the drivers side armrest forcing him to unhook her and to
touch her deformed thighs and knees while manipulating her legs into the footwell
james makes love to gabrielle in the front seat of her small invalid car deliberately involving the complex hand controls in the mechanics of their sex
as he slips his hand around her right breast he collides with the strange geometry of the cars interior
unexpected controls jut from beneath the steering wheel
a cluster of chromium treadles is fastened to a steel pivot clamped to the steering column
an extension on the floor mounted gear lever rises laterally giving way to a vertical wing of chromium metal moulded into the reverse of a drivers palm
amid this small forest of machinery james explores gabrielles new and strange body feeling his way among the braces and straps of her underwear the unfamiliar planes of her hips
and legs the unique culs de sac odd declensions of skin and musculature
gabrielle lies back
she lifts her left foot so that the leg brace rests against his knee
in the inner surface of her thigh the straps form marked depressions troughs of reddened skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps
james unshackles the left leg brace and runs his fingers along the hot corrugated skin of the deep buckle groove
the exposed portions of her body are joined together by the loosened braces and straps
through the fading afternoon light the airplanes move across their heads along the east west runways of the airport
gabrielles hand moves across his chest opening his shirt her fingers finding the small scars below his collarbone the imprint of the instrument binnacle of his own crashed car
she runs the tip of her tongue into each of the wound scars on his chest and abdomen
james exposes her breasts feeling for the wound areas which surround them
as he tries to enter her she puts her hand over his mouth
she spreads her left leg and exposes a deep trench like wound scar in her inner thigh
she directs his hand to this neo sex organ
do it there
and then after that do it here
gabrielle rotates over him so that he can see the wounds of her right hip
james turns her back pulls her thigh in between his own thighs and enters her scar
with his mouth fastened on the scar beneath her left breast his tongue exploring its sickle shaped trough he comes almost immediately
we float through the studio past a one story high automobile battery
its six cells are transparent and each one contains something submerged in the bubbly water that represents battery acid a two man submarine a scuba diver a small shark
james stands pacing as the dolly shot is reset lighting is adjusted
an ad brings him a cellular phone
somebody named vaughan
do you want it
the ad presses the talk button and hands the phone to james
we are close on vaughans scarred mouth
i need to see you ballard
i need to talk to you about the project
phone where are you
james drives up to the tattoo parlor which is located in a small mall
it is next to a small private medical clinic and has the same antiseptic untextured look of the ear nose and throat suite next door
james enters to discover vaughan getting a wound tattoo on his abdomen one that looks as though it could have been made by the fluted lower edge of a plastic
the woman giving vaughan the tattoo is sexless and professional
she could be a nurse or a hospital dietician
james sits next to them barely acknowledged by the woman
vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds photos of andy warhols scars automotive styling detail drawings from a s
detroit design studio
to tattooist youre making it too clean
medical tattoos are supposed to be clean
this isnt a medical tattoo
this is a prophetic tattoo
prophesy is dirty and ragged
make it dirty and ragged
a hint of sarcasm prophetic
is this personal prophesy or global prophesy
theres no difference
james i want you to let her give you this one
vaughan spreads out a stained scrap of paper as though it were a sacred piece of parchment
on it is a fiercely sketched wound that looks as though it were made by the lincolns hood ornament
where do you think that one should go
vaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical unsexual way and grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans
it should go here
we are close on the fresh tattoo on jamess inner thigh
it looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real wound
we can see it because jamess trousers are down around his knees
vaughans face comes into frame
he gently kisses the tattoo
james lifts vaughans face to his own and kisses his mouth touches his tongue to each of the scars around vaughans mouth
we see that the lincoln sits in the shadow of an underpass at the edge of an abandoned auto wreckers yard looking quite comfortable next to the stacks of crushed
auto hulks and piles of wheels and bumpers visible through the chain link fence
james and vaughan show their wounds to each other exposing the scars on their chests and hands to the beckoning injury sites on the interior of the car to the
pointed sills of the chromium ashtrays to the curtain of wheel covers hanging on a web of twisted wire just outside the car window
they touch embrace kiss
james steps unsteadily from the lincoln into the roadway followed for an instant by vaughans uncertain arm reaching for him
he moves away from the car along the palisade to the overgrown entrance of the wreckers yard
above him the cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks
just outside the fence of the auto wreckers yard a wreck its engine and wheels removed sits on its axles
james opens the door on its rusting hinges
a confetti of fragmented glass covers the front passenger seat
james gets in and sits there for a moment crouched over the mudstreaked instrument panel his knees tightened against his chest wall
a moment or two of this strangely comforting foetal security and then james unfolds and begins to get back out of the car
an engine starts with a roar
as james steps back into the roadway he is briefly aware of a heavy black vehicle accelerating toward him from the shadow of the overpass where he and vaughan embraced
its white walled tires tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in the gutter mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him
knowing that vaughan will not stop will kill him james presses himself against the concrete wall
the lincoln swerves after him its right hand fender striking the rear wheel housing of the car james has just left
it swings away ripping the open passenger door from its hinges
a column of exploding dust and torn newspaper rises into the air as it slides sideways across the access road
the lincoln remounts the curb on the far side of the road crushing a ten yard section of the wooden palisade
james can see vaughan flicking a look back his hard eyes calculating whether or not he can make a second pass at him
the rear wheels regain their traction on the road surface and the car swings away on to the motorway above
james leans against the roof of the abandoned car
the passenger door has been crushed into the front fender the deformed metal welded together by the impact
james retches suddenly and emptily
shreds of torn paper eddy through the air around him pasting themselves at various points against the crushed door panel and radiator hood
james sits on the balcony of his apartment watching the sky
a single engined airplane floats above the motorway a glass dragonfly carried by the sun
it seems to hang motionless the propeller rotating slowly like a toy aircrafts
the light pours from its wings in a ceaseless fountain
below it the traffic moves sluggishly along the crowded concrete lanes the roofs of the vehicles forming a continuous carapace of polished cellulose
suddenly catherine is behind him
she puts her hands on his shoulders and he turns to her as though in a dream gestures toward the airplane
i thought that was you up there
my last lessons next week
james can see now that catherine is frightened
he takes her hand
catherines car sits in the driveway
the paintwork along the left hand side has been marked in some minor collision
catherine and james stand examining the mark soberly archeologists faced with a problematic hieroglyph
i wasnt driving
id left the car in the parking lot at the airport
could it have been deliberate
one of your suitors
one of my suitors
he kneels down to examine the assault on her car
he feels the abrasions on the left hand door and body panels explores with his hand the deep trench that runs the full length of the car from the crushed
tail light to the front headlamp
the imprint of the other cars heavy front bumper is clearly marked on the rear wheel guard
james rises and takes catherines arm
he opens the passenger door for her
hes courting you
lets go find him
catherines car hurtles along a deserted six lane highway
james is driving
he looks across at catherine
she sits very still pale one hand on the window sill
where is everyone
theyve all gone away
id like to go back
its only beginning
they drive past stretches of road we have seen before the underpass near the wreckers yard several accident sites and filling stations etc
one of the filling stations is near the airport
as they cruise by it they spot vera seagrave talking to a girl attendant at the pumps
james turns into the forecourt
vera is dressed in a heavily insulated leather jacket as though she were about to leave on an antarctic expedition
james calls to her from the car
at first she fails to recognize him
her firm eyes cut across him to catherines elegant figure as if suspicious of her cross legged posture
james gets out of the car and approaches vera
he points to the suitcases in the rear seat of veras car
are you leaving vera
listen im trying to find vaughan
vera finishes with the girl and still staring at catherine steps into her car
the police are after him
an american serviceman was killed on the northolt overpass
james puts his hand on the windshield but she switches on the windshield wipers almost cutting the knuckle of his wrist
i was with him in the car at the time
before james can stop her she accelerates toward the exit and turns into the fast evening traffic
james gets back into catherines car
i think hell be waiting for us at the airport
james turns the car into the traffic
vaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover
he makes no attempt to hide himself pushing his heavy car into the passing traffic stream
apparently uninterested in them vaughan lies against his door sill almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change
his left hand drums across the rim of the steering wheel as he swerves the lincoln to and fro across the road surface
his face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of the traffic lanes surging ahead in the fast lane until he is abreast of them
and then sliding back behind them allowing other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful position in the slow lane
james can see that vaughans car has become even more battered than it was before scarred with many impact points a rear window broken cracked headlamps a body panel detached
from the off side rear wheel housing the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as vaughan corners
when they slow down for a line of tankers vaughan makes his move
he pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside
the nose of the lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car which spins down the road
the lincoln keeps on going its vast momentum taking it into the guard rails of the exit ramp and then over them
catherine and james slam spinning into the tail of a tanker which has all but stopped
the traffic behind them has already been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports car when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes
catherine lies back sprawled in her seat eyes wide and staring with fright body rigid bleeding from a small cut on her cheekbone
james jumps out of the car then immediately slows with a limp
he continues working his way doggedly through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp
when he looks over the edge james sees that vaughans lincoln has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was running on the roadway below
with the lincoln now inside it the coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other vehicles
wreckage flames and blood are everywhere
jamess eyes are wide not with horror but with excitement
catherine and james stand at the gatehouse of the police pound collecting the gate key from the mustachioed sharp eyed young officer there
they then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned vehicles
the pound is in darkness lit only by the street lights reflected in the dented chromium
they soon find vaughans crashed lincoln massive and charismatic even here even in death
james manages to wrench open the passenger side rear door enough to allow them both to get inside
sitting in the rear seat of the lincoln catherine and james make brief ritual love her buttocks held tightly in his hands as she sits across his waist
afterwards they walk among the cars
the beams of small headlamps cut across their knees
an open car has stopped beside the gatehouse
two women sit behind the windshield peering into the darkness
a pause and then the car moves forward its driver turning the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of the dismembered vehicle in which vaughan died
the woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses briefly by the gates
it is helen remington
when she helps the driver out of the car james and catherine see that it is the crippled gabrielle her leg shackles clacking as she and helen begin to walk
toward vaughans car
they stroll haltingly arms around each other like strange lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum
at one point helen kisses gabrielles hand and it is obvious that they have become lovers
james and catherine circle away from the couple and make their way back to the gatehouse
in the depths of the pound helen helps gabrielle into the lincoln
in the darkness of the back seat they embrace
james stands talking to the officer at the gatehouse window holding catherines arm around his waist pressing her fingers against the muscles of his stomach
id like to register a claim for the black lincoln the one that came in a couple of days ago
is there a form i can fill out
there certainly is but youll have to come back between and to get one
whats your attachment to that thing
a close friend owned it
well its got to be a total write off
i dont see what you could possibly do with it
we are close on the huge battle scarred grill of vaughans lincoln now brought back to swaying bellowing life
the restoration of the lincoln is as vaughan would have wanted it just enough to get it running and nothing more with ugly brown primer slapped on to the replaced
panels and whatever was cracked scraped and crumpled still cracked scraped and crumpled a mobile accident rolling on badly misaligned wheels
we pull back to see james alone in the car
the road is crowded and manic james is intense hard exhilarated alert a hunter
the car is full of junk pop cans styrofoam containers all suggesting that he has basically been living in the car for some time
james is searching for something among the lanes of traffic threading the immense car in and out of the shifting holes that appear and disappear driving with a fluid recklessness
that is recognizably vaughans style
suddenly james becomes tense focused he has spotted what he has been looking for
through the lincolns insect and oil smeared windshield we can see the unmistakable shape of catherines white sports car itself winding its way aggressively through the braids of vehicles
the lincoln lurches out on to the narrow emergency lane and takes off after catherines car scraping the low concrete wall as it wallows from side to side clipping the
corner of a truck that has made the lane too narrow
in her mirrors catherine spots the lincoln charging toward her along the emergency lane
her demeanor is just as predatory as jamess and she does not hesitate to react
catherine cranks the steering wheel to the right and dives across two lanes of startled vehicles to fishtail down a little used utility access road
behind her and closing rapidly the lumbering lincoln follows suit
around the decreasing radius curve of the utility road the more nimble sports car stretches out the distance between it and the lincoln but once the road uncurls the booming
v allows the american car to gobble up the ground until it is nose to tail with catherines car
james begins to bump the tail of the sports car breaking off the accelerator for a beat to let the white car which looks especially fragile and delicate by comparison
get away a bit then charging back until it makes contact
now the road ahead curves again and just as catherine enters the curve james gives her a seriously violent jolt
the rear of her car slews off on to the grass verge almost comes back then loses traction completely
catherines car spins backwards off the road then rolls unceremoniously almost gently down a small grade shedding bits and pieces until it finally flops to a halt on its side
in front of a cement culvert
momentum has carried james past the point where catherine has left the road
james stands on the brakes until the lincoln shudders to a halt
he jams the shift lever into reverse and backs up tires squealing and smoking in protest to where he saw her go over the edge
james jumps out of the car and stands for a beat at the edge of the road on the wet grass savoring the tableau below him
catherine lies sprawled half out of the car her tight black dress hiked up over her hips one arm across her face as though shielding her eyes from the sight
of her ruined lightly smoking sports car
james eagerly makes his way down the wet grass of the hill toward catherine
as he approaches her she begins to move stretching her arms behind her head as though awakening from a deep sleep
he can now see that her dress is wet soaked by the dirty water trickling out of the culvert and now dammed up by her torso
james kneels close to catherine
are you all right
are you hurt
catherines eyes flutter open
her mascara is smeared as though she has been crying and there is wetness at the corners of her eyes
her upper lip is bruised and beginning to purple and there is blood on her forehead and at the corner of her mouth
i dont know
i think im all right
james slips her panties down her legs leaving them around her left ankle when they snag on the one high heeled shoe she still has on
he gently rotates her on to her right hip undoes his fly then lies down on the concrete with her ignoring the light muddy stream which now begins to soak
the thigh of his trousers
kissing the back of her neck he enters her from behind
maybe the next one darling
maybe the next one
we pull up and away from the couple on the ground until we lose them behind the overturned sports car then rise and pivot until we are once again watching
the frantic lanes of traffic hurtling by obliviously only a few meters away
