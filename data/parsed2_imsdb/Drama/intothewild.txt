written by sean penn based on the book by jon krakauer tuesday april th wide shot a vast snow blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest
mountain range in north america
this is big alaska
a beat up x pick up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept snow packed road and comes to a stop
a figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck
we can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack
we hear a very distant thank you as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck seemingly into nowhere
the figure with backpack and rifle henceforth backpack stopping in his tracks turns around in the direction of the truck
backpack walks back to the truck
as he approaches the drivers door we cut in to tight shot over the back packed shoulder onto the driver
referring to items we see sitting on dashboard you left your watch your comb your change
we stay on the driver as backpack speaks keep it
i dont want your money
and i already have a watch
if you dont take it im gonna throw it away
i dont want to know what time it is what day it is or where i am
i dont want to see anybody
none of that matters
the driver reaches behind the seat of the truck pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots
handing him the boots take em
there is a pause as backpack considers accepting the boots
if you make it out alive give me a call and ill tell you how to get the boots back to me
we can feel over backpacks shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we stay on the driver
hey do me a favor will ya
take a picture of me
backpack hands him an instamatic camera and starts walking backwards
we pull back with him
and he maintains his back to us
when he stops we continue until he is full frame head to toe from behind posing
cu driver click
he snaps the shot
backpack re enters frame in an over shoulder
driver hands him the camera
you gonna be alright
ill be better than that
ill be who i am
as backpack exits the frame we slowly zoom past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change the comb and the watch on the dash
throughout the zoom the sound of footsteps crunching the snow fade into the distance
we see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the backpacker walking away from the truck until the backpacker has exited the frame
the truck takes a beat turns around in the snow and accelerates back into the direction from which it came
as the truck exits frame we may the crowd of family and friends and of course students
assembled on fold out chairs
the broad lawn
intercut chris mccandless
we dont see his face just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace
one by one the names of graduates announced
their bright young faces capped heads and gowns glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas
intercut chris on his run sweatshirt hood over head
amongst assembled crowd and family we find the mccandless billie mid to late forties with dark striking eyes walt a taciturn man early fifties and carine eighteen pretty with her
mothers eyes and waist length brown hair a gold crucifix dangles from her neck
they look around looking for chris hes nowhere in sight
intercut chris in a shower photo sonics he turns into camera the water streaming down his face
from the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother christopher johnson mccandless
the mccandless family increasingly panicked over chris absence when almost magically he appears in full cap and gown
disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform the small framed but athletic chris mccandless leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound frightening billie a little
wince from walt and carine thats our chris
and just as quickly as chris has been handed his diploma he civilly descends the platform steps
slo mo a ballet of graduation caps float upward into a frame of blue sky
we hear chris voice over this image as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his parents
high angle floating caps in foreground walt and billie delight upon the caps
an outer glee in sharp contrast to voice over i see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges i see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone
arch the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head i see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the wrought iron gate still open behind her its sword tips black in the may air they are about to graduate they are about to get married they are kids they are dumb all they know is they are innocent they would never hurt anybody
i want to go up to them and say stop dont do it shes the wrong woman hes the wrong man you are going to do things you cannot imagine
you would ever do you are going to do bad things to children you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of you are going to want to die
i want to go up to them there in the late may sunlight and say it her hungry pretty blank face turning to me
her pitiful beautiful untouched body his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me his pitiful beautiful untouched body but i dont do it
i want to live
i take them up like the male and female paper dolls and bang them together at the hips like chips of flint as if to strike sparks from them i
the last graduation cap falls out of the blue sky frame and into
graduation ceremony wardrobe walt and billie sit at a table
a cadillac can be seen through the window atlanta landmark parked beside the restaurant
here they are
walt looks out the window and sees chris drive up in his old yellow datsun with carine in the passenger seat beside him and pulls up to the space beside
chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the i say
do what you are going to do and i will tell about it
who wrote that
well it couldve been either one of us couldnt it
he hands a book of sharon olds poetry to her
theres a lot of great poems in there
thanks big brother
they exit the car and frame
chris and carine join walt and billie at the table
billie gets up and gives chris a big hug
you scared the daylights out of me jumping on to that stage oh my god
chris gives carine a look
walt extends his hand to chris
they all sit and pick up menus
the foods on the table
chris is devouring a steak
my grades are gonna be good enough i think to get into harvard law
thats a big deal
what do you have left in your college fund
its an inheritance dad
ive only been spending it as a college fund
exactly twenty four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty eight cents
thats very specific
i had to go to the bank this morning
well well certainly contribute the balance for harvard
ive got to figure out what im going to do
i got a lot of things to pack and organize here first
im so glad youre getting out of that place youre living
it was so much nicer when you lived on campus
youll come to annandale before you disappear on us wont you
reluctantly sure i will
carines not so sure
well your father and i want to make a present to you
we want to get you out of that junker
whats a junker
walt points outside to the datsun
we want to get you a new car
appalled a new car
why the hell would i want a new car
the datsun runs great
mocking the cadillac do you think i want some fancy boat
or are you worried about what the neighbors might think
we werent going to get you a cadillac chris
just a nice new car thats safe to drive
you dont know when that things just going to suddenly blow up
are you guys crazy
its a great car
i dont need a new car
i dont want a new car
i dont want anything
thing thing thing
under the table carine jabs chris leg
chris returning to polite but thanks anyway
everythings gotta be difficult
i said thank you
i just dont want anything
the group returns to some superficial calm
i wouldnt say no to a new car
mumbling a rib ivana trump mccandless
laughing it off shut up chris
to her parents seriously seriously ill pay you back
over chris shoulder he frisbees his graduation cap from the upstairs window to his parents parting cadillac on the street
as they wave goodbye carine catches the cap from the backseat window
and with a parting smile to her brother she poses with it on her own head
chris smiles and waves goodbye
as the cadillac drifts away his smile disappears into something other than sadness
in a warm ambient light we see a black and white poster on a barren wall poncho clad clint eastwood from the good the bad and the ugly
we tilt down a stack of books sitting on the floor tolstoy stegner thoreau jack london and pasternak
beside them a campers backpack
chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight
the room is spare supporting his monkish lifestyle
but on the desk before him he counts out
from a bank envelope
he pockets those bills and change then removes a check for made out to oxfam america from the same bank envelope
he scribbles a note these are all my savings
feed someone with it
signed chris mccandless
he then slides the note and the check into a pre addressed oxford famine relief fund in boston envelope
he pulls his wallet from his back pocket
pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves
considering each he flicks them into a trash bin one by one
finally coming to his social security card he holds it to the candles flame
as the flame burns bright we music gordon petersons big hard sun or as radio source tom pettys free falling rises and presentation titles a datsun b emerges from the
rising sun as the car heads west out of atlanta
highway to to presentation titles and music carry over montage we travel with chris and his datsun through the towns and open highways landscapes and landmarks days and nights that
lead to the mojave desert in the west
in contrast to his introspection of the previous night chris is buoyant throughout this sequence
crane shot we see chris stop the datsun in the middle of the desert road
down to a close up through the windshield
chris looks left
into the rearview mirror and suddenly turns the wheel veering the datsun off the paved highway into the vast desert
as we crane back up the datsun moves into the horizon
the datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just before darkness slides over the desert
it is positioned at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl
the datsun a yellow speck in the frame
coyotes yap at the moon
other than that no sound on the desert floor
in the distance voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west setting sun over the rim of the upper detrital watershed
we see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within
short series of angles as we move in on the distant gullies and ravines starting to run with copious amounts of water
chris mccandless in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house sleeps in the back seat of the datsun
his head supported by his backpack
we begin to hear a rumble
but this rumble is not thunder
it rapidly builds into an alarming roar
the roar grows to a deafening level
as he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood
a four foot high wall of water mud and debris makes impact with the datsun momentarily enveloping it in water
suddenly the car is slammed against the cliff
chris sits upright disoriented
pov as far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight water has taken over the desert with a flash flood
however theres no panic in chris face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield
the water while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels
chris gets a slight smile on his face as the car settles into its new position below the cliff
he returns to sleep
what remains of chris travelling money burns in a pile beside the datsun on the sun lit but muddy desert floor
we follow a very long set of footprints camera tracking true vertical away from the burning cash through the mud finally tilting up to the footprint maker chris
slogging toward high ground
wide shot we see the abandoned datsun nearly a mile behind chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack
he comes very close to camera only a day or twos stubble on his face and as we pan him we see as much wilderness before us as we did
chris walks into the distance
chris mccandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in a shadowy room doing his geraldo rivera
its tongue in cheek at best
this is emory university freshman chris mccandless reporting from the vault at thompson hall
he indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a brightly lit corridor below
we have just dynamited the hatchway and are the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred years
somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all
a beast built on lies corruption and greed
we hear a growling sound from behind chris
and there it is
the legendary beast mocra
camera quickly pans to a blanket wrapped crawling fellow student in a grotesque halloween mask
we move into cu on the monster growling
quick pan back to chris
in mock fright weve got to get out of here quick and re secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast
camera shakes all over like a bad horror film trying to stay with chris as he makes a quick escape down the hatchway into the university dorm corridor
clumsy video time cut chris nailing the last nail in the hatchway from below
he climbs down the steps where he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off camera source
well it looks like weve succeeded we hear the monsters growl from above
at least for the moment in sealing the beast back into the vault
your humble reporter chris mccandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics will he retain his reporters objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this
he gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement what will he do
we pick up with chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper and tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of ted turner
once again your humble reporter chris mccandless
we hear os students commenting on chris and his video crew what is this
point the camera at me
im a star
chris speaking straight to camera still tongue in cheek with a wizard of oz tone pay no attention to the voices behind the curtain
a fellow student playing ted turner with obvious fake mustache is locked into an episode of matlock on his television set as our bold reporter chris barges in
weve got a monster in the vault
it represents all the corruption the deceit and greed within us all
i must slay it
worst acting weve ever seen mccandless how many times have i had to tell you
ive had to tell you that you are a journalist and you cant get personally involved in your cases
or your stories
i know how to kill it
and im the only one who knows
you cant keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing
i look like some kind of an idiot
do you know who youre talking to
im ted turner
behind chris in the corridor outside teds office a panicked student arrives at the door
youve got to hurry
the monster is scratching at the hatchway
hell be out in no time
threatening itll mean your job chris mccandless
to ted thats it ted
fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed
microphone in hand chris makes haste
the camera runs with him out the door through the corridor up a set of steps to the hatchway
as he arrives the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board chris had nailed
into camera this is the only thing that can kill the monster
its gonna be risky but without great risk there is no freedom
so we will now hear from the famous singer chris mccandless
a piano is pushed into frame beside chris
a young black student pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play
chris begins to serenade the monster intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well
he bursts into an uninhibited solo of tender is the night
camera tilts up to the monster looking out the hatchway slowly dying from the song being sung
as the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die the audio recedes and video images go when we were little chris was very to himself
he wasnt anti social he always had friends and everybody liked him but he could go off and entertain himself for hours he didnt seem to need toys or friends
he could be alone without being lonely
the secrets our parents kept though unknown to chris and i led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we
were very young
it seemed like they never fought without us
i remember the first family meeting to let chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce
they wanted us to choose which of them wed live with
i cried my eyes out
but the divorce never happened though the threats and meetings never stopped
it wasnt long before chris and i shut off we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce
chris and i just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough
dad had been the young genius that nasa enlisted to do crucial designs for the american satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the russian sputnik
and mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get up and go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge
by the time the company actually made its first million the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise shed made us
i think this is when chris began to see careers as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it
in their lives
hed begun planning to slay the beast
to make himself free
the beast dies
we see a pile of berries sitting atop a handkerchief
beside them a survivalists guide to edible growth
the glare of the sun penetrating the canvas
a fly buzzes and lands hanging upside down
the image is blurry
delirious in the heat we widen out to see that hes filthy weeks of growth on his face and naked
he makes his way out of the tent peers at the relentless sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a canteen barely a sip of water left in
he downs it
the following short vignettes are silent and focused exclusively on chris
recreational boaters on lake mead
girls in bikinis
boys on boats eating kentucky fried chicken
at lake side an unusual sight the new chris mccandless a sun and dirt beaten bum with a backpack
a family ski boat has taken chris on
they give him water dropping him at the north end of the lake at temple bar marina
directors note high angle tight sees chris and the glimmering water treadmilling below
chris washes himself in the lake by the marina
chris brushes his teeth
i need a name
he takes a swallow of water
rinses his mouth
spits it out
then checks his bearded face in the mirror
he likes what he sees
as he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and throws it into the bin below the sink he notices a discarded tube of lipstick
he picks it up
its down to its end
yet with what lipstick remains he writes on the mirror chris is behind the cafe beside a pair of dumpsters
he removes the datsuns license plates from his backpack and discards them deeply into the garbage
chris appears from behind the cafe lugging his backpack up the rise from the cafe to the highway and starts thumbing for a ride
various shots to accompany v
toward the end of june chris had mailed our parents his final grade report
walt and billie open the envelope
almost all as
a in apartheid in south african society and history of anthropological thought a in contemporary african politics and the food crisis in africa and on it went
clever boy my brother
we observe carine in a delicate afternoon light
she is sitting up on her bed with an unread book looking out the window toward us
but by the end of july we hadnt heard anything from him and my parents were getting very worried
carines pov walt with his arm around billie in the yard
chris had never had a phone so they decided to drive down to atlanta and surprise him
chris backpack on walking away from camera
we see walt and billies car pass under an atlanta mileage sign
when they arrived at the apartment there was a for rent sign in his window and the manager told my parents that chris had moved out at the end of
we observe walt and billie chatting with chris apartment manager
when they got home i had to hand them all the letters they had sent chris that summer which had been returned in a bundle
the bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen table return to sender stamps visible
chris had instructed the post office to hold them until august st so that mom and dad wouldnt know that anything was up
some part of me understood what he had done
that he had spent the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in graduating from college
we return to the image of carine sitting on her bed as she plops on chris old graduation cap
we slowly zoom in on her throughout the remaining v
and now at last he was unincumbered
emancipated from the stifling world of parents and peers
abstraction security and material excess
those things that cut chris off from the raw truth of his existence
i only hoped he was safe
and i missed him
tracking shot ground level close on chris surrounded by a summit grove embraced in its nature
angle a deer drinking from a creek pops its head up between trees and scrub watching the alien human pass
an eagle soars above perhaps it was this pov represented in our helicopter shot water babbling in a mountain creek
angle chris in his eyes we see the landscape inject itself
sequence chris makes camp beside a stream pulling a sack of rice from his backpack and cooking it
wrapped in his own the good the bad and the ugly poncho chris eats rice while crouched beside a campfire reading from jack londons white fang
chris is on the move north through the gorgeous landscape of the sierras humming as he walks when he comes upon a sign on the trail permit camping in designated
chris bows to the sign as one would to speak to a small child
singing sign sign
everywhere a sign
fuckin up the scenery breakin my mind
dont do that
cant you read the sign
and then very impulsively he karate kicks the sign off its post into a log collapsing into a burning log collapses in chris campfire reduced to glowing embers
chris is awakened by the sound of twigs snapping in a nearby thicket
he quickly grabs a knife from his backpack unzips six inches of the tent door open
we see his eyes peering out
the crackling moves closer
his grip on the knife tightens
suddenly a hot white light hits his face
and a voice comes from behind the light
could you step out of the tent please
now we see the forest ranger appear from the thicket
chris exits the tent catching himself holding the knife
as he drops the knife to the ground sorry
i thought you were a bear
approaching i dont blame you
youre less than a hundred yards from the nearest den
thats why i came over here to talk to you
do you have some identification
my names alex
ive been travelling a lot and i got robbed and my identification was taken
you mind if i take a look in your tent
the forest ranger bends over
pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re addressing chris
youre not the character who knocked down our sign are ya
because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only
well i dont have a permit
no im sure you dont
listen it looks like youve got your food secured pretty good so im not gonna make you move on tonight
but these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes
next time stop at the rangers station and get yourself a permit
i appreciate it
im gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow
they shake hands and the forest ranger disappears into the thicket
chris descends the mountains where they meet the redwoods
every perilous step creates a mini landslide down the hill dirt and gravel
chris stops briefly to observe an over flying commercial airliner
mocking imaginary conversation among passengers is that a man mommy
thats no mere man sweetheart
thats alexander supertramp
king of the wild frontier
chris briefly waves to the airplane above and continues his descent
a car slows to a stop
this is where i turn off
thanks a lot
chris is dropped off
the driver veers off the highway and into the distance
chris is left behind to hitch another ride
camera is across the road from chris as one by one cars pass him by
he turns to move north by foot and we track with him his back to oncoming traffic he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb
something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road
reverse chris moving to the mysterious object
as he lifts it we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat
he dusts it off and snugs it onto his head when a police car comes into frame and stops beside chris
with a quick blast of the siren chris turns to regard the police car
the policeman gets out of the car and moves to chris
howre you doin this evening
reluctantly im alright
whats the matter
you wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car
chris does not oblige
because i asked you to sir
but i havent done anything wrong
these are my personal items
do you know that its unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway
do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop
we got a tree lined highway without a substantial shoulder here
and weve had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers
i mean you stopped your car
youre in the traffic lane
and you can see theres hardly any cars out here
plus its a straight road you can see for a long ways
in disbelief theres really been accidents along here
may i see some identification
now chris is worried
i dont have any
you dont have any identification
chris shakes his head no
pulling out a ticket well im gonna site you for unlawful hitchhiking
you dont have to appear
you can send a check directly to the humboldt county clerks office for restitution
if you dont pay it within days youre subject to fine and warrant
im gonna trust that youre gonna give me accurate information
whats your name
chris cant bring himself to lie
a beat mccandless
christopher johnson mccandless
walt billie and carine sit around the kitchen table in august
a copy of chris ticket has been sent to the annandale address and sits before them
billie and carine sit silently
walts on the phone
if chris were trying to disappear it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence
though my parents had already contacted the annandale police with their initial concerns this ticket arriving from california made them frantic
my father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator someone whod done work with the dia and the cia
using the willow creek ticket as a starting point the investigator began chasing down leads
most of them led far afield to europe and south africa
ultimately turning up nothing
what my dad couldnt believe was that hed given up his car
he seemed to love that datsun so much
it sounded just like chris to me though
he was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run
with his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his goofy new hat onto his head we find chris at a dead run to catch a ride that had overshot
directors note dont leave this image too soon
an old van idles waiting for him
as he gets to the passenger side the woman passenger gets out
this is jan burres early s looks to be still on the long road home from woodstock
a little heavyset dark wavy hair with a lot of premature grey in it
jan moving to the side door
we just barely saw you there under that crazy hat of yours
we couldnt back up the vans reverse is broken
as jan fiddles with side door handle oh
thanks for stopping
this doors a little tricky ill get it
and with a little pulling it opens
indicating the pony tailed and bearded driver rainey early s definitely woodstock
hop in thats rainey
hey im rainey
and im jan
alex of the hat
closing the side door yeah
jan jumps back in passenger seat and the van rolls on
were you out there a long time hitching
couple of days
but sometimes i forget to put my thumb out
probably the rest of the time that hat scares em away
chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a kick out of what he sees that hats staying on
jan is looking at the rearview mirror too observing chris with mild concern
whens the last time you ate something
chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants hes collected
excited see that
ive got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible
you can find things wherever you go
jan steals a glance to rainey
we were just in town getting some beads and stuff
jan does handicrafts so were usually going from one swap meet to another
shes so good at what she does we sold everything
so we set up camp at orick beach
youre welcome to camp there with us
and eat there with us
chris is beaming at the thought of real food
chris jan and rainey are beside a campfire sitting on blankets
their tents loom behind them
jan is weaving some sort of craft art
chris is chomping on chicken and beans like theyre going out of style
between large swallows so i just left the car
it was a great car too
id driven it cross country the first time when i got out of high school
i had some really great adventures with it
that thing would just go and go
i mean it was an but if id kept it it wouldve lasted me forever
so youre a leather now
im a leather
rainey nods smiling
looking to jan whats a leather
youre a leather tramp
thats what they call the ones that hoof it on foot
so were technically rubber tramps
interjecting as we have a vee hi cle
rainey makes a move to put his arm around jan
she goes a little stiff and fends it off
alex could have a vehicle
if he didnt burn his money
why would you want to do that
i dont need money
it makes people cautious
a little irritated well you have to be a little cautious alex
that book of yours is all well and fine but you cant depend entirely on leaves and berries
i dont know if youd want to depend on much more than that
wheres your mom and dad
makin their money somewhere
come on chris
you look like a loved kid
you know what i mean
ill paraphrase thoreau rather than love than money than fairness give me truth
you look like shit
theres the truth
they all laugh
chris sits up reading his tent entry flap ajar to let the small candle lantern ventilate
os we hear a zipping sound
we see him from chris pov coming out of his tent deep in thought
as he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire raineys face goes out of frame and all chris can see are his booted feet tapping bits
of glowing wood into the center of the fire
the tapping is slow and thoughtful
micro embers float upward into the night
chris tent flap closes by his own hand
angle chris dog ears his book and puts out the lantern
we see chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above the beach
hes got it tied to his back and his front
if we didnt know better wed think he was camouflaging himself
chris pov the rocks beside the waters edge
we see rainey sitting beside the water staring out to sea
we follow chris gaze to jan some fifty yards down the beach walking melancholically in the opposite direction of rainey
angle rainey at the waters edge
chris appears beside him
regarding chris wrapped up in wood geez
if i struck a match to you id have warmth and dinner at the same time
but raineys humor does not hide an inner turmoil
wheres jan going
well my friend all is not well on the hippie front
chris pulls out his pocketknife cuts the twine that binds the firewood to his body and takes a seat beside rainey
youre an industrious little fucker arent ya
yeah its funny how things happen at particular times
ive loved that woman for a lot of years
but you know shes got a
weve been going through this thing real quietly cause well
so after running into you last night this thing we were going through quietly she started talking about
you know what i mean
i think so
you think what
chris is looking off at jan walking in the distance
i think shes probably quietly disconnecting
it doesnt feel right to her to be close to you if theres a hole of some kind somewhere else
thats a helluva insight
youre not jesus are you
you gonna walk on that water and get her back for me
actually im a little afraid of water
rainey gives him a sideways glance
but its something ive got to get over sometime
so ill swim in it if youll carry the firewood back to the campsite
shit yes ill carry
and with that chris runs down the beach toward jan
rainey watches chris and jan chat briefly
then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean splashing and laughing
a warmth comes over him watching his old lady having some fun
he grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the campsite
angle chris and jan swimming in the chilly water having a ball
jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with chris
and chris allows it
she pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface
one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish chris
as he re surfaces she gives him a splash right in the face
through a burning campfire in the late afternoon we see the chilly bodies of chris and jan carrying their clothes run shivering toward us
rainey sits beside the campfire
i thought you guys might need a little heat
jan smiles appreciatively
moving to rainey thats not hot enough
put your arms around me
as they embrace chris throws a coat on from his tent puts on his funny straw hat and grabs a book
rainey has wrapped a blanket around jan and they sit beside the fire
im going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit
ill bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall
we might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight
he heads off down the beach
the ocean moving toward sunset
seagulls gliding inches over the water
the breeze on the sea grass
chris in his big hat reading at waters edge
jan and rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside the fire
chris closing his book remaining meditative at waters edge
jan and rainey in town buying groceries and being playful with each other
over chris shoulder the sun sets and day becomes night
jan and rainey on a blanket sharing a joint
chris lying beside the campfire in his sleeping bag
jan takes a toke passes the joint to rainey
you know what alex ought to do rainey
he ought to come out to the slabs this winter
rainey takes a toke on the joint
youd like that if youre still on the road
lot of fellow travelers
rainey offers the joint to chris
chris passes it up with a hand gesture
what is that
its down in niland california
you know where the salton sea is
near san diego yeah
well about miles northeast of there but yeah
nilands off the east shore of salton
the navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there
all thats left is a grid of concrete foundations
theyre scattered over about a square mile or so
when the weather turns cold across the rest of the country people show up there by the thousands snow birds
livin on the cheap under the sun
you sell your handcrafts there
and a lot of second hand goods
theres a swap meet
the people are cool
theres even some kids running around sometimes
most everyone there if theyre not avoiding the cold are at least dodging the irs
or the fbi
the three of them laugh
you should check it out
if you come ill make a proper hat for you
standing shaking out her blanket well alex
im gonna clean up and the old man and i are gonna get some rest
indicating the sleeping bag looks like you got yourself a good bag there
my mother made it from a kit
jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in chris but he pushes it away quickly
im gonna sleep out here by the fire
i want to read a little bit
jan moves to chris hugs him kisses him on the cheek
dont make me worry about you
the fire is burning low
chris reads from thoreaus walden from the chapter on higher laws as we move slowly in toward him we begin to hear quiet sounds of what may be love making
coming from rainey and jans tent
a gentle smile comes over chris face and in its irony he looks to the page before him
chris sliding fingertip underlines the following passage chastity is the flowering of a man and what are called genius heroism holiness and the like are but various fruits which succeed
gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean snapping from schools of fish
and the subtle crackling of a campfires death
there on the beach jan and raineys van their tent and the fireless coals of last night
but no sign of chris his bag or his tent
jan appears from her tent rubbing her eyes
she wears a sarong which she re secures at the breast then notices that chris has left
but where his tent had been the words are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood
cu jan we see her sadness
rainey appears at her shoulder
he understands what is inside his woman
he reminded me
go to wide shot jan and rainey remaining as they were
foreground seagulls glide through frame
music over joe henrys kings highway
chris hitchhiking through the sage brush uplands
chris squatting over a water bucket shaving
camping in the lava beds of the columbia river basin
walking across the idaho panhandle
cooking the last of his rice on the montana border
hitchhiking in the montana sunset
we see chris hitching down a lonely two lane road surrounded by fields and distant mountains
in early september mom and dad got a call from the annandale police notifying them that chris abandoned car had been identified by the arizona highway patrol after a group
of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert
there were no signs that chris had intended to return to it
but there wasnt any evidence of struggle
the police said they thought chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him
nonetheless the initial comfort that gave mom and dad quickly turned to their realization that chris was actually trying not to be found
we see walt
he walks out the door of his house into the street
he keeps walking
and we go with him in his silent but internal armageddon
we pull him in cu throughout all that follows
refer to scene dad calls it suspended animation
this may affect our visual approach the year chris graduated high school he bought the datsun used
he wanted to drive it cross country and visit our old neighborhood in california
the day before he left was my dads birthday
chris made a speech
chris stands beside the family piano speaking to a party of his parents friends walt and billie among them
beside him a large gift wrapped present
carine sits at the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching her brother with a hint of concern
a little drunk a little emotional dad you and i have had our differences over the years
but on your birthday i want to tell you how grateful i am for all the things youve given me
and that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids
so in return ive been busting my ass a bit
at dominos pizza chris moves to the gift
and ive gotten you this token this damned expensive token as a token of that appreciation
chris holds the large gift toward walt
walt moves through his friends to chris and strips the paper exposing a beautiful questar telescope
patting his son the back would you look at that
walt holds the telescope up for all to see
and the party responds with applause
chris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside carine at the bottom of the steps
jesus you mustve had a lot to drink
too much and not enough
i used to believe all that stuff
that whole story
i thought maybe if i said it again id believe it
but i dont
tears have come to chris eyes
he puts his head in his hands
carine puts an arm around him
present walt expressionless walking into camera
the day after the party chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer
it was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in annandale
he had a scruffy beard his hair was long and tangled and he was rail thin
as soon as i heard he was home i ran into his room to talk to him
in california hed looked up some old family friends who still lived there
hed found out that long after he had been born our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife marcia in secret
brief cutaway to chris hitching on the montana highway
and that one lie had led to another
that two years after chris was born dad had had another son with marcia
worse yet was that it was marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time
and it was chris and i who were the bastard children
dads arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused
and mom in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress became his accomplice
she and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasnt the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real
chris was quiet when he told me this
he said it made his entire childhood seem like a fiction that the truth had been dying everyday
if something bothered chris hed usually keep it to himself
and he made me promise to do the same
he never did tell mom and dad that he knew
but chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code
he loathed what he considered mom and dads hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance
chris submitted to dads authority through college but i knew he raged inwardly the whole time
it was inevitable that chris would rebel
and when he did he did it with characteristic immoderation
walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk
my father is a brilliant man
but he had made some terrible mistakes
and to some extent it seemed chris was making him pay an awful price
the image of walt dissolves into
a pick up truck pulls over for chris
as chris jumps in we see on the passenger side door the name wayne westerberg boldly painted across it
chris hops in beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a black goatee
rolling a cigarette without moving forward with the truck his knees rattling up and down howre you doing
shaking hands hi wayne
seems like every time i come on this road theres somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you
chris nods with a laugh
look i gotta stop in ethridge to drop something off know what i mean
chris is not sure about the drop something off part
how bout you and i grab something to eat down there
oh i wouldnt want to burden you
how long has it been since youve had anything to eat
couple of days
i kinda ran out of money
well theres no choice about it
im gonna get you some dinner
wayne lights his cigarette puts the truck in gear and they head down the road
as the sun dips behind the horizon we tilt up off the departing truck to the sky
ominously mounting clouds stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun waynes truck cuts through a track in a wheat field moving toward a compound of three trailers one
a double wide the other two on wheels smaller
beside them a wyeth esque farmhouse
he eases the engine and comes to a stop in front of the double wide
as he and chris dismount the truck wayne gives him a hushing finger across the lips
they tip toe up to the door where wayne shuffles a bunch of keys
a little thunder kicking in the distant sky
as wayne and chris enter they tip toe over empty booze bottles and passed out work crew waynes harvesting team
they make their way to a small table in the kitchenette
remains of the evenings dinner are on the stove
wayne turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up
so where is it youre headed
i was thinking about doubling back through the canadian side of glacier park
yeah i used to have a girlfriend whod go there camp on the black feet res
she was into all that american indian stuff
i can bring you to the border at sweet grass once youve had some food
well thatd be great
what do you do out here
well i do a lot of things
video game repair
im a licensed pilot own a grain elevator in carthage and another one a few miles out of town
but in the summertime i run a combine crew follow the harvest from texas way the hell north to the canadian border
we just got done cutting barley for coors and anheuser busch
but then i got this little black box deal on the side you know what i mean
you mean those free satellite tv deals
as though he hadnt brought it up you said it not me
chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains
wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food
as chris starts digging in a major gust of wind rocks the trailer
smiling responding to wind chris doesnt respond digs into the food
points to the unconscious tribe splayed out
six germanic looking who are these guys
wayne gets a little giggle
those are my hudderites
agricultures a pretty transient business
these guys come off the hudderite colony looking for work
i always got work for people
then that guy pointing at guy making most of his snore thats kevin
hes with me most of the time
hes not a hudderite
hes from madison
just then the rain kicks in full gear outside pounding the trailer shell
a couple hits of lightning follow
listen you dont want to go out there on the road tonight
why dont you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a hudderite until morning
chris looks about
theres not much room but it beats the pelting outside
chris with a grin on his face lays in his sleeping bag between a hudderite and the sleeping kevin
wayne comes from the back bedroom tip toes through the sleeping bodies to hand chris a pillow
get a good sleep
see you in the morning
chris waves a thanks puts the pillow beneath his head and closes his eyes
we are tight on chris hand atop the shifter of one of waynes lumbering harvesters
now take hold of the joystick get the feel of header idle it down with the toggle switch
as chris makes the attempt we immediately hear the grinding of gears the instrument alarms in chaos
wide shot chris and wayne sit atop a combine
in the background we see waynes trailer and two other combines piloted by waynes crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain
chris tries his hand at the shifter once more
this time the thing starts to move
now take it on out and make yourself some money
wayne jumps off the combine and chris begins to cut his pattern intermittently struggling with the shifter
wayne laughs his ass off
series of shots indicating a series of days passing as chris gets a hang of the machines a little more at a time
six men including wayne and chris two among them hudderites crowd in to the small dinner area of the trailer
talking politics and bullshit and eating a welcome meal
im gonna break out some whiskey
alex you want anything other than that beer
id take a white russian if youve got it
the group of men laugh at the youngsters order of a fancy drink
what are you alex a commie
no i just like white russians
i havent got anything like that here
but i tell ya what
and i know i speak for everybody
you wanna come work with us in carthage well hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a white russian down at the cabaret
dawn tomorrow engines roaring
to the others like a mock blues singer pot o gold
oh that pot o gold
they all join in to the chant song pot o gold
gotta get that pot o gold
raising his beer to carthage
toasting to carthage
the harvesting convoy rolls toward us like a herd of mammoths
a series of silent quaint establishing tableaus
directors note condor above street its a sleepy little town
cluster of clapboard houses tiny yards and weathered brick storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the northern plains
stately rows of cottonwoods shade a grid of streets seldom disturbed by moving vehicles
from under camera the series of tableaus is interrupted as the convoy roars into our frame from beneath camera
in the passenger seat chris is glowing at his new surroundings
wayne picks up the cb radio
okay kevin get all the machines back to the elevator
im gonna show chris to his room
over cb ive got dibs on that shower that showers all me
laughs first come first serve buddy
wayne signs off and veers off the road
a two story victorian in the queen anne style
wayne veers his truck into the front yard parking under the big cottonwood that towers above
chris follows wayne up the narrow stairwell
carrying chris pack for him come on up in here
thisll be your room for as long as you hang about
wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs
wayne plops chris pack beside a single bed in the tiny but comfortable room
chris enters very happy with his new quarters
showers down the hall
if you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it
but you do want to grab a shower cause were all heading over to the cabaret in exactly thirty six minutes
so get your dancing shoes on
theres foo foo in the medicine cabinet
i think its brut
slaps his own face as if hes putting on cologne then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we like to pah tay
wayne gives chris a wink and exits shutting the door behind him
chris takes in his new surroundings
hes on a work crew and he likes it
chris makes the move for the shower but by the time he opens his door to the hall all the other crew members are barreling up the stairs in front
of them clamoring for dibs chris pov i got first
in a kid voice you had first last night
entering the bathroom well if you wanna wash my back cowboy
you go ahead fairy
just dont use all the soap
he gets a kick out of these guys
he closes the door
the jack daniels is flowing
waynes crew drinks smokes and strikes out with every fat woman in the place
gail borah an on again off again girlfriend of waynes tends bar
a petite sad eyed woman slight as a heron delicate features and long blond hair
wayne and chris sit at the end of the bar
alex this is gail
this is the one to go to for that white russian youve been wanting
of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous
shut up wayne
to chris you want a white russian sweetie
shyly yes please maam
yes please maam
wayne slaps chris on the back
aint he great
to chris dont pay any attention to him
with that wayne reaches over the bar grabs gail and gets her in a lip lock to which she ultimately gives in
wayne and chris are both drunk
anything to do with hunting preserving the meat smoking it or whatever you talk to kevin over there
thats your man
he looks every bit the grizzly adams part
whats the interest in all that
im thinking about going to alaska
or city alaska
the city alaska does have markets
with a drunken excited energy no alaska alaska
i want to be all the way out there
on my own
just out there
big mountains rivers sky
just be out there in it
in the wild
in the wild
maybe write a book about my travels
about getting out of this sick society
coughing society right
because you know what i dont understand
i dont understand why why people are so bad to each other so often
it just doesnt make any sense to me
who people we talking about
you know parents and hypocrites
politicians and pricks
chris is clearly troubled by his own words
wayne leans into chris
tapping a long finger against chris forehead this is a mistake
its a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff
alex youre a helluva young guy but i promise you this youre a young guy
blood and fire
youre juggling blood and fire
chimes in who are you to be giving advice to anybody
blood and fire
thats who i am
gimme a kiss
gail pushes him off with mock disgust
mock opening his zipper in a high pitched voice come on give mr
happy a kiss
on the television above the bar appears reverend jesse jackson
we cant hear him but we can see him
chris points at the television and yells out to the entire bar of cowboys and ranch hands now thats who could be president
wayne buries his face in his hands
chris is sacked out from his night of drinking when the door knocks blast into chris head
he awakens to wayne opening his bedroom door
wayne despite his own drinking the night before is wide awake and fresh as a daisy
all the boys are hard at it including chris and wayne
wayne moves to chris side
so what do you think about all this
the working life i like all this
while wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches chris and kevin are deep in a bald
patch in the field
kevin is taking chris through the paces of smoking and curing meat in the wilds
chris listens and takes notes
directors note cast a kevin who knows this shit and shoot it as a dialogue scene as well as a silent tableau
the place is packed and chris is taking over the piano surprising everyone with a tremendous talent
segueing from honky tonk country to ragtime hes become the life of the party
the music continues over all the men of waynes crew who by now weve come to know and chris are working their asses off
post lap music fades out as we
intercut the crew at work with a series of mystery angles tires kicking up dust on dirt roads through town and into the field behind the grain elevator
back to the work back to the tires
back to the work back to these several cars hauling ass through the field
back to wayne up high in the grain elevator to chris as he lowers himself down the man lift i gotta take a piss
chris pov from high in the grain elevator
he watches wayne below as wayne saunters out to the field to take a piss
with his back to us wayne whips it out and starts pissing about yards from the grain elevator
he looks up from his urination the grain elevator behind him
we see a slight mischievous smile come to his face
he puts his hands up into the air when suddenly six unmarked fbi vehicles surround him
directors note triangulate three long lenses on wayne as the mysterious cars enter each frame as they skid to a dusty stop on all sides of him
chris and the men of his crew look on
i warned him about those little black boxes
as wayne is handcuffed and led away he nods up to his boys
to arresting agent you wanna get that zipper for me
and then calling out to his crew sorry boys
gonna have to shut down for a while
you come back and work for me anytime
to chris and the men gails got all your checks guys
i shouldnt be away too long
with that the fbi agents have hustled the good natured wayne into the back of one of the cars
as they take off into the distance we move in on chris bemused
pre lap where are you gonna go
chris sits at the end of the bar with gail borah
ive been thinking a lot about alaska
what kind of nut nut are you
alex its october for christs sake
you go to alaska you go in the spring
this time of year you wanna head south
personally i like las vegas
one armed bandit
thats what i like
yeah maybe i ought to put off going to alaska at least so i can get settled up there in decent weather
you want to go south
you want me to take you out to the highway
putting on his cowboy little lady i walked in i can walk out
he puts a few bills down on the bar saddles up his backpack and gives gail a hug
you take care of yourself now alex
you got a whole family here depending on it
and tell wayne ill drop him a line
he gives her a kiss on the cheek and hes off
empty carthage streets but for christopher johnson mccandless walking off as we crane up
chris has hitched a ride with a long haul trucker
series of angles music over traveling shots
chris disembarks the long haulers truck waves a goodbye and the truck moves on
series of angles chris walking south through the desert following the river bank
he covers twelve miles before he arrives in an arizona town a dusty weigh in station
the town is quiet but along the storefront lane where chris walks he comes upon a sporting goods store
in the window a fiberglass river kayak
chris stares at it
we hear passing cars humming above
chris has set up camp and hes digging in the dirt
he buries many of his belongings
he makes sure hes got his check from working with wayne in his pocket
he packs only the essential items burying all else
he gets into his sleeping bag and goes to sleep
chris backpacks past the mushroom rock forms at the entrance of lees ferry
chris approaches the green suited functionary at the front desk
can i help you
if i wanted to paddle down the river wheres the best place to launch out of
to launch out of
whats your experience level
do you have a permit
a permit for what
you cant paddle down the river without a permit
if you like you can apply for one here get yourself some experience and ill put you on the wait list
to paddle down a river
giggling well how long do you have to wait
ive got an opening may
laughing twelve years
well you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide
they usually have a few last minute cancellations
i think its about two thousand dollars
chris busts a gut
thanks for your help
the green suit eyes chris departure with suspicion
chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids
the whitewater roars
as we slowly zoom into chris face terrified and absorbed by the torrent a bead of sweat drops across his forehead tilts our camera to his trembling hands and legs
when peter gabriels i have the touch begins to play
zoom into chris face
a decision fear becomes determination we smash cut on cue with peter gabriels vocals
slo mo super dramatic chris blasting out of a shoot in the rapids in the kayak we saw the night before
just like peter gabriel sings it he has the touch
this kids never kayaked before certainly never on rapids
but its that immortal stage of life no care no helmet no life jacket pure adrenaline
he can hardly believe hes surviving it as he goes but theres no looking back now
and with every thump of the music we share his rush
his pure unadulterated exhilaration
with the culmination of the music chris has successfully shot the rapid
he paddles through quiet waters
we move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face upstream
there before him the impossible rapid he had just completed
to himself im superman
he feels immortal
he makes his about face and is about to head down stream when he sees at the rivers edge a group of river tourists and their guide lunching beside a
the tourists look like a bunch of bewildered tubby troopers in their misfitted orange life vests and cereal bowl helmets
the river guide yells out at chris as chris moves past camera and away
the guide gets on his satellite phone to alert the rangers
we zoom slowly away from them toward the rapid
phillip glass cloudscape plays over chris paddles on
low angle it is a narrow gorge of solid rock looking up from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest
the canyon has widened to beach like banks
along the banks he sees a young blonde couple
this is mads and sonja in their s danish
they play at the rivers edge beside their campsite hotdogs cooking on a hibachi
chris averts his eyes when sonja rises from the water topless
yelling out to chris hello
you can join us
chris doesnt know quite what to do
but mads seems quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence of his topless girlfriend
we have hotdogs
chris cant turn that down
he paddles to within feet of the waters edge
i am mads
i am sonja
chris gives sonja a little wave
she bypasses it wading up to the kayak giving him a big hug
this couple is extremely energetic
cant wait to please
and a bona fide american adventurer in their midst
its everything they couldve wanted
we are from copenhagen
and you are from the rapids
youre a crazy man
sonja he is a crazy man
to chris ill make you a hotdog
mads grabs a hotdog from the hibachi
just one minute
sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry t shirt
but as she moves back to the waters edge those nipples keep saying hello
chris meanwhile simply cannot wipe the smile off his face in the presence of these warm open people
i love this
dont you love this
this is nature
we see it in the american movies
how come youre crazy
interrupting because thats crazy
you come down the rapids
what do you want on your hotdog
mustard and relish
you have ketchup
no i have mustard and relish
mustard and relish it is then
sonja you want a hotdog
in danish of course i want a hotdog
why are you stupid
mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill
translating she asked me why im stupid
and i say well
like i ask you why youre crazy and you say well
where are you going
i havent decided
we like it here very much
we went to los angeles
and then we went to las vegas
las vegas is very nice
the universe is very good
and then we come here
maybe you go to mexico
you can take kayak around lake mead and then take the river down to mexico
chris likes the idea
how far are we from lake mead
sonja how far is hoover dam
sonja grabs a map from the tent opens and scrutinizes it
we follow her finger tracing the river
maybe three hundred thirty kilometers
like two hundred miles
sonja walks the map over to chris at waters edge and hands it to him
he studies it
man i wonder if i could go all the way down into the gulf of california
chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route leading to el golfo de santa clara
entering the water with chris hotdog i go with you
we leave sonja here
you and me in kayak we go to mexico
in danish youre embarrassing
mads with a burst of re exhilaration grabs chris hand shaking it violently
i like the meeting you
im very happy to meet both of you too
sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her t shirt off on the move
chris is about to bust a gut
sonja returns to her sunbathing
these two are a hoot
just then something catches chris attention upriver
we can just barely make out the sounds of a jet boat motor
his eyes narrow a bit then
well guys i really appreciate the hospitality but i wanna make camp down river a ways so i better take off before dark
chris back in the kayak is paddling down river
mads and sonja on the bank wave a boisterous goodbye
and they just keep waving
and chris keeps waving until he has drifted out of sight when around the upriver bend arrive the river patrol
at rivers edge mads thinking quickly waves for their attention
pointing the river patrol back upriver he yells he went thattaway
the crazy man he went thattaway
and miraculously the river patrol makes an about face and heads in the opposite direction of chris
suddenly sonja thinks mads is the most clever man on earth
as she jumps his bones right there on the rivers edge just like in the movies
chris and the kayak are in the back of a pick up truck heading down river by road
we pass the hoover dam
it would be christmas in a couple of months
and the last news wed had was about his car being found
i woke up a couple of days ago and for the first time i was surprised to realize that it wasnt only my parents who hadnt heard from chris
i wondered why he hadnt tried to call in case i might answer
he couldve hung up if it wasnt me
chris is re stocked on some food items which he packs in his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak
this lower stretch of the river has little in common with the unbridled torrent that explodes through the grand canyon
emasculated by dams and diversion canals the lower colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir through some of the hottest starkest most austere country on the continent
but why he didnt send a letter maybe through a friend
i got mad
but i told myself it was good
it made me remember that there was something more than rebellion more than anger that was driving him
chris had always been driven had always been an adventurer
when he was four years old
chris at age four
he once wandered six blocks away from home at three oclock in the morning
four year old chris opening a kitchen drawer
he was found in a neighbors kitchen up on a chair digging into their candy drawer
as chris paddles downstream with mexico in his sights he is stirred by the saline beauty and the clean slant of light
directors note angle over chris onto water reflecting the landscape and diamond flashes of sunlight
whatever drawer he was opening now must have something sweet in it
chris floats in slo mo through the air his hair wisping skyward
as he pierces feet first a clear blue surface of the rivers water camera goes underwater with him and follows him in cu as he surfaces jubilant in the beauty
of the topock gorge
he shakes the water out of his hair
chris continuing down river through the imperial national wildlife refuge drifting past saguaros and alkali flats
chris on a day hike the river behind him he telefoto lens played in beautific back light tracks a herd of wild horses
angle chris the herd moves in an s pattern
chris runs beside them and in our long lens perspective he seems to be among them
chris sits outside his tent beside a campfire scrawling a letter
his bought food bounty in evidence
the words appear on screen in his handwriting over the continue letter over chris moves up the steps of the post office with an enveloped letter in hand
continue letter over
chris is in the elegant s style post office buying a stamp
continue letter over chris licks the stamp
continue letter on screen the stamp comes down onto an envelope addressed chris ports his kayak over the dunes snaking a scar through the sand in his wake
mexico in his sights
pov morelos dam at the mexican border
careful not to be seen chris shoves off just upriver from the dam border
the floodgates are open just enough to allow chris to lay back in the kayak and drift prone under the gate
he sits back up and paddles through having passed the border either unnoticed or ignored by patrols
a television set with george bush plays
sounds of typewriters
whyd you go to mexico
i thought id run the whole river into the sea of cortez
the stupid dams dried it up
chris is kayaking
he dead ends in a reeded tributary
how long were you on your own down there
howd you know
fingers and toes
we see chris fingers and toes
down angle into interrogation room after the river dried up i ported the kayak and got a lift to golfo
we see chris jump down off the back of the duck hunters truck
he slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the street
chris goes into his pocket pulls out a sealed sandwich bag of cash
he tries to pay the hunters for their time but they refuse the money
nonetheless chris is insistent and they relent
chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles it up on his shoulders
the hunters pull away
mm lens low angle sand and heat waves in foreground and background chris paddling his kayak toward us seemingly in the sand dunes
as we boom up slightly we see that there is a bend in the waters edge and that he is in fact paddling in the crystalline blue of the gulf
i paddled south about miles
under water shot we are directly under the passing kayak as it slices the waters surface above us
we backflip the camera as it passes
thats when i saw the cave and everything went upside down
see the ocean and sand wind whipping them
camera pulls back to reveal chris in a cave where he has made camp watching waiting
a sandstorm hit and i was pretty much stuck
my kayak blew away so i left it and walked up the beach hitched back north and here i am
chris sits with the immigration officer
i guess theyre gonna have to watch that spillway a little better
what they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow
i cant disagree with you on that
okay alexander supertramp
i think were gonna let you out of here shortly but youve got two working weeks to get an id card in the united states
you cant be crossing these borders without identification are we understood
ive eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway
a freight train cranks up its great engines and starts its move west
chris pov we see a bull hobo slang for a railway security guard making his rounds
as the bull disappears around the caboose and the trains motion picks up chris appears from behind a fuel pump
he makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight cars not quite sure how to board them
he begins to slowly jog beside the train
there is a vertical steel rod on each passing car
he times the train by putting his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it
three and with that he accelerates to a run throws his pack into the moving freight car before him simultaneously leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into
but his left foot misses and hes suddenly dangling from the moving train
he grabs hand over hand on the rail
angle dangling feet and razor sharp wheels
he puts everything into pulling himself up growling the strength into his muscles finally
as chris rolls forward into the car he made it
as alexander supertramp returns to civilization
quietly im a for real hobo
hes very happy about this despite the near surrender of it
chris uses his pack as a pillow lays back on it and begins to sing roger millers king of the road
we track with train by helicopter as we segue from chris rendition of king of the road to roger millers
we let the train get away from us and disappear
chris train pulls into the yard
bulls and loaders greet the train
chris jumps off and breaks for the fence unseen
the streets are crowded with business people on their way to homes and happy hours buses and parking garages showers and comforts
among the throngs we find chris walking up grand street backpack on his shoulders
we find he is not such an unusual sight there are homeless to the left and homeless to the right
chris walks in
reminder condition of mission is circa chris stands at the registration desk talking with a a can you tell me how to get an id card
did you lose your identification sir
no birth certificate
chris shakes his head apologetically
well youre gonna have to work that out with the dmv
you can catch them in the morning
the social worker begins to write an address on a piece of paper
the closest one is montebello and we can help you with a bus voucher
she hands the montebello address to chris
so just come to this desk when you need the voucher
and if i want to apply for a job somewhere can you help me with that
if you know how to cook we might have a space for you in our mobile kitchen
but ill have to talk to my supervisor about it in the morning
oh one last thing
do you have a bed for me
handing him a form sure
just fill this in and ill get you all set up
chris begins filling in the form
throughout the next two scenes there is steady honking of car horns wailing of police sirens ambient hostile banter grinding engines of buses puffs of diesel exhaust choke us
homeless occupy nearly as many beds in the dorm
chris searches the locker wall for his assigned locker
when he comes upon it he double checks the number with that on the key opens it and puts his backpack inside
cu the lock as chris closes and secures his locker
chris walking among the hordes of homeless at th and wall streets
open fires burn in front of cardboard shacks
there are blacks whites mexicans even families with children junkies winos hustlers and hookers
new angle chris walking down broadway
this is clearly just blocks away from where we last saw him yet the atmosphere is as if of a different world
one of those downtown la hip yuppie blocks
he comes upon a bar
through the window chris sees young men and women roughly his own age working people suits gold chainers
metallica blares on the sound system
same cu on locker as before but this time its being opened
we dont even see chris but the camera is his pov as he passes the social worker same as before the social worker catches a thrown key
you leaving us so soon
i know them dmv lines are long
directors note traffic and pedestrians move in an accelerated speed while chris moves nearly in slo motion
chris exits the building into cu
he looks left then right then directly into camera
chris train barrels along
chris goes into his pack grabs his canteen and drinks some water
mid sip the train begins to make a surprising stop
screeching wheels on track
chris is alarmed
as he moves to peer out the door even before he has a chance to see whats coming wham
hes smashed in the head with a baton
a bull jumps into the car with him
lay down on your stomach spread eagle
chris turns to reason with the man
and thats all it takes six straight blows to the ribs legs and arms
we hear it more than we see it
chris is in agony
let me see your face
the bull shines a flashlight into chris eyes
i never ever ever forget a face
if i see yours again i wont arrest you
ill kill you
this is the god damned railroad
and we will do whatever we have to to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability
chris is trying to understand what the man is saying
if one of you people gets hurt on our train we are liable
do you understand that
despite the violent irony im sorry sir
you have i
of course you dont
chris is pushed off the train his pack thrown out after him
the bull jumps down beside the track as well and walks down track away from chris signalling an all clear with his flashlight to some unseen engineer
to chris over his shoulder last time my friend
chris stumbles to his feet
the pain of the beating is real
he bleeds from the back of his ear
but he can walk
and he does
chris sits on his pack on the roadside hitchhiking and eating from a can of beans he opened with his pocketknife
the odd car passes but doesnt stop
chris hops out of a camaro that gave him a ride
the lighting is anonymous and so is the driver
thanks very much
he closes the door and the car drives off
we follow chris as he goes to the overpass edge
he drops his pack over the side
chris climbs down the edge of the overpass grabs his pack and scurries into the underpass below
we suddenly recognize this as his pre river run campsite he digs up his buried belongings returning them to his pack
last to come out of the ground chris copy of jack londons call of the wild
he pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off
chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read
voices from the past screaming angry im not talking about this anymore
feet stomping off
dont walk away from me woman
i hate you
sounds of scuffle
eleven year old carine sits in the stairwell leading to her parents room where an argument ensues
carines head in her hands a delicate tear moistens the webs between her small fingers
fifteen year old chris enters from o
he leans against the stairwell and looks up the stairs
our focus remains on carine
in the b
soft focus walt is pinning billie down onto the bed
she flails at him but he holds down her shoulders
billie slips his grasp
walt reaches out with a hit push of her back
she is thrust out of the bedroom onto the landing above the staircase followed by walt who positions himself in the doorway like a hostile crucifixion
raging ill just cancel christmas then
billie returns to him punching on his chest who do you think you are
chris puts his hand out to carine
she looks up to him
he gives her a smile and a wink
she takes his hand and they exit frame as the argument continues
where do you kids think youre going
not in desperation so much as a demand for their witness kids get back here
we hear a door slam oc
the young chris and carine
she sits atop the handlebars of his bicycle beaming as chris peddles her down the middle of the street
we pull them as they ride
mockingly ill cancel christmas
humored out of her sadness who do you think you are
as they both laugh we dissolve back to chris present reading beside his candle lantern
in the nine months since chris disappearance my parents went through enormous changes
guilt was giving way to pain
and pain seemed to bring them closer
my father had humbled dramatically
and what had always been a sort of curt arrogance the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel christmas had given way to the vulnerability of a fathers
even their faces had changed
it made me sad that i couldnt share with chris the new closeness i felt toward our parents
the image of chris reading begins a slow dissolve into
i close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where chris might be
suspicious ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing lights that hit the train car from outside
theyre toothless and tattooed
aged and young
punks and piercings
theyre train tramps
we see chris observing them
warmly he speaks but we do not hear im alex
was there beauty around him
was he hurt
was he alone
we see chris sharing camp with the train tramps in the outskirts of las vegas
was he having the great adventure that he wanted
we see chris working as a waiter in a las vegas restaurant
could he feel the changes here at home
by some kind of supernatural osmosis
chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad
we see what may be chris pov from a train car snaking through a mountain pass
he said i was the only person in the world who couldve possibly understood what he had to say
we see chris in the las vegas desert by a campfire at night
high angle cu we see chris walking the streets of seattle
as we widen out he becomes a dot in the seattle landscape
in those silent moments with my eyes closed trying to picture where chris might be at that very moment probably climbing some scary mountain i want to reach into that
picture and bring him back to see what mom and dad what our family might become
long lens chris disappears over the rise into the seattle marketplace overlooking puget sound per location photography
but instead when i open my eyes what i see is my mother sitting at the dining room table sifting through photo albums and pictures of chris
its all she can do to examine the snapshots
and though she breaks down from time to time she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity like looking at food you cant eat or into a window at
a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more
we see billie driving out of the annandale supermarket onto the boulevard
she sees a hitchhiker roadside
she cranes her head is it chris
she convinces herself its chris that its her son whenever she passes a stray
and i fear for the mother in her
we see chris hitchhiking in a barren desert
instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure i begin to wonder if i do understand
what chris is saying any longer
but i catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with
that in the forced reflection that comes with loss indeed everything chris is saying has to be said
and i trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done
this is our life
chris is in the passenger seat of a mac truck cab
both chris and the trucker look outward as though to find an address or landmark
i dont know where to drop you
bullheads kinda haphazard theres no center
you sure you dont want to be in laughlin
its casinos versus chiropractors
this is good
chiropractors it is
he pulls over
chris grabs his pack and exits the truck in front of a laundromat
as the truck pulls away chris sees a help wanted sign for burger king on the laundromat window
the place is packed with a line out the door
lori the second assistant manager hurries back into the kitchen where we find chris in paper cap bunning whoppers at a leisurely pace
chris you gotta go faster
weve got a line out the door
a bit oblivious okay
but then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming pace
lori is about to say something but by now she knows theres no getting through to him
she looks down to the floor where we see that chris wears no socks
extending patience chris i dont mean to be on you about everything
youre doing a great job
i want to keep you on
and we all want to help you get to alaska but youve got to start wearing socks
were ten deep
but the pace remains
chris stands at the counter making a deposit with a young how much do i have in the account now
it looks like
let me see
including this latest deposit
one thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and
twenty two cents
whats the interest on twenty two cents
the young teller giggles
were tight on chris sock less feet pedalling away from the bank on a bicycle
the growing independence of his financial situation felt in the music over series of angles as chris rides out of town into the desert from a late afternoon sun into
a sunset as he arrives at his the casino lights of laughlin nevada distantly in b
chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his belongings strewn about
and in particular some food supplies have been torn into
a coyote yips in the distance as chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds
across the desert scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed three young coyotes head for the hills
chris picks up his tattered hat and smiles
we are tight on the punchclock as chris timecard comes into frame and is punched out
widen out to see chris taking off his paper hat and burger king overshirt
he walks his timecard over to lori
the place is all but empty
lori im punching out
just put it in the drop
no i mean im punching out for good
happy for him weve made our quota have we
also ive got to do some things before i head north
well weve enjoyed knowing you
i wont be able to get that last check to you right away though
ill let you know where to send it
alright then chris
bye bye now
city crews string christmas lights and ornaments along the main drag
we crane down to find chris bike leaning on a lamppost
a cardboard sign attached to it reads chris is hitching south on the into the big maria mountains
beyond him we see a sign for niland miles
chris gets a clean shave and a whores bath
cu chris music fades
this is the vista of former barracks foundations rainey and jan burres had told chris about
hundreds of people in tents and trailers a quarter inch to the right of a rainbow gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with the hippies
there are canvas covered booths set up for swap and trade
even a few makeshift food stands
we see that many of the inhabitants have set up christmas trees outside their trailers and tents
kids play naked in a mud pool
we see rainey selling their wares
beside the booth their van with its backseat door open
a little dog sunni jumps out the van door sniffing something out
jan exits the van after the dog
come here boy
but sunni has sniffed out chris large backpack leaning against the rear of the van
jan is just beginning to recognize it when from behind the van appears chris looking like a million bucks
as she goes to hug him angle rainey hearing his name jumps up from his stool to join them
big embraces all around
an impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a makeshift stage
jan rainey and chris sit on chairs outside the circle of inhabitants taking in the music
you have to tell us everything
note this scene should largely be improvised
they all know their characters their history
jan and rainey are doing great
and while chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty year old girl are upon him chris lays out his travels and his plan for alaska
jan remarks i guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to mexico hop freight trains and score beds at inner city missions you can figure
out alaska too
at this point the pretty year old girl who had had her eyes on chris takes the stage with an acoustic guitar introduces herself as tracy then sings an innocent
love song of her own composition stealing seductive glances at chris throughout the performance
i think youve made yourself a friend
blushing shes only a teenager
the girl finishes her song
chris and rainey man the second hand goods booth while jan bathes sunni in a steel bucket by the van
among the goods a used organ
chris is thrilled to have access to all the second hand books that are part of rainey and jans inventory
as he skims through jack londons odyssey of the north rainey notices tracy sitting on the steps of her vagabond parents rig across from the booth
she picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes fixed on chris
how long can you stay with us
well im waiting on a check from my last job to come into salton city the day after christmas
ive got to start thinking about getting ready for alaska
when the sun gets a little lower tonight im going to start a calisthenics routine
i think after the check comes in ill try to find some mountains i can climb everyday till spring comes
i gotta see how far the moneys gonna go
im going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring
so i might take another job or i might be okay
well you know well give you a little something for every day you work the booth
im not taking any money from you rainey
its been a real great twist meeting you two
you look like youre doing good
we are and you were a big part of that coming along when you did
yep things are good
gives a little giggle man i used to think tantric sex was just a bunch of reading
speaking of which dont you think you ought to introduce yourself to joni mitchell over there
chris looks up from his book to the wide open year old smile of tracy
rainey laughs aloud
chris smiles back and against his better instincts gives her a little wave over with the paperback
tracy jumps off her step putting her guitar inside the rig and trots like a little wood nymph to chris
you selling books
i read a lot
i heard you play your song last night
embarrassed im terrible
rainey amused by all of this
you are not terrible
you sing sweet
i was going to go watch the kids play in the mud
do you want to go
ill watch the store
this is rainey
and im chris
whoops a slip on the name but
and this is alex
dont lie to her
chris realizes his slip but before rainey can question anything chris stands and goes off with tracy
rainey and jan share a conspiratorial smile
long lens we watch chris and tracy sit pit side with a foreground of frolicking naked children splashing about in the mud
we dont hear their conversation
we just watch its gentleness
tracy helps rainey cook dinner on the barbecue meaning to demonstrate to chris what a wonderful wife she would be
jan and chris sipping on beers sit beside each other on folding chairs out of rainey and tracys earshot
i wasnt much older than tracy when i got pregnant
and i thought my husband and i were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever
but it didnt work out that way
now ancient history
and that was the end of that
so i raised reno by myself thats my son
then i met rainey
and that was really good for a while
but reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way
and then i dont know
he kinda followed in his fathers footsteps out the door and gone
and i really dont know where he is
i havent heard from him in two years
i hope i get to meet him sometime
jan looks into chris eyes and smiles with pure love
she leans over and gently kisses chris on the cheek
do your folks know where you are
chris aims to deflect the question as tracy enters the scene
oh im sorry
are you guys getting heavy
youve been doing a fantastic job over there
to chris shall we eat
tracy grabs chris hand and proudly leads him to supper
as they exit frame we remain for a moment with jan and her thoughts
chris reading and selling books
chris and tracy taking walks with sunni
rainey and jan stealing some afternoon delight in the van
its the days of wine and roses
chris new daily regimen of calisthenics
tracys new daily regimen of watching chris do calisthenics
his lean body tighter and stronger everyday
rainey stands over chris as chris does sit ups
raineys gut hanging a little heavy over his belt
os voices exchange christmas greetings
i really ought to get myself doing that
you should rainey
makes that tantric stuff go even better
how the hell would you know
that poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post
and here you are the monk of jack lalane
they share a laugh
chris comes to the end of his sit ups
wipes his brow with a towel
rainey squats down next to him
i guess jan filled you in
about reno and everything
children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents
they dont grant clemency easily
i think reno tended to see things in black and white
i just hope he lives long enough to forgive her
the connection is not lost on chris
but painful as it is you turned a light on in her and im grateful
chris doesnt answer
a kid rides by on a bright new big wheel
must be from the rich side of the commune
do your folks know where you are
dont you think they ought to
but i cant
not yet anyway
i got a sister though carine
shes the most beautiful girl in the world
but its all got to stay behind me until i get where im going
rainey wont intrude any further
he just nods
chris notices tracy in the door of her parents rig stealthily waving him over
chris gives rainey the uh oh look pulls on his t shirt and walks over to the rig
tracy has disappeared inside
chris pops his head in
come in here
as chris mounts the steps he finds tracy laying on the bed inside wearing a skimpy white girls tank top and underpants
deer in headlights what
my parents went into town
yes they did
they went to call my grandma for christmas
no i mean no we cant do that
chris moves to sit on the edge of her bed
tracy sits up beside him
how old are you
chris throws her a look of doubt
what year were you born
as soon as she has to think about it the jig is up
you want to do something together
shyly she shakes her head yes
we see the used christmas trees of the residents being thrown onto an existing campfire building into the enormous celebratory bonfire that lights the scene
as we did with the footsteps in the mud and the kayak slashing the sand we track vertically along an extension cord from one of the trailer generators to the
stage until we find tracy with her guitar and chris with the second hand organ from rainey and jans booth on the stage
they enter into a duet of john prines angel from montgomery for the crowd of the slabs fire lit inhabitants
in the crowd we find rainey and jan clapping and dancing along to chris and tracys song
jan is pulling the van out from their plot
rainey is guiding the single directional vehicle
chris and tracy stand beside the car path
chris writes down wayne westerbergs carthage address
you can always get in touch with me by sending mail here
i dont know when ill get it but ill get it
youre pretty magic
he hugs her
and kisses her
i dont know
jan pulls up in the van
rainey walks over to chris and gives him a paternal hug
you take care of yourself kiddo
you too rainey
thanks for everything
chris gives raineys gut a full hand pinch
new years resolution
rainey gives him a wink and puts his arm around tracy as chris jumps into the car
then he and jan hit the road
this market liquor store post office serves as the cultural nexus for the greater salton sea area
as jans van pulls up opposite the post office and makes a u turn to curbside chris gets out of the van
now jans eyes really well up
sweetly just get your pack out of the back and get out of here
i cant take a hug
chris says nothing
he just looks at jan
they understand each other
chris closes the door
he fiddles with the broken handle of the back door gets it open gets his pack out
on top of his pack a wrapped xmas gift and when he closes the back door jan heads straight off back to the slabs
chris opens the giftwrap its the new hat jan had promised
chris is touched
telephoto lens a long two laned road before us rises and falls in a series of saddles and peaks
the narrow shoulders are densely wooded
slowly appearing over the near most peak a team of eight shirtless high school runners
leading the group year old christopher mccandless
lean softly handsome and graceful
in high school chris became captain of the cross country track team
they called themselves the road warriors
reverse angle the group of young runners led by chris suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining woods
series of angles the runners led by chris pace unchartered trails grassy hillsides and shallow streams
hed take them on what he loved to refer to as epic runs
the whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking
then theyd slow down a little somehow hed find their bearings and lead them home again at full speed
this was my brothers idea of fun
we favor chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating point of being lost
when he has identified a most likely return route he quickens his pace leading the group in the direction of return
chris heads out with his last burger king check in hand proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to climb
a year and a half into chris disappearance each day that goes by now feels like two
dad calls it suspended animation
i kept telling myself that he had to get lost to prove his independence to himself
but this was no day run for the road warriors and after so much time i could no longer keep out the haunting thoughts
chris with pack and new hat walks away from camera toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond
in many ways my life and even my parents had begun to move in new directions
id fallen in love
and mom and dad had even ventured out on a brief vacation
but when a search of tax records uncovered chris contribution to oxfam the weight of his disappearance just seemed to lie down on us full length
wide shot we see the oh my god hot springs
steaming pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees
a small group of campers and charlie manson wannabes in we zoom past them to the sheer rock faces and landforms of the badlands several miles beyond
slo mo we are looking down a radically steep rock face
a shirtless chris is in training running towards us under the hot desert sun
we hear only breath and footsteps
chris rests on the sand under a tarp hung from a creosote branch
a plate of beans and rice eaten nearly clean and an empty water jug beside him
flies buzz and pick
chris on a morning jog wearing a shoulder bag and carrying an empty water jug
a quick wave to one of his distant neighbors at the springs camp as he runs by
chris continues his jog cars whisk by and dust kicks into the air
but chris is undeterred keeps running
chris approaches slowing his jog to a walk
chris sets down his water jug and stretches his calves
in the distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from where he ran
chris shakes off the jog picks up the jug and we go with him around the side of the building
theres a water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud
chris pops his jug under it and fills it up
chris walks the aisles sipping from his jug as he comes across bags of rice on the market shelves
a heavy set girl passes him in the aisle with her well mannered dog following her
no high pitched pet voice hey boy
you are a handsome fellow
over shoulder to the girl beautiful dog
as the girl continues on the dog wants to stay with chris
go on boy
and the dog obeys him
as he sorts through the various rice selections brown white wild we notice a man peering over the opposite shelf at chris
this is ron franz between and years old six feet thick arms barrel chest and large ears
he wears old jeans an immaculate white t shirt a decorative tooled leather belt white socks and scuffed black loafers
his deeply pitted nose demonstrates a purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely wrought tattoo
and on either side of it the wary blue eyes of a soldier
he is the archetypical american man
chris has caught his sympathetic eye
chris moves to the counter to pay for rice
in wide shot we watch chris from behind walking out across the two lane road
he puts out his thumb to hitch a ride
when a truck comes from behind into frame heading straight for chris the truck makes a relaxed l turn pulling up beside chris
wheres your camp
pointing out past oh my god hot springs
ive lived in and around here six years now and ive never heard of any place that goes by that name
ron leans across the bench seat of the truck opening up the passenger door
show me how to get there
chris hops in beside ron who extends his hand ron franz
where are you from alex
okay alex from west virginia
i like a fellow who doesnt raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animals
shows he doesnt condescend
chris remembers now the dog in the store and why ron mustve thought to give him a ride
and they head off
ron truck drives up the road
as we come upon a x track twisting down a narrow wash you go left here
ron turns the truck down the x track
we watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt road about a mile in
out the window rons eye has been caught by something
rons pov oh my god hot springs we see a couple of day glo vans and rusted out studebakers that hadnt been turned over since eisenhower was in the white
several of those living there mill about buck naked
and at the center of the camp the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees
you live here
no we keep going
im further up
another half mile or so out on the bajada
ron and chris drive up in the truck
ron shuts off the ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs
chris follows puts his full water jug under the tarp at his campsite hooking it onto a branch
he throws his shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack
well this is somethin out here
dont you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there
no they keep to themselves pretty much and so do i
you strike me as a bright young man
am i wrong about that
i think i got my head on my shoulders pretty good
thats what i mean
how long have you been out here
couple of weeks
and before that
a lot of places
ive been moving around
how old are you
twenty three years old
son dont you think you should be getting an education
and a job
and making something of this life
i think careers are a twentieth century invention and i dont want one
you dont need to worry about me
i have a college education
im not destitute
im living like this by choice
in the dirt
laughs yeah in the dirt
i just dont know
wheres your family
dont have one anymore
thats a shame
chris can see some deep sadness in this man
i want to show you something
ron follows chris to the rockface wed seen chris running earlier
they begin to walk up it
its tough on the old timer walking this steep hill
but hes a tough old timer at least for the moment
angle the two men nearly half way to the summit
its getting steeper and higher
this is getting a little steep
and a little high for me kid
but look out there
even from half way out its quite a sight isnt it
their pov enormous beautiful vista all the way across the bajada
from the top you can see all the way to the salton sea too
ron looks up the precarious rock wall
he aint gonna be seeing the salton sea today
you can see the salton sea from up there
starting his way down the hill my goodness
you dont want to go up
i dont do these kind of things
chris smiles and follows ron
as they approach the bottom of the hill how about you and me take a drive
about fifty miles or so up highway i know a place thats got a view great food and requires no climbing
hows that sound
chris thinks about it
then yeah sure
itll take me a couple of minutes to clean up
rons truck drives through frame
we see ron and chris driving parallel on the windmilled road our frame will only hold the lower fraction of the spinning windmills in the background vertical pov we are
thousands of feet in the air over the rigid rocky canyon as we ascend toward san jacinto summit
music over as chris and ron ride the tram to the peak we watch chris watching ron his kind moist old eyes slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature
other passengers on the tram seem nervous but ron is meditative almost hypnotized
and with each roll through of the tram through the cable towers the tram car rocks and sways but rons peace goes unbroken
and chris continues to admire the gentle blinking of his eyes
the two of them sit in a quiet corner booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit of san jacinto overlooking the lights of palm springs and the
desert clear back to salton sea
chris is on a roll
how old are you mr
seventy nine years old
see all due respect but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long theyve trudged around like a dip shit
but its true
no question about that
ron continues to let chris vent
the governments the same as my parents
they dont respect anybody
we cant do this
but they can do that
i mean the hypocrisy of the whole
makes me crazy
my father was having children with two women at the same time and then has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me
make judgments on me
my mother of course goes along with all of it
keeps the secret which of course makes my whole life a fiction
everything i thought was wasnt
theyre such fools
alex please dont lump me in amongst your judges
and your tyrants
but id prefer to not hear that kind of language
realizing his slip sorry
i dont usually use that kind of language either
i just get so angry thinking about it
ron reaches across the table
puts his sturdy hand on chris shoulder
you got a lot of passion young man
chris smiles at ron
as ron and chris pull up in the pick up truck we see sporadic fireworks whistling and crackling into the air above the hot springs and hear the distant hooting
of its inhabitants
chris hops out and walks around to rons side of the truck
awww that was a great time mr
if charles manson and his buddies dont kill me on my way out of here id like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night
if i come out here about say four oclock tomorrow how would that be
that would be swell
ron is thrilled
im no gourmet but i know where the spices are
good night kid
good night mr
and with that ron hits the road
chris hikes up it with his backpack on one laborious step at a time
chris summiting the rock formation
he looks down over the desert and there before him the salton sea
the house is a single level beige structure sitting between the salton sea and a small inlet where he keeps a fishing boat
underneath a canopy in the backyard there is a small workshop of some kind
high angle chris looking at his own reflection in the water below rons dock
in the reflection we see his hands full of dirty laundry
ron broils a couple of steaks
chris enters and moves past ron carrying his laundry into another room
chris pours detergent over his long in need clothes
starts the cycle
as chris enters ron is pulling the steaks from the broiler
above the kitchen sink chris sees a row of approximately ten photographs each in vertical x frames some black and white some color all of japanese boys and girls in
formal american and japanese attire
did you find everything you need
breaking his gaze from the photographs yeah
i hope i dont wreck your machine
theres a lot of grime in that stuff
well thats what its for
how do these steaks look
ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table
well sit down
ron grabs some silverware from a drawer plops it down on the kitchen table with some paper napkins
what do you drink
you got a white russian
dont have any alcohol
i had to quit all that
how about a guava juice
ill take a guava juice that sounds good
as ron gets the drinks yeah i had a little spell with the bottle you could say
ron pops the drinks down on the table then sits with chris
they lift their glasses toward one another then cheers
i spent most of my life in the army
on new years eve i was stationed over in okinawa
my wife and son were here in the states just driving down the road when a fellow whod had too much to drink plowed right into them
killed them both
anyway you might think that the last thing in the world id do is go to the whiskey but at the time it felt like the only thing i could
and i did it hard
but pretty soon i figured i wasnt doing my wife and son any good mourning them with a bottle
so i pulled myself together and quit drinking cold turkey
ron spinning his body around points to the photographs over the sink
brightening you see all these kids over here
yeah i was gonna ask you
pointing at each with his finger fuki kenjiro yoshiko keiko masaro junichi kimpei nayoko
for the last picture frame ron stands and takes it off the shelf pridefully shows chris the picture and this is akira
just finished medical school
chris takes the picture and studies akiras face
ron sits back down
yeah i unofficially adopted all of them
it did my heart some good but i guess really it was just writing a few letters and sending some money
anyway it was important to me
i get a letter from each of them from time to time
so since all that this is pretty much me
indicating his small reclusive abode do you ever travel mr
i cant seem to get too far from my leather
ill show you after you finish eating
i do a lot of leather engraving
i got a little workshop in the garage
between that and my pension i do pretty well
but every time i think i might take a trip somewhere i get too far behind on orders and such to consider it
having wolfed down the steak well im finished eating
id love to see your workshop
standing alright then
ron picks up the picture of akira and replaces it on the shelf above the sink
as we begin ron is instructing chris in the skills of leather engraving
chris a clear plastic bag of clean laundry beside him sits alone cross legged
he begins to carve into a leather belt
we follow chris in a low angle up his mountain run framing from mid back to just above his head sweating profusely
rons truck cuts along the x track
chris reaching the summit
he bends over to catch his breath hands on knees
how about some fishing
chris turns to the voice
and down at the bottom of the rock wall beside the campsite is ron holding up two fishing poles
referring to the sea that things twice as salty as the ocean
did you know that
chris has barely the breath to speak
anything alive in it
ron shrugs his shoulders in a who cares
chris laughs but nods in the affirmative and gives ron the thumbs up
chris and ron fishing in the salton sea
at rons workshop garage ron guides chris in his leather belt project
at chris campsite chris does push ups while ron sits on the tailgate of his truck spying on the manson family through binoculars shaking his head
chris at his campsite working on the belt by campfire light
we move in on the belt hes beginning to form the letter n in the leather
chris jogging in the morning beside oh my god hot springs
chris and ron at the leather bench in rons workshop garage
in a extreme close up music fades out as we pan across chris leather belt and the story being told on it through the engravings alex is inscribed at the
belts left end then the initials c

across the strip of cowhide one sees a rendering of two lane blacktop a no u turn sign a thunderstorm producing a flash flood that engulfs a car a hitchhikers

whats the n stand for
ron is sitting on his tailgate watching chris backpack on climb the stone wall
son what the hell you running from
yells down from above i could ask you the same question
except i already know the answer
you do do you
i do mr
youve got to get back out in the world
get out of that lonely house of yours that little workshop and go live on the road
ron waves him off
youre going to live a long time ron
you should make a radical change in your lifestyle
the core of mans spirit comes with new experiences
and there you are stubborn old man sitting on your butt
sittin on my butt huh
ron gets up off the tailgate
ill show you sittin on my butt
and ron starts making the old man hustle
shifty shoulders and all up the stone wall
mumbling stubborn old man
chris is laughing and clapping
come on old man
mumbling ya little pinhead
chris is jumping up and down thrilled for rons efforts
now the old mans shuffle has turned into an old mans walk
but he aint stopping
and bit by bit he shows hes got it in him after all
as ron is just about to mount the summit chris extends a hand
ron swats it away
ya little pinhead
ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let his thumping heart slow down
ron after taking one more deep breath sits up and chris sits next to him
hes actually pretty happy with himself
he looks out and sees the distant salton sea
im going to miss you when you go
ill miss you too ron
but youre wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships
gods placed it all around us
its in everything
in anything we can experience
people just have to change the way they think about those things
you ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick up and go take a look at some of the great work gods done out here in
the american west
youre probably right
and im going to take stock of that
chris offers a skeptical glance
no i am
a second skeptical glance
which ron squashes with genuine sincerity
almost to himself i am
chris buys it this time and feels hes accomplished something with ron
but ill tell you something
the bits and pieces ive put together you know what youve told me about your family
your mother and dad
and i know you got your problems with the church too but theres some kind of bigger thing that we can all appreciate
and it sounds like you dont mind calling it god
but when you forgive you love
and when you love
gods light shines on you
miraculously it is just at that moment that the cloud clears from the sun and the light shines in rons eyes
chris points at rons face at the light shining on him holy shit
i told you about that language
the two men their eyes welling up fall back laughing
extreme wide shot from below the two men on the summit with the echoing of laughter and rons screams i told you so
i told you so
chris pulls his laundry out of the dryer
hes got his pack sitting in the doorway to the kitchen
he folds his things and tucks them into his pack
ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel
what are you doing up
its three thirty in the morning
heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast
chris says nothing
im going to drive you a hundred miles to somewhere where you can pick up a train a plane or hitch a ride without getting stuck on this desert
id take you all the way to alaska if i didnt have to get to an eight oclock mass
ron you dont have to do that
i want to do it
get you started on this thing of yours
on my great interrupting i know
on your great alaskan adventure
from just out of chris eye line ron leans out of frame picking up a zippered duffel bag
he opens it displaying the contents to chris
theres a machete an arctic parka collapsible fishing pole and a few odds and ends i threw in there for you
oh just take it
chris does nodding his thanks
ill wait for you in the truck
we follow the two men on this nondescript locale driving along the highway east from dawn through sunrise
they ride in silence through coachchella desert center and blythe
the truck exits at a north south junction
as ron begins to pull over
well my friend
both of them are uncomfortable
chris goes for the door handle
rons gnarled hand reaches out to take chris elbow
after a long beat ron speaks without looking at chris
i had an idea
you know my mother was an only child
so was my father
and i was their only child
now with my own boy gone im the end of the line
when im gone my family will be finished
what do you say you let me adopt you
i could be say your grandfather
this takes chris by surprise
he knew it would be hard but not this hard
how about we talk about this when i get back from alaska ron
would that be alright
releases chris elbow
well talk about it then
trying to mask
the blinking moist eyes again yep
we can do that yep
chris gets out of the truck
ron watches as chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that ron gave him
chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a ride north on the far side of the road
we zoom slowly through the windshield into rons face as he watches chris hitching away
we hear the first bars of neil youngs my my hey hey
this will carry throughout the following montage
we zoom into walt mccandless face as he looks through the questar telescope that chris had given him
angle the stars through the telescope
the same stars his son walks under
we pan across space
note this montage will intercut chris traveling pov with objective shots
however we never see chris
we pull back from the starry night sky to see it framed from within a moving train
carine in her shower water cascades over her face
billie in her kitchen making dinner
through the windshield of a semi truck the sun rises on glacier national park
a handheld zoom out from canadian border crossing camera turns to the woods beyond and moves into them
series of traveling shots through skookumchuk and radium junction lake louise to prince george and dawson creek static nature shots helicopter shots
on the bed in their van jan sits on raineys bare feet while he does sit ups
ron holding a garage sale while hooking a trailer to his truck
wayne being released from jail
mads and sonja side by side one armed bandit ing in a vegas casino
tracy at a high school dance slow dancing with her young date
looking through the windshield of another semi
a bear lopes across the two lane road before us
we pan and zoom with it into the tundra beside the road
handheld walking we pass mile of the alaska highway the sign fairbanks miles
intercut hand and thumb hitching a sense that rides are few and far between
a misting mountain peak
beavers in streams
melting blue ice walls
a lynx skittering across a snowy mound
walt and his telescope
the hitchhikers view on a two lane road walking past a highway sign for the yukon territory
through johnsons crossing whitehorse and beaver creek
from a passenger car window a series of road signs reading closed for winter
about a month short of the second anniversary of chris disappearance i had gotten engaged to my boyfriend jerry ray and was moving in with him
carine packing her belongings into boxes stumbles upon the sharon olds book chris had given her on his graduation day
when i stumbled upon the book chris had given me on his graduation day
for some reason it was the last line of the poem he read that really stuck out
flash back from page chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the and i will tell about it
i asked chris who had written the poem
what we see of carine plays with the voice over track and silent with the production track in essence lip synching herself
chris dialogue comes directly from the flashback image
who wrote that
well it couldve been either one of us
we see pictures of chris on the night stand of walt and billies bedroom what would he tell about now
what did his voice sound like now
i realized that the words to my thoughts were of less and less meaning
chris was writing his story and it had to be chris who would tell it
the pictures in the scene blur as in a far away tunnel like sound mom help me
billie sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night tears rolling down her cheeks
walt awakens beside her
what is it
i wasnt dreaming
i didnt imagine it
i heard his voice walt
i heard chris
walt takes her in his arms trying to squeeze life into both of them
berms of cleared snow line the streets
a gas station gold hill gas and liquor we see chris writing appear on screen
a sign against a radio tower radio fairbanks perhaps we hear a weather report we return to the area of scene
music over of religious scope
helicopter shot we travel a long ways across snowy peaks and valleys clearly far from anywhere passing between two escarpments of outer range bordering bottomlands five miles wide until we
barely see a tiny form within it trudging through the snow
we overfly it
chris crunching through two to three feet not more of snow in arctic parka big boots his warm hat rifle slung over his shoulder and pack
he moves toward camera
we pan around with him as he walks past where beyond chris on the snow plain rises a tree line
its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow
at its center a channel of gently flowing water opaque with glacial till
beyond the far ice shelf chris appears from the riverside treeline
he eases across the ice then wades through the latte colored channel and on to the other side
reverse angle chris moving toward the opposite tree line he turns back to the gentle river behind
chris pov scanning the terrain
from the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a second mountain peak triangulating his location
he makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the trees
total silence across the beatific white vista of snow mountain and colorless trees until a distant echoing chris has skinned and is cooking a squirrel
chris packs the last of his camp and begins his march upriver
as chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line he catches his first glimpse of denalis mt
mckinleys high blinding white bulwarks
chris stands in awe
we remain in his wide shot pov as it but now chris tent sits in its foreground with the moonlit denali still visible
camera angled skyward into the broken rays of grey light
we tilt down to find and track through the trees with chris moving along the river when he sees something just chris pov through the trees and fireweed he sees
something metallic and rusty
chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing where before him a derelict school bus
it is a vintage international harvester from the s
chris approaches the bus lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone
as he moves around the vehicle we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether
the green and white paint is badly oxidized
weathered lettering fairbanks city transit system bus
broken whiskey bottles litter the floor
chris may well have found his new home
the bus is outfitted with a bunk and a barrel stove
previous visitors had left it stocked with matches bug dope and other essentials
we follow chris back out of the bus surveying the area of the clearing
he loves what he sees
he runs up a berm to look down into the river
he runs from corner to corner of this magic bus area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee
he climbs a tree swings from its branch doing a flip in the air landing on his feet but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then
onto his back
he grabs a handful of snow shoves it in his mouth melts it into water and swallows it
crane shot we pull up from chris to high above the clearing
he re enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket scribbling on the wall of the bus angle chris he continues to write as he speaks the words
aloud the road
escaped from atlanta
thou shalt not return cause the west is the best
and now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure
chris is cleaning up the bus
the climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution
chris shoveling snow away from the bus entrance with a rock
ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bringing him to the great white north
back to chris real time as he continues to write as he speaks no longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees and walks alone upon the land to become
lost in the wild
chris signs his doctrine chris posts a found piece of paper on the inner wall of the bus alongside his doctrine
cu chris hand he writes and circles the number chris comes out rifle in hand
we track with him as he moves into the woods on the hunt
chris searching for game
he moves through the woods along the river and at the base of a nearby mountain
finding animals for food seems more difficult than expected
chris stumbles upon a caribou as it steps out from the woods
he lines up his rifle on the animal about to pull the trigger when its calf appears beside it
he lowers his rifle unwilling to take a shot that would separate mother and child
a spruce grouse is spied on a foreground branch
the branch splinters and the bird makes haste
angle chris rifle in hand
chris cooking rice
we see his single bag of rice
its amount tells us the hunting had better improve soon
we explore a passage of time throughout which chris gets increasingly thin and pale hunting sleeping cooking rice dwindling line ups of scrawny shot birds
he adds holes to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking waistline
chris bags a squirrel on a snowy plain
chris eats his measly catch but looks to his bag of rice with concern perhaps only a day or so left of his rations
we come to the diary log posted on the wall
we see that he has been there for a weeks worth of entries as the squirrel is mentioned on day seven
chris is awakened by a new may sun streaming light through the windows of the bus
pov the sun circling high in the heavens
snowmelt dripping quickly across the windowpane
chris dances atop the bus naked in the new spring
note we are in a time of year in this part of the world where the sun dips behind the horizon only four hours a day intercut series of angles
throughout which chris remains thin but his pallor improves
the diary log representing a small improvement on the hunting front
undergrowth exposing itself through snowmelt
establish a small waterfall near the bus
landing on the snow has now all but vanished except on north facing slopes and shadowy ravines exposing a range carpeted in an amalgam of muskeg alder thickets and veins
of scrawny spruce
chris traipses along the seasons rose hips and lingonberries which he gathers in great quantity and snacks on as he walks
chris shoots a porcupine
the diary log day porcupine chris stands triumphant at the peak of a foot butte overlooking the bus
circle camera around him degrees recording the broad vista
angle cu hes beaming with satisfaction
we begin a slow zoom out and then accelerate the zoom encompassing the entire grandeur of the mountain with chris at its peak
the diary log day climbed mountain
the diary log map area
chris surveying and taking notes of area
the diary log improvise a bathtub and smudge pot
chris building a bathtub out in the front
the diary log collect skins and feathers to sew into chris hunting and skinning
the diary log construct bridge across nearby narrow chris knee deep in slow moving water constructing a make shift bridge across narrow creek
the diary log blaze network of hunting trails
chris making a trail with his machete when a moose appears from a nearby thicket
chris drops the machete and pulls his rifle from his shoulder
the moose looks ready to charge chris
theres no choice
chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into the mooses head dropping it
chris can hardly believe his own success
he puts the rifle back on his shoulder just staring at the dead moose
he begins back pedalling away from it
bit by bit his steps turn into a jog and then he turns and runs back toward the bus
directors note handheld chris scrambles through his pack and finds the piece of paper where he had written notes of how to cure beef by smoking it taught to him
by kevin waynes hunter friend back in south dakota
back at the kill the slow process of butchering begins
this aint going to be pretty
the diary log butchering extremely difficult
the diary log fly and mosquito hordes
the diary log remove intestines liver kidney one
the diary log got hind quarters and legs to stream
the diary log remove heart
the diary log digs smoker hole into existing cave
the diary log haul near cave
the diary log try to protect with smoker
the diary log can only work nights
the diary log maggots already
the diary log abandon carcass to wolves
we see chris hidden behind a rise watching a wolf pack tug at the rancid meat from the carcass
in and out of the bus
day and night portraying chris mourning his killing of the moose
he even plants a cross by its skeletal remains
sunrise and nature awakens
bird songs and flower blooms
a waterfall cascades
chris reading tolstoys family happiness
his pov the page what chris reads i have lived through much and now i think i have found what is needed for happiness
a quiet secluded life in the country with the possibility of being useful to people
chris sits amongst the pink bunches of fireweed choking the vehicles wheel wells growing higher than the axles his back leaning against the bus finishing the reading of family happiness
angle chris reading with great interest
his pov the page what chris reads and then on top of all that you for a mate and children perhaps what more can the heart of a man desire
angle chris he looks up from his book
a gentle breeze tickles morning flowers
the sunlight dances in a coppice of aspen and leaves of trees above
the sound of buzzing flies mutes
he is taking one last look at his paradise
chris showers photo sonic music lynyrd skynyrds simple man lyrics in cursive begins to play over my momma told me when i was young chris packs his gear
come sit beside me my only son a last look about the bus
listen closely what i say
full pack and rifle mounted in wide shot beside the sushana river
if you do this it will help you some sunny day just take your time dont live too fast we pass the familiar landmark of the mt
mckinley clearing where chris had camped
troubles w ill come and they will pass chris walking and camping his way back to the teklanika river and the road home
find a woman youll find love and dont forget son theres someone up above
in the trees beside the river we find chris
the river is not yet in sight but chris starts to hear it a building rumble
as chris exits the treeline there she is the teklanika at full flood
seventy five foot wide banks replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier
snowmelt from glaciers high in the alaska range its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete
and what had been a distant rumble in the woods now had the volume and power of a freight train a seventy five foot wide one
chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow careful step into the river
without mercy wham
the river kicks his feet out from under him
the branch he holds snaps
by some miracle his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower sturdier branch below saving himself from a certain death
we see the broken branch catapulted down river and into a rocky shoot below
he pulls himself back onto the bank drops his pack at riverside and eases to a sitting position beside it
its pouring rain outside
the rain pelts the top of the bus
chris pack is thrown onto the bunk
his hand appears at the diary log on the wall
he writes extreme cu beaded and shimmering from the past nights rain a bright red berry moves in the breeze like a tiny vibrating bell
rack focus to chris eyes spying it
he plucks it from its stem
chris adds another hole to tighten his belt
chris looking very thin
he is noshing on a bag of collected berries while reading from boris pasternaks doctor zhivago
angle the book here she stopped and closing her eyes took a deep breath of the flower scented air of the broad expanse around her
it was dearer to her than her kin better than a lover wiser than a book
angle chris pulls more berries from the bag and chews on them as he reads
angle the book for a moment she re discovered the purpose of her life
she was here in earth to grasp the meaning of its wild enchantment and call each thing by its right name
angle chris echoing by its right name
by its right name
he puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries in front of his face as close as shot of when he picked it
chris then grabs tanaina plantlore the flora and fauna book he had gotten from the library in fairbanks
and it takes him out of the bus like a divining rod
his nose in the book he follows it
plant to plant
bush to bush
speaking aloud the names of everything he sees as he identifies them with the book
beautiful blueberries vaccinium uliginosum
eskimo potato hedysarum alpinum
we follow chris over a number of days as he eats from these identified species of plant each being logged one by one by name on the bus diary log
with tanaina plantlore by his side chris digs into the soft earth on the berm of the river bank and digs up a wild potato root
chris pulls the seeds from the root noshing on them as he reads from doctor zhivago
we drift from him reading to the diary log on the wall
the day representing july th the diary log wild potato root we drift back to chris
fatigue shows in his eyes as he puts the book down and lays down to sleep
wide shot of the bus
its a beautiful july morning
birds chirp in the trees
a soft breeze sweeping down from the mountains massages the valley below
we slowly zoom into the bus
the open bag of seeds beside chris sleeping body
we drift over to chris face his lips de hydrated and skin parched
he breathes heavily
he tries to sit up
its a terrible struggle
barely makes it to his feet
chris stumbles to the door of the bus looking up at the hot sun
he has to sit back down on the small bus steps
from his position on the step he leans back into the bus and is able to grab his water jug
he pours it into his mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him
he drinks it all
it spills over his face and chest
we observe chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside his haunted eyes
and a curiosity seems to overtake him
he crawls back to his copy of tanaina plantlore flipping the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph identifying the wild potato root and the word edible
he reads the page to its conclusion and as almost an afterthought turns the page to see if there might be more
the word jumps off the page at him
the book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato root and warns that those with lateral veins such as those invisible on the leaflets of wild sweet peas are
the words leading to partial motor paralysis
inhibition of digestion
crash zoom into chris face realizing his desperate plight
chris kneels holding one of the potato seeds to the sunlight and there we see them the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds
angle the diary log extremely weak
fault of potato
chris barely able to walk moves at the pace of an elderly man with his rifle through the underbrush
he needs food now
he shoots a squirrel
but as he moves toward what he thinks is his kill the squirrel makes off with a bleeding tail
chris fires several desperate shots at the squirrel but misses with each one
chris having a fitful sleep
short breaths and mutterings
a big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch the squirrel chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the day
on the last legs of bleeding to death it falls from the tree
the moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days through visions of the nature about in varying light
chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full
he is shirtless and absolutely emaciated
he pauses at the rivers edge to take air into his lungs
its all he can do just to breath
wide angle tableau continuous chris standing at the rivers edge catching his breath framed against the background of the foot butte that hed so recently climbed with ease
now maintaining this tableau something moves from near camera right into frame
bit by bit well realize its a large bear entering frame and moving away from camera toward chris
it lumbers to within feet of him
cu over bear onto chris chris passive to the bears presence
angle the bear just as passive towards chris as though he didnt represent enough of anything to eat
back to tableau as the bear passing chris disappears over the rise toward the river
chris a motionless and slight silhouette
chris lays on the floor
cu chris orange light twinkles in his eyes
chris pov through the bus window we see the orange glow of smoke rising into the air
cu chris writes in his diary log
set small signal fire today watched it die tonight
back to pov as the ambient orange light fades into the blackness of smoke
the diary log day made it
but in weakest chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus
he shakes his head as if trying to say something and then considers his rifle and abundant ammunition
but taking his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an option for him
no no no dont do this to me
the frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream out
he does but with a low gurgled animal sound
he shakes it off and looks to his copy of doctor zhivago for distraction
thumbing through the pages he focuses his eyes on the page angle the page what he reads and that an unshared happiness is not happiness
chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book scribbling across the page he flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had written the quote he
tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side writing these words quickly as if in panic and now these words arrive slowly as we hear chris repeating with a weak voice call everything by its right name
the drumbeat increases as he signs the note we move from the page back up to chris
we see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight
he removes them folds them and lays them by his side
his body begins to tremble
his eyes dance wildly
the drumming intensifies
chris takes one last look out the window
the sun is covered by a well defined and puffy cloud
his arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother
with great suffering and shattering trembles he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag
skyward the cloud obscuring the sun
drumbeats escalate boom
we tighten on chris anguished face
directors note these cus on chris face combine both static and hand held cus upside down and right side up moving zooms and push ins
straight side and dutch angles
perhaps some intermittent distortion
we intercut between chris and the sky in a dance transitioning to the next world
it is hopeful anguished sad and elated
chris approaching the annandale house
his backpack on and body healthy
billie parts the curtains ecstatic to see chris approach alive and healthy
we see but do not hear her call to walt
a smiling chris steps up the curb approaching home
walt and billie we push into them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son
push into chris he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents embrace
what if you saw me running into your arms
chris walt and billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace
would you see then
the drumming resumes with a blast of bass and before an embrace is possible
what i see now
chris looking at the sky a cathartic tear falls from his left eye
another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun
chris the last airy expulsion of his breath
his open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes
it is a face of peace love a face of true deep serenity
the eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom
thats the way he settles to stillness looking directly into our camera
and he died alive
he made it
cat stevens miles from nowhere plays over as we pull away from chris face through the bus window and up into the sky we drift further and further away above
the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller
reprise image of truck driver taking picture of chris in scene
then its him the smiling still image we saw taken in the first scene from behind but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image
of the real christopher mccandless on the edge of the stampede trail
as it takes over the screen we zoom slowly into his smiling face
and then these words appear superimposed over it dedicated to the memory of christopher johnson mccandless february august th as those words dissolve these words appear on september carine mccandless
flew with her brothers ashes from alaska home to the eastern seaboard
she carried them with her on the plane
in her backpack
