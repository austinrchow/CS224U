in gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever
we ease back revealing more taking in the visual feast finally discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley a dog at his feet
virgil anderson life ahead of him someone seemingly at ease with himself
as we watch
him a moment sounds become prominent whistle of the wind through the grass a birds wings as it takes flight a tree branch creaking under its own weight
and as he sits there listening we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the day
black and our titles come up
then out of the darkness come a pair of headlights
and were an old bmw making its way up the taconic parkway
on the radio whitney houstons ill always love you
amy tremont s driving on the phone
im lost betsy and you know me i dont wear lost well wait wait im losing you
the cell phone glitches im pulling over before you disappear forever
amy pulls off the side of the road
wrestles with a map and the phone
i was looking for a sign
her attention is caught by something off camera
she stares out into the night
her pov a small iced over pond and in the middle moving about is virgil ice skating hockey stick in hand moving about the rink with an imaginary puck
i took the first
no no im listening
virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick throws his hands up in the air like he just scored
amy smiles peers off down the road

shrugs about to pull out that love song still blaring

click she shuts off the radio and pulls back out onto the road
amy pulling luggage out of her car
she takes a breath clearly shes exhausted and starts towards the entrance
amy at the front desk with the night manager caroline s annoyingly fit
we have a full weight room lifecycles stairmasters a spa yoga aerobics spin classes
im really just looking for a quick fix here

amy enters wearing sweats she checks her watch looks toward a closed door about to grab a magazine when she hears from behind the door virgil oh god
amys interest piques the womans murmur continuing deep ecstasy
yes there a bit more
a small bell dings wait wait you cant stop one more minute noo

and the door opens and we see a woman s susan bette midler type backing out of the room
virgil you have to come live with me

amy smiles as she passes susan and enters
virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table
the room is very ordered every vial bottle towel has its exact spot
hey amy im virgil why dont you get ready hop up on the table
amy sees virgil his head turned slightly away she drops her sweats and lies on the table face down pulling the sheet to cover herself

laughs thats right
mozart einstein virgil anderson massage therapist
now im going to start working somewhat deep you let me know if you want anything deeper
deeper is good where i come from all you get is shallow
i like that deep it is
click he hits a button on a cd player and as we hear the soulful aria mira norma from bellinis norma
first time in pinecrest
came in late last night
missed the town completely
if you came in broad daylight you could still miss the town completely
slow moving cuts of virgil working long strokes over amys body his hands gracefully lengthening and stretching her muscles
too much compute
bad chair you should think about a change
virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move that causes amy to release a very deep guttural sound
amy is now lost in another world as virgil shifts working gently not caressing but molding like a sculptor
a moment and amy surprisingly begins to cry softly
virgil stops takes a step back
i im sorry it was too deep
she cries for another few beats then takes a breath
its not you
its just things have kinda built up i dont know why im crying
look this is embarrassing
dont be embarrassed you obviously needed it
we should stop for today
you always make the girls cry
not since grade school
im going to go now unless youd like me to stay
could you just for a minute
of course whatever you need
virgil sits next to her then reaches out takes her hand and starts a slow comforting massage we see amy visibly relax
you ever feel like a martians invaded your entire body
amy closes her eyes smiling slightly in thanks
camera pans slowly over to amy asleep and on the click of the door her eyes dreamily open
hallway outside the massage area
amy exits the change room now wearing her sweats pulling on her sneakers
calling out hey caroline you look incredible today
laughing quite a compliment virgil
see ya tomorrow
amy looks down the hall sees a glimpse of virgil rounding the corner
she chases after hi n into the reception area where she sees him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway
hopping along tugging on her last sandal she decides to go after him fighting her way through a large tour group just checking in
virgil in the distance moving his way towards the main street
amy exiting the building trying not to slip on the ice as she hurries after him trying to get close enough to call out
virgil stops at a main roadway as amy comes up behind him
virgil turns sunglasses on looks directly at amy
its amy amy tremont
of course you were sleeping didnt want to wake you
yes thanks youre the skater right i saw you last night coming in
pretty mean slapshot
you play on some team or something
you a hockey fan

but i loved to skate as a kid unfortunately i have two left feet
playing with her they look perfectly ok with me
amy laughs starts relaxing unconsciously starts to flirt
head cocked shifts her weight on one foot moving slightly closer
i love the view you get here
same here i never get used to it
just then a yellow school bus pulls up in front of him and whoosh the doors pop open revealing carl kipling black a hundred years old
virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus
well this is my ride
hey tommy my man
and with his hand extended a kid high fives it
amy looks up a bus full of young school kids
as the kid moves off
well i just wanted to apologize for back there blubbering like that i was just in a weird place
now im fine so i wanted to thank you
for what you did
for making you cry
no i made me cry and you handled it great didnt freak or anything
beat is my mascara smeared or something
youre just looking at me funny
virgil lets move it
as i said earlier i just never get used to the view
virgil starts towards the bus reaching behind to his pack
pulls something out
see you tomorrow
and click click click a white cane unfolds in his hand
and he taps his way to the bus
oh my god
youre youre im so sorry
smile hey you already apologized once no need to overdo it
amy doesnt know how to respond
and he moves into the front seat of the bus amongst hey virgils from the school kids and ca chunk the doors close the yellow bus steaming off past amy
as she stares at virgil in the front seat about to wave to him then realizing he wouldnt see
as she turns and watches the bus move off down the street a hand comes out virgils and waves good bye
the bus stopping in front of virgils home a side by side duplex at the edge of surrounding woods
virgil steps into the street and with a honk the bus pulls away
he turns grazes his hand across a tree out front and starts towards his home
at the porch he hesitates at the first door
finds it with his hand then raps on it
he moves over to his own door and goes inside
as he enters sophie an aging lab lays on the couch
get of f the couch sophie
as the dog slides guiltily off the couch
some seeing eye dog more like sleeping eye dog
virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the remote control placed just so
click a game show pops on
met a girl today nice voice followed me out of the building
no she wasnt a stalker
close on virgils hand flipping open a large book marked tv hockey schedule its completely white all in braille
sophies just worried about you she watches too many horror movies
in the kitchen jennie anderson older than virgil simply dressed putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate
hey youre here so how are the kids today
running his hand down the pure white page he finds what he wants bap he hits the channel changer and the game comes on
the usual need a lot of attention
so whos the girl
moving into the kitchen virgil puts the remote to the side of the refrigerator where it velcro sticks to an exact spot
from the spa
i made her cry
you havent done that since grade school
smile thats what i told her
virgil moves past jennie as she goes into the living room hand up door open and hes got a glass
back to the fridge he grabs a coke
your dinners ready chickens at oclock rice is at
oclock peas at oclock and news at
jennie places virgils dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee table facing away from the tv
laughs one day im going to switch them on you
and one day ill play forward for the new york rangers
four precise steps into the room and virgil plops down on the sofa finds his fork
jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school books sit
you need new jokes
or a new sister
id work on the jokes
picking up the books she moves past virgil pecks him on the head and moves to the door
you want to watch some hockey
at the door you want to grade some spelling tests
beat ill be next door you need me
she leaves and virgil pats the couch and sophie hops up next to him
you know this girl for one moment she actually thought i could sophie grumbles as she settles in im not kidding
beat and she had this great voice relaxing soft like a breeze through beat wonder what she thinks about blind dates
amy in bed just out of the shower the only light in the room comes from the tv
she has the remote mindlessly switching channels not staying on one for more than a second or two
click an odd couple rerun click espn bowling click three stooges moe poking curly in the eye click click click
bored she stops notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed
she picks it up holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around her head
she stands hands out in front of her starts to walk across the room not so bad wham right into a side table
shit that hurts
grabbing her leg she hops hits a lamp
ripping the towel of f her head hopping around on one foot she hears coming
rubbing her leg she limps half walks to the door opens it to virgil dark glasses cane smile virgil
she pulls a towel in closer then realizes it doesnt matter my turn to apologize
i should have told you i was blind it wasnt fair
you want to come in i just got out of the shower give me a minute to get changed
as he moves in sure i promise i wont look
as amy starts to get changed in the bathroom
anyways i was in the neighborhood actually the whole towns my neighborhood and since youve never been to our illustrious village i thought maybe we could go into town see
what we see
see what we see
figure of speech you mean right now tonight
great im blind and youre deaf what a pair
a few store windows lit up
some people eating dinner at a streetside cafe
virgil holding amys arm as they walk down the street
the mechanic at the top of the street is doug smokes too much but a good guy
three steps down is carlsons hardware hes got a laugh like a donkey we sometimes listen to games together hes a devils fan
and just up ahead should be gradys junk shop he calls it antiques
smells like junk
id hate to see what it looks like a woman bustles past nancy bender weighed down with groceries
intuitively hey nancy
hey virgil got that book in for you
nancys our librarian brings in any braille book i want
to amy the guys nuts about the pyramids anything he can get his hands on
thank you nancy you should get your groceries home your ice creams melting
nancy laughs as she moves off
nice place you seem to know everyone here
moved here when i was eight
my family figured it would be a good place for me to grow up
tell me what you see
well theres a good structure to the town genuine lines good use of space
to be honest id find a better balance to a lot of these buildings
but thats me
the architect in me cant leave well enough alone
art school in college i made the arms for the venus demilo
realizing he probably doesnt understand see the venus de milo has no arms and
laughs i know the venus de milo has no arms and the mona lisa has this captivating smile and david doesnt wear a fig leaf
how do you
i may not have been a lot of places but i read about things then make an image up here points to his head that works for me
grazing his hand across a telephone pole virgil stops turns to amy
this is the end of the street
we should turn back
what about past the end of the street
whats out there
he turns around
no theres an old run down building off to the side
must be the old firehouse
it had a fire so they shut it down
amy laughs honest to god
intrigued what else do you see
a wall of shrubs a field with an interesting configuration of trees
the wind has picked up a bit
tell me how you see it
enjoying the game ok sure
lets see long and elegant
like like a woman dancing with two lovers trying to decide which one she loves
virgil stops a moment takes in the image
its just the image you just gave me dancing trees
i like that
virgil stops his head cocks slightly
we should go its starting to rain
looking around theres a bit of a breeze but kaboom thunder and the rain just drops
they run in laughing amy closing the door behind them as virgil moves his way into the center of the room stands where the moonlight from a high window hits
water runs down the outside glass causing the light to ripple across him
the room is empty almost surreal
i cant believe how fast it happens
she sees virgil his head cocked towards the ceiling virgil
virgils head turns toward her
you like rain i love the rain
moving to him what were you just doing there
virgil slowly moves his head about sensing the room
listening the rain it brings out the contours of everything gives life to a room i cant see
we see slow moving cuts of the building as virgil describes what he hears
you hear it
on the roof dripping down the walls on every side
on the right on the drainpipe its drumming with a deeper steadier sound like a timpani echoing across the room tells me the room is large open
you feel it in your chest
on the left the rain says
he listens a fire escape with its own rhythm ping ping
then listen there
he points whats that over there
looks like its
no listen for it not what it looks like what it becomes
amy moves closer virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders turns her to the sound
now just listen to it shut out everything but that sound do you hear it
amy strains to listen closes her eyes her head instinctively turning no in unison with virgils yes there its soft like a shimmer the wind blowing the rain against a
smile like a cymbal
its like our own percussive symphony isnt it
amy opens her eyes looks about the room listening
the world is invisible to me with my touch it comes alive
but only one thing at a time
but when its raining i feel everything at once
sometimes i wish it could rain inside rain all around us
einfuehlung its an architectural term
it means to share an empathy
been a long time since i felt that
and as they stand listening to the rain playing its music amy watches him fascinated by him then shivers slightly
youre cold we should go
no im fine really
it was just something passing through me cant explain it a good thing
amy smiles at him then quietly realizes he cant see it
she moves close her hand reaching out and taking his
what you just showed me
how i feel makes me smile
she takes his hand hesitates then puts it on the side of her face
i see it now
we hold a beat enjoying the symphony of rain then cut to the sun warming the cool morning air
the school bus pulling away to reveal virgil making his way into work
i thought after yesterday youd never get up on my table again
amy on the table
virgil squirting oil in his hand preparing
today im looking for a complete nervous breakdown
i love a challenge
and as he places his palms carefully on her back working her back slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background
virgils hands on the small of her back something amazingly sensual about how he works her muscles
amy speaks to him in low tones in a state of complete relaxation
can i ask how long youve been blind
of course most people avoid the subject
you tell them youre blind and they act surprised
i didnt know you hide it so well
and then they wave their hand in front of your face just to make sure
beat it started when i was a little over a year old
virgils hands move down amys sides slow feeling each contour the oil making her skin glisten
amy moves her head slightly with his touch
she lets out a small breath of air
quiet you see shadows
and a case of retinitis pigmentosa thrown in for good measure
this area needs to loosen up
i think youre doing it
beat no bright lights nothing
im blind as a bat
actually blinder cause they emit sonar all the time
i dont have a sixth sense i just dont have the fifth one
i cant hear things in vermont cant smell if youre mad at me and no i dont know helen keller ray charles or stevie wonder
amy murmurs in response to virgils touch
you say something
no i just this feels nice too nice
virgil moves his hands down her back sensually kneading each muscle
its clear hes enjoying this as much as she is
youre very good
at what you do
another breath exhales from her involuntarily as virgil hits a sensitive spot
you enjoy it
some clients make it more enjoyable than others
virgil now works down her thighs amys back arching slightly with the movement both of them heating to the moment
both their breaths quickening
and this client
is very very
ding and the spell is broken
sorry its time
ive got mr
ketchum coming in next all two hundred pounds
sorry i felt like we were just getting started
amy sits up on the table the sheet pulling away slightly revealing her
for a moment she watches him his head turned towards her but not seeing
then she slowly pulls the sheet up covering herself
for last night as well love to do it again
how about i cook dinner then tonight
id like that
aerobics step class
amy working out
in front of her two rather large women in neon stretch workout clothes amy tries to avoid the view a thought and she shuts her eyes as she continues her
amy towel around her neck coming in from the workout
tilt up to virgil cutting the last of it and putting it in the pan sizzling as it hits
vegetables and a box of pasta are arranged on the countertop
sophie watches the proceedings
rrrrinnng the phone
virgil stops cutting his hand easily finds the phone
amy on the phone in her car on the taconic parkway
virgil its amy
i i cant make dinner im really sorry an emergency came up theyre dragging me back to new york
the project we were working on was rejected could go down the drain
ill deal with it quick id like to come back
ill be here
virgil hangs up the phone frustrated he reaches for the frying pan and promptly burns his hand
dropping the pan sophie goes scurrying as he kicks at it sending it across the room
he turns thrusts his hand under the sink turning on the cold water
shit that was stupid
evening rush hour traffic surrounding the flatiron building
im just saying there seems to be something missing
a small cardboard model of what looks like a small mini mall
amy sits in front of it drawing on a sketch pad
the office is sparse functional
a few draftsmen can be seen in the background through a glass partition
falk something lj missing we realize that now
we just need some time to figure out what
duncan roswell s leaning a little too ardently into a speaker phone
the voice on the other end is jack falk their would be employer
their assistant betsy ernst early s sits in the corner taking notes
fine but you all know what kind of schedule were on here
watching amy and budget
dont worry we wont let you down
she takes a piece of paper has an idea starts sketching duncan hangs up
dont say it i know
you were never happy with the design
i wasnt going to say that
but youd have tinkered with it till the job went away
so now weve got him hooked youve got your second chance
and amy shoves her rough sketch across the table
look at these site photos see those trees we were going to get rid of them lets incorporate them into the design use whats natural about the location
duncan stares at her and by the way the rd st
lobby coming back from pinecrest i came up with a new addition add some life to that place
duncan stares at the sketch then looks up at amy ok whats going on here
we sent hydra the three headed monster off a few days ago and got back mary poppins in return
i cant have a couple of ideas
even betsy stares at her fine you want to know i met a guy
too modern for me
were all friends here
so spill the beans
nothing to spill hes a good guy smart funny blind
whoa whoa wait a minute blind
like tap tap white cane blind
come on amy i mean i know you like challenges hell you married me but
i knew youd be understanding
standing no no i am
youre right this is none of my business anymore but a blind guy
if youre lonely in my
opinion get a puppy
duncan dont be a jerk
you still work here
hes just jealous
so much for the were all friends here idea
close on computer screen
a cursor blinks then the words congenital blindness a click and a web page for the american braille institute comes up
wide we see amy hovering over her computer various sketches of the proposed building next to her two giant magnolia trees have been incorporated into the design
as we watch her search on the computer we move over her shoulder to see in the corner of her plans a sketch of the intertwined dancing trees and the
betsy enters carrying her jacket
everybodys gone for the day
you go ahead im just finishing up something here
she turns to look at betsy who now peers over her shoulder sees what shes doing
amy looks up at her sees betsys look
i just want to know a little more about whats wrong with him
friend to friend
shoot i hate to admit it but i agree with duncan on this one
back to the computer dont shoot
he makes sense sometimes
my father had a problem a few years back with severe cataracts
do you have any idea what youre getting into
amy spins in her chair looks to betsy
you ever listened to rain i mean really listened
this like that smell the roses thing
turns to her ive spent the last five years of my adult life with a man who has the emotional content of a soap dish
the only time i saw him cry was doing our tax return three years ago
beat i need more than that betsy
for once in a long long time i feel like i can breathe again
just the way he touches me i know i found someone i can connect with
ah here we go
i can tell hes sensing everything about me with a simple touch
he listens to my every word as if its the only sound on the planet i feel like even though he cant see me he knows everything about me
he just moves me does that sound crazy
beat does he have a brother
the frozen pond nestled against a strand of pine
virgil skates fast across the ice enjoying the speed the wind using his hockey stick as a guide he nears the edge of pond feels it with the stick and
slams to a stop
he shuffles his body around to face in the other direction then starts skating again passing amy standing on the snow covered bank
on amy smiling watching virgil enjoying his release of energy
her pov virgil skating well a look of relaxation weve never seen on his face
he skates in an arc coming back past amy
finally she speaks
wayne gretzky look out
virgil slams to a halt in surprise nearly toppling over
didnt mean to scare you
i said id come back
how long have you been
just got here couldnt find you at the spa took a chance youd be here
youre very good
skated since i was a kid
my dad taught me wanted me to play pro one day
how do you like my pond
describe it for me
like cool blue silk you know blue
i think so keep going
blue silk stretched tight across a bowl surrounded by white jacketed sentries of trees on the horizon protecting it from the outside world
horizons a tough one
never understood horizon if touch it dont know what it thats ok i liked the rest of picture
he starts moving towards her you want to skate
sorry i didnt bring my skates
dont need them
come on step hold of my stick
smile hockey stick
he holds the stick out like a cross bar
amy moves cautiously forward and takes hold of it
now hold on for balance
i used to do this with jennie when we were kids
and virgil starts skating backwards pulling amy with him
amy is apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement the sensation both of them laughing out loud
wide as we see them move about the rink amy sliding and being pulled by virgil
as he picks up speed we hear amy scream in delight
look out were running out of ice
virgil turns expertly arcing around the edge of the ice but amy loses her nerve and balance and lets go of the stick and goes flying into an embankment
the momentum carries virgil off down the ice both of them laughing hysterically
never been dumped so fast in my life
me dump you
stay where you are ill come to you just keep talking
amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment
what do i say
virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for amy
hearing her voice veering in her direction anything howd you become an architect
god lets see i was in college art school a little aimless and i met this guy
an architect opened up a new world to me
i liked the structure the control finding problems coming up with solutions when i graduated we started a company together on impulse got married which was crazy divorced a year
ago but were still partners
which must seem even crazier
and virgils suddenly there going a little too far tumbling off the pond and into her
youd think i meant to do that
a patented move
theyre close in the snow together face to face
amy smiles realizes this is tough
i bat my eyelashes toss my head just right and theres this very sexy thing i do with my eyes then realize none of it matters to you
it doesnt matter
tell me what you look like
dont know im
he puts his hand out over her face hesitates then slowly feels down the contours of her cheek her eyelids the shape of her lips amy moving with the touch
the sensuality of it and as he continues amys hand reaches up touching his face virgil smiles
eyes mouth chin cheek
you are very beautiful
so are you more than i could describe
virgils hands move down her face closing her eyes letting her just experience his touch his exploring
and as both their hands continue enjoying the sensation of discovering each other amy leans forward her eyes still closed finding his mouth grazing his lips with her own softly
gently then they fold into each others arms locked into a warm deep kiss
its dark a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked bodies
a fire burns in the background
in flowing cuts we see them make love virgil his head tilted down amy puts her hand to his chin lifts his head then kisses each of his closed eyelids
in rhythm with virgils movements
amy now astride virgil she closes her eyes feels it the way virgil would moving faster now in total rhythm shuddering in mutual release and she collapses on top of
him a deep breath and she rolls over cuddles into his arm
a long beat out of breath so thats what a blind date is
they breathe then both start laughing quietly then hysterically together as virgil wraps her up in his arms holding her tightly
the sun cresting it bringing a new light to the day
virgils home early morning sounds of a shower in the background
amy in virgils robe pulls a juice container out of the fridge pours herself a glass putting the juice on the counter as she walks into the living room taking
in the sparseness of his surroundings
close on an open braille book
the completely white pages with minute bumps
amy pulls up a chair sits and flips through the book running her hand across the pages trying to understand his world
she then turns to the front cover to see what it is
we hear the shower stop as amy smiles puts the book down pushes the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall virgil as a young
boy his sister jennie a few years older and his mother and father
then another picture next to it virgil in his skates and jennie older no father sophie at their feet
and a final picture virgil as an adult he and jennie on the front porch his arms wrapped around his sister like hes never going to let go
amy turns to see jennie carrying a bag under her arm
jennie moves towards the kitchen
im jennie virgils sister
and you are
virgil steps out bathrobe drying his hair
jen this is amy tremont
jennie now at the kitchen stares at the juice container places it back in the fridge just so
i was just at the market virgil picking up a few things before school and i thought you might like some
smells apples and bananas
amy sees the fruit on the counter impressed
hes being a show off amy i always bring him these
putting them in the fridge the apples are on the bottom shelf
at two oclock
i know thanks
amy you in town long
and wham virgil moving into the room collides right into the chair amy moved knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground
jennie immediately rushes over
no youre not youre bleeding
turning to amy sudden first lesson with a blind man amy dont change anything its too dangerous moving to virgil im sorry i didnt know
it was my fault
jennie still dabbing at his leg
embarassed snaps goddamit jennie i said i was ok leave me alone
jennie hesitates then stands to go sees the hockey book out of place
a glance to amy and she picks it up quietly moves it back to its rightful spot
ive got parent meetings tonight theres dinner in the freezer left corner
turns to amy nice to have met you amy
me too and again im sorry
and shes gone leaving amy and virgil together a moment of awkwardness
she seemed jealous
your leg is still bleeding
itll stop happens all the time
welcome to my world
we hold on amy taking this in japanese lanterns criss cross across an open area
guests of the spa mingle about drinks in hand some dance on a floor set up over the aerobics area
music plays in the background
amy carrying two trays of food finds her way to where virgil sits at a table off to the side putting his food in front of him
lets see if i can get this right
chickens at three salad at seven vegetables at ten
picking up his fork very good thank you
this is nice
they do this every weekend
every friday for the guests leaving
supposed to make them want to come back
sits uneasy love the music gershwin makes you want to
virgil fork poised over his food senses her uncomfortableness
you like dancing
yeah dont do it much
changing subject chickens good
amy resumes eating virgils fork spears something on his plate raising it to his mouth both we and amy now see its a large pat of butter
too late its in his mouth
amy watches him the reaction on his face as he tastes it then surreptitiously swallows it
then realizes amy saw him
nothing like a good pat of fat
what do you say we dance
no really im fine
virgil is up pulling her hand
come on she stands and virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders
and as she ushers him to the floor the music changes a salsa lively
amy stops different piece maybe we should
you kidding take my hand
and as she does virgil starts dancing to the music feeling the beat in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own something weve never seen before uninhibited wild a
little funny but also theres something sensual in his abandonment
all amy can do is hang on for the ride enjoying virgil enjoying himself
people even clear back a little to give him some room however he moves about the floor easily somehow sensing where the other couples are
its a whirlwind moment a moment where the two of them get lost with each other for a second shutting out the world and its just them the music and
then suddenly the music is over
and they stop the moment gone
virgil turns to amy and she applauds virgils wild moves he takes a bow with a flourish
spins to another angle another bow
spins back again a step back and crasssh hes into the buffet table sliding to the ground food spilling on top of him
amy cant help but laugh rushes to him
you have to teach me that move
and amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand and pulls him up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing we see amy on the
phone looking out her window
betsy you were telling me about your father his cataracts you said he had a problem
how is he now
she listens doctor dr
do you have his number
a handful of people on various pieces of equipment
virgil tank top heavy sweat on a stationary bicycle working out
amy next to him on a treadmill trying to keep up as caroline from the front desk comes and hands her something
amy reads it briefly then hops off the treadmill moving to virgil
virgil i just got some great news
picking up speed again the atlanta project
no no i was talking to my assistant this morning her father had these severe cataracts
she put me in touch with a dr
richard aaron the guys the leading eye surgeon on the eastern seaboard hes been working with techniques i dont know all the jargon but i spoke to him earlier on
the phone at the institute
you called this guy
virgil stops riding starts to get off the bike
excited i told him all about you he just faxed me back hed love to get a look at your eyes he thinks maybe mavbe there might be a chance
virgil faces amy best he can while he pulls on his sweat jacket
i dont get it am i missing the sign that says its help the handicapped week
virgil starts to move away
amy stops him
i thought youd be excited
whats the problem
virgil turns on her
thats the whole point here amy there is no goddamned problem
and virgil turns and bumps into a stationary bike he shoves it off to the side and makes his way out of the gym
virgil enters visibly upset passing a co worker coming out of the shower
virgil steams right past him not answering hands feeling down the lockers finding his he tugs it open pulls off his shirt and throws it in
he takes a breath settles himself then slams the locker door shut
parents are picking up their children from jennies school
as jennie helps the last of the kids into her mothers car she looks up to see amy across the street
amy nods starts towards her
id like to talk to you if i could about virgil
theres something i dont understand
you see i spoke to a doctor whos apparently doing breakthrough work on cataracts jennie turns to amy but when i brought it up to virgil he acted as if
what dont you understand
if i was blind almost all my life and there was even a remote possibility i could see id jump at it
when theres something youve adapted to accepted youd just want to change it without even thinking about it
beat were very comfortable here amy
virgil has everything he needs
i thought just maybe hed like to not be falling over things for the rest of his life
look i see
cuts her off yes you do and virgil doesnt
he spent the first eight years of his life having his eyes prodded pierced and poked by doctors faith healers spiritualists shamans and medicine men
my father had them lined up out the door
it hurt and disappointed us all and it almost killed him
he doesnt need to go through that again
now maybe you understand
and she turns on her heel and is gone
amy making her way up to the porch hearing from inside
no no why why
she hurries up the steps reaching the open door where she sees virgil his head in his hands
i cant believe youre doing this to me
virgil turns sharply sophie jumps up starts barking
sophie stop it
cmon in its just the rangers
i could check better than these guys today
i prefer to think of it as not winning
i thought you would have been long gone after that outburst from my evil twin brother
weve had him committed you know
rikers island hard time
standing can i get you something coke beer
no i im fine
i just wanted apologize for stomping around in life like bigfoot today
virgil turns towards amy
amy you see the big tree outside
how far is it from my front porch
guessing about thirty feet
but to me its fourteen steps exactly
fourteen steps and i arrive right where i want to be
but if i run or rush ill lose count and slam into it
told you cant leave well enough alone
i i guess i should get back start to pack
rushing into trees again
off amys smile we cut to on the porch the two of them sipping glasses of wine we see their dinner hungry man beef entree each category of food in
its own perfect little compartment
you know this dinner this is really quite
she laughs its an acquired taste trust me
jennie thinks its the only way ill know where my food is
but i have a secret weapon
holds up a little bottle hot sauce
lets you know youre eating something like some
he starts to sprinkle liberally on amys food
amy laughing grabs the bottle
thats ok ill do it
dont want to overdo it
she puts the bottle down looks to virgil sips her wine
time to face it
virgil i have to go home tomorrow
wait wait you smell that
the winter pines its so strong at night drifts on the wind wait hear the breeze then
amy closes her eyes takes in the scent and they both sit there close taking in the night air enjoying the moment
and on virgils face we see him lost in thought
close on virgil eyes closed we hear a sound like night crickets
his eyes slowly open
he rolls over his arm reaching out for her but theres no one there
virgil sits upright
amy is sitting in a chair by the window
im here trouble sleeping
and she crawls back into bed virgil takes hold of her and as she settles into his arm he strokes her face gently a blind mans version of watching his
lover fall to sleep
black then we hear voices close on amys face the voices awaken her cutting into her dreams
she looks out the doorway sees virgil and jenny arguing on the front porch
she cant hear what they are saying but its clear theres a problem
amy pulling a robe around herself comes into the room as jenny turns on her heel and walks away from virgil
virgil stands there a moment taking in what just happened
amy steps out onto the porch
morning look something i want to say
the leaving thing i know hate it too
the other night when we were dancing being with you i felt different special i dont know whole
that was whole
virgil puts his hand out she takes it he turns to her
smile just for a second i felt like i could see you all of you
beat what you said about this doctor this eye guy i know how important it is to you
turns to him are you sure you want to do this
were just going to talk to the guy what could it hurt
off amys smile a soaring shot
amys car travelling across the bridge heading towards manhattan
youre going to love the city so many things to see
virgil in the passenger seat windows open taking in all the sounds new and exciting
amy watches him as she drives
laughing waitwaitwait he hasnt said he can even do anything yet
i know i just feel good about this
amy looks to him sees him feeling the light against his face virgil before you lost all sight do you remember seeing anything at all
yeah i do
i was just a baby when it happened but there is one thing
thats all i remember about it
everyone says its clouds but i know i had it in my hands so it couldnt be clouds
this puffy thing that was something special its stayed with me all these years i dont know why
richard aaron wire rims short stylish haircut is finishing a high tech examination of virgils eyes
cups attached to wires sit over his eyes
the machine an electroretinogram emits an irritating strange flat line sound
the room is very dimly lit
aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine a series of flashing lights hit virgils eyes
the doctor jots down a reading then with a flourish spins the machine away from virgils face and pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out
in the corner sits an older gentleman dr
goldman focused on papers in his hands
ok were done
aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to virgil as amy moves to join them
some good news
you have grade posterior subscapular cataracts
and this is the good news
good news in that i should be able to remove them with little or no damage to your cornea
so what does that mean theyre gone then what
the cataracts are acting like a curtain covering the window of sight
if the disease to the retina is reduced as much as i think it is theres a very good possibility we can give you sight
amy looks to virgil apprehensive
virgils expressionless taking this all in
looks to goldman who nods imperceptibly we feel theres an opportunity for us all here i think i can get the institute to pick up the bill
say you remove the cataracts do you have any idea what kind of vision id have
aaron looks to goldman
at this time no
unfortunately the cataracts are not allowing me to see the retinal wall
i cant tell how advanced the retinitas pigmentosa has become
so youre suggesting an operation that may or may not be successful
but there is a chance he could regain his sight
there have been a few cases of restored vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth
moves near virgil the operation is delicate ill admit but nothing as invasive as what you went through as a child
of course there is always some risks with any operation infection swelling long shot stuff
i would do both eyes at the same time its basically out patient surgery
virgil an exhale of air
a lot to take in
what if it doesnt work
what if i have the operation with all its risks and you remove the cataract and it doesnt work
aaron looks to amy
somber it would be evident that you will never be able to see
virgils head shifts slightly
not what he wanted to hear
amy reaches out takes his hand
what do you think
thats what i need to think
virgil and amy stepping out of a cab
virgil using his cane seems blinder than weve seen him before
the city sounds an assault on him
this is my place theres a park across the street and
she stops realizes he wants to walk in silence
they enter her loft building an old converted industrial space
there is an odd loud sound which echoes three times after every bounce
as they come up on the second floor landing a basketball comes flying down the hall which amy fumbles with then catches
from around the corner comes ethan colvin eight oversized knicks shirt
amy tosses him his ball
sorry my mom wont let me go outside till she gets home from work
well if the super catches you playing ball in the hall hell have a coronary
ethan this is my friend virgil
hey ethan seeing his cane are you blind
and he turns and runs back up the stairs
hey the kid thinks im cool whats so bad
amys loft is a wide open space a kitchen facing onto a small living area a bed in the corner of the room a work space with drafting board and
drawing racks fill one side of the room
by a window stands a plaster sculpture stuck in the corner as if forgotten
this is where i hang my hat its a bit of a mess but
amy stops realizes he cant see it
virgil puts his overnight bag down
help me out with a mental map
walk me down a straight line and show me your place all the obstacles
remember once youve told me they cant be moved otherwise
got it here take my arm
they start about the room couch chair tv to the left low table at
at oclock has the phone on it
they come to the sculpture virgils hand grazes across it
my art school days not very good
virgil continues to feel the sculpture from top to bottom not stopping during the dialogue
its a mother
holding her child up in the air like shes proud
its not done yet one day ill finish it
virgil turns his hand to the wall feels a window does this window open
i could use some air
moving to the windows i think so
as amy throws open the window a wind blasts through catching a stack of plans on her drafting table blowing them across the floor
virgil turns concerned makes his way to her
the wind knocked over my plans
amy down on the floor picking them up virgil senses her down there crouches down beside her tries to help her pick up
what is this these plans
amy looks at virgil his hand running across one of her plans
just my work some plans for the atlanta project were bidding on drawings of a lobby were finishing up some other smaller stuff
its its what i do
amy realizes they mean nothing to him he hands them back stands
she watches him then standing moves to him
ive got to get to work
tonight well do something we could listen to music or go out for dinner
how about a movie
i havent been in years
i wont be long
and amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door a beat she forgets her purse steps back in to see virgil standing there quietly his hand out
on her plans again feeling the paper searching for the design wanting to know her wanting to understand her finding nothing there
amy feels uncomfortable quietly steps out closes the door
wide the theater half full playing woody allens annie hall the very funny scene where woody and diane keaton wrestle with the lobster
we move in slowly and discover virgil and amy leaning in close to each other amy quietly describing the scene to him
theres these big pots and woodys got a huge lobster in his hand
lobster whats a lobster
trying not to use her hands to describe its a
kind of like
then she looks to virgil sees he was kidding her
laughing thats it youre on your own
off virgils laugh bwam a subway train explodes past us
a collection of typical night riders everyone keeping to themselves
two kids sit in the corner blasting their boom box virgil stands in the middle of the train enjoying the vibrations
amy sits on a seat watching him
and they lived happily ever after
woody and diane
and the lobster
stop with the lobster
a song comes on the radio virgils head turns
hey you here that
all she hears is the clatter of the subway
virgil turns towards the music bapping his hands rhythmically on the subway car wall
hey can you turn that up
the kid shrugs crakks it up
its gershwins cant take that away from me
virgil turns to amy picks up on the song hands rapping he starts singing the way you comb your hair the way you sip your tea
he finds amy pulls her up and into an embrace as he saunters them down the aisle
loudly cant take that away from meee what
people are watching
everyone is staring at us
well it can be embarrassing
kidding oh i see
no you dont
the way you make me see
turns to him what do you mean
virgil gives her a look i want the operation you mean it
i mean i only want you to have the operation
i want the chance to see
the chance to see central park the brooklyn bridge apples raisins a buffalo a carbuerator and the man in the moon
beat but i would give all that up just to see this face
and amy folds herself into virgil a moment they hold each other then amy starts to sing along with the song virgil joining in and they dance together in love
you cant take that away from me
and the car explodes past again and as the music dies we cut to close on a platter of silver utensils fine exacting scalpels
a gloved hand comes into frame picks up a clamp and we follow it to virgils eyes the clamp being used to hold it open
the work we are seeing is grueling difficult to watch but at the same time so fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off
aaron followed by dr
goldman hands in the air mask on leans over virgil looks to the anesthesiologist who nods then to no one in particular
ok virgil lets get to it
and as he is handed a scalpel we watch as it moves down to cut open the white section of the eye and just as it feels almost unbearable to
watch we see amy coffee cup in hand grab a second just poured cup out of a vending machine
she makes her way over to reveal jennie who sits quietly reading a book
its really bad
jennie looks up smiles takes the cup
amy sits down next to her
they both sip for a moment
virgil never mentions his parents do they know
our mother died when i was virgil wasnt even a teenager
and our father hes been gone for quite awhile
i didnt know
jennie looks into her coffee takes another sip
smile youre right this is bad
it must have been very tough on you taking care of virgil alone after your mother died
hes my brother
you dont like virgil doing this do you
i dont like virgil getting hurt
hope is like fire it can keep you warm or it can burn you
aaron focused on his exacting work
his hands move deftly
close on virgils eye
aarons probe working right in the middle of it
there you are
and aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue holding it up for all to see before he plops it on a tray
switching instruments he gingerly picks up a plastic implant moving back towards the eye he glances at the nurse assisting him you know what they say virgil
the eyes are the windows to the soul
virgil cant move listens intently as he carefully places the implant into virgils eye
with a wink that makes us the windex to the soul
he focuses ok both eyes done
lets patch him up
on a large monitor we see an extreme close up of virgils eye waiting
virgil being wheeled down a hall head wrapped in bandages
as he enters hello
jennies there takes his hand
howre you feeling
ok a little pain like a tequila hang over is amy here
right here dr
aaron said you did great so hows my hair id hate the first time i see myself to be a bad hair day
virgil reacts to a sound whats that
theres camera guys here too
wide we now see the room has a small video crew in it preparing to document the event
entering for posterity
were going to make you famous
were also sending this closed circuit to one of our conference rooms theres a lot of people interested in our results today
so how you feel virgil
a laugh nervous
aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats of light
nothing to be nervous about
now jennie and amy if you would stand off to my right i want virgil to get just a slight bounce of light
returning to virgil ready virgil
both amy and jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as aaron starts to unravel the bandages
when the bandages are completely off all that is left are two gauze patches on both eyes
okay last phase we remove these patches and
suddenly apprehensive hand up okay wait
so so what do i do
i mean what will i see first
well were all here amy your sister
this is new for us all
why dont we find out
aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes and everyone waits
virgil slowly opens his eyes he just seems to be staring blankly bewildered not focusing at aaron who stands before him still holding the bandages
amy looks to jennie to aaron whats happening
then finally well
and virgil reacts a startling look of recognition mixed with fear crossing his face
what is it virgil
its its i dont know
and now for the first time we see virgils pov there is light movement color shadow but somehow it is foreign to us
there is no perception of depth
no sense of definition of shape or shadow it is as confounding to us as it is to virgil like an explosion of picasso dali and monet on screen
suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images there is movement and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as a mouth
aaron speaks again leaning in to virgil who reacts back
virgil what do you see
jennies reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears first slowly then a dam break
virgil whats wrong
everythings fine its going to take
its not fine dont say its fine
tell me what youre seeing virgil
virgil suddenly pulling back his eyes dancing around in his head trying to take it all in trying to focus
over everyone i dont know its all screwed up this cant be seeing somethings wrong too confusing what the hells happening
his pov the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot its like a giant monster violently moving towards us
what is it stop
virgils hand lashes out towards the camera crew even though they are feet away
to the crew stop moving
virgil its just the camera
the room has heightened into chaos virgil reacting to everything he sees any quick movement amy moves next to him aaron trying to remain calm jennie assuring virgil everythings ok
alright alright theyve stopped
lets everybody just calm down well take it slowly
everyone settles takes a breath
what can we do
they all look to virgil breathing heavy his eyes swinging back and forth
i gotta focus gotta think gimme a second ok ok get me a coke
hes thirsty someone get him a drink
no just a can a bottle put something in my hands
amy reaches over grabs an empty coke can
here hows this
virgil takes it in his hands closes his eyes feels it
then slowly opens his eyes trying to focus on what is in his hand aaron catching on
good virgil thats it use your touch associate now tell me what do you see in your hand
virgil holds it up stares hard
is it a can
whats going on
they all look at virgil turning the can over and over in his hand staring intently at it learning it
beams hes associating one sense to the other
his fingers tell his brain then his brain tells his eyes and he recognizes the image in front of him
realizing hes seeing
aaron looks to amy and jennie theyre still doubtful he motions to them to meet him outside
virgil lets rest your eyes for today and well check them again tomorrow
we should all be happy weve got something
virgil not happy just very confused
as aaron leaves jennie takes virgils hand while amy stands there upset watching him just staring at a soda can
in the corridor dr
aaron shaking hands with dr
goldman people exiting the near by conference room all congratulating the two doctors
as amy exits the room aaron moves to her
what just happened in there
you saw it
success wait a minute then why cant he see me his sister anything
he sees you
he just doesnt understand that he sees you
but hell overcome it i mean this is temporary right
theres a very real possibility the part of his brain area allocated to vision is atrophied given its lack of use virgil has probably used it for some other function
jennie has stepped into the waiting area has just heard aaron
you didnt think of this
this is as much an accusation of amy as of aaron
we had no way of knowing what his faculties were until we gave him the operation
if you remember we didnt know what to expect though its clear his retinal disease must be in remission
so what are we supposed to do now you saw him its like hes another person in there
he wont need to stay here take him home let him rest
but i will need to see him every couple of days for the next month
isnt there some kind of therapy he should be doing someone to help him
aaron stares at her hadnt thought of this
ok there is a visual therapist ray webster a little unorthodox thats why hes probably your best bet especially considering the unique aspects of virgils condition
ill contact him for you but theres no guarantee he can help
cant believe this no guarantees
jennie i told amy here when we first talked this is whole new ground for all of us
and jennie quietly turns and goes back into virgils room
amy just stares at dr
aaron a little overwhelmed
virgil starting to dress
he stares at his clothes on a hangar not comprehending what it is
he closes his eyes his hand going out to feel it then opening his eyes he takes the shirt turns and notices someone watching him
his pov its his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes
virgil stares at himself standing stock still waiting for a response from the person staring at him
slowly realizing that what he sees is himself
he starts moving towards the mirror fascinated
virgils pov focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape becomes clearer to him
his hand going up to his nose moving it back and forth laughs at its absurdity then is taken with his own smile
he tries a smile comes off awkward as he starts to stare at his teeth
touching each part of his face he investigates his chin ears and finally his hair
then he stops and just stares and stares at a face that is his own but so incredibly foreign to him
who is this person
jenny starting to pack up virgils things
suddenly there is a burst of laughter from the other room
she looks up quizzically amy in the check in area pacing on a cellphone
duncan i know the additions to the mall will cost more
look i cant do this on the phone ill be in tomorrow
yes i remembered theyre putting the fixtures in the lobby ill get there as well im just asking for one more day
jenny finishing packing up virgils things
jenny looks up virgil standing in the doorway dressed
no its jennie
she moves toward him virgil pulls back hands out in front of him
im sorry ill move slower i just
and virgils hands are on her face eyes closed feeling
he opens his eyes staring blankly trying to figure this out
this is you
this is me
angle on amy moving down the hall hearing the voices
everythings going to be alright we just need to get you home
no no i cant go home
i need to be here see the therapist doctors
i want to be here
but i cant stay here and you cant do this alone whos going to take care
angle on amy outside the door not wanting to go in
shes going to look after you
she doesnt know anything about the blind
im not blind anymore and im not going to let someone i care about walk out of my life again
moves to him its not your fault he left
you cant keep blaming yourself
beat im staying here
a pause and jennie moves her hand out to him touches his arm
amy feeling uncomfortable starts to step away
amy turns jennie in the doorway
virgils finishing getting ready
could you walk me to my car
amy nods sees an element of defeat in jennies eyes
jennie and amy stand on the curb near jennies car
a moment of uncomfortableness then you alright
im scared to death
ive spent my whole life looking for any holes he might fall in
id run up ahead and cover them
everywhere i look here i see holes
please believe me i dont want him to get hurt anymore than you do
amy when virgil was very young he couldnt see those close to him so he never learned to reach out
turns to her dont expect him to reach out when hes in pain or confused or unhappy
if you really care about him you have to just be there for him
and before amy can answer she gets into her car starts it up and drives off
virgil slowly gets out of the cab looks up at the buildings immediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over
amy lunges to help him
virgil is laughing in spite of himself
this is just great i dont believe this
whats that saying stop the world i wanna get off
hey virgil its ethan
virgil turns to the familiar voice
ethan basketball under his arm coming out of the building with his mom karen colvin
virgil scans tries to focus on them
that you ethan
its me and this is my mom
hi virgil heard a lot about you
you look funny
you should see how i look from this side
amy lets just get you inside then you can rest
well see you later ethan
and she gives karen a small glance as she takes virgils arm as they start towards the stairs leading into the building virgil suddenly slamming to a halt
wait wait what are we doing virgils pov the staircase
a flat image a solid wall with horizontal lines
ethan surprised whats up here
its ok its not a wall its just a staircase
youre going to have to trust me on these things
god i feel like
like such a child i just thought seeing would be different
well get a hold of this ray webster guy well get his help
virgil steps slowly forward giant baby steps each foot reaching out to feel the step before making the commitment
his pov the wall of stairs changing perspective with each step
like an accordion spreading itself out to us
this is all a very bad acid trip
virgils pov multi colored balloons dozens of assorted flowers bowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room
a candyland of seeing
something exploded in your apartment
amy laughs pulls him into the room
virgil trying to take it all in not understanding anything
i wanted to do something special for you
its making me a little bit dizzy but it is special
virgils hands go out amy moves to him he holds her shoulders
he stares at her
as she turns her head slightly virgil is able to focus on her her eyes her smile
okay so this is what beautiful looks like
you want to see the rest
focusing on her virgil smiles takes her face in his hands leans in and kisses her
she pulls back a little
i cant believe this how nervous i am
she kisses him then takes a step back
what if you dont like what you see
do you want me to turn off the lights
this is your first seeing day
she starts to unbutton her dress i want you to see everything
and she drops the dress from her shoulders it hits the ground a beat and she stands there naked
yes very ok
and she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they kiss we slowly fade to black
the sound of heavy new york rain
amy awakening and sees virgil is gone his side of the bed empty
she looks across the room where she sees silhouetted against the moonlit window virgil standing next to amys sculpture his face and body pressed up against the pane of glass
wrapping a house coat around her virgil
virgil turns around half faces her the rain on the windows decorating his face
i cant sleep im afraid if i close my eyes
itll be black when you open them again
a moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture
you enjoy sculpting
i liked the idea of molding taking the way i saw things up here touching her head and making it take shape with my hands
but you never finish them
pieces never come out the way i wanted the way i saw them
i end up working on them forever like this one never getting them right
virgil stares out the window at the rain
this is what rain looks like
it looks lonely
not what i expected
but i like it
amy smiles moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look out at the night rain
amy working over a cad computer with draftsman
youve got to alter each of the windows by five feet
these are the specs you gave me
i know im changing them this is better
calling out betsy
betsy pokes her head in
can you get me some research on those maple trees were leaving in
theyre too big i want to change them so they fit in with the design better
get rid of the dead weight
dont you have an appointment
amy looks to her watch
starts for her jacket and the door
evan here will print out the new specs give them to duncan tell him ill be back in two hours
duncan steps out of his office
she turns virtually out the door
just give me two hours
and shes gone
a few kids smoking on the steps
others entering laden down with books a small sea parting to allow amy helping virgil up the steps and inside
they make their way down the hall past a room where a group of blind children learn to read braille
amy cant help but stare at these young faces struggling to learn
its a whole different world
a strange space dark as all the windows are covered
in a jar on the desk two pickled eyeballs stare back at virgil and amy waiting patiently
there are books everywhere periodicals stacked and overflowing on shelves
a dead plant in the corner
ray webster s almost completely bald wearing a worn nyu sweatshirt sits at the desk in front of them flipping through a file in front of him
right ok virgil says here you went blind at one before you developed a visual vocabulary
webster stands moves towards a bookshelf you have no sense of depth of field no knowledge of space shape size or distance
basically your eyes work but your brain hasnt learned to process the information
beat you are mentallv blind
neurologists call this visual agnosia
i call it pretty screwed up
ill make a note of that
webster plops down a large book flips through some pages then searching his pockets dammit what
glasses can never find em
calling out mrs
fenster pops her head in the door this must be a ritual they have as she instantly pulls her glasses off and hands them to webster who drops them over
they are clearly womans glasses pointed in the ends little jewels
referring to the book ok
alberto valvo sight restoration after long term blindness blah blah blah
reading one must die as a blind person to be born again as a sighted person
however it is the interim the limbo between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born that is so terrible
slamming the book shut there
youre in limbo
what do you mean there hes in limbo
thats all you have to offer
im anne bancroft all of a sudden
im a professor i teach people how to teach the blind how to become independent
beat theres no book on what youre going through id like to help but like the rest of things in life its up to you
wait a minute up to me
i thought you were going to help me here
webster rummages in his desk pulls out a magazine photo then digging in a brown paper bag he pulls out an apple
you want a lesson
he holds out the apple for virgil who reluctantly takes it holds it in his hand eyes closed feels it then opening his eyes he holds it out in front
of him trying to focus on it
his pov as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape
its an apple
holding up the photo ok
whats this now
virgil stares at the photo
his pov a photo of an apple
not that different from the real apple he holds in his hand he holds the real apple up to compare using his eyes
its an apple
holding the paper out to virgil good
but is it an apple or just a picture of an apple
and virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes its not an apple just a representation of one
virgil is visibly disappointed
so this is a joke
is that what youre saying your eyes lie to you
great looking forward to this
your eyesight can and will play tricks on you virgil
no matter what i could teach you no matter what exercises i could give you theyll still play tricks on you
thats all it is right now one big trick
nothing makes any sense
i cant function like this
he moves to his chair virgil look you have to learn to see just like you learned to speak
only this is not like learning a new language its like learning language for the first time
he leans forward perception sight life is about experience about reaching out and exploring the world for yourself
its not enough to just see virgil he points two fingers into his eyes weve got to look as well
and webster turns the fingers from his eyes outward to the world
wound up well thank you obi wan kenobi but that doesnt tell us anything
what we need is some assistance here some kind of program a set of exercises were kind of adrift and
amy last i checked this isnt a game of parcheesi it doesnt come with a set of rules
i cant believe youre just
no wait virgil
standing thank you dr
you want me im always here
and virgil turns and half steps half shuffles towards the door
we hold on amys befuddled face then virgil feels his way down the steps amy rushing out after him
im going to call aaron get him to recommend someone else
hes right amy
ive got to do this on my own
no one taught you how to see
virgil starts walking stiffly towards the street
amy hurries after him grabs him just as he was about to step into traffic
i was a baby then i had years to learn you dont you need to
anxious we dont even know what to do where to start
virgils hand goes out brushes a mailbox
whats this this thing
amy looks over
shrugs what its a mailbox
what color is it
virgil stares at it tries to take it in
ok good thats a mailbox its blue
there weve started
she says nothing
virgil senses her apprehension
amy lets just get a cab get you home and tonight we can work on it
hand out cab
a cab veers across traffic pulls up to them
i want to walk
i want to see whats out there
dont you have a job
im going to make time for this
go to work
if i need you i have your number
a beat she looks to virgil then climbs into the cab and it pulls away
virgil looks left right trying to decide where to start his journey when we see the cab back up in front of him and amy climbs out
screw work lets go try those eyes
aaron at a podium
the room filled with colleagues
a newscrew records the lecture from the back of the hall
now just two weeks after surgery the patient is still having difficulty understanding images shapes contours virgil determined to see making his way down a street trying to dodge people
coming at him from all angles
amy walks a short distance behind him coaxing him along
his pov people seem to explode out of two dimensions into three
this is clearly exhausting
and his progress with depth of field has been especially slow
wham virgil collides with a kid on a skateboard amy winces as he quickly regains his balance shakes it off starts his journey again determined
amy trying to help virgil take in the confusion of images explaining to him items hanging about the stalls
its clear hes a little overwhelmed when something familiar catches his eye
he moves toward it his pov focusing trying to give it shape its a yellow cab just like the one amy drove off in again he focuses reaches out surprisingly
wrapping his hand around the car
virgil is still very reliant on his touch to interpret objects in his surroundings he then realizes its a porcelain toy from a souvenir shop
amy watches him examine it like a child as we hear and his understanding of three dimensionality is extremely limited and confounding to him
virgil his hands all over a small long haired terrier
he looks to amy as he stands
its a dog
amy on her cellphone trying to get work done nods yes thats a dog
virgil looks back at the pup which has now turned around backwards
now whats that
on amy disturbed by his slow progress
amy and virgil being led through a series of plants and trees by a i believe we have just the tree youre looking for your lobby
needs very little light slow growing ah here we are
amy and virgil stop at a large ficus tree
what do you think virgil
he is also still having great difficulty scanning basically putting a whole picture together
virgil stares at the large tree
up down up down up down up down amy and the saleswoman watch him amy wants to help but cant comprehend what hes going through
if he looks at the top of a tree then scans to the bottom hes forgotten the top by the time he reaches the trunk
angle on virgil in amys office staring at a construction sign future home of etc
using his finger to outline the letters of the sign he tries to read the word future
he mouths the letters tries to form the word
this includes the ability to read
in reading a word he forgets the first letter by the time he gets to the last
amy working with a draftsman glances up to see virgil struggling with reading
bathed in a bank of lights aaron at the podium continuing
virgil quiet is seated behind him
he has a total lack of visual memory
this is an unexpected physiological flaw
we are hopeful virgil can overcome this
beat thank you thats all for today
virgil and amy exit the hall are immediately surrounded by reporters and photographers
theres a sudden flash
virgil reacts pulling away
a camera its ok taking your picture
what by flashing me in the face
flash theres another amy tries to block the light
its not good for him
suddenly theres a mike in his face as christie evans reporter from channel news steps forward with camera crew in tow
christie evans eyewitness news
we heard the doctor speak about your progress and were wondering what your expectations are
as virgil stops stunned by the lights in his face
as he looks to amy we cut to tv monitor virgil turns to camera starts talking to the reporter
as we pull back we hear less and less as we reveal a modest living room
a teenager doing homework on a table in the corner and a man early s rugged sitting on a couch watching the news
oh my god
he leans forward his interest piqued and he picks up the phone
for a jennie anderson
a silver fork held up in front of us
virgil and amy sit on the patio of la mela
virgils hand goes out for the fork
amy pulls it away
uh uh uh
see it first
virgil stares hard at it
guessing a pen
i dont know let me touch it
she hands it to him
now put it down in front of you
how far is it from
twenty feet youre not looking
dammit amy amy i spent all day in front of that panel feeling like a guinea pig
every time i open my eyes i have to look
can we just sit and have dinner for once
amy just stares
its clear theyre both tired
im just trying to help you see
but thats all it seems were about
how was your day what goes on at work how about those rangers did the stock market hold today is there anything else going on in our world besides my
beat ok weve been invited to a party duncans birthday
an italian waiter appears putting a large plate of spaghetti in front of virgil and amy
virgil is a little repulsed by what he sees
whats this looks like worms
its spaghetti its fine
as virgil tries to maneuver his fork amy reaches behind her
i brought you a present good for hand eye coordination
she hands him a toys r us bag
he peers inside
great you go to work building buildings i go home with building blocks
amy looking a little worn staring blankly at her computer
a three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen
duncan pokes his head in
im here for you to wish me happy birthday
hows it going
hes progressing slowly doing the best he can
i was actually wondering about the mall designs
were expected in atlanta tomorrow with these plans
i cant go to atlanta tomorrow not with virgils problems
ok ok duncan moves in behind her im sorry
things arent going so well
stares at her work he seems blinder now than he ever was
duncan puts his hands on her shoulders starts to knead them
amy starts to relax
do you ever wonder why you do the things you do
didnt get what you expected did you
sometimes i think hes not going to make it that hes never going to be able to see
amy listen to me
you liked this guy i saw that
you wanted to help him it didnt work out so hot
you cant punish yourself
sometimes things just dont work out the way we want them to look at us
amy smiles warmly
beat a joke now back to work
as he starts out of the room amy turns stops him
hey happy birthday
virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen utensils being held by ethan
ethan shakes his head no its a cheese grater
virgil stares again
ethan mimes grating cheese
yes my man
ethan holds up something new one of those strange spaghetti strainers
now they are both staring at something they dont understand
virgil looks to ethan
laughing youre no help
how am i supposed to do my homework if
homework dude i aint doin homework
virgil continues to look at the strainer as ethan gravitates towards his cane folded up on the table
beat youre lucky you got a cane
virgil looks over sees his fascination
you want it
ive been thinking about throwing it out
ethans up in a flash
man really i can have it
picking it up i could be a ninja darth vader fighter with one of these protect my mom from the evil super
virgil is up with the spaghetti strainer in his hand
but first youll have to fight off the evil whatever this is
as they joust about virgil enjoying himself theres a knock at the door
could be the super go for cover
as ethan ducks behind the couch virgil makes his way to the door fumbling with the handle he opens it to jennie
virgil stares at her
we soon realize he has no idea who this is
jenny looks at him her eyes welling
virgil its me
and suddenly ethan is there cane drawn like a sword
jennie startled looks to ethan then virgil
whats going on
god im sorry cmon in this is my friend ethan what are you doing here
off jennies look virgil and jennie standing across the street from a building being torn down
hard hatted workers hover about the large trucks at work
you want to tell me what were doing here
thats our father
virgil looks in the direction shes pointing tries to focus on a figure moving across the lot
the man we saw watching tv
i cant i cant see him
jennie looks to him
i thought your eyes were better
i i dont want to see him
my eyes arent good enough not yet he wont understand
it wont be enough
virgil takes a step back
hes our father
he heard about the operation and hes asked to see you
look here he comes
goddamit jennie i dont want to see him i dont even know why you brought me here
and virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down the street leaving jenny alone
amy making her way up the stairs roll of plans under her arm
opening her door to a totally dark room
she drops her things
she flicks on the light to reveal virgil has been sitting in the dark
she looks over sees the scattered blocks on the floor
i forget about the lights sometimes
look about this party tonight its no big deal maybe we should just
its your partners birthday
we should go besides you wanted me to meet your friends right
noisy crowded people mill about carrying drinks black and silver balloons float about the ceiling
moving through the crowd music blasting amy introducing people to virgil over the noise
a waiter walks up to them holding a tray of wine
glass of wine
amy reaches out takes one
which is the red
amy looks at the waiter then points to one
virgils hand reaches out slowly hovering its clear its confusing trying to separate out one glass
the waiter looks to amy like is he ok
virgil here let me
her hand darts in front of his
sorry i mean im almost there i think i got it
and she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass pulling it back
at the last second knocking over two other glasses
the waiter trying not to spill on himself
trust me youre not the first or probably the last
let me get a cloth
thanks the waiter smiles and as he walks off
virgil nervously takes a large drink of wine
i hope youre driving
suddenly from the front of the room marshall the host calls out ok
hes coming up the stairs
everybody get ready kill the lights
excitement a buzz virgil looks around then click all the lights go out
virgil panics momentarily
what whats happening
amy moves to him in the near dark room
its for the surprise they turned off the lights
and suddenly the lights flood back on everyone screams surprise
duncan at the door with betsy genuinely surprised catches his breath then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor
the room explodes in laughter amy included
this action is even more confusing to virgil
is he ok
hearing this everyone breaks into bigger laughter virgil now the focus of attention good naturedly laughs amy smiles embarrassed
virgil takes a gulp of his wine finishing it off
the music is cranked
many couples dance
virgil exits the bathroom glances back in the mirror again at his hair not sure he likes its style
he tries brushing it to the other side its ok
how about the other way not so bad maybe
its clear hes a little tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair
here ya go virgil
virgil turns the waiter stands there holding a glass of wine placing it carefully into virgils hand cheers kevin
over the noise virgil
virgil embarrassed turns can faintly hear amys voice over the music
searches the room bopping bodies balloons being bashed round lights dim
the number of drinks hes had isnt helping
virgil over here
amy standing with duncan and betsy
maybe hes blind again
dont even think it
cmon i want the both of you to meet him hell never find us here
with virgil smiling as he sees amy duncan and betsy move towards him
virgil im sorry i went to get duncan
and this is betsy
hey virgil good to meet you
heard a lot about you
good to meet you
virgil thrusts his hand out colliding it into duncans
sorry things still get a little cockeyed sometimes
holding up his drink few more of these and ill be the same
lemme get kevin my man hell top you up
uncomfortable everyone stops
amy in atlanta tomorrow
duncan i told you
i spoke to falk and he
cant hear what
duncan pulls amy in close to talk shutting virgil and betsy out
amy said you had great hands
laughs she did did she
virgil holds them up in front of his face tries to see them
then looks past them and watches amy and duncan more importantly looks at duncans hair his clothes
its clear hes becoming aware of appearances
his own especially
as they break their tete a tete
you know my father was blind for several years he had cataracts as well
somehow this comes out patronizing
im surprised i dont know him
its a club you know
kevin the african american waiter comes up
virgil throws his arm around kevin
kevin duncan here the birthday man could use himself a drink
kevin here tells me hes black did you know that i mean look at him look at me isnt that the damnedest thing
amy is mortified kevin laughs
ill get you a drink
virgil looks to amy
whats that look
ive never seen your face that way before
what does it mean
before she can answer a dance song breaks out betsy wraps her arm around duncans
come on duncan lets dance move those old bones
duncan only acknowledges betsys contact with a raised eyebrow to amy
what the hell its my birthday nice to meet you virgil see you at the opening
and theyre gone onto the floor
virgil watches him sees the ease with which duncan moves handles things
the lobby we designed
virgil you cant
virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor
amy ready for one of virgils wild dances takes hold of his hand
the music blaring virgil starts to get into it amy starting to relax then virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing more conservative
hes even getting some looks from people
slowly he winds down tries to mimic what everyone else is doing ends up in just a slow shuffle
amy watches him sees hes uncomfortable moves to him but virgil turns on his heel and strides away
amy follows after him
virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony
amy comes up to him finds virgil facing a wall eyes shut
what are you doing
virgils head cocks slightly towards her just like when he was blind
i feel like rip van winkle
ive woken up from a thirty year sleep and the worlds passed me by
its just dancing
virgil whirls on her his hand on her shoulder to steady his look at her
no no no no
its not the goddamn dancing
i wanted to come here tonight show you i could fit in
like the big boys do
big seeing boys
well i dont
its just going to take time
you werent ready
we shouldnt have come
no i me shouldnt have come
you want me to see but you know what you know what shit i dont belong in the wonderful world of seeing
amy reaches out to him
amy realizes what she just said virgil pulls his arm away
no i wont
im tired of looking
fuck looking and the horse it came in on
and he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little crystals
the party slams to a halt amy stands stunned
virgil shaken tiny cuts on his face
oh my god are you alright
virgil slams his eyes shut
yeah im just fine
take me home
virgil small nicks on his face wakes up rolls over feels the empty bed beside him
looks up to see amy pulling her coat on suitcase at her side
didnt want to wake you
ill only be a couple of days
this isnt working
what were not working your eyes whats not working
i get up every morning i look in the mirror and i stare at a total stranger
i stare and i stare and no matter how hard i look i dont see virgil there anywhere
and the more i look at you
you dont see me
i saw you better when i was blind
well youre not blind any more
im sorry if that disappoints you
beat ive got a plane to catch
im going to go before we say things we dont mean
and she grabs her bag and is out the door
as we hold on virgils face
at the window virgil looking out watching amy get in the cab
as she drives away we see virgil watch the car recede then his hand goes out
his pov his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab trying to hold onto it like in times square trying not to let it go
close on amys sketches
the mall has been integrated into the two large trees giving it shelter and shape
i love it
amy and duncan sit across from falk a man in his s earned everything hes got no bullshit kinda guy
but we already cut those trees down
kids milling about
a young couple neck unabashedly against a wall
we see this is virgils pov hes watching people together
virgil makes his way down the hall
stops at an open doorway a sign next to it with raised letters in braille
as his hand feels across it he also reads the visual letters dr
peering inside he sees a lab full of the newly blind some teenagers a couple of adults a handful of seeing impaired all learning to use a cane
the rapid tapping of their cane like a room full of typewriters
virgil watches the blind working their way around a small obstacle course many of them running into desks tables its tough frustrating work
suddenly virgil feels someone next to him
you want to join us
virgil watches the blind
no no ill wait for you out here when youre done
as virgil moves off to a hallway bench virgil virgil turns as webster tosses his something
virgil misses it it hits the ground he reaches down finding it he picks it up its an apple
he looks to webster who smiles back at him
ill be done in a minute
amy and duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms
a little combo plays music in the adjacent bar a few people on the tiny dance floor
youd think he would have told us
i mean those trees were in the photos
well just have to win him over tomorrow
let me buy you a drink get those creative juices going
looks at her watch aw no i really
but duncan has her by the arm and in one spin has her in a dance embrace
this move seems comfortable familiar to them both
cmon listen theyre playing our song
laughs mack the knife was our song
webster is cleaning up after class
virgil watching some of the teenage kids and adults find their way out of the room
as the last of them leaves
ok im just about done here i got a place for you relax those eyes a bit
a table front and center
some empty beer glasses in front of them
two full ones in their hands theyre both a little in their cups
a stripper grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to the sounds of talking heads burning down the house
eyeing the girl you want to know the truth gods honest truth
seeings been the shits
you got to be kidding me son
you can say that sitting here in these prime viewing seats
forget fixing your eyes were going to get your head examined
i was better off blind
people dont have these expectations of you you cant live up to
youre blind fine they deal with it
didnt get what you expected did you
when i was blind i had an image of what everything was up here
points to his head now its all different not at all what id expected not what id hoped for
virgil let me explain something here
when you were blind you dealt with things one at a time sequentially right
a wall led to a door to a tree to a car
thats how you got to what you wanted right
beat seeing people for better or worse deal with everything all at once taking in the whole picture which sometimes confuses the hell out of what they want
beat virgil my advice after three beers dont be afraid to take in the whole picture just dont lose sight of what you want
what i want is to make it work with amy
and what does she have to say she just wants me to see
its that important is it
you know what i learned a long time ago
seeing girls like seeing guys
beat im not going to let her down
amy and duncan are dancing they seem good together
nothing fancy but they move as one about the floor
see not so bad
not so bad
its nice to dance together again
first time we danced connecticut
we watched the leaves turn so much to see id love to go back
so would i
beat what happened to us amy
youre so intent on fixing everything whyd you give up on us
i learned some things cant be fixed
we got married for all the wrong reasons
i dont think i fell in love with you as much as i fell in love with architecture
serious i never fell in love with architecture but i know i fell in love with you
now thats bullshit
it used to work
they smile at each other everythings easy right now pause they dance amy looks up at duncan who hesitates then leans in and kisses her
a moment and amy pulls away slightly looks down for a second then she leans back in and they kiss again
we hold on this kiss then cut to black we hear movement then a light comes on in the bathroom
amy stands there clutching her clothes staring into the mirror
in the background we see duncan curled up asleep in bed
amy stares at herself long and hard
whisper oh god
and she starts to dress amy
whats going on what time is it
click he flicks the bedside lamp on squinting finds amy
she doesnt talk keeps dressing
this was a mistake a big mistake
go back to sleep youve got an important meeting tomorrow
hold on here youre not bailing out on me i need you
flat for the meeting
of course for the meeting
dressed she moves toward the doorway duncan sits up in bed
im going home
to be a babysitter
she stops at the door
cant we for once be adults face the fact that weve just made a colossal error
fine this was stupid there happy
but goddamit amy i still care about you
where do you actuallv think any of this is going to lead with this guy
i dont know but the one good thing to come of this mess tonight i know i want to find out
and shes gone wham
a cab pulls up amy gets out looks up at her loft its dark
kitchen light on a pile of ethans blocks on the table
amy makes her way over to see it reads amy opens the door and sees virgil leaning against the parapet wall staring out at the night manhattan skyline
after a moment he walks back to the other end of the roof turns and slowly walk toward the parapet wall again all the time staring at the skyline with
a smile and look of amazement on his face
hi virgil turns finds her
amy starts toward virgil
its the craziest thing
you start back over there focus on a building
and when you walk towards it it changes each step makes it look different
i started out just looking for the horizon
you cant see it from here too many buildings
but its still there even though you cant see it right
you gotta have faith its there
things exist beyond what i can see i just have to take it on faith
she comes up next to him virgil looking out over the wall turns to her studies her face you have so many looks
amy theres something i have to tell you
i was getting confused which is no excuse for how ive acted but
wait no this isnt your fault im the ones been a shit
youre too hard on yourself expect too much of yourself
stopping her let me say this
every day of my life ive wished for just one thing
to be whole
for just one month
for just one day or one minute
for one goddamned half a second
and not just to be able to run or ride a bike or drive a car
beat but for once not to have a bruise from bumping into something or to stand in a room and have to ask is anyone here and here that dead
silence knowing someone is there
not to have food on my sweater or have to put my finger in my glass to know when its full
i just want to be whole
beat i went to see my father the other day
amy moves toward him
i couldnt face him
i felt like i was letting him down
i feel like im letting you down
i gave up years ago im not going to give up now
amy that day i met you for the first time in my life i felt someone needed me as much as i needed them
i dont want you to give up on me
amy out of breath feels a surge of love for this man moves in kissing him
a long kiss then besides i couldnt leave you i owe too much in back rent
and as amy pulls him into embrace we hold on her face then close on dr
aaron harsh lights washing him out
up until the operation five weeks ago virgil had been a touch person someone whos vocabulary whole sensibility his picture of the world was based on tactile non visual terms
a health instructor s jack lalaine type is giving virgil the tour of the facilities
they enter the weight workout room
various shapes and sizes of people work out on various shapes and sizes of workout machines
aarons voice over continues as jack motions to virgil to follow him
his pov chrome iron plastic but somehow its more defined than weve seen before
determined virgil starts his way into the gym hand out brushing by what he sees in front of him
but now as a sighted person by focusing singlemindedly on his goal virgil has a new found ability to understand his own physical relationship to objects in his life around
virgil now drops his hand starts moving through the maze of people and equipment actually seeing his way
distance size shape perspective now all have profound meaning to him
virgil negotiating a glass door exiting the building
and though there are still miles to go in his learning process for all medical intents and purposes he is becoming a seeing person
virgil walking down the street deftly dodging a kid on a skateboard throwing out his hand to hail a cab
this is an extraordinary achievement and advancement for medical science and a tribute to virgils determination to see
ladies and gentlemen virgil anderson
applause and virgil looking to amy in the audience stands a seeing man and easily makes his way to the podium
standing in the lights he readjusts the microphone moving it up from the much shorter aaron
clears his throat since this may be one of our last sessions are there any questions
anderson is there something you were surprised to see for the first time something that looked quite different than you thought
laughter no really
dont get me wrong i love them they just werent what i expected
what about your girlfriend
whose did you think i was talking about
now that youre fully seeing what are you looking forward to most
not having to do these sessions
laugh no actually being independent
can you read yet
will you ever be able to
i dont know
if you cant read will you ever be able to drive
suddenly somber i dont know
well how can you say
after so many years of darkness describe what it is to actually see
angle on the voice in the dark
close on virgil as he thinks about the question
close on the atlanta project
and a set of plans laid out across amys desk
virgils hand comes into frame touches the model moves to the plans touches them
on virgil alone in amys office looking at her work
we go to his face his eyes we see that he is seeing amys work
virgil looks up amy at the doorway
the atlanta project i thought it went away
duncan did some song and dance falks coming to the lobby opening tomorrow see our work
i see it amy
what you do
the plans the work the ideas
for the first time i really see what you do and not just up here
he points to his head but in here
virgils hand goes out to her chest places it on her heart
moves in close sexy tonight is your night something special i want to show you what is it
the sun starting to set the whole of the five burroughs of new york laid out in front of us
virgil moves to the edge looks out over this amazing panorama
amy moves up next to virgil they take it in a moment
thats the brooklyn bridge empire state building chrysler building just over there
amy look at me
this face this is everything
its all ive ever wanted to see
he watches her you have so many looks
what do all those looks mean
makes corresponding face is sad
her face softens is what in love looks like
virgil puts his hand on her face looks at it carefully
this look this look i love
amy leans forward and kisses him and he soon forgets it even happened
as they kiss we pull slowly back and away as the sun goes deep gold and we start to hear what sounds like rain we cut to and they are
still kissing and we realize they are in the shower together kissing exploring very sensual
as virgil moves to kiss her neck her breasts amys head tilts back in to the spray
virgil its raining
and he moves up again looks her in the eyes and for a moment his eyesight shudders ever so slight y it goes away and they kiss again
amy and virgil on the street each hailing separate cabs
so eight oclock tonight
eight oclock building opening i havent forgotten
she blows him a kiss and shes gone
virgil watches her cab pull away clear something is bothering him
his pov his vision going in and out
then clear then clouded again
virgils massage room
not as organized as he had at bear mtn
virgil is working on an overweight man his back is splotchy from too much sun
virgil massaging becomes preoccupied with his skins imperfections losing his concentration
hey virgil im the one supposed to fall asleep here
he closes his eyes gets back into his rhythm
virgil pack over his shoulder leaving for the day about to cut through the weight room when it suddenly comes to a halt
his pov his vision fading in and out and then suddenly quick flashes of black
on the final black we smash to virgil at the desk
the nurse looks up
daphne i need to see dr
aaron right away
its an emergency
aaron is again examining virgil on the electroretinogram
done aaron pulls the machine out of the way
looks at virgil rubs his hand across his face
what does that mean
what you just did
virgil imitates him
it means the machine is only registering sparks of activity retinal sparks followed by nothing
how long has this been going on
i dont know first i thought i was tired some blurs occasional cloudiness but its been getting worse
today im getting complete blackouts
your retinal function is down ten percent
im afraid your retinal disease seems to have returned
what does that mean i thought you corrected it
you told me i was a seeing person
now youve every right to be upset
maybe you didnt have the blood vessels to supply enough oxygen to the retinas
possibly some trauma there are so many variables
beat to be honest i dont know
i wish to god i did
virgil stands anxious starts pacing
youre the expert
tell me what do we do now how do we repair this
i i wish there was a nice way to say this
virgil backs away doesnt want to hear it
no there is no nice way to say it is there
no nice way to let the man know its all over that
hes going blind again
virgil i understand what
no you dont
dont ever say that
youll never understand
aaron stands there says nothing tries to let virgils anger dissipate
a long moment
hard to say
month few weeks beat days
virgil stands there stunned then looking to aaron
god what do i tell amy
what do i tell her
on virgils face
virgil steps into the hall sees a five year old boy blind eyes half shut hands reaching out plodding it a half circle over to where his mother waits for
and we see the realization on virgils face of seeing his past and what he will return to virgil running running best he can through the crowded street hands out
bumping into people desperate scared trying to run from himself from his fate
wham he comes to a stop out of breath he looks left right where do you go then sees something off screen
his face torn with fear he moves forward hand out reaching to a window to his own reflection
and we push slowly in on the reflection as he touches the window his hand on his face a face he may never see again and a cloud passes overhead
and his reflection is gone
virgil stands at the site amidst the rubble and mud
his father walks slowly over to him raising his arms to embrace him
virgil takes a step back not ready his father stops understands looks his son up and down
you look good
hey how do i look
i need some answers
whyd you leave
because im blind or because i quit trying to see
to the point i like that something you got from me
cut the bullshit dad
i dont hear from you for over twenty years then you find out i can see and all of a sudden you show up
looks around hey
virge can we talk about this later huh
no not later
was my blindness so wrong that made you tear our family apart
virgils riled his father
he steps towards virgil tries to speak under his breath
every morning i woke up and looked at you and saw my own failures
if i couldnt get my own son to see then
what difference does any of this make you can see now hell i knew you could
virgil watches his father this stranger
his eyes start to well
im going blind again
his father looks at him stunned
he reels from the news takes a step back
the doctor told me today
youre the first person ive told
i wanted to come see you before it was completely gone
speechless a beat and virgils father takes another step back then turns and walks away forever
virgil standing across the street
trying to take in the building standing at the front as a security guard opens the door
sorry the building doesnt open until tonight
im virgil anderson
with roswell tremont
we did the lobby
im here to check some details for tonight
oh okay sure mr
the lobby is pretty straightforward
open a few plants a large central check in desk
simple unobtrusive nothing exceptional or unique
virgil moves his way about the lobby looking at it carefully from every possible angle his hand grazing across walls entranceways desperately committing as much as he can to memory
finally ending up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as he can
you want to see that the thing work
this thing the guard reaches over hits a switch and against one section of windows a wall of water comes dripping down causing a shower of indoor rain the sound
instantly echoing off of the walls
virgil smiles moves toward it closing his eyes listening to the indoor rain really taking in the room having total empathy with what amy has created
virgil wrapped in a towel is shaving
but he has his eyes closed
amy comes in dressed beautifully using the mirror to put her earrings in
virgil quickly opens his eyes
no not a bit
what do you think
she pivots for him
you look great
not too flashy
she looks in the mirror she is nervous im going to change
virgil lets her go calls to her
this is an important night for you
but you know whats most important
she pokes her head in that youre going to be there to see it
virgil turns to the mirror stares at himself contemplating what hes up against
the lobby is filled with business types waiters circulating with champagne tiny hors doeuvres
virgil and amy enter standing at the top of the stairs leading to the party
virgil immediately going into a performance for amy
amy its good very good
im proud of you
i love the detail planted pots in the corners the moldings
beat its got genuine lines
excited look around do you see it
he looks about the room then turns towards the indoor rain
his pov clear then slight haziness a momentary flash of black then back in focus
he turns to amy
puts his arm around her
he extends his hand
virgil obliged slowly extends his having trouble focusing but duncan helps him taking hold of it and shaking it
still working on that hand shake youll get it dont worry
congratulations the place looks great
thanks heres the genius though i just get the gigs
can i steal her away falks over there and i cant tell if hes impressed with our work or just has gas from the pate
go do your thing
ill be right back
theres food and drinks down on the floor
duncan and amy start down the stairs as virgil tries to find a safe place to stand
his eyesight fading in and out he looks around decides to negotiate the steps he takes one step on the stairs looks down is able to see amy with falk
and duncan looking up at him she smiles he does his best smiles back lets go of the handrail takes another step finally reaching the bottom floor
he stands there for a long moment lost as to where to move
a glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using the sound to help guide him
amy looks over sees virgil moving across the floor gives him a little wave he doesnt notice her
at the rain virgil stands taking in the sound
a figure comes up next to him
quite a party
love the detail of the building
sometimes the detail doesnt matter
virgil stops turns to webster
what are you doing here
aaron called me
he was worried
ive been trying to find you amys office told me you were here
its almost gone
last few days have been pretty bad
obviously amy doesnt know
its going to break her heart
this is her big night i didnt want to ruin it
thought i could pull it off
beat you cant avoid this forever
virgil turns back towards the rain
i know beat so ray
is it better to have seen and lost than never to have seen at all
i thought it was loved and lost
amy comes up to them
webster this is a surprise
virgil invited me wanted to show you off i think
the place is terrific hes got every right to be proud
i need virgil for a moment schmoozing time
as hes led away thanks ray
ill call you
angle on duncan standing anxiously with falk and his wife donna as they arrive
virgil id like you to meet jack falk and his wife donna up from atlanta
pleased to meet you
amy tells us you were blind
amy spurts out a glass of wine
virgil deflects the comment
thats ok nice to see someone so honest
amy tells us youre her inspiration
any help you can give us with our project
im a little biased but i kind of liked amys original design
but could we do better
amy jumps in with
we could do better mr
falk a lot better
good i like that attitude
lets keep trying for perfection
everyone smiles amy wraps her arm around virgil
thats right thats why ive got virgil
pleasant laughter all around and as amy and the others continue we push in on virgil as he takes in this thought
virgil and amy out front
people leaving duncan getting into a town car with falk and his wife he looks back gives the thumbs up and climbs in after them
the car pulls away into the night
you wanna walk i feel like some air
see what we see
can i take your arm eyes a little tired
as they walk
you really made the place come alive with that fountain
beat you know ive been thinking youre doing so great now and if we get this new design job wed have some extra money i think we should go on
a big seeing celebration
taken aback a seeing celebration
yeah maybe in a couple of months
i looked into egypt we could see the pyramids we could see it together for the first time
what do you say
you know there is something id like to see
of course anything
the rangers play tomorrow
seasonll be over before we know it could be our last chance
sure why not
then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead one that grows increasingly larger as we move towards a sound
a hum that grows in intensity until the light fills the frame and bam we exit the tunnel and we are that glorious first view people the white ice shining
below like a giant jewel and the players in bright colors scurrying about the playing surface below
this is amazing isnt it
she looks to virgil who is awed by what he is seeing
then suddenly on his face a flash one of those moments of darkness
should we find our seats
looks like the games already started
yeah i ill follow you
virgil and amy in the loge seats on the aisle up behind the goal
amy looking at the stadium while virgil next to her watches the game best he can
i love the stadium the way its structure
amy the game
right the game
smash a hard check into the boards deep in the rangers end of the ice
the puck squirts out gretzky picks it up fires it across ice one two its back to him and he has a wide open break from center ice the crowd
is out of their seats virgil included amy quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm
on virgils face watching gretzky skate towards him excited then losing him another flash of blackness like a blow to the head and we hear the crowd suddenly explode and
as virgils vision regains we see the players mobbing wayne after his goal the little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening
we see the frustration as virgil realizes hell never see it
he scored he scored you see that it was amazing
as the players make their way to center ice the crowd sits and amy sees the expression again on his face
that was good right
yeah it was great i was just
suddenly virgil becomes transfixed
walking down the aisle away from him a vendor carrying a tray of pink cotton candy
virgil stares at it a moment transfixed then like in a trance he stands stepping out into the aisle a man on a mission
virgil where are you going
and hes on the stairs carefully moving down the stairs toward the vendor
then she sees the vendor handing virgil a large cotton candy round and puffy like a cloud but something he can hold in his hand
amy cant believe it watching virgil his fascination at finding this long lost memory
the puffy thing
angle on virgil turning admiring his prize then looking up trying to find amy who waves to him excited
his pov scanning the crowd its hazy then flashes of dark
amys face suddenly drops its clear even though she is only four rows up he doesnt see her
game is over virgil is packing up his stuff amy staring
virgil whats happening
just having a bad eye day
a lot to take in
whats going on
i see almost nothing
amy she feels like shes about to explode
its ok for you to cry
recovering no no im not going to cry
solve the problem
we made it through one operation well make it through another
we wont give up
well get this right we just need to
i saw dr
theres nothing they can do
then well find another doctor
theres got to be someone else
well find something that works
dont you get it i cant go through this again
so just like that we just forget it give up
why the hell havent you told me what was going on
whirls on her because of this
not letting it go thinking theres a solution
goddamit im not design flaw in your fucking work that you can just change to make work or throw away because it doesnt meet your expectations
beat lets face it its over
virgil give it time youll see
this conversation is ended
the door swings open amy and virgil enter virgil moves towards the bed pulls out his duffel bag
what are you doing
what do you mean leaving youre leaving this apartment youre leaving new york youre leaving me
virgil turns they stand across the room from each other miles apart
im going home
amy walks toward him picking a battle rejection
so youre big sister can take care of you feed you tv dinners for of your life
virgil tries to side step her
im not going to go through this bullshit again
amy moves in front confronting him is that what this has all been to you bullshit
who the hell were we fooling
im blind im not meant to see i dont belong here
god damn right youre blind
you want to live in your own little world this perfect world that your sister built for you where no one can touch you
where no one can reach you
do you know the reason why i remembered the cotton candy all those years
because i went to the game with my father
and its the only good thing i can remember about him
the rest is him pushing me to be something im not then turning his back on me the minute his plans fail
i am not turning my back on you
you want me to give up on you you love the self pity
i dont want you to give up on me
but you wont give up on me seeing
because there must be other options
virgil avoiding her sidesteps quickly past her straight into the lamp which crashes to the ground and breaks
a short few steps then a much larger crash the sound of a large heavier thing breaking
amy feels her way to the lights and turns them on
we see that virgil has collided with amys sculpture of the woman
he sits among the pieces on the floor
virgil feeling the damage
going to him is anything broken
no no bones are broken
virgil uses the wall to stand then with his hands out in front of him he finds his way to the bed
its finished cant you see that
we both didnt get what we wanted
quietly i never meant to hurt you
when you asked me to come here did you ever think this wasnt going to work that for one minute i may not be able to see
beat did you ever think it would be ok to have a relationship with a blind man
amy a pause
theres my answer
and he grabs his duffel and pack throws the last few things in and moving to the door leaves
virgil riding crossing the george washington bridge going home
he looks out the window sees the receding city and he closes his eyes listens to the rain
the bus comes down the main street of pinecrest
stopping the bus door opens and virgil gets out and turns to face up the street the street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now
the door opens
jennie smiles warmly reaches out to him
virgil and jennie entering his place to be greeted immediately by sophie bounding across the floor towards them tail wagging tongue hanging out
and he bends down to hug her
sophie laps at his face
virgil holds her back to get a good look at her
let me look at you
youre so beautiful
jennie watches her brother happy to have him home
hoping to get him back to normal
virgil walks around touching things seeing the simplicity of his life
nothing on the walls no decorations no plants
he realizes this is a home designed by his sister
he moves over to the photo of the family
he on his dads shoulders
stares at it at his father and mother for the first time
mom and dad
virgil just stares
everythings as you left it
jen im pretty tired id like to be alone
the phone rings
virgil doesnt move his apprehension is clear he knows who it is
jennie sees this and moves toward the phone
virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch followed by sophie as his sister picks up the phone in the background
he sits down looks into the night as we hear jennie faintly on the phone
a beat and she hangs up
we hold on virgil virgil walks down main street
seeing his town a town he grew up in but now seems so foreign
virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he sees
the yellow bus drives by full of kids carl at the helm
somehow its not what he expected
amy organizing all her work on the atlanta project the original designs the new design with the trees then she sees the sketch she made of the dancing trees
her eyes hold and she slowly shuts them and with them tightly closed her hand reaches out and runs along the drawings
we find virgil standing looking out at the end of the street where he stood with amy
in front of him he sees the dancing trees
virgils pov a retinal spark a quick glimpse of the intertwined trees one lover choosing between two others
virgil stands in the middle of the room
looks about at what was at one time so special to him
now it just seems old and dingy the magic is gone
he closes his eyes for a moment listens cocks his head to the left the right but there is nothing there
virgil standing outside staring at a building hes never seen never been inside
his pov flickering a moment
virgil now sits at a table
stacks and stacks of life magazine splayed out in front of him
he is flipping through them at a rapid rate like a drowning man searching for air
images cars jfk the pyramids martin luther king houses flowers marilyn monroe that napalm burned little girl in viet nam african masks dachau prisoners nixon warhol paintings the mona lisa
that vulture watching over the little baby the eiffel tower first man on the moon the venus de milo that guy in front of the tank in tianaman square
and the pyramids
the pictures go by fast and furious virgil soaking them up like a sponge life beauty horror great people great events
and we move in on his face absorbing these images for the last time a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing
and we cut to golden rays of the late afternoon sun
amy on the roof leaning on the parapet watching the horizon
then a thought comes to her
and mimicking what virgil had done she walks back to the other end of the roof turns and looks out towards the skyline again
then starts slowly walking towards the parapet till she reaches the wall again
the reaction on her face she doesnt see it not like virgil did
virgil is shifting furniture in his house
a table moves it to the window moves a chair to join it stands back to have a look at it
his pov a moment of clear then haze then dark then haze
virgil rubs his head these last days of sight have been painful and exhausting for him
shes at the door
virgil cocks his head in her direction
i picked up some things at the store t shirts im sure youre out some socks
jennie whats at the end of main street
well i think its vivians little stationery
beyond all the stores past firehouse
what happens when this is no more main street
well theres nothing really you know that
you told me thats all there was
theres a helluva lot out there
jennie surprised at where this is going
i told you what you needed to know
what was within my reach
what more do vou want
isnt there anything more that vou want
is this about our father he called told me
this isnt about him
jennie youve spent your whole life as blind as i was
the world doesnt stop within our reach
this is your home
stop thinking about whats out there things that will never matter to you
youre safe here where everyone
where everyone what
can protect me
beat jennie this place was a wonderful safe haven for me growing up
i know that
looking around and i can only imagine what you gave up to keep this world for me
i thank you and love you from the bottom of my soul
but now i want to give you your life back
virgil i i cant
you can virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him
im reaching out jennie
this gets jennie and she goes to him really hugging him for the first time as tears flow from her eyes
amy dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground trying to piece the sculpture back together
its a difficult fix
amy you in there
she scrapes some plaster into a dust pan
we hear enters a key in the door and the door opens
duncan i knew keeping this key would come in handy one day
what a mess what happened
it broke im trying to fix it
so guess what
im not in the mood for games
we got it
the goddamned atlanta mall we got it
now pull yourself out of this slump i want you to fly down this week to
continuing to work on the sculpture
im not going
what are you ta king about
whats the problem here
nothing is right thank you very much
you know what the problem is youre the problem you met a blind guy you thought was cool and spent the first two months trying to change him
are you finished
not even close
let me tell you something you cant change people to solve you
you tried to do it with me you tried to do it with virgil
you ever think some of the things you try to fix aint broke
and hes gone as amy slumps into a chair confused tired then slowly she starts to hear the sound of a cane in the stairwell
amys heart starts racing she takes a breath jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the door unlocking it and swinging it open excitedly virg
the cane being held by ethan as he taps his way down the stairs
sorry i thought
hes not coming back is he
no hes not
ethan sees shes covered in dust looks past her into the loft
he looks past her at the sculpture half repaired
cleaning up a mess going to start over
virgil walks the path sophie following close behind
by the way he walks counting steps touching landmarks we realize he is using sight very little
coming through the clearing to the plateau where he took amy the leaves now starting to turn golden colors he stops stands over top of the pond
virgils pov a retinal spark
the view across the valley with white clouds against the bluest sky
his hand reaches out to touch the edge of the world to touch the horizon
and as he drops his hand we see the clouds start to race by while the blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness
virgil doesnt move from the spot
the screen goes almost black then slowly the sun starts to rise in the east
virgil makes no movement
a long beat then as the sun moves across him he realizes its day
he stands and unfolds his cane
its clear he has returned to being completely blind
as he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear growing up blind i had two dreams
one was to see
the other to play for the new york rangers
virgil stands at the podium speaking dark glasses on cane in hand
after the miracle of my short period of sight i realize id rather play for the rangers
laughs from the dark its not that it was so awful i saw many things some good some back some that im already forgetting
but i realized that our eyes arent what make us see
we only live in darkness when we dont look look at what is genuine about ourselves genuine about others you dont need eyes for that
virgil sitting with three young blind children working through braille with them
webster watches from the corner of the room
virgil small brown bag in one hand cane in the other exits the building and makes his way across the street to washington square
virgil taking in the sun finishing off the last of his sandwich
balling up his paper bag he taps his cane out finds the garbage can nearby and tosses the bag rim shot it misses hits the ground
a hand reaches into frame and puts the bag in the garbage
virgil looks up senses the presence
did i miss
by a mile
angle on amy watching virgil realizing his sight is gone
ray told me you were living in town said i could find you here
beat i rushed didnt i
fourteen steps to the tree and i made us smash right into it
amy sits next to him
i finished the sculpture
id love you to see it
figure of speech
figure of speech
virgil when i first met you you saw more than any sighted person ive ever known
i didnt mean to take that away from you
i actually saw the horizon
you did that for me
its out there
you showed me you just have to reach for it
amy smiles her hand goes out hesitates then lands lightly on his
you want to walk
see what we see
just see what we see
virgil smiles nods
as he stands he takes her arm and as they walk off into the park we slowly fade to black and just listen listen to the sounds of the day
the percussion of the city
