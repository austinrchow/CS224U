written by dee rees a disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders jeans and hats crosses a narrow street
lights flare hands are stamped torsos are patted down
money exchanges hands
we descend into a black throbbing tunnel
explicit music booms from bassy club speakers
hips legs feet dancing
a go go dancer struts and wiggles around a brass pole
hoots and cheers
the dancer marches in place rolling her thonged bottom
more cheers greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband
where all my sexy sagittarian ladies at
arms go up
a collection of whoops ripple the crowd
the dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst
the camera rotates as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd
we realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling
oh my god
alike pronounced ah lee kay covers her mouth laughing and wide eyed
she tries to back away from the stage but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills
among them is laura worldly and smooth
where your singles at
where your singles at
laura strains over alikes shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancers boot
alike drops her beer in all the jostling
goddamn i love my job
laura stuffs a bill into alikes now empty hand and forcibly waves alikes wrist in the air
alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her
whatchu come here for
alike shoves the dollar bill into lauras chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage
laura shrugs puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage
alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend
oof sorry ladies
finally free of the throng alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone
she rolls her eyes back to the stage where laura is no longer visible
not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd she retreats for the bar
alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar
her gaze settles on a cute girl a little ways down staring out at the dance floor
alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl
the girl ignores her
alike clears her throat and speaks a little too loudly
how are you
the girl jerks around and frowns at alike looking her up and down
i was just sayin umm
the girl dismisses alike and turns back toward the floor
you wanna drink or something
alike strains snapping at the bartender
a confident woman swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand
the cute girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance floor
alike looks around just in time to see her leaving
the bartender finally materializes and alike slinks away
alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the cramped stall bathroom
a couple in front of her makes out vigorously and she folds her arms and looks away
a buff something woman with locs smiles and winks at alike
alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks away
the line inches forward
alike glances around searching for the woman
the something has already lost interest her attention now fully directed at a much more feminine woman strutting out of the restroom
embarrassed alike faces front again
two androgynous gangsters ags who have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer
alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance
one of the ags breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the line inches forward again
alike pretends not to notice and slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch along the wall
alike dozes on the couch
give it up for sin a min ladies
alike wakes with a start
she checks the time on her cell phone
cursing she scrambles up from the couch
laura dances with a cute short haired girl
alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction
cmon were late
i gotta go
hold on a minute
cmon why you trippin
why are you trippin you know i gotta go
you know i gotta go
ima get in trouble
lemme dance with shortie first then ill be ready
laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair continue their wobbling uneven groove
alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women both feminine and butch push past her without a second glance
alike tugs at lauras jersey
laura happily tangled in her dance partners embrace rolls her eyes
stop pulling on my clothes
laura sulks frowning out at the night
alike extends the olive branch
how many numbers you get
i couldve gotten more but your moms was holding me up
thats jacked up
how many you get
tonya denise shelley
no wait thats old i can delete that one
laura snatches the phone from alike
alike swipes at it but misses
laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through the numbers with the other
aint shelley that chick from your math class
these are your damn study group numbers
why you frontin
alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her sleeve
i dont see you with no list of numbers
im not the one looking for a girlfriend man
you the one still a virgin
trying to help your ass
im sayin whatchu waitin for
alike shrugs it off her smile fading a little
laura elbows her and sneers
kickin that same ol quiet shit since th grade
i dont need to press i gets plenty
i get more pussy than your daddy nigga what
yeah you got me with that one
alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on
a middle class bronx landscape well lit with a newly constructed starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window
alike reaches over and presses the tape
laura elbows alike
your stop youre getting off here right
nah ill roll with you a few more stops
why you gon walk all the way back down for
make sure you get home okay
the bus pulls to the curb
the light flicks on over the back door
you aint big nigga
trying to protect somebody
hurry up man get off
to bus driver thats alright man next stop
alike elbows laura sharply
the bus driver frowns in the rear view
you aint gotta push me whyre you beastin
im not beastin
laura climbs over alike and swings toward the door
you got a problem
ima call you
alike turns and watches laura stroll away
laura drums a little beat on alikes window as the bus pulls off
alike waves and faces forward again
an old lady sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look
alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away
alike studies her reflection in the window and takes a breath
she unbuttons her bulky mens shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads princess
she stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears
she slumps back against the seat and stares into the night
the bus stops at a lonely island of curb
alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night
alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through
the house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock
alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway
her younger sister sharondas door cracks open as she passes
whispering be quiet
where you been this late
movie ended at midnight
alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door
sharonda yanks the door open wider
whispering dont push me
whispering go to bed
i know what stays open past midnight
sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance
alike eases sharondas door shut
sharonda swings the door open wide
good night lee
sharonda slams her door
the light clicks on underneath alikes parents door
alike rolls her eyes at her sisters closed door and shrugs into her room
alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed
she tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother audrey appears in the doorway
nice to know you still live here
alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed
whatre you doing home so late anyway
lost track of time
you know what time your curfew is
where were you
the show ended at midnight
and your curfew is twelve thirty
i lost track of time
audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb
alike turns her back on her and slumps into pajamas
at least you were cute
whered you get that shirt
i like that
alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches to the top of the closet
compliments your figure
i saw something just like it on sale maybe we could go shopping goodnight
audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter
vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice
i really dont care for that young lady you run around with anyway
and tie your head up
alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps it around her head
its your head
and you really should wash your face too
i dont have on make up
wash your face anyway
im seventeen years old please dont talk to me like watch your tone
beat well its your skin
alike is still
she listens for the door to her parents room to shut before snatching off the scarf and storming to the bathroom
alike turns on the faucet wets the soap and puts it back in the dish wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack
she plops down on the toilet and looks up
a crucifix frowns down at her from the wall
she averts her eyes and stands to leave
did you brush your teeth
alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder
alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little around the sink
she stares at her reflection
alike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure
alike bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter
students horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups chugging their morning fantas and munching on snack cakes
the school bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building
alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last stragglers finally trickle in
she yanks her hoodie tighter and launches across the lawn and into the building
a second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into classrooms
alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the bathroom
one last straggler bina a year old girl with mature but down to earth good looks rushes past alike
the two exchange a brief confused look then mutually dismiss each other as they hurry in opposite directions
alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut behind her
she rips off her hoodie and the girly shirt beneath and flings them to the floor
she pulls out a pair of wife beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head
she unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head
she stares at her reflection in the window and tries unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt
her eyes scour her reflection again and again for any imperfections
she spots the earrings and yanks them out of her ears
the late bell beckons and alike stuffs her feminine clothes into her backpack and bolts
the math teacher glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests
a chorus of groans follows in her wake
as promised i will be grading these on a curve
alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom
the desks in front her and beside her are empty
she is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes
but the highest grade on the test was a
the math teacher puts alikes test on her desk and gives her a little smile
alike doesnt smile back
the lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado clearing the room in a rush of limbs shouts and backpacks
alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door
the cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying
clusters of girls and boys loud talk flirt fight and horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the walls
alike walks alone staying at the fringes of the crowd and shrugs through the cafeteria line
alike flees the cafeteria tray laden with rubbery cuisine of dubious nutritional value
she raps on the door of a classroom and slips in
alvarado a middle aged californian ex hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste
her small desk radio plays alternative rock
sun beams into the empty classroom and alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk
whaddja bring me
nothin you can eat
you shouldnt be eatin that crap either
over a mouthful of pizza i know
sooo wheres the new stuff
alike hands over her purple and white composition book
alvarado thumbs the pages reading silently
did you see the one in the back
alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth moves silently as she reads
ill probably do it in class
alvarado hands the book back to alike and digs in to another celery stick
what do you think
of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all you know that
i dont know
is it your best
alike frowns through the pages of the composition book
i thought it was good
alike slumps back into her seat and considers the books cover
i believe you can go deeper
audrey is a heat seeking missile whipping through the sparse hallways of the trauma wing her clipboard and pen in constant motion
nurses and aides scatter in her wake suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to avoid her caustic gaze
she barks at a cluster of clerks chit chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to escape
audrey drills her
oh so your log is all up to date
no i and youve checked the round for any calls
do you even know which doctors are on the floor
no maam i then i suggest you get busy
the clerk skitters off red faced and audrey looks daggers into her back before storming the break room
audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads toward a table
a few lounging aides wad up their garbage and flee the break room
audrey settles down at the table and pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote pretending not to be hurt
she peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins reading
a big red department store bag sits next to her work tote
the television suspended over the table mumbles corporate healthcare infomercials
singletary one of audreys co workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag on the table across from her
mind if i sit here
no not at all
whatchu got there
you been shopping
just some yogurt
some vanilla yogurt
no i meant in the bag
what do you have in the shopping bag the big red thing
i dont know where my mind is
yeah this is just uh well let me get your opinion
audreys steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all butterflies and giggles
she rifles through the bag and hoists out a pink ribbed v neck sweater
oh thats nice
yeah see isnt this cute
thats for your daughter
yeah this is for alike
the youngest one
no shes the oldest one
oh the other one
what you think its too young
for whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first
but i think it should be fine
its really cute
itll compliment her figure
now see thats what i thought
but lee doesnt like anything i pick out for her anymore
singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the sweater from audrey
my oldest going on mind you banned me from buying her any more clothes
we have two completely different tastes
i just give her gift cards now and trust me were both happier for it
is it her birthday
singletary hands the sweater back to audrey who smooths it carefully back into the tissue paper
i just wanted to get her something nice
three rowdy co workers burst into the room chattering and finger popping
oooooh audrey you got me a whatchall in here talking present
well no we none of yo damn business
the co workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various parts of the breakroom
audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet
somebody cranks on a small radio and a frisky r b beat invades the air
singletary pats audrey on the arm
let me know how it goes
oh i will
ill call you when hey bren this is what i was telling you about
co worker shoves a tabloid in mrs
singletarys face tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page
is that her
look how big she done got
the center of the room shifts and audrey is once again alone at the fringes
she collects her shopping bag and looks around to say goodbye but no one notices her leave
audrey sharonda alike and their father arthur something with a used to be athletic build are all gathered around the dinner table for a rare family dinner
everyone takes half hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact with each other
sharonda picks at her food
i dont see why we cant just watch tv like usual
alike elbows sharonda
you dont tell me what to do
the phone rings and arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it
im expecting a call
audrey stares after him then glares back at alike and sharonda
this is your fathers night off
alike casts a glance in the direction of the bedroom where arthur can be heard talking in hushed tones
she rolls her eyes and slinks down into her seat
so straighten up
arthur settles back into his chair his mood a little brighter
seeing an opportunity for brownie points sharonda pitches in
homecoming got moved this year
its gonna be in september instead of october
which means ill be able to go to autumn ball and the homecoming dance
who are you going with
i dont know
if he asks me
i havent decided yet
but for homecoming i definitely want to go with craig

arthur gives alike an approving daddys girl wink
alike beams back

but its her junior year shes not gonna have any memories
i dont like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway
nobody buzzes around alike
thats right and it better stay that way
matter of fact i dont know if ima let you go
alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink
arthur jabs her on the arm as she walks by
audrey tears into a dinner roll shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact
laura brings a steaming cup of ramen noodles to a worn kitchen table splayed with bills
her older sister candace a stout something with pleasant but hard working looks scribbles notes on the back of an envelope while soaking her feet
laura takes a sip of her soup and starts sifting through a pile of envelopes
how much we paid him last time
six twenty five
so that makes we owe another two seventy five for the rest of the month
candace pecks on a calculator and scribbles on the envelope
laura flips through more bills
let it ride
no let it ride
laura locks her hands on top of her head and leans back in her chair surveying the financial carnage
candace reaches inside a ceramic hen on the table and pulls out a wad of money
she counts out several hundred dollars into an envelope
i can get some more hours no
you know what you need to do
nah candy i cant just dip out on you like that i was doing just fine before you moved in remember
i can handle it
laura sucks her teeth
you working was only supposed to be temporary
mom wouldve wanted who
man dont even she wouldve stop
laura pushes up from the table and glares at candace a showdown
candace stares back unfazed
laura caves first
ill get the money orders in the morning
laura tugs at the envelope but candace doesnt let go right away
ill look into it alright
candace relinquishes the envelope and laura stalks off down the hallway to her room
the next test is coming up soon
i said ill look into it
candace smiles wanly and sips her soup
she takes a foot out of the water and kneads it
alike slams into her usual stall and launches into her superman changing routine
she unrolls pulls a jersey from her backpack and yanks it over her head
alike sits off to one side of the stairs headphoned into oblivion and scribbling into her composition book
a group of fast girls strut by and encamp on the opposite wall giggling and yakking on cell phones
one of the girls mika cuts a flirty smile at alike
alike turns away and buries herself in her book but cranks down the volume on her ipod
it was like seven of us me khalil misha tamara
heeeell no fat tamara
oh i was about to say tamara marks is a ughh i cant stand her
anyway it was all of us and oh laura you know that girl from the restaurant

the pack directs their attention at alike
alike profiles and attempts to look casual
yeah alike shes cute too
i dont be looking at them all like that
mika smiles as her eyes travel down alikes physique
alike aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt unnecessarily
she licks her lips and readjusts the book in her lap fighting hard to keep the grin off her face
look im not gay but if i was gay i might talk to her
shes in the middle anyway
yeah but if she was just a little more harder alike looks over and starts to nod when a cute boy with locs swaggers up to the girls drawing their
the girls erupt into titters and they melt into conversation
alike deflates watching them over the top of her book
she observes every little moment between the girls and the boy every wink
another boy joins the group and they stroll off down the sidewalk
alike plucks the headphones out of her ears watching them leave
mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at alike
remnants of alikes grin return reflexively
mikas friend jerks her elbow around
oooh let me find out mika
you act like you bi or something
i like girls but i love boys
i cant tell
alike waits for them to disappear from view before snatching up her bag and bolting in the opposite direction
laura hoists a box of french fries onto her shoulder and moves inside the restaurant
watch out its slippery
so what do you think
i already told you what i think
but you know her right
i said i know of her i dont know her know her
alike hefts up a box and follows laura back into the restaurant
im saying you know her friend right

yeah thank you
im listening all im saying is pass me that milkshake mix right there
alike tosses laura a bladder of milkshake mix
laura catches it
all im saying is that i dont think you should put yourself out there like that
especially if you dont even know if she likes you like that
how do you know she does
i just know she does
laura holds out her hand as if checking for rain and scans the ceiling
whatre you doing
i thought i felt a drop of pig shit
all i know is i been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest
i dont want to holla at girls in the club
why you pressed about this chick
i wanted to ask you about something else too
oh god what now

alike cocks her head at laura
laura frowns back
just for my image
alike raises her eyebrow
laura shakes her head
the light bulb goes off
she roars in disbelief
you trying to strap
oh my god what are you going through
what difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon make
by next friday
oh my god i cant believe you
she better be cute for all of this
alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in her underwear
i think it looks natural
a peach colored dildo dangles stiffly from alikes waist
the harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts
alike appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots laura a look
im serious i mean it doesnt look that bad
i cant believe you
alike frowns at the dildo in profile
laura this doesnt look right
ima look stupid
well first of all i dont think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that
im not putting this thing next to my skin it pinches already
alike yanks at the harness and her boxers trying to pull it out of her bottom
its supposed to fit like that
they didnt have any brown
i didnt have time for all of that
the brown ones were too big anyway
alike struggling with the apparatus
you gotta take it back
i cant take it back
heres the receipt

one time was embarrassing enough
still what if somebody would see me in there
im not going back thats it
then wheres my change
sharonda bursts into the room
lee whered you put my make up case

ooh lee laura leaps from the bed and blocks sharondas path to the doorway
alike tackles sharonda and wrestles her down to the floor
laura slams the door shuts and locks it

alike pulls off the dildo and harness

alike fishes the make up case out of her backpack
she holds it out to sharonda
sharonda reaches for it
alike jerks it back

alike flips open the make up case and jabs the dildo at it stopping short of the surface of the make up
lee stop it eeew

eeww thats so nasty
cmon lee give it back
then promise you wont tell
ughh i hate you
alike jabs the dildo closer to the make up
ok ok i wont tell
alike tosses the case at sharonda who scrambles to catch it
alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind her headboard
sharonda saunters out into the hallway
im still tellin tellin what
audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway still dressed for work shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag
noth she took my makeup again
notices laura oh
hello laura i didnt see you standing there
hows your mother
i havent spoken to her in awhile
well i hope so
and im so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet

audrey fixes laura with another hard glance and shoos sharonda down the hallway
laura starts to shut the door but audrey stops it with her arm
i think well just leave this open
let some air circulate in here
i was just about to leave anyway
audrey lingers looking back and forth between laura and alike
alike frowns at her mother
satisfied that the conversation is over audrey moves off toward her room
laura checks to make sure shes gone and whispers to alike
just try it
alike squirms in her seat
will you chill
you just gotta get used to it
alike tugs at her crotch and attempts to cross her legs
alike uncrosses her legs and yanks at her jeans
laura bats her hand away
sit still people gon think you got something
this joint hurts man
ima go take it off

youre the one who wanted to meet her not me
then you come on too
hurry up a group of girls approaches one of them we recognize as mika the girl that likes alike from the bathroom
laura stands to greet them
nervous introductions all around
laura shoots alike a warning glance
laura is hugged up with two girls at the end of the couch
alike fidgets in her seat and keeps pulling at the knees of her jeans
mika hand in chin stares into space
alike does another pull fidget combo
mika rolls her eyes at her
yeah no yeah its just theres a spring in the cushion or something
you wanna switch seats
no im good
and you dont wanna dance
hey yall were about to go dance
no no not really
im not really feeling the music
mika sighs and looks around at the other dancing couples
alike gives her jeans another tortured tug
agonized minutes of awkward booming silence
well you dont mind right
i mean you dont mind if i go dance with somebody else
no do your thing
if you change your mind no no its cool
mika escapes the couch and disappears into the crowd
alike slips off her shoes and eases through the kitchen
audrey flicks on the light blocking the hallway entrance
i hope it was worth it
mom i lost save it
it wont happen oh i know it wont
alike peels off her jeans and lobs them into the top of her closet
she unharnesses the dildo and wads the tangled mess up in an old t shirt
she stuffs the wad in back of the closet and slams the closet door shut staring at her reflection in the mirror
alike reconsiders and yanks the wad back from the closet
alike stuffs the wad into a trash bag and plunges it deep into a neighbors garbage can
she scurries back into her building and doesnt look back
alike skulks on the couch in wrinkled khaki pants and a cotton button down shirt
an obnoxious r b video plays on the tv
sounds of bustling and the drone of a hair dryer fill the room
turn that mess off
alike turns the television volume to low and continues watching
sharonda are you ready
lee are you ready
audrey hobbles out with one high heel on
she snatches the remote from alike and snaps the tv off
i said off
thought you were ready
i am ready
youre not going to church looking like that
wheres the blouse i bought you
whats wrong with this
the front door bursts open and arthur tromps in his police uniform hanging open over a white undershirt
he slings a heavy f
p tote bag on the floor and strips off his shirt as he crosses to the kitchen
audrey rushes over and buzzes around him
hey there youre home early well actually late
i thought you would have called dad do what your mom says
audrey scuttles over to where arthur is now digging through the open fridge
he pulls out a foil covered plate tears open one corner sniffs it
are you hungry
let me heat it up for you
arthur heads toward the microwave with the plate
audrey intercepts the plate from him and dumps the contents into a skillet
ill heat it up on the stove for you
leave me out of it
go get changed
dad whats wrong with this outfit
im not gonna argue with you
do what she says
dad speaking bad tarzan swahili umgowa
and put on a skirt
alike stalks off to her bedroom
sharonda bounces into the kitchen
too much lipstick
audrey wheels on sharonda with a death glare
sharonda pecks dad on the cheek
dad wipes his cheek and rubs his fingers together
sharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom
audrey slides a steaming plate in front of arthur
did you talk to her
get me a beer please
im talking about lee
and i dont see that theres a problem
im tired of this tomboy thing shes got going on
you said you were going to handle it
she needs a male point of view
i said okay dammit
now can i please have a beer please
its sunday morning
it goes with the spaghetti
audrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front of arthur
she pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal her expression softening as she caresses his forearm
do you have to work tonight
to put food on the table and clothes on our backs no
to go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet yes
are you forever gonna be mad
are you forever going to be happy
beat you made that decision a long time ago
we both made sacrifices
alike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v neck that audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat front skirt
arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can
you look beautiful baby
tuck your blouse in
this isnt me
tuck your blouse in
leave it out
audrey frowns at arthur
arthur stands his ground
i think its fine out
whats the deal with you and laura

dad i hardly ever why dont you give that a break for a little while
dad come on
to alike you heard him
to sharonda sharonda
alike spins into the living room defeated
you coming with us
we could go to a later service
the one oclock i said no
arthur slams his fork on the plate
alike looks up
sharonda appears in the doorway looking from audrey to arthur
arthur pushes up from the table
alike you look beautiful
everybody looks beautiful okay
arthur disappears into the bedroom
alike snatches up her bible and launches out the door sharonda follows
audrey pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind her
alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as audrey chit chats with other churchgoers
sharonda sits in the back seat flipping through a cd case and occasionally passing cds to alike to play
alike faces stonily forward except to cast impatient glances in audreys direction
audrey raps on the window
heres someone i want you to meet
alike cracks the window an inch
audrey motions to bina standing by with her mother ms
alike cracks the window a little wider and acknowledges them with a half hearted wave
get down out the car and come speak
laboriously alike rolls the window back up turns off the car radio and climbs down out of the car

alike reaches over and turns the key in the ignition

alike toots the horn
audrey circles and gets in the drivers side
i dont know what your problem is

audrey cranks the ignition and starts to back out
i dont know what you think is going to change
i know god doesnt make mistakes
i know that much
an invisible scab is ripped open in alike and the fire dies in her eyes
satisfied audrey slips the car into gear
you may not like bina but youre certainly gonna be spending much less time with that laura person i guarantee you that much
moooom can you be quiet
nobodys putting in anything
im gonna listen to what i want to listen to for a change
alike wilts against the window and tacky zydeco music leaks from the car as it jerks away from the curb and into traffic
alike strides down the sidewalk
bina speedwalks to keep up
look i dont like lying to my mother thats all
then dont she doesnt have to know
she asks me everyday
so tell her yeah

bina stops short
alike keeps walking

we dont have to see each other any other time than that
alike doesnt miss a step
bina yells after her
whatever my mother asks me again im telling her
then she can tell your mother then its whatever for you
alike stops short
bina crosses the street and continues in the direction away from school
alike spins around scanning the street then catches sight of her on the opposite sidewalk
bina keeps on pushing the school now in sight
alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to catch up with her
hey look im sorry
yeah you sorry your mom is gonna bug out
no for real im sorry
i didnt mean to be that way
ok i am concerned that my my mom will find out but

the girls walk in silence for a moment

alike relaxes her shoulders both relieved and surprised
i can tell
ive seen i mean a lot of peoples parents are like that
but probably not like mine
anyway like i said we dont have to talk
alikes cell phone chirps its laura
alike sighs and stuffs the phone back into her pocket
this is lee im not able to answer my phone right now laura snaps her cell phone shut
a ged study book still glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of her
she opens her cell phone again and pulls up alikes number
her thumb hovers over the talk button
she snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio down and dragging the book closer
the cell phone rings and she snatches it up
a picture of a girl making a kissy face with the name tasha underneath blinks onto the screen and laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside
she hoists the ged book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall
there is a knock at her bedroom door and candace peeks in
hows it comin
candace smiles at laura and hesitates before closing the door
candace turns the radio off before ducking back out
laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book
alike and arthur cavort in a sloppy half court game in the fluorescent glare of the gym
well heeled clientele cross to and fro munching power bars and sipping gatorade
arthur has an awful shot but alikes is worse
alike heaves a huge airball past the basket
oh my god
alike cracks up as arthur chases down the ball
thats just embarrassing
you aint got no range either
yeah but at least i hit the backboard
alike rushes to guard arthur who dribbles clumsily around the key
he tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward the basket
laughing they tussle over the rebound
whats the score
nah i definitely have like three
at least three
giggling the pair rollick in another squeaky shoed play
mack the store proprietor leans against the counter flipping through a newspaper
arthur in uniform mulls through the sports section
a ratty looking man sock sips from a red plastic cup
mack cranks the volume on the tiny television above the counter
its on again
check it out free
channel and channel
arthur appears on the tv screen dressed in suit tie sunglasses and looking impressive
he is talking to a news reporter and a bad news graphic reading east side drug bust detective arthur freeman blots out the bottom of the screen
look whos big time
brother was looking clean though
looked just like look like
uh danny glover
arthur and mack laugh and slap hands
sock sneers at their revelry
the bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset butch woman strolls in
her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain clinks against her ample carpenter pants
all three men turn to stare
been more of that since they opened up that new club cross the way
arthur grunts and returns to his paper
to butch woman excuse me miss
certain friday nights they got you know special parties going on
or should i say sir
chill out sock
hey my man
you hear me talkin to you
mack snatches socks cup
sock pivots around to protest
mind your business
sock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts
hes caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up to the counter with a case of liquor
arthur steps out of the way and observes
and a pack of kools
mack nods and fishes under the counter
say i been trying to get your attention
do you go by sir or miss
thatll be all maam
look i just had a simple question i wanted to ask
see i just want to know how does pussy taste
the woman directs her full attention at sock for the first time
mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale
you know i just wanna know if you go with women for the taste or is it just youre too big black and ugly so dont no man want you
sock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his cup
the woman counts out the money and smiles at sock
i cant lie pussy do taste good
the woman takes her time putting away her change
maybe you should try it yourself sometime
or better yet the woman picks up her case
ask yo wife how she likes me
the woman winks at sock
arthur chokes back a guffaw
as soon as the woman clears the door arthur and mack explode in laughter
sock is livid and screams after her
ask your wife
she told you
she aint tell me shit
i dont know what the fuck yall niggas are laughing for
awww shut up
your big mouth got you in trouble as usual
thought you was my friend mack
but i guess i aint expect you to defend me free the way your daughter is arthur slams sock against the counter before he can finish his sentence
he dont mean nothin
he dont know what hes talking about
arthur grinds socks collar tighter around his trembling fist
sock glares back clearly punked
he aint moved outside a two mile radius of where he crawled out his mammys pussy
he dont know shit
to mack i been to poughkeepsie
arthur snorts and flings sock loose
carry your poughkeepsie ass on out of my store
mack sweeps socks plastic cup off the counter and into a garbage can
sock tromps to the door
i should arrest your ass
man fuck yall
free dont pay him no mind
just talkin trash
mack playfully jabs him in the shoulder and bustles underneath the counter
arthurs eyes linger on the door and his jaw tightens
laura swings through the front door of her apartment alike close behind
she slides two twenty dollar bills underneath the ceramic hen on the table and breezes into her bedroom
alike is a paper doll in lauras floor length mirror dressed only in boxers and a wife beater
laura holds a bright orange polo shirt up in front of alikes torso
alike cocks her head to the side and considers
damn this is your color
so whats the deal incog negro
mom has me hemmed up
your phone aint broke
you coulda called a nigga
put this on
laura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands alike a turquoise one instead
alike hoists the oversized shirt over her head
shes making me hang out with this chick from church
you a grown ass woman bruh
laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap from the wall rack and drops it onto alikes head
alike considers and takes it off
laura puts another cap in its place
before alike can object laura tosses her a pair of denim shorts
try these with it
so i guess the piers is out for saturday huh
i dont even know if thats me anymore
alike struggles into the jean shorts widening her stance so they dont fall down
laura tosses her a belt and admires alikes reflection
yeah thats hot yo
you should rock that
i was gonna see if you wanna do something different
alike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the rack
different like what
alike peels out of the polo shirt
i dont know maybe like a open mic or something
its plenty chicks at the piers you just gotta be more confident
laura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory
the jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and some still have store tags
most of the shirts are still enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners
laura passes alike a perfectly folded button down shirt
you can rock this
i havent even worn it yet
but i understand if you got better things to do
alike holds the shirt against her torso and stares at her reflection
she catches lauras eager look in the mirror and wilts
nah im down
i dont want you getting hemmed up
nah seriously im down for whatever
thats whats up
ima take the whole day off
its gonna be tight watch
we gon do it up
laura holds a new pair of jeans against her body and does a little dance
alike laughs wanly
audrey sits between alikes knees as alike oils her scalp
alike takes her time massaging each braid between her hands before moving to the next
audrey reads an essence magazine the cover of which reads ways to please your man
you should wear your hair down sometimes
your father likes it up
it looks nice down
alike catches her mothers eye in the mirrors reflection they share a sad moment
audrey closes the magazine and tosses it back onto the bed
anyway give this back to binas mom when you go over tomorrow night
we talked about this
no we didnt
lee i had plans for this weekend
well you dont have to go to binas on saturday night you can always stay home with me
oh my god
bina sits on the floor flipping through cds
alike sits in a chair head in hand completely disinterested
you like destinys child
no i dont really like any of that commercial bullshit
bina looks up off balanced
who do you like
alike checks the time on her phone
alike starts packing her backpack
just more underground stuff
none of that crap they play on the radio
people you probably havent heard of
asheru and blue black
i heard of pharcyde
ah for real
alike perks up looking genuinely interested for the first time
uh oh whatchu know about bahamadia
let me find out
im not as generic as you think
the phone rings
singletary answers from another room
alike and bina freeze listening
yeah shes here
i understand alike sulks
bina flips to the back of the cd book
alright how about rock
whatchu know about santogold
since you all underground and stuff
i havent heard of her i heard of res
alike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to leave
oh no this is way better you gotta check her out
bina jams her ipod onto the stereo adapter
the thick fierce guitar rhythms of tamar kalis boot consume the room
bina chants the lyrics along with the music
her hair is short
her legs are brown
her lips are full
her head hangs down
alike plops back down in her chair
audrey smooths a pink sticky note onto a foil covered plate and shoves it into the fridge
the doorbell rings and she rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing song voice
is lee home please
shes out with her friend right now laura
you take care
audrey starts to close the door
laura stops it with her hand
umm do you know when shell be back
no i believe shes out for the evening
oh because we had umm
audrey shuts the door harder than necessary
laura checks her phone and shakes her head
twist a virgin round your dirty little finger
blood is gone but the memory lingers
twist a virgin round your bloody little finger love is gone but the memory lingers
alike is bobbing her head backpack forgotten on her shoulder
bina cranks the volume down
yo this shit is hot
dont you have to go
nah i wanna stay
alike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the cd book into her lap
her cell phone rings and she ignores it
the pier is a parade of mohawks curly weaves tight jeans and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes young queens and gender queer youth of all shades of brown
stroll cavort and strut seeing and wanting to be seen
equally bedecked observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both sides
laura jabs numbers into her cell phone
competing threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her
leave a message and ill call you back
laura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the screen
she starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear
where you at
hit me up when you get here
alike and bina are sprawled in the floor
bina djs from her laptop
alvarado was trying to get me to check out this one place
alike hands her the flyer
bina laughs and tosses it back
oh hell no
thats for old people ill write down some places you should check out
maybe you could read some of my stuff too
laura scowls at her cell phone screen
she shoves the phone in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of the evening
brake lights bathe laura and her circle of ags in red as late night predators cruise the strip for fresh meat
laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an alley across the street and looks away
one of the entourage passes laura a joint and she inhales deeply
a few of the girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break off and scatter into the night one by one
member when we used to stay out here all night
shit used to
you stay with your sister now huh
laura nods and spits
lucky as hell
ap english class is a safe haven
the desks are pulled together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily pierced dyed hair and vintage clothes types
alvarado sits cross legged atop her desk taking notes
alike stands at the center of the circle reciting an original poem
a butterfly briefly suffocated on the mucous of its own change imprisoned
by the membranous chaff of its own underdeveloped wings and cramped in the darkness of the too tight cocoon of its own creation pauses thinking death inevitable prepares to die
in the absolute solitude of swollen husk
a c r a c k appears a thin jagged light connecting the inner to the outer world a butterfly briefly paralyzed by the imminence of death discovers life is
the class claps
julie tell me what you think
a forest of hands go up as alike winds her way back to her seat
a few classmates whisper brief encouragements
bina nods and smiles at alike
unguarded alike smiles back
bina and alike troop home at a more leisurely pace
alike breaks the silence for once
i liked your story though
it was tight
the one about the the one about karma how things come back to you
that one i thought it was tight
i wasnt gonna say anything but i liked yours too
why did i like it or why wasnt i gonna say anything
why did you like it
i dont know
i guess because it felt honest
didnt you have on a different shirt earlier
no whatd you say
yeah i had on a different shirt
well thats cool
so why werent you gonna say anything about it
about your shirt
about the poem
cause youre moody
man im not moody
this is me
alike looks up at the stoop surprised
its not so bad when theres some conversation huh
alike looks away
you wanna come up
alike sits on binas twin bed looking around and really taking in the room for the first time
she reaches over and picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf
bina fishes around in a rack of cds
who gave you this
what the bear
alike holds the figurine out bina looks at it over her shoulder
girl my stupid ex boyfriend gave me that
bina opens a cd case and pulls the booklet out
i mean i guess it was at the time
bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the room and hands alike the booklet
anyway this is the other artist i was telling you about
her stuff is like bouncier
a buoyant afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom
bina plops down on the bed next to alike
this is straight
youll burn me a copy
yeah i have a bunch of other stuff too
beat so who do you hang out with
i dont really see you with anybody
alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack
she pulls out her composition book
i didnt mean it like that
i was just asking because i was curious
i dont really like anybody that goes there either
my friend laura used to go there
not now but shes going back
oh because i was just gonna say im going to this house party and you can come if you want to
bina waves her hand at the radio
they play this kind of music
howm i supposed to dress
you dont dress
you just come however
come as you are
can i see
bina snatches the book from alikes hands and starts flipping through pages before alike can answer
but thats mainly old stuff though
this is the one you did today
bina offers the journal back to alike
alike reaches for it
bina pulls it away at the last second an impromptu game of keep away
alike misses again
the girls crack up
bina yanks it away again
alike gives up still smiling
you play too much
seriously its right here
just take it
alike summons the courage for one last swipe
she manages to grab it but bina doesnt let go right away
the girls lock eyes during the extemporaneous tug of war
beaming with her victory alike busies herself with the journal
bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next foray
she dances the moose up alikes arm and plants an exaggerated peck on her cheek with it
the girls erupt into renewed giggles
bina tosses the stuffed animal aside and scoots closer to read over alikes shoulder
whats so private
nothin just my writings
bina studies alikes profile
she leans in and pecks alike on the cheek
alike lets the kiss soak in glancing at bina sidelong
bina leans in again this time planting a long kiss on alikes lips
alike pulls away
bina tenses for the verdict
whyd you do that for
sorry no im sorry
i just umm
i gotta go
i thought sorry
alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door bina flounders in her wake
laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades
a cute puerto rican girl is draped around lauras neck like a personal cheerleader
music blasts from the tv but doesnt drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage
there is a knock at the door
youll get that for me
one of the friends breaks away from the pack opens the door without greeting and walks away
alike is left alone to escort herself in
laura hardly looks up as alike stops at the fringes of the pack
a collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table although no one addresses alike directly
laura slams the table and raises her hands in triumph
i told you
awww we shoulda been done set you
laura slaps hands with her partner
the unlucky pair of partners argue
the personal cheerleader kisses laura on the neck
alike looks away
good game baby
whats good lee
just came to say wassup
whatchu got ty
three maybe four
we goin eight
roars of disbelief from around the table
alike is quickly forgotten in the ruckus
alike circles to lauras side
the personal cheerleader looks her up and down
can i talk to you for a second
now i got to cut you
grab em partner
we gonna run a boston on that ass
to alike yo im busy right now
more raucous laughter from the table
alike endures another few moments of card slapping table pounding dejection before leaning into lauras ear
i really need to talk to you i said later
wide eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table
laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up
alike picks up her face and slips away
thought that was your girl
mind your business
thats what i thought
laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig of water
audrey lies awake in bed
the clock on the nightstand indicates a little past two in the morning
she looks at the sliver of light underneath the bedroom door the sound of arthurs key in the door breaks the silence
arthurs voice in hushed tones
audrey rolls over and faces the wall
alike watches her fathers footsteps break up the light beneath her door
she tosses off her blankets and springs into the hallway
loud whisper hey dad
she is talking to empty air
she eases down the hallway toward the kitchen and the sound of his muffled voice
come on now you know thats not what i want
thats not what im saying
thats not listen to me
are you gonna listen to me
alike stops short outside the kitchen door confused
alike swings around the corner
no not you
into phone hey ill talk to you later alright
my daughters up
arthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his pocket
he fishes a beer out of the fridge
who was that
arthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table
a foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits
what you doing up
just wanted to talk
arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash without reading it
he peels up one side of the foil peeks at the food underneath and launches it into the trash too
dad the plate dont trash the plate
arthur strips off his dress shirt and tie and flings them into the living room
alike rescues the plate from the garbage and carefully lays it in the sink so it doesnt clatter
arent you hungry
you ate at work
no just grabbed some take out
why you asking me all these goddamn questions girl
whats wrong with you
you dont question me
alike starts to head back to her room
im sorry alike come on back
look i got patties
arthur tosses a greasy bag onto the table and pulls out a chair for her
alike sits happily and the two munch in silence for awhile
your mommas worried that uh
want a sip
arthur offers her the beer
alike takes it to the head
i said a sip
arthur snatches the beer from her
alike picks at her patty eating little pieces of crust
whats on you your mind
what if what if
say somebody liked you right
they like you
or they like you like you
say they like you like you
i mean they havent said anything yet
but what if
so what if the person is kinda like a friend but you know they like you more than that
well i think thats the best way to start as friends
but then what if
what if the person is arthur scents the heavy news packed in alikes expressive pause and scrambles to intercept her at the pass
whats his name
what grade is he in
ima look his ass up in the system
wait till your mama finds out
shell be so goddamn happy
alike plays along swallowing her disappointment
arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police uniform out the hall closet
he lays it across the back of the couch and unzips his pants
alike turns her back to give him privacy
say uh theres this new uh womens club up there by the liquor store have you do you you havent heard anything about it right
alike shakes her head no
arthur tucks his undershirt into his pants
called the kitty litter the catbox something like that
nah i never even heard of it
cause you know thats a uh
its a rough neighborhood
you know that right
i had a case over there
you wanna be careful stay away from that element
just in case it ever comes up
ill be careful
i know you will
alike glances back at arthur and sees that hes decent
she scoots back around to face him
arthur smooths his uniform shirt into his pants
dad when you were on the phone earlier
it sounded like
i guess youre headed back to work huh
your mama still up
tell her i had to work
arthur picks up his work tote and kisses alike on the forehead
laura jams a pillow into a t shirt as a makeshift pillowcase as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch
the pier girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her knapsack on the floor
laura tosses the pillow onto the couch
my sister gets home at six so you gotta be gone by then
theres some lunchmeat in there too help yourself
laura pulls up close to the kitchen table
the ged test prep book now dog eared and worn is on the table in front of her
she finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice answers into a spiral notebook
a stack of old math and english textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil
alike spies on bina stuffing books into her locker
she draws her breath and approaches
a long awkward silence
alike leans against the bank of lockers not daring to make eye contact
im sorry about the other day
bina pretends to rearrange books in her locker
things have been crazy
but look im sorry i bugged out
i didnt know that you
i wasnt expecting that
you still coming to the party
i dont know i need to try and catch up with laura
but i do wanna hang out
maybe we could do both
bina smiles and shuts the locker door
beat you could spend the night if want to
avoid the whole curfew thing
arthur coaches alike as she navigates the car to a jerky stop in front of macks liquor store
easy easy now
watch your right hand side
dont ride the brakes though
im getting better
can i drive back
arthur rubs his chest in mock heart attack
i dont about that
youre shaky girl youre shaky
get us some chips and ill think about it
arthur hands alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down out of the car
arthur shouts a greeting to mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door
sock and two other men chit chat nearby
their chatter lowers as arthur approaches
alike bops into the store
i see alikes been running circles around you again
little bit little bit
i still got it though
arthur claps mack on the shoulder and glimpses sock whispering to one of the men
arthur follows the mens gazes over to alike at the potato chip rack
she twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t shirt up over her nose
the smile evaporates from arthurs face
sock peers back at him smirking
arthur starts toward him when alike saunters out between them
we better get going
ill holler at you later
arthur crosses the lot in a bound snatches the car keys from alikes hand and hustles her into the car
get in the car
but you said i could drive i said get in the car
alike frowns then catches sight of the men in front of the store
she slumps into the car and slams the door
arthur piles into the drivers seat
they sit in silence for a moment alike traces the lines in her hands
you know youre daddys girl right
alike avoids eye contact staring out her window
arthur searches her face a moment longer then starts the car and pulls away in silence
audrey reclines on the couch reading a book
the doorknob jiggles and audrey folds the book against her chest pretending to be asleep
arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair not even bothering to approach audreys sleeping form
arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of audreys foil covered plates
he tosses it aside and gathers sandwich ingredients instead
audrey yawns and props herself up on one elbow
oh youre home
i mustve dozed off
how long have you been in
dad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients back into the fridge
did you see the plate in there
this is fine
arthur plops down on an armchair and flips the tv channel to sports highlights
mom scoots over on the couch
theres room over here
you can see the tv better
this is fine
arthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches audreys hurt expression
he winks at her
you and your daughter
have you talked to lee yet
i told you she i talked to alike
like i told you
matter fact shes got a boyfriend
just give her some space
shes hardly ever home in the first place and youre just like her creeping in all hours of the night
both of you
running around like you got something to hide like im the big bad witch and what about me
im home by myself all the time and sharondas getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon i dont have anything to hide
look i told you i talked to alike and everything is fine
did you ask her
dad slams down his half eaten sandwich and stands up
no because i didnt have to
besides i would know okay
if anybody would know it would be me
i know my daughter your daughter
better than anyone else and
so now all of a sudden shes just your daughter
im telling you shes just well i guess i better not fine
have nothing else to say then huh
thats your damn problem youre too much of a damn worry wart
lets hope youre right detective
will you shut the fuck up
audrey jerks to her feet and flings the book aside
im not your dumb damn floozy in the street
and you will not talk to me that way
audrey slaps the sandwich off arthurs plate and storms to the bedroom
arthur sees sharonda peeking from her bedroom door but cant summon any words
sharonda skitters into alikes bedroom
alike is awake hands folded behind her head
sharonda curls up on top of the covers next to her
i know youre not scared
the girls lay silently as they listen to arthur bang around in the kitchen
i hope you know it doesnt matter to me
alike rubs sharondas head and gives her a little squeeze
a mohawked woman yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table turned stage
kids roam from room to room nursing plastic cups
some in elaborate ensembles some in thrift store duds others in plain old jeans but no two people the same
alike clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable as she and bina ease their way through the crowd
in between performers guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and render their voices practically inaudible
bina introduces alike to different people alike is welcomed alike bina point out different performers they laugh and talk in each others ears alike and bina dance wildly in the
middle of the crowd surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies one performer beckons alike up onto the table alike demurs at first then leaps on top of the table
alike drags a giggling bina out of the party and they crash into the open night lights glisten across the hudson river distant orbs reflected in a thousand shimmering faux
stars in weak defiance against the night sky
a sodium vapor glow veils everything in generous haloes making the night more beautiful than it really is
dancing silhouettes laughing playing yelling flying always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house
like puck on a midsummers night like peter pan and his lost boys
among the silhouettes is laura enthroned atop a railing
laura smoking a joint grandly surrounded by an adoring circle a sycophantic harem of four
laura completely miserable as she watches two other silhouettes drawing closer spinning collapsing now righting always connected
alike and bina
bina smiles and snakes her arms around alikes neck
alike too shy to react giggles and folds
laura watches the pair spin and passes to the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows
laura cuffs alike on the neck pulling alikes hoodie up over her face
alikes laugh is tentative at first not sure whether this is play or for real
laura chuckles breaking the ice
the pair slapbox and rough house both missing with wild arcing blows
laura aims a mini charge at alike that lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance away
alike swipes lauras hat
laura claps alike on the shoulder and alike waves to bina
bina waves and smiles
so whatchu you think
shes cool right
laura looks around and shrugs
laura plucks a fresh joint out of her coat and lights it
shes hot right
i told you
it was so tight
im tellin you you shoulda been there tonight
laura takes a puff and offers it to alike
this ones just for me and you
alike waves it off oblivious and intoxicated with the night
and shes smart too
she does poetry you should hear it
its like its good you know
laura stops walking and alike skips ahead still chattering

alike shakes her head
her mouth moves but nothing comes out
because i love you alright
and im sayin

alike is stopped cold as the light bulb finally goes off
laura takes a long drag on the joint
bina and mika stumble over giggling
bina hooks alikes arm
mika kisses laura on the neck
laura snaps out of her gaze her familiar smirk creeping back
we goin to get something to eat
thats whats up
listen umm laura pinches out the joint and hands it to mika who tucks it away
thats for later
bina nice to meet you
we had fun
laura gives bina a polite hug pounds alike on the shoulder and starts to lead mika away
hey hold up
laura pumps a lazy fist in the air in acknowledgement
bina takes alikes hand and slowly drags her away
alike keeps looking back then finally gives up
laura looks back just as alike turns around and disappears around the corner
i like your friends
music videos play on the tv
alike and bina lay stretched out on pillows a plate of brownie crumbs between them
bina smacks her with a pillow
im not sleep
yes you are
alike rubs sleep out of her eyes and props herself up on one elbow
any brownies left
bina flicks off the tv and stares at alike
alike looks away
alike folds her arms behind her head
bina strokes alikes stomach
her fingers dance at the top of alikes pajama bottoms
their eyes meet
alike sits bolt upright
whatre you doing
this is uh
im sorry im trippin out
we dont have to
alike leans in and kisses bina on the lips
bina considers and takes alikes chin in her hand and kisses her back
bina places alikes hand on her chest
alike lets her hand linger then traces binas shoulders
laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the mail
she pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it
the return address reads nys educational testing services
she flips the envelope over and looks around she rips the top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope
the top of the slip reads campbell laura ged testing laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a small wooden frame home
the paint is peeling and the flowers in the window box are dead
a rusted metal mailbox next to the door overflows with circulars
laura lifts the circulars out of the box and trashes them
she picks up a discarded fast food bag and tosses it too
a dog barks from a neighboring yard
laura pulls open the screen door and tries to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main door but its covered over in aluminum foil
laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door
she snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward
laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt
lauras mother and no nonsense opens the door and frowns down at laura through the screen
lauras mother crosses her arms and looks at laura up and down
thought you mightve stepped out or something
howve you been
lauras mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing on laura
laura takes a step closer to the door
me and candy you know were doing real good
lauras mother puts her hand on the doorknob
we might even be moving to a bigger place soon
you know shes workin at the hospital now yeah youd be real proud of her
she might even go back and get her rn laura takes another step forward
you look good
you look healthy yeah you look real good
you know uh we miss you and everything lauras mother starts to close the door
laura backs away
i dont wanna take too much of your time
i just stopped by you know i uh im getting my stuff together too i uh laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and advances on the screen
door again holding it out
so i did it
i took the test and lauras mother slams the door
laura stands on her tiptoes and yells at the diamond shaped window
i got my ged
the lock on the door snaps into place
renewed barking from across the street
silence from the door
laura brushes a fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the mailbox
but listen i i gotta go
i gotta get to work but ima leave it for you to see
it was nice talking to you
laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway
she stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch
she yanks the envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket
laura storms off the porch and out of yard never looking back
alike is asleep on the bed
bina cleans up feverishly accidentally bumping alike awake
alike yawns and rolls over a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers her surroundings
bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in
you up already
its after one oclock actually
bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes hamper and then begins making the bed with alike still in it
alike pulls bina down beside her
nothins wrong im just cleaning up
dont worry about it
okay then ill help you
no i got it
bina snatches a pillow from behind alike and fluffs it
alike still oblivious grins and traces binas shoulder
look um i just wanted to say that last night
last night was amazing
thank you for last night we were just playin around thats all
bina flinches away from alikes touch
alike shoots a glance at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper
we can slow things down
nobody has to know that were together
look if you dont want to call it that thats fine but dont act like nothing happened
bina moves away and levels her gaze at alike for the first time
alike touches binas elbow bina flinches away
look im not gay okay
this isnt me i wasnt im not ready for all this
alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it around on the bed
bina recoils and snatches it away
recognition seeps across alikes pained face
bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on alike
alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on
she pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a sweatshirt down over her nightie
she flings her backpack open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering her things
alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an armful of toiletries dumping them in the bag
bina watches her arms folded
alike takes one last look around the room and heads for the door running a sleeve across her face
alike ignores her and launches into the hallway
bina runs to her bedroom doorway
alike beelines for the front door
bina chases alike across the room
lee stop please
alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running nose and turns to face her
bina takes several steps toward her
alike lets go of the doorhandle her voice cracks
you promise you wont tell anybody
alike rages outside weaving blind fury down the sidewalk
she kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out into the street narrowly missing getting hit by a car
she continues her zag to the other sidewalk her pace quickening
she rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into the air
she tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and flings them into the street
spinning and thrashing she wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another garbage can
she circles back and kicks the can over
she hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of a subway station
lee bursts into the living room and charges to her bedroom
audrey who has been waiting in the living room storms in after her
where in the hell have you been
alike kicks off her shoes and paces the room
you hear me talking to you
where you been
you left binas hours ago
audrey gasps in stunned silence
im not your husband so stop comin at me like i am
im not your companion im not your friend you made that abundantly clear im your daughter and i have my own shit to deal with
lee dont you dare alike i am your mother audrey melts back against the doorjamb
alike slings off her shirt and slams the door in audreys face
a livid audrey bangs on the door and jiggles the handle
you must have lost your damn mind
wait until your father gets home
alike attacks her closet ripping all the girly shirts from the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan
she plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the floor
she launches a pair of pumps into the wall followed by a chunky pair of timberlands
silent sobs rack her body as she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror
she strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner
alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before collapsing onto the bed
she writhes against the pillows and covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist through her body
alike jerks awake in her bed a pillow pulled down around her ears
the sound of a muffled argument leaks from her parentss bedroom
the shouting gets louder and alike sits upright in her bed as her fathers footsteps boom past her doorway and into the living room
audreys voice trails him down the hallway and alike scrambles into a t shirt and shorts
arthurs hand is on the doorknob a small tote flung over his shoulder
audrey blocks the door her hands on her hips
they both look up as alike edges into the living room
you see thats exactly what im talking about
get over here
go back to bed
no you come tell your father what you told me
dont drag her into this audrey
to alike go to your room alike

i am not leaving you
sharonda wake up

audrey shoves arthur toward the door
reflexively arthur raises his hand at audrey
audrey puffs up
i wish you would
look girls your daddys going to beat me
sharonda bursts into tears behind alike
alike hurries sharonda back down the hallway
go in my room and lock the door
dont come out kay
sharonda bawls harder
alike gently closes the door on her
its gonna be okay
arthur and audrey argue viciously
dammit thats not true
look will you stop sayin that
its the truth
alike edges back into the living room audrey wheels on her
arthur is beaten and cornered
your daddys got a new girlfriend
or did you already know that
you know i bet you did
audrey stop it
alike go back to bed
meanwhile your daughters turning into a damn man right before your very eyes and you cant even see it
arthur drops his tote and advances toward audrey leveling a stiff finger at her face
no you take that back
you shut the fuck up about that audrey
arthur gets in audreys face
audrey leers back at him
alike jumps between them
go back to bed alike

dont call her lee
mom stoppit please
tell your dad where you hang out
tell him about your butch ass girlfriend lauras not my girlfriend
what the hell are you talking about
you dont know what the hell are you talking about

alike drops her gaze and backs away
arthurs expression cracks and he tears his focus from audrey to alike
tell me what
im not tellin you nothin
tell him youre a dyke
you tell him youre a nasty ass dyke
no shes not gay
alike we didnt raise you that way baby
eyes still downcast alike just shakes her head and backs away
you shut the hell up audrey
arthur extends his arms toward alike his voice trembling
i know thats not true
you tell your mother right now alike
you tell her it isnt true
alike meets her fathers eyes
dad dont you lie now you tell the truth
you already know
no i dont know
you tell your mother its just a phase
its not a phase
arthur is stopped cold his shoulders slump
see if you wouldve done to alike whats wrong with you
theres nothing wrong with me
this is your fault
if you had arthur tears into audrey spittle flying
dont you scream at me
you this is not my fault
just shouldve been at home more shut up and lemme talk
why dont you do trying to fuckin talk arthur spasms as though hes been stabbed
out of nowhere audreys backhand pistons alike to the ground
she raises her hand high and slaps it down hard on alikes shoulders and arms
arthur turns to stone
say it again
say it again
alike fends off audreys blows with her hands
she kicks angrily as audrey towers over her
im a lesbian
yeah im a dyke
no youre not
audreys blows become more manic and vicious
arthur wakes from his trance and tries to wrestle audrey off of alike
dont you say that
dont you say that
get offa me
you a man now
you gon fight audrey swings and hits alike with a nasty hook to the jaw alikes head snaps back and hits the floor
arthur yanks audrey off of alike
audrey directs her rage at him pummeling his face and chest
tears stream down arthurs face as audrey shakes free and aims one last blow at his face
the rattle of circuit breakers echo through the bare darkness of lauras small apartment
how about now
laura bangs into something in the darkness
a small light flicks to life and grows larger
in its dim glow laura spots alike leaning against a worn couch
the lights become two as laura hands alike a candle
good thing i keep some these around
alike snorts thickly
her words are slurred and nasal
yeah for your many women
hey you thanking em now
laura holds her candle up to alikes grim face
alike wipes at already dried tear streaks on her puffy face and looks down
laura slides an arm around her waist and guides her into the small bedroom
you bring clothes
i stopped by the house i stopped by thats alright man
you can wear some of mine
its okay cmon
lets get some sleep
my sisterll be home in a little bit too
overturned ramen noodle cups litter the floor
laura sips a beer and strokes alikes head who sleeps fitfully in her lap
arthur is frozen in the middle of the living room with a contractor trash bag
he stoops and piles the shards of a broken lamp into the bag one by one
sharonda peeks out at him from her bedroom door
arthur looks up at her and sharonda pushes the door shut
audrey sits at the edge of her bed in a housecoat
her hair is ruffled and flyaway
her ankles are crossed and her hands are dead birds in her lap
her work clothes are laid out in a neat line beside her shirt pants socks and shoes on the floor right underneath
the telephone begins to ring but audrey does not hear it
bina and a high school boy sit on the floor their backs propped against the bed books spread on the floor
the boy puts his arm around bina launching numerous passionate advances but bina pushes him away
the clueless boy continues his clumsy attempts
bina stares out the window completely detached
audrey still in her housecoat stares into the refrigerator transfixed by the mountain of foil covered plates
her eyes are cried out buttons
suddenly she remembers to breathe and her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears
she yanks a foil covered plate dumps its contents into the trash can and tosses the plate into the sink
she dumps another and another her composure returning with each plate tossed
by the time she gets to the last one her breathing slows and returns to normal
she disappears into the bedroom and reappears with the red shopping bag
she calmly lifts out the pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage
she wads up the shopping bag and stuffs it in too
she takes a deep breath and wipes her sleeve across her nose
arthur audrey and sharonda are pegged around the dinner table
audreys make up fails to cover the dark circles beneath her eyes and arthur has a weeks worth of stubble
there is a jagged hole where alike usually sits
noticing the asymmetry audrey bundles up alikes place setting and sweeps it onto the floor
sharonda looks from audrey to arthur then into her plate
you want to say grace
arthur clears his throat
audrey thrusts her hands out to arthur and sharonda
they each take her hand and arthur begins again
dear heavenly father we pray
we pray thank you for this food and we pray
we pray for your continued blessing
arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed
an awkward silence ensues
audrey and sharonda look up at him still holding hands
audrey switches to an overly cheery auto pilot mode babbling to no one in particular
i got this recipe from a magazine
supposed to be very good
and you see i made those green beans you like
sharonda pass the rice please
sharonda staring at her father doesnt reach for the bowl
you know where she is
alike and laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream
sunset paints the cityscape pink and orange
the faint cadence of children playing drifts in and out on a fickle breeze
alikes wounds are healing and she seems happy
the friends exchange wordless smiles and soak in the peacefulness around them
laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate
arthur is standing in the doorway
laura calls out to alike
alike looks up and the smile fades from her face
arthur tries to move around laura but laura stares him down
laura looks back at alike
alike considers then carefully nods
laura steps out of the way and watches arthur pass
alike rises to face her father
she stands tall her weight is centered
arthur struggles to find her eyes and she turns away from him
distant playground voices fill the pause
alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook
laura swings open the door and alike looks back in greeting her smile fading as arthur appears behind her
laura motions to alike
alike considers then carefully nods
laura steps aside and watches arthur pass
alike wanders to the edge of the roof arthur follows
distant playground voices fill the pause
your mother couldnt make it
alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline
arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer
remember our old place
waaay out in queens
it was our first apartment we were so proud
had all those trees around it
in october the whooole block would be covered with leaves
alike makes no sign
you couldntve been more than years old
and when the wind would blow all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive
youd get so scared
youd cry and youd scream and beg for us to pick you up
i would try and tell you theyre only leaves baby and make you stay on the ground
but you were so afraid and you cried so hard your mother would always pick you up
she always picked you up
arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory
he dares a glance over at alike
member how we used to ive been accepted into a early college program
starts in the spring
californias a long way away ten weeks writing boot camp workshops
then i can start summer semester
we can talk about that
i need you to meet with my guidance counselor
sign the paperwork so i can graduate early
im sorry alright
im sorry i let her hurt you i need to know now if youll sign the papers
yes or no
can you forgive me
yes or no
you can always come back home
things are gonna be different i promise you alike holds arthurs hand stopping him
dad im not running
arthurs heart breaks he gasps back a sob
im not going back home
alike nods squeezes arthurs hand
arthur breathes deeply composing himself
he starts to pull away
i better tell mom that she was right
right about what
god doesnt make mistakes
you should tell her yourself
arthur squeezes alikes hand and drifts away
alike inhales the sunset
audrey is cleaned up well dressed and freshly put together
she sits alone at the lunch table crunching an apple
a bible and a daily devotional guide are spread open in front of her
alike knocks on the glass and audrey looks up stunned
alike comes in and sits across from her
audrey glances around concerned about passing coworkers
howve you been
did dad tell you
he told me yes
how are you
audrey gathers her lunch garbage and pushes back from the table
i just hope youre keeping yourself safe
i love you mom
audrey stacks her devotional guide on top of her bible and stands
she starts to speak then crosses to the door instead
i said i love you
ill be praying for you
audrey disappears into the hallway
alike writes in her notebook mouthing the words to a poem
she looks up and studies the horizon from time to time
alike relaxes at a desk reading from her notebook
alvarado sits cross legged on her desk listening
heartbreak opens onto the sunrise for even breaking is opening and i am broken i am open broken to the new light without pushing in open to the possibilities within
pushing out see the love shine in through my cracks see the light shine out through me
i am broken i am open i am broken open see the love light shining through me shining through my cracks through the gaps my spirit takes journey my spirit
takes flight could not have risen otherwise and i am not running i am choosing running is not a choice from the breaking breaking is freeing broken is freedom i am not broken i am free
alike closes her book
the pair reflect in easy silence
the downtown brooklyn landscape hums against the windshield as arthur and alike ride in complete silence
sharonda chews a thumbnail peering over the backseat
laura slumps against the window a smirk hiding at the corner of her lips
laura and sharonda fumble a suitcase out of the trunk of the car
alike shrugs into her backpack
arthur nudges them aside and hefts out the rest of the luggage
i got it
arthur slams the trunk shut
you want me to come in with you
alike shakes her head
arthur starts to back away
well alike pounces on arthur in a surprise hug
arthur squeezes her back
you can always come back home
i love you
i love you too
general chaos as passengers and well wishes scramble for position
let me get a hug or somethin damn
laura squeezes alike first with one arm then pulls her hand out of her pocket to wrap both arms around her friend
call us when you get there
you know i will
laura backs away and wipes a sleeve at her eye
you just better fuckin call
alike disappears through the bus doors
laura slouches on a hydrant and sharonda paces scanning the windows for alike
sharonda waves maniacally
alike musters a smile and puts a hand on the window
laura raises a fist
the bus sails away from the curb
alike leans forward to keep laura and sharonda in sight as long as possible
as she faces front again she glimpses arthur standing in the doorway of the terminal
a passing van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat
an old korean woman next to her offers her a piece of ginger candy
alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep breath
reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across alikes face and she is able to hold back neither the smile nor the tears that come
