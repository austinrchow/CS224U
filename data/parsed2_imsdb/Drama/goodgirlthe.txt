as a girl you see the world like a giant candy store filled with sweet candy and such
but one day you look around and see a prison and youre on death row
you wanna run or scream or cry
but somethings locking you up
are the other folks cows chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll
or are they just keeping quiet like you
planning their escape
camera zooms on holden tom on your left honey
whats that cashiers name
when did he start working here
who is he
what are you doing
its called work princess
kind of fun
you might want to give it a go someday
theres a retail rodeo special on aisle three
liquid drain cleaner
two ounce cans for
liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through your pipes
ladies shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes
liquid drain cleaner on aisle three
have a good day and thank you for shopping at retail rodeo
can i talk to you for a second
i was just curious
have you ever been to a bible study
we got a good one going on every wednesday at the first church of nazarine
rodney comes benita comes
you got any interest in reading the bible
i have my own you know beliefs
we dont preach fire and brimstone
just the ten commandments
were not interested in scaring people
were about loving jesus
i kinda like my nights to myself
well maybe youll have nights of eternal hellfire to yourself
just kidding you
how was your day
how was yours
the wind was flipping paint in our eyes
feel like ive been attacked by hornets in my eyeballs
bubba stand up

damn it phil
including this gorgeous eggplant
i think we got most of it out
you two were stoned
you keep frying your brain liike that youll slip off a ladder and crack open your head bone
you do really stupid things when youre high phil
like sitting on my couch with your big blue ass
everything just turns to shit
you finally get nice things then everything just gets messed up
why is this tv buzzing
its the wind doing that
they the winds coming in different lately

what happens at the end of your book
oh he has a nervous breakdown
goes to a mental hospital
you dont get paid to pick your crack
you get paid to work
im not sure i can do makeovers

a little pancake eyeliner mascara rouge on the cheeks and powder it up
then you take a moist tissue roll it in a ball and toss it in their face
im talking to a tree stump
girl where are you
sorry im just a little tired
its the food you eat justine
look at me
i am years older than you and have times your energy
cause i dont eat meat and i dont eat dairy
its probably why you cant get pregnant honey
and why you have that hung jaw look on your face
its the cheese in your pizza and the chicken in your salad
i went to the doctor
he says im fertile
he says i could repopulate the entire planet
then whats the deal here
did he say you get enough vitamins
he didnt say
you could make paint where at different angles the house is different colours
you stand at the front door and the house is red
you stand at the street and the house is green
or you could make like an invisible paint
make the whole house disappear
what would be really neat is a paint that could change the molecular structure of a house like a chemical acid deal
what do you think teeny
i think you two are a pair of potheads
you getting a whole one of these or a half
that oneright there
you didnt bring this into the store

at the hotel in bed probably after they made love holden gave me two of his stories to read
its like what a story would be
i was about a boy who was put upon his mother was cold and selfish and his father wanted him to play football
other people didnt get him especially girls
then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him
so he starts actin out drinkin and doin all kinds of drugs
at the end the boy kills himself but jumpin over abridge
the second story was pretty much the same as the first
except at the end the boy kills himself by drinkin a bottle of bug poison
your stories are intense
i just wanna leave some kind of legacy
after that i dont care what happens to me
dont say that
i wish there was a story about me
i dont know who would read it though

thats easy for you to say holden you are not married
you just you just gonna give up
you gonna go crawlin back
holden you are gonna get us caught
youre so fucking afraid it makes me sick
dont give up on us
justine goes out of the backdoor of retail rodeo takes a few deep breaths trying not to freak out ill see you tomorrow okay
good luck on your important thing
justine arrives at bubbas
he opens the door and his dog bitz is barking
easy bitz easy bitz
back in your corner
back in your corner
back in your corner bitz
come on in
i wanna show you somethin
yells at dog again im in shock
you know why
bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak
finally when he opened his mouth he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life
he talked about how he loved phil and how he loved me
and how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me and to be a guy like phil to this imaginary girl like me that he never found
then he wen on about givin up your dreams and how its all a part of gettin older
bubba had given up on his dream to be like phil and accepted his fate as bubba always and forever
then last week a door that remained shut swung wide open
bubba thought this no chance coincidence a cosmic force was at work
the sounds of me makin love to a man that wasnt phil was like a shout in bubbas ear from the creator himself
what it meant or what to do or why bubba didnt know
all he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long
i was no longer bubbas image of perfection
to him i was just a liar and a whore and that sickened him
but on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to phil
phil was no superman just a cuckhold and a foll and that was beautiful
bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do
something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle
bubba i am not gonna sleep with you
but dont you see
this is my chance for liberation
but one persons liberation is another persons well badness
theres just no way
im gonna have to tell phil then
hes my best friend
i cant keep him in the dark about somethin this big
hes a cuckhold
you wanna cuckhold him yourself
well thats different
that isnt about him
thats about my salvation
look youve got your choice to make
either destroy your marriage and break your husbands heart
or have sex with me right now
bubba is yelling at the dog again and saying justines name oh god
there was someone in the window
did you not see
i gotta go
phil is never gonna find out about any of this
the dog is still barking get this damn dog away from me
youre lookin at a free man justine
a free man
good for you
yelling at dog again
tv sounds as phil comes out of the bathroom still brushing his teeth im nervous
cause i gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup thats why
what if i cant do it
you can do it
you know if you said youd help me id feel alot less nervous
its gonna be on your lunch hour anyway
you didnt even say nothing about the tv bein fixed
well arent you a fright
justine you talked to holden lately
he didnt show up for work today i wanna know what gives
i know you two are friends
were not friends
you eat lunch together every day
no we dont
well if you see him tell him jack fields is lookin for him
justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees holden in the car more depressed than ever
oh my god
what are you doin
youre a hooker you hooker
i saw you
you followed me
so how many guys you gettin with
you gettin with every guy in the state
no holden this is all because of you
he had me over a barrel
if i didnt sleep with him he was gonna tell phil about us
im so alone
youve gotta get a hold of yourself
are you drunk
yes im drunk
and ill be drunk every day until the day i die
what do you care
you jump on any pecker thats put in front of you
its not what you think
i saw everything
look go home
and meet me after work
where you goin
i gotta help phil with his sperm
i cant share you justine
maybe with one man but not with a whole bunch of em
would you come with me
wish me luck
good luck honey
knock em dead partner
justine and bubba watch phil walk into one of the rooms you look nice
no i dont
i know youre angry and i can figure why
but from where i stand what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing
nothin happened yesterday so drop it
well im awful grateful to ya justine
bubba i mean it
let me just ask you one thing
how do i stack up against phil
you know how do i stack up where it counts
your husband asked me to request for your presence
justine knocks on the door
gets into the room cmon
i cant do this on my own
i need help
youve never done it on your own
not in a place like this
not where i have to hand over the results
just let me hold your boob
holds her boob justines face is full of pain ah theyre sore
justine looks fed up with everything whats wrong with you
you look like death
my stomachs crampin
i feel sore
is it your period
nah its stress
this job is stressful
im breaking out
youre breakin out cause you put so much makeup on your face
maybe youre pregnant
thinks about it you know sometimes i think to myself at least it cant get any worse
but it can
i can worse
as long as you can say youve hit rock bottom you can
oh my god blackberries
a blind man can go deaf
a widow can lose her children
babies starve and they never get food
they never get any food
they just come into the world and they die
calm down holden
i cant calm down
id be easy if i was a hooker like you
i could calm down all over town
i am not a hooker
i know youre not
im in agony
what do you mean why
i thought you hated your life
i mean im depressed but
you are really depressed

ill murder him in his sleep
ill kill my parents ill steal the money whatever it takes
you just just whatever you want as long as its you and me
please dont forsake me justine
i i promise
car is parked somewhere justine and holden are sitting on the car holdens smoking i realized then that holden was at best a child and at worst a demon
if i was ever gonna go straight id have to ditch him
sometimes to get back on the road to redemption you have to make a few pit stops
justine goes up to the blackberry man how much are the blackberries
a tin for two dollars miss
gives her the blackberries there you go
holden and justine are in the car again justines driving have a blackberry
we need a plan
we cant keep livin day to day
we gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick
have a blackberry holden
but theyre dirty
hesitating he eats a blackberry and then smiles theyre sweet
if i could only get my hands on some money someone could just tell me the answer
i gotta do
but if i ever do i end up thinking about it instead
i gotta do
but do what
justine pushes the blackberry hes about to eat away from his mouth what
what was that for
they looked dirty
i i think i saw a bug in them or something
jack talking to holden about something justines talking to holdens parents
im worried about holden
im worried about tom
i just befriended tom recently and now well i think hes mentally ill
he has this idea in his head that weve had some sort of affair
which is crazy because im im married
hes been sayin all sorts of strange things and makin threats
and and i just think he would be better off in a place where people professionals could take care of him
otherwise hes just gonna get himself in trouble

how it all came down to this only the devil knows
retail rodeo was at the corner on my left the motel was down the road to my right
i closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future
on my left i saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks
dirty looks and quiet whisperings
and burning secrets that wont ever die away
and on my right what could i picture
the blue sky the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity
a beautiful never ending nothing
i know where you can find him
hes at the hotel glen capri and hell be there till noon

tv reporter talking about holden killing himself at the hotel retail rodeo
you know that guy
attention retail rodeo employees this is jack fields your store manager
as most of you all know by now we lost another employee yesterday
holden was a thief and a disturbed young man and what happened was a sad thing
perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy like dont steal and dont be disturbed
the important is to move on
like dozens of those who quit
this ones for you holden
i thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies

shot of justine in the bathroom of retail rodeo
shes sitting on one of the toilets shes wearing fake eyelashes and just looks trashy
that day i read the story holden wrote for me
it was kinda different from the other one but kinda the same
it was about a woman who was put upon
whose job was a prison and whose life had lost all meaning
other people dont get her especially her husband
one day she meets a boy who is also put upon and they fall in love
after spending their whole lives not getting got with one look they get eachother completely
in the end the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness never to be heard from again
