written by allan loeb onto which is written in white letters
when business in the united states underwent a contraction
the federal reserve created more paper reserves
the excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a fantastic speculative boom
its a summer day
the heat floats above the pavement
a cab waits in the lot
the large gates of new yorks largest prison open and todays group of newly released emerge
they pass a guard who lifts up a copy of the usa today to reveal the headlines and date that tells us its
amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel
and we know this man
he is gordon gekko
but he is not as slick as we remember
he doesnt have that gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair
no this is a very different version of the man we remember
because now theres nothing behind those eyes
nothing we can read anyway
and he just stands there
coldly watching his recently freed brethren greet their wives and children
reuniting with the people who waited for them
the people who love them
the cab slowly pulls up and gordon holds up a finger
wait a minute
he glares over to the entrance of the lot
waiting for his people
but they dont come
and the cab waits
gordon stands there
in the heat
and completely alone
as the white letters reappear on the screen
as a result
the american economy collapsed
taken from an article about the pre crash
written by alan greenspan
its funny the more we find ourselves slaves of chance
the more superstitious we become
a gorgeous june friday
and that would make andrew zabel one superstitious motherfucker
find andrew zabel mid s shaved head and in good shape
he started every day the same exact way
he would walk his dogs then leave his gramercy park condo at seven am on the dot
as andrew leaves east gramercy park east an impressive building made of white stone
andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella
and he would take an umbrella with him even when there was no chance of rain
as andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the indian clerk a familiar nod
and without saying a word the clerk knows exactly what to give him
hed buy a journal a tin of chocolate altoids and a cold bottle of poland springs water
as andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate
he had timed it out so he wouldnt have to wait more than three minutes for the uptown five train
as andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight from the train coming down the tunnel
i guess you could say that day was like every other
and as the train approaches
holding that wall street journal
the bottle of water and that tin of altoids
except for one thing
andrew zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the track
and as the train slams into us
which holds for an uncomfortably long moment then
money never sleeps graces the screen
and we move down below the letters to find
now filling the screen
its of the dow jones industrial average
its for the year and its down to the right
a circle marks friday june th
follow a blue line back three days and stop
another circle is now formed and matthew goods giant rings out
card june th
the workplace throng
listening to their ipods checking their blackberrys and sipping their starbucks
move with this throng to the matthew good tune under the opening titles past seventh avenue the lehman brothers building
with that giant ticker that rounds the building posting dow
and keep moving
all is normal in the financial center of the universe
land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel then climb up it to the top
to the penthouse office suites
and push in through the window to be in
an impressive office with a degree view of southern manhattan
zabel sits behind his desk
go ahead open it
and across from andrew zabel sits jacob l
who holds his bonus check
on the wall over zabels shoulder runs an electronic ticker with the major indices and just one stock
keller zabel investments
i thought that because of the problems with the credi screw the credit derivative desk i dont understand half the shit they do anyway
zabel forces a smile
but jacob can tell somethings wrong with him
are you okay
zabel doesnt answer
he just nods to the envelope
he opens the envelope and looks down at the check
and he can barely contain his excitement
and we get a good look at jacob now
boyish features that display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in
hes definitely sexy definitely cerebral and definitely winning
im proud of you jacob
and jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the electronic ticker on the wall
princess cut platinum banded five carat completely colorless round center stone with a medium girdle and excellent polish
pull back to be in
jacob inspects the ring then looks up to the fey salesman
yeah its nice
but heres the thing
he looks around the store for a moment then
i want to see the fuck you room
the fuck you room
the room where you sell me a fuck you ring for fuck you money
the private client foyer
and with a big smile
what did i say
two bedroom in a murray hill high rise
jacob watches fox business on his tv
a much nicer much bigger much flatter plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be installed
a promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by cody willard
tomorrow night we explore the excesses of hedge fund managers
different pictures flash on the screen of private jets massive mansions expensive watches and wines
whether theyre spraying a bottle champagne at voile rouge in saint tropez ordering a martini at the algonquian hotel with a diamond on the bottom or eating a gold dusted
hamburger at the wall street burger shoppe
now the flashes are of some of the top hedge fund managers in the business that well see later
one of them is a man named bretton woods
maybe we hold a little longer on him to get a good look
mid s good looking and refined
these cowboys of finance always seem to land on their feet
jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv
he grabs the phone and makes a call
i know youre at the fund raiser tonight but i wanted to say hi
okay best part
getting my bonus check
he grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it
shes in workout gear wearing earbuds obviously just off a run caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger
it was right after i ordered lunch and i remembered that were not seeing each other this weekend
and he finishes his message to her
okay text me yours and ill read them in my sleep
i love you
as jacob disconnects and looks out the window
looking out at third avenue twinkling up into midtown
where the blue line travels down the dow trend line down and to the right then stops on thurs june th
a large space lined with long desks that hold five traders each
each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in front of them
its loud and frenetic
most of the traders are under thirty five its a young persons game
jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk
its larger than the others and anchors the room
this is his domain
fox business plays on each of the screens that line the space ubiquitous
a note when possible business news will be droning from television sets throughout this movie in bg
as it is the current soundtrack of new york these days a trader named willy shouts out
jake glass works is up nine points on earnings you want to unload some
yeah lets get closer to home
a trader named audry turns to jacob
to jacob re willy wheres his hat
willy glares at her
mind your own business audry
i had to wear pfizer on my forehead for a full week
so post it up bitch
willy pleads with jacob
cmon jake its embarrassing
jacob just shrugs
the stock goes down you wear the crown
thems the rules
audry grins in victory
willy shakes his head grabs a marker scribbles something down on a post it then places it on his forehead
it reads i bought toll brothers at and he has to wear it all week
and jacob laughs
now looking up at the electronic ticker
an ultra exclusive club reserved for wall street money men hollywood players gangstas and supermodels
tis whatever you like blares
the dance floor is packed with new yorks privileged draped in prada and dripped in sweat
jacob heads a table of five men who are all in suits
they are all in various areas of finance
a hedge fund portfolio manager a derivatives trader a private equity cfo and a the quant stares at a high class call girl working the room across the way
he then turns back to the guys with
girl like that cost a thousand bucks last year
now its up to five
getting priced out of the hooker bubble
confirming in frustration
goddamn bull markets killing my sex life
they all laugh
its not such a bull market anymore
shell be trading at five hundred soon enough
the laughter dies down
turning to jacob its true
im actually shocked kzi gave you a bonus of that size
private equity cfo nudges hedge fund pm in reference to the woman who just took the seat at the next table
yeah im going long boeing
oh i didnt notice
the is having problems
as hedge fund pm opens a bottle of krug clos du mesnil and pours it into the flutes
to derivatives trader why
why are you so shocked
offering jacob a flute
because theyre in serious trouble
declining the champagne
were not in serious trouble
its a rumor
a woman takes the table next to them and this makes derivatives trader perk up and say
i think goodyear tire is definitely a buy
hedge fund pm checks out the woman
and those tires are real
even more confused
the chart is horrible
somebody color the quant in here
hedge fund pm leans into quant and explains
boeing ticker ba
goodyear ticker gt
oh its like a code
and private equity cfo turns to jacob with
you guys were down three points in an up market today
whatever somebody was adding to their short
as a supermodel now joins the next table
going long starwood
starwoods a buy
figuring it out starwood ticker hot
im more a buyer of
thinks for a minute what the fuck is that
its an exchange traded fund that tracks the guinian franc
okay whatever whats it code for
and quant looks over to the model then back proudly with
gold digger freak show
the guys just shake their heads
jacob and derivatives trader enjoy the summer night
out of all the guys hes closest to jacob
his name is robby
can i ask you something robby
whats your number
you know what i mean
the amount of money you would need to fuck it all and walk away
if you wanted to
do you want to walk away
but one day
i dont know
when i have a family
its just so consuming
so many marriages get wall street divorce lawyers do great in any market
ive thought about it
what i would need
to raise a family live a good life be secure
its not as much as we would think if you move out of new york
and it dawns on robby
when did you buy the ring
jacob smiles at his friends perception
so when are you going to ask her
im going to dc this weekend
i like her for you
shes one of the good ones
did you hear what her father said on charlie rose
jacob shakes his head
something about bear stearns being the first rain drop of the impending mother of all storms
hes speaking at columbia on friday
if its slow enough a few of us might play hookie and check it out
hes the best show in town
and they continue to walk until
tell me what you hear
robby slowly nods
i dont think you want to hear it bro
you worship zabel and its not good
i dont worship him
hes done a lot for me and ive known him a long time
but hes been acting strange lately
just tell me what you hear
that keller zabel is holding toxic waste they cant find a market for
jacob shakes his head
its not true
there are hedge funds with huge short positions
jacob you know better
you know it doesnt matter if theyre rumors or not
and robby stops walking
senior year i couldnt get my mind around how all those dot coms with no earnings were worth billions of dollars and you were the one who said something that
made it all clear for me
i dont remember
turning to jacob with
an assets value can only be priced at its perception
i said that
so buddy it dont matter if the rumors are true or not
because in this climate
if they exist at all
then most likely
looking his friend head on
youre going to cease to
jacob leaves his murray hill building apartment and nods to his doorman diego
j to the acob morning to you brother
and jacob waits for the morning joke
okay whats the best aphrodisiac on wall street
i dont know
diego cracks up
jacob just shakes his head and moves on
and jacob walks uptown
deep in thought
its a gorgeous june friday
suddenly jacob just stops walking and stands there for a long moment
coming to a decision
and as jacob turns around and starts heading the other way
jacob smiles to the doorman
im here to see andrew zabel
is he expecting you
the elevator opens and andrew zabel appears with two adorable bichon frise puppies
im sorry to come by like this but the rumors are now hitting a fever pitch and i wanted to make sure everything was okay
zabel nods and heads for the door
as they enter through the gates of the park and walk
is everything okay
and andrew zabel doesnt seem all there
introspective and blank
i remember when the starter gave me this bushy hair twelve year old kid and i said donny what the fuck give me a real caddy
and he said this kids the best
and you were
you had the wind down the grade of every green
whats going on
but you wouldnt shut up about stocks
twelve years old and you blabbed on and on about companies and sectors and earnings
andy are we going under
what was that piece of shit you loved
that airline equipment supplier who was branching out into car airbags flour controls
are you okay
what a dog
why did you give me that bonus
zabel stops walking and faces jacob with
because i know you jacob
and i know youve been holding off because you didnt think you had enough
we all do that
postpone life until we believe we have what it takes to actually live it
there isnt a better money runner on the street
well get through this
marry her jacob
and have children with her and spend as much time as you can with them
and never forget that thats whats important
and jacob l
looking his boss head on
andrew if theres anyway i can help give back the bonus whatever
all you have to do is say the word
and zabel just looks away
theres just so much you dont know jacob
the normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and sober today
they all watch alexis glick report
rumors of insolvency have hit the street concerning kzis books and theyre shooting first then asking questions later
the stock is now trading just a bit over thirty one dollars a share down almost forty four percent on the session
and standing in the center of the floor watching this
his universe becoming unglued
and he turns to audry
helpless and in shock
who did this to us
she can only shrug
tears in her eyes
jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floors electronic ticker on the wall
and he moves for the elevator banks
unable to take it anymore
furious jacob walks down th ave with his phone to his ear
andrew call me back
im going to find out who did this to us
i swear to god
if its the last thing i do
were going to bounce back from this
and were going to find out who spread the rumor
and then were going to destroy them
he disconnects the call and keeps walking
after a beat with his anger brewing
jacob slams his phone down on the ground and it shatters
jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling
fox business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall
footage of the governor of new york a tough looking man in his s speaking to the press outside of the state capitol
i dont know anything about the solvency of keller zabel
i do know that whats bringing down the stock at this precise moment are rumors
and this practice of short selling american financial institutions then floating rumors in order to profit from them must be stopped
the uptick rule must be reinstated
jacob glares over to the tv
and once again i will point to largely unregulated world of hedge funds
an ever growing and increasing powerful area of the market that i repeatedly tried to regulate as chairman of the sec
and theres a loud knock on the door
jacob ignores it
and the collapse of this legendary new york financial institution is why i continue to fight that battle as governor of this great state
this time louder
jacob mutes the tv
from the door
answer the door
jacob gets up moves slowly and answers the door
you werent answering your phone
robby sharply nods
he stops short
i just found this out and it hasnt hit the press yet
he stops short and looks away in frustration
robby what are you trying to say
andrew zabel threw himself in front of the subway this morning
jacob just stands in that doorway
no reaction at all
jacob now stands in the center of his apartment
completely in shock
as he looks to the plasma
fox business on mute
brian sullivan reporting under the graphic kzi
he glares at it for a long moment then
almost calmly picks up a chair and throws it into the tv
not sure what to do
he turns and sees
on the dresser
a gorgeous engagement ring sitting in an open box
a fuck you ring
as jacob bounds the steps of the business school and heads into the old stone building
the lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students
jacob stands at the back
a professor is at the podium
our speaker today has quite a checkered background in the world of finance
some laughter from the room
he graduated from city college in and became a securities broker at hudson river bank then moved on to smith barney
in he went out on his own to establish a spectacular career as a independent trader then an active participant in the lbo craze of the s
in he was indicted for insider trading and then charged with other various forms of securities fraud and irs violations
in one of the most harshest sentences ever given to a white collar criminal
he served fourteen years in a maximum security prison and he wants me to stress that it was not a country club
again laughter from the floor
since his release in he has written and has spoken publicly about what he refers to as the current state of the world economy
he is not allowed to trade on the us exchanges
his new book moral hazard
why wall street has finally gone too far
comes out in october
the room applauds
and out to the podium slowly walks
no swagger in his step
not in a suit
hair not slicked back
but still looks fucking good
as he waits for the applause to wind down
and even a little longer
surveying every corner of the large room
commanding its full attention
holding the silence
he leans into the mic and says
youre all pretty much fucked
the room breaks into laughter
gordon smiles and waits for it to die down
whats not funny is whats happening out there
i dont think people get it
and i know the financial center of the world doesnt get it
which happens to be washington dc now
as he takes to a pace
to understand where we are we need to understand how we got here
no good deed goes unpunished all fires start with a well meaning spark and we wanted americans to be able to afford homes
sounds nice enough
lets try to get the middle and lower classes into homes they can own
so we made money cheap and lowered restrictions on mortgage lending
as he takes a moment and looks over the room
somebody reminded me the other night that i once said greed is good
i swear i dont remember it but it sounds like something i would say in the eighties
and i was right then
greed was good
america needed greed and risk taking and leverage to get to become the superpower we are
and capitalism needed greed and risk and leverage to become the economic platform it has become
but those same attributes that got us there are now the liabilities that threaten to destroy us
jacobs blackberry vibrates and he checks it
he has a text
so greed has been redefined
who knows maybe it was always like this and like everything else in this world its good and it is evil
taking a moment to survey the room
because people its greed that caused someone who aspires to own a seven hundred thousand dollar house they cant afford to take on a loan theyll never be able to
and its greed that caused their mortgage lender to give them that loan then sell it right away
and its greed that caused the buyer of that loan to slice it into a million little pieces then spit them all over the world
and its greed that caused the rating agency to give that toxic loan a triple a rating just because it was mixed in with some good loans
and its greed that caused the insurance company to insure that loan
jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks the quote kzi
they were insuring the end of the world when the world explodes
just find us in the rubble and well be sure to pay your claim
drawing in a deep breath
cmos clos cbos cdos cdss spes abcps sivs remics cmbss toxic traunches ninja loans credit default swaps affinity marketing stapled financing synthetic securitization
maybe i was in prison too long but i have no idea what half that shit means
the room laughs in agreement
and im considered a pretty smart guy when it comes to finance
and jacobs blackberry vibrates again
this time he removes it from his pocket doesnt check it and simply turns it off
and if i know our central bank which i do i predict its going to throw gasoline on this fire with more cheap money and federal bailouts and statistics on
productivity and inflation
and gordon stops pacing
takes a moment for effect
then sums it all up with
so no good deed goes unpunished and all fires start with a well meaning spark and when you take free money and no lending standards then add it with unaccountable
risk and ungodly leverage and unbridled greed
what you end up with is cancer
and gordon takes in a deep breath
systemic malignant and global
now the room is completely silent
do they still have the v t restaurant on amsterdam
is that still there
a stunned girl in the front row shakes her head
with a smile god i loved their pizza
jacob looks on as gordon is surrounded by professors and students alike
announcing to the throng ill give you six minutes then i really have to go
gordon quickly walks out with his publisher a woman in her s and heads into the quad
jacob immediately matches their stride
gekko can i speak to you for a moment
as he keeps walking
youre too late sport
q as over
my name is jacob moore and im dating your daughter
im going to ask her to marry me
and this makes gordon stop and finally face jacob with
ill give you nine minutes
as gordon and jacob leave the campus and take to the street
then you have my apologies
stocks in a free fall
my guess is that it just lost its bar mitzvah
jacob quickly takes out his blackberry turns it on and checks to see gordons right
by the end of the day it might not even be potty trained
and jacob looks at him
i might not be allowed to trade jake but i still love to watch from home
andrew zabel took me under his wing when i was in high school
he basically got me my scholarship to yale then hired me right out of business school
andrews smart he beats the benchmarks consistently
hell land on his feet
and gordon stops walking and regards jacob
he killed himself this morning
as that registers
im sorry to hear that
he was a father to me
and jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into gordons eyes
genuine and lofty
i love your daughter very much and i would be honored if
and realizing what this is
gordon starts to laugh
which throws jacob off
you would bless i really dont understand what you find so funny
my daughter hasnt spoken to me for eleven years and you know it
she blames me for her brothers overdose and every other disaster thats fallen upon the world since the mid nineties
and by the way isnt it strange that winnie would date a guy from the street
she hates me
and she hates wall street and everything it represents
so dont you find it curious that she would fall in love with you
and that slams into jacob
whos frozen for a beat
jacob finally snaps out of it then joins gordon
so you want my blessing
i guess i should know a little about you first
where did you grow up
it wasnt like that
i mean we didnt have much money
my mother was a tailor
and your father
what did he do
and gordon regards jacob for a long moment taking him in until
jacob looks down the street
what are you looking for
your town car
with a laugh
as gordon pats jacob on the back
then youre going to be looking for quite awhile
and heads for the subway
gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard
jacob notices a picture of winnie in the wallet
can i see that
gordon shrugs and shows the picture to jacob
its of a young winnie and younger gordon on the back of a gorgeous white horse
she was eight in that one
it was taken in egypt
she doesnt keep pictures from her childhood
gordon slowly nods
what do i get in return
wanna make a trade
and gordon thinks about then
ill give you this picture and in return
id like a picture of winnie
without you in it
i dont have one on me
gordon sighs takes the picture out of his wallet and hands it to jacob
then ill give you this one on margin
as they wait for the train
jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show gordon the ring
i really did come to ask for your blessing
no you didnt
as the train arrives
its so typical
inside of an ironic laugh levered to the hilt
and with the ship going down
as he gets on
they still gave you a bonus
gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall
and he doesnt look at jacob when he says
dont play me jake
you dont think i can see it in your eyes
you dont think i know that look
i know it by sight kid
because i lived it for years
christ i can even smell it on you
smell what on me
jacob just looks away
some hedgehog said bad things about your company
it caused the stock to plummet and made those bad things become true
and jacob now sees the poster that has gordons attention
it features a pile of money being blown out the window under the caption that reads
if this looks familiar to you
its because youre renting
the man you loved like a father threw himself in front of the uptown five this morning and you want to bring that hedgehog to their knees
you knew he was dead
low down payments
like i said i still love to watch from home
and now gordon turns to face jacob with
so dont insult me by pretending to ask for winnifreds hand when what you really want to know is who to bring down to their knees and how to do
and jacob swallows that back
doesnt argue it
i know who
it was either nassim tariq from the frontier fund bretton woods from locust or karen molina from esl
does winnie even know you came to see me
well not exactly
but im going to tell her
not such a grand idea pal
off jacobs confusion
see i have a feeling youre going to want to see me again
and if you tell her we had this little pow wow
shes not going to let that happen
as jacob considers that
the train slows to a stop
look you seem like a smart kid
walk away dust off your resume and get another job
as he steals one last glance at that guardian mortgage ad
but do it quick
and with that gordon moves for the doors
but jacob steps in front of him
im going to bring them down
whoever floated the rumor for a quick buck
its not worth it
its a waste of energy and time
see jacob nobody gets it
they never did
as the subway doors open
if theres one thing i learned in prison its that money is not the prime commodity in our lives
and your nine minutes are up
and gordon gekko gets off the subway
leaving jacob on the train
but right before the doors close gordon stops and turns with
there are worse ways to go than jumping in front of a train
for instance could you imagine taking something for your diabetes
as the doors close
and end up having it cause you to die of acute pancreatitis
and as the subway pulls out of the station jacob moore just stands there
holding the pole and wondering what the hell that was supposed to mean
a victorian estate on a bluff
zabels funeral in progress
hundreds of people made it out from the city
andrew didnt have children so he made all you all of us his children
and to list andrew zabels many accomplishments would take me far too long to enumerate but if you just look around you youll see those accomplishments in the faces of
the many people gathered here today
and we pan the procession of mourners
the alumni of the morris high school class of
who through the adopt a grade program andrew pledged to pay the college educations of every member who graduated and got accepted into a university
the members of the saint helena symphony who andrew provided emergency funding for when they were facing extinction
and the many many other recipients of andrew zabels generosity
those who were left behind
those who were overlooked
those who otherwise would never have stood a chance
and we land on jacob l
above being just a great financial mind
or a great husband
he wears a dark suit
and a blank expression
or a great father
or a great neighbor
or a great friend
with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes
andrew zabel was a great man
most of the guests across the pool eat and quietly mill about
were with jacob willy audry and another trader named two dollars a share
the fed didnt give us a choice
jacob walks around the room
taking in the pictures of andrew zabels life
does that include the building
what about the zabels institutional managed fund
how much is in that
and thats all intact
jesus united bancorp made out like a bandit
we couldve handled it at a share or even
he just shakes his head
it was that fucking rumor
it was so well timed
and the market doesnt care
shoot first ask later
united has a huge trading desk
yeah were all out of a job
jacob pulls away from the wall of pictures
my mother was a tailor
they all look at him
out of our house less than five miles from here
youre from matinecock
i thought you didnt grow up with mon jacob confirms
we werent rich
everyone else was
she altered their clothes and i carried their golf clubs
and jacob looks at a picture of andrew zabel one more time
he gave me a seat at the table
jacob heads for the main house
he sees barbara zabel andrews wife sitting next to the some friends
jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him
wobbly and full of tears
jacob takes her into his embrace
through her sobs you were a son to him
squeezing her tight
fighting back a rush of emotion
i was a fucked up kid i was angry my mother couldnt control me
he was the only one who cared
i wouldnt be anywhere right now if it wasnt for
and jacob moore stops short
finally breaking down
allowing his own tears to stream down his face
he pulls away
if you need anything
and jacob moves away from the people and moves across the lawn
but he stops when he sees a woman standing across the way
weve seen pictures of her
shes in her late twenties with a natural beauty that might take two glances to notice
but after that second glance
shes winnie gekko
as she rushes to him
jacob im so sorry
why didnt you tell me
lehigh had the committee hearings and i knew he would need you and i didnt thats not how this works
and she looks into his eyes
jacob thats not how this works
regards her for a beat then
will you marry me
i got a ring
not on me but are you proposing to me at a funeral
i had a whole thing i was going to do in dc but seeing you
the words just kind of fell out of my mouth
i dont know
he wouldve loved you doing this here
and she softly kisses him and squeezes him tight
tears in her eyes
ill marry you jacob
hugging her back
by the way i dont have a job anymore
glittering in all its glory
pull back to be in
winnie looks up from the ring
its too expensive
well return it
jacob i dont care about what ring you give me
you know that
were not taking it back
i worked hard for that ring and i want you to wear it
she regards him
he moves to her
takes the ring and places it on her finger
then jacob pulls her into his kiss
its almost violent
shes taken off guard
and as they fall into each other then back onto the bed
the whole floor is dead
the tvs are off
jacob cleans out his desk audry cleans hers out as well across the way
jacob wipes his forehead and glances up at the large letters on the wall keller zabel investments
and he shakes his head in anger and frustration
she looks up
you cover pharm and biotech
who are the big players in diabetes treatments
lilly abbot osi inverness
is anyone riding on something in phase three
few midcaps maybe
you want me to check
she turns on her computer and takes a seat
oh this takes me back to when i had a job
he stands over her shoulder
yeah amlyn pharmaceuticals has byetta going in front of the fda next month
i remember this
they pulled it during phase two because some of the test subjects died but theyve obviously solved those problems now
how did they die
i dont remember
that was it
jacob shakes his head
how did he know
without answering her
can you look up large institutional ownership
mutual or hedge
locust fund owns a shitload
and she looks over to jacob with
as he takes in that information
want your severance audry
and he kisses her on the forehead
short amlyn pharmaceuticals
as jacob peruses the paintings that are going up for auction with hedge fund pm
what the fuck is pancreatitis anyway
a private gym on greene street
as jacob spars with a blogger from streetaccount
i dont know exactly but its not something you wanna come down with
square feet of space exposed brick and minotti furniture
a private wine tasting is being held
about fifteen people look on as the sommelier describes the details of the bottle hes uncorking
near the back find jacob standing with a morgan stanley whispers to jacob whens the fda coming down with their decision
as they stand in front of a huge sigmar polke
any day now
while showering jacob with quick jabs
wheres your information from
holding the wine hes supposed to be sampling but not drinking it
a doctor thats very close to the trials
and thats all i can say
as they move on from the polke
but listen im out of work now so i cant afford to get behind size on this trade
im only telling you because youve helped me in the past
as he removes his head gear and wipes away the sweat
this is completely off the record
as they receive the next glass of wine
dont tell anyone
jacob gets off the train and sees her across the platform
and as he brings her into his embrace
jacob and winnie have dinner with her boss senator katherine lehigh s
your boys coming up in the polls
senator lehigh nods
theyre blaming this mess on the current administration
its helping us
and some people say that the worst isnt over
whats the word he uses
winnie looks over to jacob
when did he say that
and jacob takes for an extra long moment
holding her look
then comes to a decision and lies
on charlie rose
but winnie continues to glare at him
with a smile okay so whens the big date
as new york opens for business
the prevalent pay site for all hedgefunders trading desk cowboys and large individual players
looks like a scrappy internet start up with mismatching cheap office furniture
as our blogger from the gym sips his coffee fires up his computer and starts to type
a small well appointed two bedroom in cleveland heights
jacob wakes and leans up
he regards winnie sleeping next to him
he softly kisses her neck
she smiles in her sleep then rolls over
as their bodies intertwine
a huge industrial space in the highline district that houses this eight billion dollar hedge fund
find a meeting in progress with all of the fund portfolio managers
this is known as the weekly idea storm session
where each pm pitches new trade ideas
as hedge fund pm stands up to present to the team with a confident smile
dressed for work winnie heads into the bedroom and regards jacob still laying in bed
she kisses him on the forehead lays a section of the washington post on his chest with a little laugh then goes
as jacob looks down to see
its the classified jobs section
midtown corporate high floor
find the private client portfolio manager we remember from the wine tasting
he sits at his computer in a big corner office with a beautiful western view to the river behind him and types in an im window amln short fda to
deny byetta then hits send
as he receives the digital receipt
instant messages sent
as jacob munches toast and watches fox business in his underwear
another stock thats getting beaten before the bell is amlyn pharmaceuticals
the stocks down nine percent in premarket trading on no news
when we come back we have blue star airlines ceo bud fox discussing how he turned his once small regional airline into the countrys third largest carrier
a select group of financial journalists sit in small metal chairs in front of a podium with the amlyn name and logo behind it
as the investor relations officer heads up the podium and opens his prepared statement
jacob watches happy hour on fox business as winnie opens a bottle of wine in the kitchen
she pours a glass of wine and another of water
if he wins
she has a real chance for a cabinet position and im pretty sure shell take me with her if she can
hes going to win
as she hands him the glass of water
dont jinx it
and jacob sees amlyn pharmaceuticals graphic on the screen and turns up the tv
big drop in amlyn as negative rumors on the street forced the company to admit there are still internal concerns about byetta and pancreatitis
they now may be forced to pull the phase three drug from fda review and retool
the stock takes a twenty eight percent haircut
can we watch something else
jacob brings her in and kisses her
whatever you want
her phone rings
as she goes to answer it
not project runway
picking up the phone
who is this
as she pulls the phone away from her ear and looks over to jacob
its for you
someone named bretton woods
jacob rounds west nd street and stares down the hottest new address in manhattan
a little nervous he sucks in a deep breath then heads into the building
a butler lets jacob in
jacob takes in the massive space with an insane view of central park
he can hear a beautiful sonata playing in the next room
im here to see bretton woods
the butler nods then leads jacob through the full floor unit and into the
a huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room
a fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass featuring that park view on the other
and jacob realizes that sonata is live
hes walked into a recital of some sort
about twenty people sit watching a young girl play on a very unique looking silver grand piano
the girl cant be a day over thirteen
shes playing mozarts ronda alla turca
her fingers gliding across the keyboard in precision her eyes closed in inspiration
its as spectacular as it is moving
jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room
all ethnicities and types
the african leader in full tribal gear the disheveled artist with his gay novelist lover the new york knick with his model wife the movie star with her teenage son
and bretton woods
mid s slicing jawline deep set eyes in great shape refined composed and masculine
hes the owner of this penthouse and hes looking right at jacob
jacob looks away
and the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata to applause
the guests all stand some go talk with the girl
bretton heads over to jacob
as you can see im having a little dinner party here but i thought it was important we speak right away
he speaks with a british accent
bretton looks over the room for a moment scans his guests then back at jacob
if you dont mind waiting in my office ill be in a minute
and the butler is already at jacobs side motioning him to follow him
jacob waits for bretton
he looks over the place
the view of the park
the classic furniture
of a giant man like monster eating a much smaller naked human
the smaller mans heads been bitten off and blood drips down the body
jacob holds on the painting
saturno devorando a sus hijos
as jacob turns to see bretton standing in the doorway
saturn devouring his son
bretton heads in and closes the door behind him
do you collect
sitting behind his desk
only the obsessive compulsive or the insecure egotistical feel the need to collect things
bretton just looks at him
making him nervous
your daughters an amazing piano player
that was quite a show
that wasnt my daughter
that was isabel patrovsky shes the worlds greatest living piano prodigy
and that wasnt a show
that was a very expensive private recital
theres a long beat of silence with jacob just looking at bretton
taking him in
and its unmistakable the one thing that this man exudes above all else
you cost my fund three hundred and forty million dollars today
off of jacobs slight smile
yeah kills my year pushes my watermark higher and might cause redemptions
i hope youre happy
my funds in trouble now
jacob just shrugs
you dont want to deny it
who told you
a doctor i know
i checked with all the desks in town
you didnt make money off it
then why did you do it
you destroyed my firm
your firm destroyed itself
you killed andrew zabel
andrew zabel killed himself
and bretton sighs
the rumors were true
you made them true
no jacob being levered thirty eight to one in toxic debt made them true
institutional money running was zabels talent
he didnt have a down year in the last twenty
jacob just glares at him
his fatal flaw was allowing the children on his mortgage security desk to talk him into the deadly game of hot potato everybodys been so fond of playing recently
and jacob holds brettons look for a moment then
heads for the door without saying a thing
come work for me
jacob stops and turns
i run three billion dollars
come help me run it
and jacob takes a beat
because your loyalty desired revenge your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off
as he stands
and as for andrew zabel
there really is no telling why he did what he did
as far as im concerned it was just a bit of money
and there are surely more important things in the world
and jacob sucks in a deep breath containing his anger
now im going on safari with my family
think about the offer and get in touch after the july th holiday
heading for the door
you got my attention jacob
and thats one of the rarest commodities out there
and jacob just regards him then
you can have my answer now bretton
i have no interest in working for a fund thats in trouble
holding brettons look
whats your number
the amount of money you would need to be able to walk away from it all and just live happily ever after
everybody has one its an exact number whats yours
and bretton takes a moment to think about that then simply says
and disappears into his penthouse
jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by
you know what i overheard a guy say yesterday
i know youre going to tell me
this markets just like a divorce
ive lost half my money
only i still have my wife
as he goes into the hot summer day
jacob heads up to the restaurant to find gordon gekko waiting outside
theres a wait
fifteen minutes she said
no thats not okay
because it means theyre crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended
the sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine
the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine
i told you id have lunch with you
not give you a hundred and six minutes of my time
jacob just stands there
lets go to whole foods
gordon and jacob share a little table out front of the market
gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while jacob doesnt eat
did you eat before
just not hungry
i used to not eat lunch too
jacob nods and slides something across the table
the picture of winnie in workout gear flipping the finger
gordon looks at it and laughs
as he places it in his pocket
thatll make it a round trade for us
i actually owe you one now
off gordons look
i crushed him
his fund is bleeding
i wouldnt be surprised if the redemptions finish the job
you seem awfully proud of yourself
howd you know about amlyn
its amazing what information you can find out when people know youre not going to trade on it
so you didnt use me to make a little money
and never to look up from his lunch
i prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it
whyd you give it to me
youre out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter
i figured you could use the money
i didnt make any money off of it
you didnt trade it
with a smile in and over the top faux innocence
that wouldve been insider trading mr
gordon just shakes his head
and not most likely
winnie and i are engaged
as gordon finally looks up from his burger
as they walk up park avenue
so did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship
jacob doesnt say anything
and gordon doesnt press
so im guessing shes not going to take your last name
thats my winnie
i knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that mrs
claus didnt get enough credit
and this makes jacob smile
my brother has two daughters
i had winnie and rudy
sucking in a deep breath and since rudy
well ive worried about the name
its something you dont really think about until you hit sixty or so but its important
as they walk some more in silence until
i want you to get my daughter to accept me back into her life again jacob
jacob slowly nods
because save for the extremely precious and depreciating asset of time
shes all i have
as gordon stops in front of a georgian style pre war building and turns to jacob
cmon ill show you some more pictures of your fiancee that she doesnt want you to see
gordon and jacob get into the elevator gordon pushes
the doors begin to close but someone gets on at the last moment
hes a hedge fund type real slick reminds us of gekko twenty years ago
and hes about years old
slick hits his floor
sky still falling
you know it
inside of a derisive sigh sells books i guess
no doubt about it this is a nice place
worth three million dollars maybe four at the beginning of the year
large framed photographs line the walls
gordon shows jacob pictures of winnies childhood
she refused to take that cowboy hat off
she actually slept in it
smitten jacob looks at some more of the pictures then stands
taking in the large framed pictures on the wall
as jacob checks out a framed chart for gouda tulip bulbs dec to feb
the chart goes straight up and to the right then straight down in a single line
the art of a bubble
bretton offered to hire me
and did you accept
as jacob moves over to an another piece
jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from the early s
its of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars
one of the men is uncle sam dressed in us flag colors
but sams very small in this cartoon
cant really row the boat
the other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy rowing
he single handedly stopped the panic of by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing
everyone else quickly followed like lemmings
re political cartoon see people had stopped looking to their government or trusted advisors
they looked to jp morgan
it was all about simple psychology every crash should have a jp morgan to step in and save it
as they walk the hardwood floor
the best opportunities are found where angels fear to tread
and they arrive at the next piece on the wall
a small framed bond
thats a bond issued by the central american country of poyais
gregor mcgregor made a fortune dealing these to the british elite in
the country didnt exist
and now jacob notices a very strange picture across the room
he goes over to look at it
its very old
black and white
of a woman filling her stove with money
weimer republic of germany
inflation turned to hyper inflation and it was more efficient to burn the money for heat than spend it
as they both hold on the picture
what caused it
a country in debt
that took on even more debt to fund a war
then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial imbalances
as he turns to face jacob
and you honestly think this is where were heading
looking jacob head on
if we dont take our heads out of the sand
its going to get bad out there champ im not going to lie
even the small regional bank i started out at might go under
hudson river bank
and ive got some news for you
he aint bleeding
hes not even cut
what are you talking about
what im talking about jake
is that id bet dollars to donuts that bretton woods unwound most of his position in amlyn last week
that he knew about the pancreatitis
off of jacobs confusion
the only reason you think you hurt him is because he wanted you to think that
how do you know that
but its not brettons first rodeo
and my instincts for this sort of thing dont often disappoint
jacob cant believe it
and with each passing moment of realization
shock turns into rage
i cant believe it
believe it princess
hes beating your ass all over the court
as jacob tries to calm himself
and you think i should take the job bring him down from the inside
gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and
i dont know jake
what you kids think is pay back these days is really incredible
when i was coming up we slaughtered men
there are guys still working at penny ante brokerages in the poughkeepsies of this country because they crossed me
while jacob processes that
so ill make you another trade jake
ill help you bring him down if you help me get her back
as jacob just looks away
then you both can have a father
as jacob walks
on the phone with
jacob i could lose my job
who holds his sleeping infant in his hands
robby i need to know
now nobody moves size in this town without using your desk
well play twenty questions only itll be two questions and all you have to do is say yes or no
capitulating with a sigh
the locust fund
did they make any major moves in the last few weeks
was it unloading amlyn pharmaceuticals
robby i got you the fucking the job
and after a long moment
jacob stops walking
sucks in a deep breath
im sorry to make you do that
with that he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration
and after a moment jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes another call
into the phone okay gordon
youve got yourself a trade
as a circle forms on june th then travels down the trend line to early july and stops
and as a circle is formed around july th we
exploding over the capitol building
a bbq for the political set and their families
paper plates and plastic cups are being thrown away by help children and parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks
jacob holds winnie as they look up at the sky
my parents would always throw this huge party in the hamptons on the fourth
the city of south hampton would have its firework show at pm then my father would wait until it was over then put on his
which of course was always twice as spectacular
she leans up sips her wine then
then one year the city passed an ordinance that their firework show had to be the last of the night
they were sick of getting shown up by gordon gekko
whatd he do
he rented a barge and shot the fireworks off of it a mile off the coast
out of jurisdiction
almost to herself the show was even more amazing over the water
and jacob looks at her
i think he should be invited to the wedding
winnie hes your father
as the fireworks explode into their finale
you dont know him
i know hes unhappy
look at him out there
trying to scare everybody
hes desperate for attention
this is none of your business
thats not how this works
she just looks away
hes got nothing
the firework show ends and everyone applauds
and thats what he deserves
suddenly everyone begins to look over to the house where something is happening
the things that came out after he was convicted
the things he was recorded saying
secret service personnel wearing ear pieces start walking the lawn
this wasnt the man we knew jacob
she stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the action is
it was a long time ago
he stands and kisses her
just consider it okay
thats all im asking
she holds his look for a long moment then
nodding over to all the excitement
cmon you can meet the next president of the united states
a massive foyer of black marble with wall to wall views of manhattan
theres much more space than furniture here
jacob waits patiently in a white suede chair
he checks his watch and sighs
hes been sitting here quite awhile
finally the six foot tall receptionist leaves her desk
her heels clicking as she walks over
are you ready
jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators
the doors open and jacob gets on
jacob stands there with six foot
do you have everything they said youd need
holding a folder of his previous tax forms his passport and other documents obviously needed for the job
and the elevator doors open
but not to an office
jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight
then looks to realize that hes on the roof of the building
and in front of him is
an augusta a e helicopter with the locust fund written on the side
as jacob looks down to the city below wondering where the hell theyre going
jacob emerges from the augusta and looks across the tarmac to see a boeing with the locust fund written on the side
and now jacob knows why he needed his passport
as the dives down toward biggin hill airfield
the lights of london twinkling to the north
the black maybach limousine pulls up out front of a square foot victorian home with the perfectly restored brick exterior
as jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible home
the design is much different that woodss new york cpw penthouse
its more classical
with dark woods and worn leathers and thick rugs and commanding views along the river thames
and jacob is lead into the
where bretton eats alone at the head of the long table
as jacob walks through the expansive space
i thought we were going to meet in new york
and i thought you had no interest in working for a fund that was in trouble
i was emotional
i was angry
and what changed
i caught a glance of my portfolio
and bretton laughs
jacob notices two huge chocolate brown french mastiffs sitting at brettons feet
dogue de bordeaux
bred to kill
but contango and backwardation here are socialized since birth so theyre harmless
you named your dogs after technical futures market terms
and bretton stands
of course not
with a wink my children did
as he heads into
a fire burning in the fireplace
jacob follows bretton in
and where are your children
bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player on it
greece with my wife
my boys are studying the iliad now
while bretton looks through the various sleeves of records contango and backwardation slowly find their way into the room and sit by the fire
bretton finds what hes looking for
removing the record from its sleeve
here it is
one of the most beautiful pieces of music youll ever hear
bretton places the record on the phonograph and the rolling stones let it loose rings out
exile on main street without a doubt the stones greatest album
he was expecting beethoven
it was all outtakes
and the critics hated it
and it didnt sell well at first
but now its universally known as their best release
i asked mick once how he thought that happened
how something could go from so worthless to so valuable
he just looked at me and said
it never went from worthless to valuable
just the opinions of it did
taking a seat
and that was the greatest lesson i ever learned about investing
an assets value can only be priced at its perception
there is no intrinsic
youll work out of the new york office
i wouldnt want to pull you away from your fiancee in washington
shes gordon gekkos daughter
he was a legend at one time
its quite sad how he publicly cries out wolf now
bretton stands and stretches
you see for a legend
inside of a tired sigh
the only thing worse than death is becoming irrelevant
and bretton just sits there
enjoying his scotch while taking in the stones tune
jacob stands at the window of his suite
looking out onto the victoria embankment and on the phone with
good work kid youre on the inside now
hes going to dubai to raise some money then meeting me in new york to set me up
gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment
papers scattered about and his editor waiting patiently
hes not meeting you in new york
because you need to go to dubai with him
i dont understand
as the takes off
you need to do something that will earn his trust
you need to make yourself a hero
jacob sits across from bretton who enjoys a slice of pizza and a coke
you need to help him get this money
and jacob glares at bretton like he might kill him
but be cautious
your relationship with bretton is still fragile you fuck it up here and youre done
bretton looks up and jacob immediately replaces his glare with a smile
looks better than meals i get on united
johns pizza on bleeker
it crossed the atlantic with you yesterday
would you like a slice
i appreciate you wanting to help with this part of the business even though its not your expertise
well theres a lot i can learn from you
for this trip just stay in the background and observe
as bretton tosses some pizza to contango and backwardation
were going to meet with oleg bakunin
hes a russian oligarch on the run because putin wanted to steal everything he owns
he already has a few hundred million with us but im looking to get half a billion more
our maintenance fee on that alone would be ten million a year
my father didnt make half of that in his twenty six year career
and he looks out the window
he worked in a mid level job for united bancorp actually
never to look from the window
with just a trace of disdain
got a fishing kit when he retired
the most bizarre stunning city in the world outlandish skyscrapers marinas archipelagos
and the is now flying over
a collection of man made islands that make out a one dimensional map like depiction of earth
as we fly over this archipelago
richard branson purchased great britain rod stewart bought germany tommy lee bought greece
its custom outfitted mercedes benz van thats completely decked out like the inside of a private jet
full entertainment system recessed led lighting tray tables fine leather blacked out windows that defog with the push of a button designed by phillipe starck and made custom for once
you get to the top of the waiting list
jacob and bretton ride into the city
bretton takes a call on his vertu
you have to be kidding me
he disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to jacob
looks like a bit of news broke while we were in the air
and bretton turns on fox business to see footage of
the governor of new york standing at a podium next to his wife
he doesnt look happy as he says
the remorse i feel will always be with me
words cannot describe how grateful i am for the love and compassion they have shown me
from those to whom much is given much is expected
brettons enjoying every second of this
hes been after us for years
i have been given much the love of my family the faith and trust of the people of new york and the chance to lead this state laughing with delight
you dont want to live in a glass house if youre gonna play this game
i dont understand
is he resigning
whatd he do
and bretton simply turns to him and says
foot tall feat of modern design perched on the edge of the persian gulf
as the jetvan pulls out front
theres a big party for oleg tonight at a club called the left bank
its roaring s themed so ive had original suits from that era delivered to our rooms
as jacob and bretton walk through the ridiculously opulent lobby plated in gold leaf
hedge funds are not banking and this isnt ivy league geography ninth hole deal making
as they walk down the hall to their suites
contango and backwardation tagging along
olegs a brute hes has a
and he likes to party
as they stop in front of large double doors
the bellman opens the doors to reveal
makes the rainman suite at caesars look like a standard room at a motel
square feet degree view inch plasmas share the walls with picassos and monets
bretton nods over to the double doors across the hall
im just down the hall
with a smile i hope you dont mind i took the nicer one
now dressed in a tightly fitting suit over a white shirt with wing collars and stove pipe skinny trousers jacob stands in front of the mirror
as jacob throws on a top hat and admires the version of himself
a roaring s party is taking place
its full on speakeasy vibe
its right out of only with europeans russians and middle easterners
smoke fills the room
a jazz band roars
as jacob and bretton head in
if he offers you a drink take it
and with that bretton points across the room where oleg bakunin sits
if he offers you a line of coke snort it
hes in his mid s overweight sweaty draped in tight black prada and smoking a cigarette
if he offers you a child raise it
and it seems a model bomb has recently exploded at olegs table
leaving the skinny shards everywhere
oleg sees them stands and opens his arms
bretton woods has arrived
they head over
oleg turns to one of the model girls next to him
i want you to meet one of the only men in the world who might be as rich as i am
wait a minute
bretton what did oil close at today
a hundred and twenty nine dollars a barrel
to model girl forget what i said im much richer than him
oleg then looks at jacob
who the fuck is this
oleg im jacob moore
its nice to meet you
oleg regards jacob for a beat then back to bretton and asks again
who the fuck is this
jacob has recently come over from kzi to work with me
and now oleg turns to jacob
you worked with andrew zabel
jacob takes a beat
he was a legend
jacob just nods not showing any emotion
oleg motions for the girls to make room and they all sit
it was that mortgage shit
he shouldve just focused on managing money and not fuck around with that crazy mortgage shit
bretton just looks away
jacob stays cool
it was a shame his fund was only for institutions
i wouldve liked to have invested
oleg motions to a waitress who immediately pours vintage champagne
in honor of the theme tonight have a glass of heidsiek champagne
oleg hands jacob a flute before he can decline
this is one of two hundred bottles discovered on a shipwreck off the coast of finland
thirty grand a bottle
and oleg aggressively puts his arm around jacob bringing him into a drunken half bear hug and spilling most of the champagne out of jacobs flute
oleg and some of his crew lead jacob bretton and three beautiful giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded mooring
fishing boats bob violently in the water and next to them is olegs phoenix his personal meter submarine
as a boatman helps them all climb aboard phoenix
as they walk through the ornate deck saloon oleg beckons jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking out at the city of dubai
and then the view starts to move
the surface of the water rises before them dubai recedes and the submarine descends spectacularly into the depths
square feet days of oxygen capacity
lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past
jacob bretton and oleg are on divans the girls undulating around them
bretton i have
two hundred million with you
and hopefully thats just a start
oleg there are so many opportunities out there right now i feel like a kid in the candy store
oleg waves him off
you know i like to spread it around
im like my own fund of funds
i dont like to have too much with one manager
as oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope
you never really know who to trust in this world
jacob takes a beat swallows nervously then
i couldnt agree more oleg
its one of the first things that andrew zabel taught me
i worked very closely with him
its why bretton hired me
to get behind the andrew zabel curtain
bretton flashes jacob a look
what the hell are you doing
jacob swallows back some nerves then continues
you said before that you always wanted to invest with zabel but couldnt because he only handled institutional money
well heres your chance
zabel taught me everything he knew
oleg looks up to jacob from the line of coke with interest
well im not going to give you the whole cake oleg
he looks over to bretton who still glares at jacob
but i can give you a little bite
it involves building positions in high yielding stocks new to volatility then writing calls with split strike prices
and oleg regards jacob for a long moment a jury determining the verdict
jacob holding on to that sly smile
bretton looking away
playing it cool
its complicated but like bretton said right now there are more opportunities than ever
oleg simply nods
with a simple
then does another line
theres a knock on his door
the knocks louder
jacob finally wakes moves to the door and opens it to see
two beautiful russian women paulina and nadia were here for the party
oleg said you needed a party
cozying up to her friend with a smile
and were it
jacob nervously thinks then
we pan across the suite
past the roaring fire
past the empty bottle of champagne
how about there
i bet you want me to do it there
past the plate of half eaten chocolate strawberries
i want you to hold it
and find the three of them
but its gone up so much
sitting at jacobs computer
looking over a chart for a russian oil company
but if youre going to correctly utilize this technical head and shoulders strategy you need to hold the stock until
pointing on the chart right here
i always sell too soon
very common mistake
you need to cut your losers short and let your winners run
she looks to her friend with a smile
good advice for everything
her friend agrees with a laugh
and jacob checks the clock
i think enough time has passed
i appreciate you guys keeping our little secret
as he walks them to the door
you must love her very much
jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open across the hall
and they all witness a younger american woman leave brettons room then head down the hall right by them
the most famous hooker in the world
off jacobs confusion
that had just left brettons room looks right at us under the caption the governors mistake pull back to be on perezhilton
com jacob moore sits in front of his computer
and he turns to paulina
is she a gift from oleg
shes brettons go to
he flies her in wherever hes at
and jacob slowly takes that in
wearing sunglasses jacob greets bretton at the elevators
you look like crap
they walk for the exit
let me ask you something
was that speech about split strike prices and stocks new to volatility for real
that was all bullshit
well it worked
olegs wiring us five hundred million dollars today
and bretton turns to jacob
good job jacob
and as they head out into the dubai heat
so he trust you now
the iconic charging bull of wall street
i think so
travel the park to find
jacob and gordon stopping at the food vendors
well im happy to help
what about your end of the trade sport
im still working on it
ill talk to her
what do you want
ill take a pretzel
as they get their food and walk
so youre a hedge fund cowboy now
shaking his head
goddamn hedge funds what a racket
playing the world casino betting other peoples money with leverage
and its completely legal and completely unregulated
the hustles they get away with make insider trading seem like a parking ticket
rows and rows of computers in a large dark room
nassim tariq and his frontier fund
with their slews of mit grads who become glorified millionaire robots pushing buttons
with casually dressed asians and indians in their s working the keyboards like zombies
slaves to top secret propriety elegant algorithms that work until they dont
a stuffy conference room half filled with bored men in their s watching a presentation
or the baby cub funds like sammy rosens essex advisers
filled with goldman sachs and julian robertson pedigree
most of the men type on their blackberrys
one is actually asleep
men who are way too rich lazy and tired to run money properly anymore
a small cluttered office with papers strewn about
or allan daniels and his bully operation
allan daniels a small bull dog of a man paces back and forth
dictating in anger
his secretary types down every word hes shouting
with his angry letters to company boards that are nothing but veiled threats in the name of activism
where gordon stops walking
so youre inside
you have his trust
and now you want to know whats next
and jacobs look over to gekko confirms this
heres the thing about bretton
he puts all of his money into his own fund which makes him stupid egotistical and most importantly
and he chases
he doesnt take losses well and he chases with leverage
he thinks hes a trader he thinks hes an investor but hes not
hes a gambler
that pretzel looks good
jacob just shrugs
care to make a trade
and they trade
the hotdog for the pretzel
as for your end of our trade
find a way for me to reunite with my daughter jake
because we both know how she would react to the fact that youve been lying to her about bonding with your future father in law
just standing there
holding that hot dog
is that a threat
looking jacob dead on
jacob just shakes his head with a laugh
now realizing that gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage
youre priceless gordon
with a smile
just be happy im on your team
get him into a bad position and watch him chase it
what bad position
what have i been saying all along kid
theyre a death trap mark my words
as jacob takes in his new view
but he wont fall for a brokerage or bank play this late in the game
everyone knows theyre poison
as the office grows furniture
a plasma on the wall
a computer on the desk
sell him on insurance
theres a case to be made for those stocks
ill fated as they may be
books on the shelves
pictures on the walls
a couch and table
a paper shredder and waste baskets
but take your time
make him think youve been doing your due diligence
find jacob at his desk
working away at his computer
its late at night
make it look like youre working your ass off to find him this genius trade
come in early leave late and dont bring up the idea for at least a few weeks
and jacob finally gets up from his desk
goes to the window
looking across midtown manhattan
and then jacob
eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel
a building he once called home
sell him hard
then watch him bite
then watch him chase
then watch him come undone
holding his suitcase jacob emerges from the elevator and heads for a waiting town car
jacob sees diego
loves this new one
whats the most dangerous question on wall street
how are you
and jacob agrees whole heartedly as he heads on his way
as the sun rises over our nations capital
winnie and jacob jog the park through the humid july haze
its very early
and jacob stops jogging
catches his breath
she keeps running
why are you with me
she stops and turns back to him
you hate finance
you hate wall street
why are you with me
its a valid question
and she thinks about it for a moment then
and what does it mean psych major
well its when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them
like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics
he turns away
thats great winnie
jacob that might be why i was initially attracted to you
but its not why i love you
she moves to him
i love you because youre compassionate and you care so deeply about what you do and you have like no ego its crazy
she reaches to him
turning his face to meet hers
and youre the smartest person ive ever met
and theres nobody i trust more in the world
jacob looks away
and winnie can sense somethings not right
as jacob draws in a deep breath collects himself and finally turns back to her with
i just wish you would master that relationship from childhood so you can move forward with this one
as a circle forms on july th then travels down the trend and stops
and as a circle is formed around august th we
as it sweats through the heart of summer
two jetvans ride uptown
as jacob rides with bretton
i found something i like
bretton looks over to him
ive been wondering when my new portfolio manager was going to come to me with something special
i just wanted to make sure i would be bringing you the smartest idea possible
i know you dont go light
if i commit to this
we go large and we dont back down
it might be better to do this in the office
i have color and support to waving him off
cmon jacob you know thats not how we do
million acres of state protected majestic land
rivers and lakes
cypresses and maples
many trails that go on for miles
as the two becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area a state ranger opens the gate and allows them to drive through then park
jacob and bretton emerge from the jetvan
this is how we do
and with a nod the driver of the other jetvan opens it to reveal two motorcycles inside
brettons mtt turbine superbike and an agusta these bikes are handcrafted works of art as much as they are demons of speed
jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement
and were allowed to ride these through here
sucking in the fresh summer air
now decked out in leather riding gear
on the bikes
at the mouth of the trail
revving the engines
and with that shoots into the forest
jacob quickly follows
winding through the trees
along the side of a river
bretton riding extremely fast with jacob trying to keep up
bretton reaches a clearing and waits for jacob to catch up
once he does
youre going to have to keep up
im just getting used to it
tell me your idea
are you still short any of the financials
after kzi i took profits
i think its time to go the other way
im talking the old school insurers that have become the babies thrown out with the bath water
jacob waits for a reaction from bretton
but all he gets is
and with that bretton rips into the clearing
jacob rides just as fast
theyre neck and neck
its definitely a race
bretton pulls ahead but jacob doesnt give up
as they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed
he pulls up next to bretton as they approach the trail
if jacob doesnt slow down and fall in line behind bretton hes going to hit the trees
but he doesnt
instead jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail
pulling ahead of bretton and taking the lead
as it sits still in the setting sun
untouched by man
bretton and jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore
as they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty
the basket of stocks im putting together focuses on reinsurance brokering and management services for businesses
theyre trading below book and have large dividends
i say we buy them here
bretton thinks about it
hes not sure
financials are a falling knife
im not arguing that
but the best opportunities are found where angels fear to tread
jacob can see
he has bretton on the hook
so yeah they are falling knives
and with confidence
driving it home
whats life without a little blood on your hands
as workers install an electronic ticker that wraps around the top circumference of the whole office
similar to the one andrew zabel had
then i want you to build positions in your favorite three names
jacob picks up the phone and
with jacob on top and robby on the bottom
as robby takes the order and starts typing into his bloomberg
i want you stealth
use all six trading desks were in business with
six different trading desks
six different brokers taking calls from jacob who still owns the whole top half of the screen
and if they go down
we increase our size
feet on desk
staring at the ticker
which only has three stocks on it
see jacob i dont believe in wrong
and iss at
i only believe in not right yet
a rainstorm takes over the city
a cab pulls out front of shun lee cafe
winnie sucks in a deep breath
he chose this restaurant
we used to come here every sunday night
he takes her hand
youre going to be fine
im only doing this for you
youre doing this for you
she just glares at him
were never having sex again
then what my friends say about marriage will be true
and she nervously fights back a smile
oh shut up
the host leads winnie and jacob through the grand dining room
gordon sees them and stands up
we can tell hes anxious as well
fighting back the nerves
they just stand there
jacob holds out his hand
gekko im jacob moore we spoke on the phone
nice to finally meet in person
gekko just looks at him for an extra long beat then
shakes his hand
they all sit
jacob shall we get some wine
i dont drink
then gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter
let me guess
the ginger garlic lobster
i used to order that every time
she closes her menu
im not really hungry
ive been following your career winnie
senator lehigh said some very nice things about you in the american prospect interview
shes really been
supportive of my
and it trails off
as she just glares at gordon
i cant do this
she exhales stands and looks down to jacob
i cant do this
and she quickly walks off
until gordon looks over to him with
this is a long term investment
go after her
she needs you
and jacob does
as gordon looks down
jacob runs after her
he turns her around
you dont understand
her tears being washed away by the rain
my mother couldnt handle rudy
he was so out of control
i couldnt help him
jacob takes her into his hold
if he wasnt in prison
if he had been there
i know it wouldve been different
your brothers dead winnie
squeezing her tight
your father isnt
hes not the person people think he is
it was a long time ago
she pulls out of his embrace
hell hurt us
cant we just go home
and he just looks at her for a long moment
soaking wet and shivering
crying and exposed
what am i doing
i love you
you dont have to do this
lets just go home
the phone rings
jacob answers it
your insurance companies are down
hes working a coffee in the master suite of the black swan home
i want to increase our size
glancing at the lcd am
its just a matter of time before they turn
ill call the jacob i want you to triple our positions on all three
jacob takes a beat
and they better fucking go up
and as jacob just looks at the phone
the instant you know youre in trouble is the exact moment when a sound investment thesis turns into blind hope
jacob sits across from gordon at this well known breakfast spot in the parker meridian hotel
tripling the size
thats a very aggressive move
and i promise you hes using leverage to do this
suddenly a man approaches the table
hes in his thirties
mr gekko im tom sanders
i write for barrons
ive heard of it
letting out a little laugh
im sure you have
well im doing a piece of wall street moguls who ended up going to prison
ive already talked to boesky and milken and would love to sit down with you
can you give me the cover
tom isnt sure if gordons serious
either is jacob
dont make those decisions
get me the cover and ill give you seventy minutes
tom politely smiles
take that as a no
gordon looks down to his breakfast and quietly asserts
almost to himself both those assholes got the cover when they were convicted
and after a moment
how do we know the insurance companies are going to continue going down
as he casually places his egg on a piece of toast
its all going down
and takes a bite
side by side
above the charts are written respectively mcc acn and iss
and we follow all the three trend lines from aug th forward to the right
and they all move down
and we stop in september
and as a blue circle is formed over sept th on all three charts we
this is the financial follies
an annual event held by the financial writers association
people sit at tables enjoying this dinner and live show that pokes fun at people in the world of finance
everyone whos anyone in high finance is here
on the stage the spotlight finds bill maher and the applause breaks out
welcome to the financial follies
im bill maher and im getting paid in euros
jacob shares a table with bretton brettons wife and a few other financial players
winnie is not here
when the financial writers association asked me to host an event for the world of finance i was shocked
im known in washington not wall street
but then they informed me that washington is actually in the process of buying wall street so it all makes sense
i asked them if anythings off limits
and they said to stay away from the brokerages banks and insurers
pause for effect then
where the fuck was that advice five months ago
i see sammy rosens here
the spotlight finds sammy rosen billionaire hedge funder
sammy how are you
from his table
to the room of course he is
in the amount of time it took for us to have that exchange he made three hundred and nine thousand dollars
back to sammy sammy let me give you some free advice the next time someone with bad eyesight wants to sell you a hundred and fifty million dollar painting
dont let them personally deliver it
its an inside joke that this room gets
somebody told me gordon gekko is here
across the room a spotlight finds gordon
there you are
i have some inside information for you gekko
sex sells books not bread lines
gordon smiles and raises his glass up to bill
talk about your sour grapes
seriously gordon just because the sec doesnt let you make obscene amounts of money by being wrong and nefarious doesnt mean you have to ruin it for all of these
hard working people
the room applauds
okay we have a video to show now
its a very detailed and academic account of the current mortgage crises
let er rip
and the room goes dark
and on the screen plays a childlike roughly illustrated stick figure skit being narrated by children
under the caption main street national bank is a drawing of a poor man sitting across from a banker man behind his desk
id like a mortgage
i dont really have any money though
is that cool
since housing prices are always going up it wont be a problem
you guys are awesome
under the caption a few weeks later at the bank
banker man now stands over a pile of steaming shit
wow these mortgages are really beginning to smell
i better sell them to smart people
under the caption of smart people investment bank smart man stands over the same steaming pile of shit
wow these mortgages we just bought really smell
i better sell them to foreigners
under the caption of the cdo factory our smart man oversees an assembly line of stick figure workers
mix those crappy mortgages in real good with the clean ones so the rating agencies wont smell them
under the caption of rich man hedge fund a stick figure named rich man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his ear
good news smart man not only did foreigners buy those traunches but so did school boards and charities and big pensions
why did they buy them you ask
well they were looking for a really secure risk free investment and they were all triple a so
under the caption norwegian village pension fund a norwegian man sits behind his desk and shouts into his phone
what the fuck
were not receiving our monthly payments
under the caption rich man hedge fund rich man at his desk on the phone
yeah we fucked up
and it now shuffles between the last two frames
the norwegian man and rich man
what about the rating agencies
yeah they fucked up too
what about the investment bank that put these cdos together
what about the bank that made the original loan
totally fucked up
what am i supposed to tell my villagers
that you fucked up
the final frame just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the caption
and the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a smattering of applause
what a year enjoy the night
desert is served
jackets are off cigars are lit brettons wife has gone home
the group at the table is a little drunk and having a good time
its a good question
what do you think george
george an investment banker at the table thinks about it
the definition of rich
the table reacts
some agree other dont
george turns to jacob
what do you think
to be rich
is to have the love of a good woman
they all boo
with a smile for real
i truly believe that
and jacob turns to bretton
whats your definition of rich
an approaching voice answers it for him
to have twice as much money as you currently do
as he takes a seat
isnt that what you always say bretton
announcing to the table
he brings up the question runs it round the table then finishes with that
its an old bit
also announcing to the table
be careful gordon
looking at jacob your daughters financial health is in my hands now
jacob loses his smile
suddenly becoming uncomfortable
and the way the locust fund has been buying up the insurance companies lately makes me worried about my future grandchildrens college educations
i didnt tell him
no i dont suppose you did
bretton looks over to jacob
go ahead jacob preach your book
defend your names
and jacob turns to gordon
we have a proactive central bank the charts show a clear bottom on july th and these companies are trading at half of what they were six months ago
just cause its low dont make it cheap sport
i read your book
its not out yet
i have a friend in publishing
government seizures of assets and gold
end of democracy
bretton leans back
taking in this sparring match
do you really need attention that badly
since i have forty four seconds to spare im going to tell you a story
its about a guy named sam
and we go close on gekko
sam used to work a job he made things and he grew things and he sold those things
until one day sam got a credit card and was amazed how easy it was to buy things with it
so sam got another card and then another
then he used the credit card money to make it look like he had an income
and he used that income to secure a loan
and with that loan sam bought a fancy bmw car and rented a fancy penthouse apartment
now the credit cards hit their limit and the bank needed him to service that loan so sam went to his friends
his chinese friend
and his japanese friend
and his british friend and so on
and his friends loaned sam money
and that brings us to today
where sam owes the credit cards and sam owes the banks and sam owes his friends and eventually theyre going to take away sams fancy bmw car and his fancy
and jacob can now see
in gordon gekkos eyes
he truly believes every word hes saying
and sam doesnt make anything anymore and sam doesnt grow anything anymore so sam doesnt sell anything anymore
as he stands
our favorite uncle sams desperate jake
and he just found a printing press in his basement
so you tell me where do we go from here
and with that gordon gekko goes
it is sad isnt it
that he cant just take his ball and go home
that he has to piss on the whole game
rushed jacob heads through the lobby of his building
diego catches his stride
doing his best howard down goes lehman
down goes lehman
down goes lehman
and jacob just keeps walking
jacob heads into the office to find bretton sitting behind his desk
theyre not going to save it
theyre just going to let it bloody die
and sure enough
on the tv
fox business runs footage of lehman brothers demise
on the screen the chyron screams and as another us banking institution collapses congress is working quickly on a bailout package that will distribute over three hundred billion dollars to
other banks in trouble
bretton turns off the tv and looks to jacob with
were getting fucking killed
and jacob looks up to his electronic ticker
bretton holds jacobs look
fighting to keep his composure
he simply stands and offers jacob his desk back
then buy more
jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone
cost us down to current levels
jacob looks up surprised
its just a question of time before this turns around
and he glares at jacob
bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker
a frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet
as he goes
leverage is sexy
as a circle forms on sept th then travels down the trend line and stops
and as a circle is formed around the sept th we
lcd reads am
jacob lays awake
staring at the ceiling
i would hear him in the kitchen
jacob turns to see shes awake
im sorry you have an early train
im going to just go to the office now
she leans up
he didnt want to keep my mother awake so hed go into the kitchen and sit there
i could hear him because my room was right up the back stairs
id go and sit with him sometimes
wed eat ice cream
jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe
i was only eight but i could tell he was worried about something and that made me worried
softly almost to herself then the market would go back up and he would sleep through the night again
its not the market winnie
as he sits on the edge of the bed
its just that i havent been able to sleep through the night since
the thought trails off
she leans up and kisses him
i wish i could tell you something was going to come along that would make it better but i cant
its just going to take time jacob
a lot of time
and she looks into his eyes
have you been counting fridays
he slowly nods
i still count tuesdays
all seven hundred and twenty eight of them
he leans over and kisses her forehead
go back to sleep
and he goes
after a beat she sees jacobs wallet
calling out after him jacob you forgot
she jumps out of bed grabs the wallet and goes after him but
it opens up and winnie notices the picture inside
and she stops staring at that picture
her and her father on that white horse
taken years ago
a picture she knows she never gave to jacob
jacob heads in and turns on fox business
its a complete unmitigated bloodbath out there
the s p tried to rally at about am but it was met with yet another brutal wave of selling and people
were now at our lows for the day the week the month and the year
jacob looks up at ticker on the wall
and he stares at that ticker
at the the locust funds methodical death
are you happy
he stands in the doorway holding a drink
and bretton chucks the drink against the wall and the glass shatters
jacob takes a step back
brettons in a complete state as he walks over to jacobs desk and swipes it clean
papers flying about
now he picks up the chair
throws it against the window
as he punches the monitor of jacobs bloomberg
and jacob just stands there
just looking at
face full of sweat
blood all over his hand
hair strewn about
completely out of breath
bloodshot red eyes
a beaten down mess of a man
what happened to composure bretton
well i suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks
and bretton calms down walks to the window
its not making sense to me anymore
the market always made sense to me and for the most part
i was better than it
quicker than it
but its moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway
and he faces jacob moore
if i unwind the fund now ill still walk with six hundred million or so
and jacobs face falls
this is news to him
its time to call it a day
spend more time with my family
i suppose this moment comes for all of us
you still have six hundred million
bretton vacantly nods
and jacob moore
trying his best to hide his disappointment
almost to himself thats a fortune
with a shrug
i guess its all relative
bretton then takes a moment
confirming to himself that this is the right decision
then finally looks over to jacob with
and jacob youre the worst portfolio manager ive ever seen
painted in the soft light of sunset
fresh off his morning run gordon wears a sweat suit and works a vitamin water
jacob approaches in his suit
he wants to close the fund
he wants to ride off into the fucking sunset
no its not okay
because were so fucking close
and hes going to walk with six hundred million dollars and thats unacceptable
and gordon sighs in defeat
i dont know what to tell you pal
you wanted to make him bleed i wanted my daughter back
as he walks
looks like life brings disappointment to us all
as he matches gordons stride
in a complete state
what happened to slaughtering men gordon
what happened to turning them into penny ante brokers in poughkeepsie
gordon stops walking
look at you
this cant possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with
jacob turns away
i want to finish the job
because nobody gave a shit about me before andrew zabel came along
because he didnt deserve what he got
the universe is an efficient market kid
we all get what we deserve
now its gordon who looks away
i know you cared about him
and i know how that motivates
he wasnt such a saint
and with that gordon gekko heads on his way
whats that supposed to mean
you dont want to know
jacob steps forward
shouting out after him
im sorry she doesnt want anything to do with you gordon im sorry she doesnt love you
gordon stops walking
you want to know
jacob sharply nods
did you ever think about it
i mean really think about it
how someone could make money year after year
even through bear markets
jacob just stands there
on november th an italian man arrived aboard the s
vancouver in boston
he had two dollars and fifty cents to his name
yet just a few years later he was millionaire
you wanna know how
he had invented a scheme
it was quite simple actually
and jacob now steps forward
piecing it together
he would get people to invest with him by offering larger than normal returns then pay the old investors with the new investors money
as long as there was fresh money he could keep going
do you know what his name was jacob
it was charles
jenkov foundation for brain research above the door
researchers in lab coats coming in and out of it
students walking the quad
wearing backpacks and socializing
somewhere in florida
a couple in their s enjoying a beautiful day
riding bicycles side by side
gordon steps forward
all of them went to bed thinking they were perfectly fine
are going to wake up to find theyre completely wiped out
im not son
i wish i were
jacob just stands there
stunned with what hes hearing
see jacob you knew how to get that out of me
by playing me off of what i really want
my daughter back
so you need get bretton back in the game
play him off of what he really wants
and off jacobs reaction
jacob shares a table with our morgan stanley portfolio manager
its ugly out there dude
i wake up everyday wondering if todays the day were going under
but i do have something for you
and as morgan portfolio manager leans forward in anticipation
as jacob and hedge fund pm walk the floor
checking out the new prius
i was going to get the new maserati but
jacob slowly nods
so i heard something earlier today
as jacob jogs with our blogger from streetaccount
its so much better working out outdoors
that gym was so stuffy
not to mention expensive
so youve obviously heard the rumor
and blogger looks over to jacob
as our blogger from the gym sips his coffee fires up his computer and starts to type
as hedge fund pm stands up to present to the team with a confident smile
as morgan portfolio receives the digital receipt
instant messages sent
as the cab stops outside of the building
as the thunder claps outside
jacob stares at the goya painting
saturno devorando a sus hijos saturn
the man being eaten alive
i dont like unannounced visits
united bancorp is going under
wells fargo has stepped up but the offer is insanely low
i know all this
you still have the fund and you still have the leverage that comes with it
you want out of the game
buy a bank
bretton skeptically regards jacob
why are you doing this
because i got you into those insurance companies
because i let you down
biting his lip in thought
i dont like the mortgage toxic waste
it cant be quantified
and it spreads
i worked it out already
you wouldnt have to take it
howd you do that
well wells wont insure the zabel institutional money
its against their policy
i told them you would
then who would take on the mortgage securities
bretton slowly nods
taking all this in
so id get the bank the kzi assets including the institutional fund yet none of the mortgage securities
as jacob leans forward
going in for the kill
you could actually own the bank your father toiled away at his whole career
think about that bretton
bretton just shakes his head
were going to lose our credit
im facing margin calls
so in order to stay in the game
we need fresh money
not going to work oils crashing
jacob thinks for a moment then
and how much do we need
fifty sixty million minimum
and thats just to hold off the current margin calls
and bretton just sighs
god de leveraging is a bitch
im going to get us the money
and jacob goes
bretton calling out after him
why wall street has finally gone too far is now everywhere
in large cut outs and piles on tables and in the stores windows
jacob arrives at the end of the line
new yorks newest best selling author is having a book signing
signs a book and looks up at the lady who gave it to him
i have a question
what exactly is moral hazard
with a smile
short version taking risks youre not accountable for with other peoples money
and the next person steps up and hands gordon a copy
hes going for it
were almost home
as he signs it
there you go
but he needs fresh money to serve the leverage
a hundred million
gordon just shrugs
im a writer now
we dont make that much
as the line of people holding their new books start to get impatient
i know that but i figured you might know how to get it
handing jacob back the signed copy
well if you need money that badly jake
you might want to check closer to home
off jacobs confused reaction
as they walk the mall
the nations capitol behind them
its a lot
i dont know jacob
i never really considered it mine
but it is
its your money
and she faces him
regarding his urgency
glaring at him you might want to wipe some of the drool off your face
im not kidding
this is important
as they continue to walk
yes its mine
when he went to prison my father put a lot of money in our names
and when rudy died it all became mine
but its in a trust
i cant get to it until im thirty five and even then i was planning on giving it to charity
lets say i can figure out a way for you to get it
take a loan against it something like that
will you do that for me
why are you doing this jacob
jacob takes a moment
looking away with
this is my only chance to make things right winnie
and she just regards him
as jacob walks down the hall with ken hadley estate lawyer to manhattans elite
gordon couldnt invest any of his money so he put most of it into the childrens names with directions on how it was to be invested
he definitely knew what he was doing
and how could winnie get it now
hadley stops walking and thinks about it
well shed have to sign a reversion of trust document
that way the funds would revert back to their pre trust posture and regulations
so all she has to do is sign a piece of paper
as that registers
how much is in there
theres private equity ownership real estate a very large position in a bank
all sorts of investment vehicles
ballpark it for me
i dont know
assuming immediate liquidity
over three hundred million
and with that jacob sets to go
gordon would have to sign the document as well
in the make up chair of the fox business channel green room speaks into his phone
you also would need the trusts executor to sign it
jacob as he walks down th avenue
who is that
hes a lifelong friend
it wont be a problem
what about you
i would love to sign it jacob
consider it done
walking down th avenue
thank you gordon
just after you agree to two things
before bretton buys the bank he must use all of winnies money and all the locust funds leverage to go against the market
theyre about to pass this bailout and i want to be on the other side of it
this things going to hell in a bucket and im sick of being on sidelines pal
but what about its just for a few weeks then its right back to our plan
whats the second thing
and as that hangs
as she starts to sign the forms
a clock ticks
a large table
three lawyers sit on one side
winnie and jacob on the other and gordon at the head
winnie finishes signing the forms then slides them back to hadley who hands them to gordon
jacob takes her hand but she pulls it away
and after gordon signs the papers they all stand
gordon just looks at winnie whos now looking back at him
tears beginning to well
and he slowly opens his arms
youre all i have left now
and she slowly walks over to him
to his embrace
he was my only son
and i messed that up
i messed it all up i know that
shes now crying
and confirming through her tears
you always get what you want dad
and jacob moore
witnessing this strange reunion
realizing how right she is
jacobs on the phone in his office watching coverage of a vote on the senate floor
into his phone okay it looks like this bailouts going to pass
robby with a phone to his ear
into his phone theres going to be an initial bounce
each time to another broker with a phone to their ear
our six brokers from before
into his phone were going to sell that bounce
day by day
alexis glick starting off the days coverage
and each new day finds alexis in a different outfit with a different headline above her head
we dont hear her it moves quickly and its ugly
first were going to unload all of our positions in the insurers
then were going to go the other way
were going to bet against this market
against the s p the nasdaq the dow
the financials china india brazil
the brokerages that are still left all the froth from the last two years
as a circle forms on october th then travels the trend line down even further to late october and stops
gentlemen anything that can be sold
were going to sell
and as a circle is formed around the date of october th we
jacob gets off the elevator and sees diego who doesnt say anything
no market joke today
diego just shrugs
it stopped being funny
jacob softly nods and heads on his way
jacob heads in to find bretton waiting for him
i thought you were in london
the united bancorp deal is going to go through
ive begun unwinding all our positions
but our deal with gordon was that we have to stay short until november th
bretton just looks at him
jacob gordon redeemed all his money yesterday
were clean with him
and this hits jacob like a ton of bricks
is something wrong
no everythings great
forcing out a smile
lets go buy a bank
as the landlord walks down the hall with jacob and winnie
thank you he hasnt answered his phone and were very worried
the landlord nods and unlocks the apartment door for them
and they walk in to find the place completely empty
everythings gone save for one thing
that framed picture of the woman filling her stove with money
jacob slowly walks over to the it and stares it down
he played me
she joins his side
he played us
i dont give a shit about the money
and she turns to face him
this is who he is
he sucks in a deep breath then
i lied to you
i contacted him
i spent time with him
without you knowing
i saw the picture in your wallet
then why didnt you say anything
because i wanted to give you a chance to say something first
because i love you i really do
she takes off the fuck you ring
and because i desperately wanted to find something in you to believe in
shaking her head in but jacob
youve become that exact thing ive been trying to master
and places it into his palm
youve become him
hadley sits behind his desk
its completely legal jacob
the funds reverted back to the pre trust posture
that means the money was technically gordons again
hadley just shrugs
but hes not allowed to trade
he didnt trade
he put the money into the hedge fund thats considered capital investment
jacob gordon never put the money into a hedge fund
he simply took control of the bank
i told you about the position in the bank
i dont understand
a sleepy town
well gordon had placed his hudson river shares into the trust before he was convicted
you do know he started out there
a rental car parks out front of a small bank
jacob emerges and heads for the bank
okay then the trust aggressively acquired more shares about two years ago
enough to have a controlling position in the bank
and jacob stops walking when he sees
a group of angry depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the doorway
jacob and hadley
gordon wasnt allowed to control the trust
all of the trusts moves were made by its executor
who the hell is sammy redding
jacob the executor of winnies trust has always been bretton woods
and as that slams into jacob moore
as jacob takes his seat and settles in for the long flight
hes flying commercial
and in coach
its raining and gray
as jacob walks the hallowed halls of this old school stock brokerage with the manager
so were throwing brettons birthday party at balmoral
well were very proud to have such a resounding success hail from these hallowed halls i assure you
weve been trying to get bretton to come back and speak to our younger brokers but
hes a hard man to reach
thats funny because he often speaks about his days here at redmayne and bentley
anyway what im hoping you can help me with were records of his early trades
we think itll be fun to bring up some of brettons real losers from when he was starting out
you know we all have dogs
but it is against policy to allow just anyone to see those records
i completely understand
how about this
ill make you a trade
you let me see the records for brettons party
and with a killer smile
and ill make sure bretton gives your young brokers a speech that will blow them away
as jacob looks over the old documents
trading ledgers from twenty five years ago
down the list we see him circle all the unusually large successful trades
and then follow them to the client on the right side of the ledger
and jacob realizes its the same client every time
wow bretton you really kicked some ass for client forty one
finally jacob turns to the back of the ledger to the client key where he moves the pencil down to client and it says
all making sense now bud fox wasnt the only one
jacob waits in the large entry hall
holding a cheap umbrella he bought at heathrow
and down from the stairs walks
its been a bitch of a month my friend
tell me this visit does not bring bad news
oleg sips his vodka and looks at jacob
you want me to audit the locust fund
i want you to tell bretton you need the official records of all the funds activity starting with when you gave him the original two hundred million
you need this because the russian federal tax service is up your ass and you have to play ball with them
and if he declines
youll have no choice but to pull your money
oleg lights a cigarette
exhaling the smoke with
and why would i do that
and jacob leans forward
because if you do this for me oleg ill teach you the andrew zabel magic
ill explain to you in detail all of his techniques
ill give you all his secrets
its less complicated than you might think
a phone rings
jacob wakes up and takes it
okay thank you
he moves to the curtains then opens them
and the daylight spills in
oleg slides four encyclopedia sized bounded stacks of printouts across his desk
all the locust funds trades for the last two years
jacob nods placing them into his bag
and oleg lights a cigarette
looks right at us
leaning forward with
now give it to me
let me behind the andrew zabel curtain
as jacob flies back to new york
he flips through the locust fund trading ledgers shaking his head in disbelief
winnie answers the door to find
they were working together
your father and bretton
walking back into the apartment
jacob what are you doing here
following her in
gordon wanted the trust the whole time
and when i came to him seeking revenge
he saw his window
upset she looks for her keys
i have to go to work
bretton owed him a favor because he fed your father information twenty three years ago when he was a young broker in london and your father never ratted him out
she just looks at him
shaking her head
and not in disapproval
but in pity
but he keeps going
and he never put the money into brettons fund
turns out your trust had built up a controlling position in hudson river bank
thats the bank he worked at when i was born
well now he owns it
or shall i say pilfered it before he went awol
and that money wasnt even the banks
it was taxpayers
as this washes over a stunned winnie gekko
and jacob confirms
he saw this coming years ago
from his cell
im guessing he made off with billions
and he throws something on the table
and now look
its a copy of portfolio magazine with a picture of gordon on cover under the headline
guess whos back and getting rich betting against you
hes in london
giving interviews and being hailed as a genius
everyones buying his book and waiting to see his next move
desperately trying to get her mind around this
but what about the sec the regulatory agencies
the government is flying this billion dollar airplane by the seat of its pants
they dont know where half of the fucking money is going
and even if they did do you think they want this out there
as this all washes over her
this is his revenge
sure beats the hell out of insider trading doesnt it
and winnie finds her keys and heads for the door
i cant hear anymore of this
but jacob steps in front of her
i sold everything
i gave back the kzi bonus
im out and im broke and i deserve it
and she just looks at him
but winnie the one thing i cant accept is losing you
and before she reacts
as a circle forms on nov th then travels quite a ways then finally stops
unfortunately this slope down the s p trendline is quite pronounced
and as a circle is formed around jan th we
as jacob opens up a copy of barrons
gekko on the cover under the caption whats his next move
in an official office of our federal reserve bank proudly signing the documents
dubai in the background
jacob waits against a bench
and across the way he sees
did you see barrons
you finally got the cover
everybody thinks you got rich of betting against the system
if they only knew
the powers that be will never let that happen
jacobs not arguing it
how much is enough gordon
gordon laughs with a shake of the head
ive been asked that before
they took a hundred twenty two thousand six hundred and forty hours from me
for a goddamn victimless crime
all the while i sit in my by and watch real crooks by the thousands give out mortgages like candy package them into unexplainable derivatives and spit the cancer out
into the world
and he just shakes his head
and when i get out
whos there waiting for me
you better believe im going to get mine
youre not going to miss america
ill always have america
its why im here
im buying the island
i know its kitschy but its fun and good for business
looking over the water
i have a lot business abroad now
interests in an australian copper mine a german solar company some russian oil pipelines a casino in macau
see jake america just isnt where the action is anymore
what happened to the precious depreciating asset of time
it still trades
and he turns to jacob with a smile
but im a billionaire now pal
im out gordon im done trading
i dont know why
you pulled it off kid you took him down granted with my help but you atoned for zabels sins with brettons money
as i see it youre just getting started
and jacob stops walking then slowly turns to gordon with
did you ever really want to reconcile with her
of course i did im human
glaring at him
then why did you do it
strongly holding jacobs glare
but it didnt work
gordon sadly shrugs
ive been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she wont accept it
she doesnt want it
we dont want it
because its not about what you have
its about what you do
and gordon its never about the money
gordon shakes his head
that sounds good
i bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow
but champ its idealistic
and idealism kills every trade
winnie will realize that at some point
and then well be fine
and jacob finally looks away
see jacob the hustle we all fall for is actually thinking we can fight whats inherent whats inevitable
that we can somehow undo what genetics or god or whatever name you wanna tag it has placed deep inside of us
because whether its greed or revenge or the compulsion to chase
it all amounts to the same thing
loss of control
and its always going to be there and its always going to be stronger than you pal
now walking again
its why bubbles will always exist and its why were all currently in this mess
joining gordons stride
and gordon stops walking
its going to be a boy
what do you want
its bad out there gordon people are panicked
theyre not looking to their government
theyre not looking to their trusted advisors
theyre looking to you
you want me to buy
and jacob moore
publicly and aggressively
gordon just looks at him
but theyre all lemmings
you once said every crash should have a jp morgan to step in and save it
well gordon this is your chance to be jp morgan
and now gordon shakes his head
were far from the bottom
itll be a dead cat bounce
itll buy us time
thats all im asking for
time for the new administration to put their plan into action
what do i get in return
as gordon turns
takes in the city of dubai
in all of its ridiculous splendor
you can offer that
your daughter can
she works with the new secretary of treasury now
something money cant buy
and gordon looks at him for the longest moments allowing it all to register then
sorry son thats simply a trade i cannot make
and as gordon gekko walks off
leaving jacob moore behind
you wanna know what the mother of all bubbles was
the human race
scientists call it the cambrian explosion from the cambrian fauna
as jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see winnie waiting for him
it happened million years ago
when all of the sudden there was the seemingly rapid appearance of most major groups of complex animals
and as they embrace
and from it was born humanity
being led through a massive empty space
it was an explosion of life
scientists will tell you it was unprecedented excessive and by the standards of evolution time
happened in a flash
the city of london outside the large windows
suddenly the world had millions of new species
just like that
this will be the home of his new international empire
at his desk in his cpw penthouse
see bubbles are the purest form of darwinism
looking over pages and pages of destruction
andrew zabels legacy that he now has to pay for
they teach us what we didnt know and they remind us of what we forgot
and bretton completely loses it
just starts ripping out the pages then tearing them in two
they kill excess and they lean out the herd
page by page
over and over again
sitting in his massive london office
hes completely alone
he looks up at the wall
at the framed picture of jp morgan and uncle sam rowing that boat
then he looks down at an old picture of winnie
shes probably three or four years old
and lovingly holding her baby brother rudy
and gordon holds on this picture for a long moment before finally
they actually bring us back to the necessary simple
picking up the phone
now in the back of a town car
we dont know where
as the door opens daylight spills in and we see the charging bull of bowling green park across the way
gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the new york stock exchange
and gordon stops at the famed doors takes a moment to regard the exchange sucks in a deep breath readies for his heros welcome and finally
opens the doors then disappears inside
greet the morning in their small washington dc apartment
winnie pouring coffee jacob turning on the tv
and on the screen is a picture of gordon gekko walking the floor of the new york stock exchange under the graphic
gekko now betting on a recovery
youd be amazed what can rise from the ashes
sam cookes a change is gonna come kicks in
and we go close on the fox business channels coverage of the markets huge rally of an opening
with gordon gekko ringing the bell
until the channel suddenly changes
to the cartoon network
