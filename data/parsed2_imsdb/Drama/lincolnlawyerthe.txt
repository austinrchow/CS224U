lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate
moving with mick through the press of lawyers others before the judge shows up as a few prisoners are led into the holding pen mick picks out his client harold
casey s lanky with a ponytail and skull halo tattoo
mick tries catching his eye but harolds clearly avoiding him

a look of understanding
judge nods im holding this over pending notification from counsel
then gavels down for the next case as caseys led off mick joins him along the rail he hisses that was bullshit askin for a delay i know what that
and so does judge powell
he spent a lot of years as a defense lawyer so he knows all about having to chase mr
green and he doesnt look kindly on defendants who dont pay their attorneys

under which mick sees earl indicate something on the road
while lorna reacts to what mick said exasperated
youre going to see gloria
why do you waste time on her mickey
mick sees where earls pointing squad of motorcycles harleys in the side view mirrors
they pull up alongside gang jackets black leather vests
want me to do somethin about this
cause i can
ignore them youre doing fine
face of the leader of the motorcycles leers at mick through window as mick ignores answers lorna re gloria what can i say lorn ive got a soft spot for
why do you think i married you
the divorce papers called it temporary insanity
lucky for you there was a cure
when earl interrupts insistent now mr
calling his attention to the motorcycles have pulled in front
the leader signals earl to pull off
mick sees theyre surrounded
the lincoln follows the harleys off pulls to a stop in a lot at the crest of the exit
jagged rocks craggy peaks
the leader gets off his bike
eddie vogel nearly lbs
skull halo patch on leather vest same as harolds tattoo
the road saints
mick lowers a window
counsellor hows it hanging

if you want me to work youve gat to pay me
we paid you
thats long gone
i could tell you half went to the aerial photo expert
hes going to blow the states case by showing that the dea violated the air space over harolds farm by flying too low
but you dont need to know that
all you need to know is we had a deal
time to refill the tank
taps the side of the lincoln
sure gas guzzler like this
i heard you got three more
whats one man need with four lincolns
you want another five grand
im flying the guy in from kodak in new york he wants business class
and i want harold back on the farm
hes the best farmer we got if you know what i mean
and i dont want to
either pay me my money or go with the public defender the judge finds you
of course he wont know much about air space but keep your shirt on counsellor
we want you
he reaches into a vest with his big hand
mick takes it
starts to count and realizes you had the whole ten ready
what if youd backed me down to five
this vest got lots of pocket
eddie taps another pocket and grins
one tooth missing
camera moving on eight men prisoners in grey jumpers
six are black
of the two white men ones a wet eyed skanky junkie s
the other is a tall young man somehow polished even in prison outfit definitely out of place here louis roulet
louis turns the proverbial deer in the headlights scared
my name is michael haller
i had a call
haller mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell
signals louis to come to the bars to talk
louis approaches i called you because i need
you want me to represent you for your first appearance
i get twenty five hundred for that
we can work out what comes next
thank you this is a set up mr
haller i made a mistake with that woman she was setting me up keep your voice down
and dont say anything about the case not til ive got you out on bail
micks voice as always is easy and calm
i understand your family lawyers in court
points to dobbs balding dignified wasp a few rows in
is he ready to post bail
hell do whatever he has to
mick nods noting the tinge of desperation in louiss voice
takes out a notebook
okay tell me about yourself
how old are you
ties to the community
you grow up here go to school
beverly hills ucla
i work for my mothers business
its named for her second husband
how much did you make last year
when louis hesitates if im going to get you out i need to know everything
my taxes last year said four hundred thousand
just then the white junkie lurches forward towards mick i want a lawyer too you got a card
theyll have one for you out there
i need you to back up and leave us alone
can you do that pal
junkie backs off does just what mick says
then mick low voiced listen
theyve put some heavy charges on you
the da will probably ask for no bail
frightened voice the others react mick hushes him and
i said theyre going to ask it
when was the last time you were arrested
so if i checked your record youd find parking tickets
mick looks briefly into the younger mans eyes hes scared fragile but sincere
this whole thing is were not talking about the case remember
not even to the judge
dont i even say not guilty
todays about setting arraignment period
you say nothing
are you going to get me out
im gonna try louis
one more thing there are lots of lawyers
why pick me
remembered your name from some case in the papers
a drug case i dont know
you remember the name or anything
no but you got the evidence thrown out against some guy does it matter
when mick hesitates i need your help mr
off mick go to right eye bruised swollen shut
bloody gauze protrudes from her nostril
lip cut and swollen like a plum
gash over the right eye
fear in her expression
studying it is assistant d
maggie mcpherson s
maggies in a navy suit raven black hair smart and strong and a beauty
coming up behind her are you the prosecutor who used to have the roulet case
she starts to smile until his emphasis registers
dont tell me
son of a bitch haller
rules are rules
i wanted this one
alright ill go quietly
but after todays hearing if you dont object
you going for no bail
that wont change with the prosecutor
not with what your guy did
with which she shows him the photo gruesome
if he did it
they only picked him up in her home with blood all over him but its a valid question
i love it when youre sarcastic
can i at least see the arrest report
get it from whoever takes over
no favors on this one
mick looks admiringly at maggie
at her passion
off the sudden shift in topic maggie starts putting away the things on her desk
she likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself
how about this weekend
this takes her by surprise
but she takes him up on it
okay ill tell hayley
only mick dont cancel on her
a tv camera is trained toward louis in the holding area he tries avoiding it
while mick and maggie are arguing in judge there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight with resources like this man has its always a
risk let alone the fact that the victim was brutally ms
mcpherson the extent of her injuries are not the point
im setting bail at a million dollars
mick wins maggie loses
exchange glances mick bangs out always moving
getting the door for him is his friend bail bondsman val valenzuela excited
whatd i tell you mick we got us a franchise
well see val
theres the lawyer guy you get him to go for the cash bond
moving from val mick heads down the hall through the busy crush of attorneys clients spectators to dobbs waiting
they shake hands
it was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call
ive represented the family so long i think of louis that way
he did look a little frail
my advice is let mr
valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take the boy home
windsor was thinking of putting up property
assessing it will take days
by then louis might be carrying somebodys child
before dobbs can argue so just tap val for the bond spring louis and take him to your office
well meet there at four
and heads off again
dobbs follows him out to
where dobbs suddenly tenses as he sees a tv cameraman coming out with camera
off dobbss reaction yep
medias already picked us up
windsors sensitive about the press
mick a beat
then calls the cameraman over
when he comes i saw you in there filming
whats your name
they call me sticks
you freelancing on this sticks
your clients got profile i figure i can sell it to local news
how much will they pay you for what you shot today
seven seven fifty
suppose we take it off your hands for eight
sticks hesitates like its not the legit thing to do
or do we make it a thousand
sticks hesitates no longer
takes the tape from the camera and hands it to mick
whos already counting out money from the roll of cash ted gave him
to dobbs i can expense this right
sticks takes the money goes
dobbs impressed beaming now ill admit mr
haller you werent my choice
you were louiss
frankly id never heard of you
but maybe i should have
seems to me ive underestimated you
then lets talk about my fees
before dobbs can reply ill need a hundred thousand up front
working off five fifty an hour itll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial
thats estimating the trial at a week
appeals we start over
micks lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb
mick hand on the door i take it thats not a problem
reaction dobbs hesitates but has no choice
mick gets in we glimpse the lincolns license plate nt glty cut to howd it go mickey
we get the case
into his cell weve got it if we want it
id still like to know the states case what theyve got on him
whats the difference
course we want the case
mick says nothing
gaze out the window
ive got an hour til hes released
til then ill be at county
before she says anything any calls
he says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you
yeah he does
youre going to bat for me again
gloria redhead but good looks already fading greets the arriving mick in a client attorney booth
you dont even know who the mick was
you dont look good gloria
for coming not for the compliment
micks already paging through her arrest sheet sees
something new for you getting booked on possession of coke along with the usual
dumb i know
a guy paid me with it i had it on me when i went to my next
and your next was a cop
she shrugs nods
mick keeps turning pages looking for a break
cant you get me into one of those rehab places where they get you straight
we did a pre trial rehab last time
wont go for it again
you may have to do some jail here
yeah you can
theyve got programs in jail too
look youve had a long run
maybe after this you can finally get out of the life
and do what
have kids and plant flowers
look at me
mick doesnt have an answer
opens a notebook gets to work
okay tell me what happened
i did a guy at the travel lodge on santa monica
the one who paid you coke instead of money
he had a shitload in there
which gets micks attention
his wheels suddenly turning
do you know who he was
he reached me on my website
he was mexican or something
writes likes this did you screen him
dont i screen em all
off what his drivers license
no his passport
i think his name was hector or hector what
hector arrande moya is what you get if you run a trace
hes colombian a fugitive from a grand jury indictment down in florida
the dea wants him for drug trafficking
s leslie faire a woman well dressed humorless
they want him a lot
and your girls looking to trade
shell give you his motel and room number
shell also have to testify on the coke
thats a no
your guys take it from there
my investigator says hector hasnt checked out yet
as she weighs it whats she want in exchange
you drop charges and all she does is a pre trial rehabilitation
the facility at usc med would be nice
when she hesitates or do i take this straight to the feds
which though veiled is a threat
leslie hates this
high floor tall windows
dobbs on the cut lets in mick
micks checking the impressive room vast views all the way to the pacific as the others enter behind him mary windsor distinguished louis suit silk t shirt ray bans
another man thickly built enters at micks side
windsor this is raul levin
levins my investigator
accepting this everyone takes their place at the long blonde wood conference table
mick cant help run his hand over the surface everythings a contrast to his own on the fly office
dobbs to mrs
windsor i cant commend mr
haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning
mary windsor nods provisionally pleased
i have a check for you mr
and slides it towards him in an envelope
mick tries not to seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside angle we glimpse the amount the zeroes
but im going to need that to come from your son mrs
slides it back to her you can give him the money so he can write the check
but i want the check to come from louis
hes my client and thats got to be clear from the start
she is offended but takes back the envelope nods to louis
he takes out a checkbook writes
mick continues to mary thank you
ill expect you to support your son through this in other ways
if youre willing
dont be silly
ill back my son come hell or high water
these ridiculous charges
that ridiculous woman
its good to know youll be there when we need you
but not now is that it
well be going over the case
could make you testify about what you hear
attorney privilege doesnt cover you
mary windsors motionless a moment
rather than respond she simply rises
to louis i will see you at dinner
dobbs gets the door for her
when shes gone my mother built a good business
from the ground up
ive got no trouble believing that
after a beat i say we get started
all agree they sit mick starts up our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial
i want this behind me
you can stretch things out enjoy your freedom
guilty clients you mean
i want this over
micks struck by how firm
we go to trial right away
puts more pressure on the d
or maybe the case never even goes to trial
they look at him
our firms clout is considerable
pressure can be brought to bear dont kid yourself cecil
to dobbs and louis no way the state is dropping these charges
in fact theyve already upped them to improve their negotiating position
there wont be any negotiating
before mick can speak no plea bargain no nothing
im not going to jail for something i didnt do
it might not be jail
even if i walk
im innocent and if theres a trial i want to get on the stand and tell the jury im innocent
if thats a problem we can part company right now
mick looks at the young man
time to tell me what happened
removes his ray bans
camera moves among l
yuppies night players
the scenes low key but sexy expensive
i was having a drink at morgans ventura boulevard
morgans thats a singles bar right
camera finds louis at the bar checking out the action
right nice place good for pick ups
thats why i was there
looking to get laid pure and simple
mick to raul whos holding a dark blue file raul whats the file say about the girl
reads chicago accent regina campo goes by reggie
an actress and a telephone solicitor
and hoping to retire
soon as she sues my client
ignores dobbs to louis did you know her before last night
reggie campo mid s the finest sexual kitten imaginable humor enlivening her face and eyes and mouth moving
id seen her around but never spoke to her
she was always with a guy
she was with one last night
she slows as she passes louis whispers her lips brush his face as she discreetly hands him something
con t d she just laid her address on me
on a napkin
but she was still with a guy
reggie returns to the guy at the bar s hard like a vet
i got it that she wasnt too into her date
she told me hed be gone by ten if i was interested
i didnt keep the napkin
i work in real estate i remember addresses
check that file youve got and see if the police report has any of this
while raul looks mick explains to louis and dobbs cant hide some professional pride in raul levins work rauls already worked us a little miracle
hes managed to score a copy of the discovery file everything the d
theyd have to turn it over eventually but it could have been weeks
under which rauls checked the blue file and
they dont have the other guy
they dont even have the bar
all theyve got is louis shows up and beats the crap out of her
that is such bullshit just keep telling me
louis is sitting in a porsche carrera
i didnt want to walk in on anything so i got there early
his pov shadow figure of hard guy approaching in the dark
i waited til the guy came out
you see what he was driving
hard guy gets in the corvette pulls out
so he leaves and you go in
arriving up the stairs is louis knocks
a little while and the door opens a crack
reggie part of her face peers out
she saw it was me
coast d the hallway inside was tight
i had to walk past her yknow so she could close the door
so i had to turn my back to her
we see this shes behind him
as we hear simply
contd then that was it
what was what
she hit me with something and i went down
it got black fast
sudden pop to louis struck from behind
blacking out as he tumbles
back to conference tables silent
all looking at louis
what do you remember next
waking up with two guys sitting on me
holding me down
two guys straddle louis who is face down on the floor
contd couple of faggots from next door
police report has them homosexual couple from down the hall
like i said
to which raul says nothing
after a beat go on louis
i was still foggy when the cops came
back to living room
louis is cuffed by now hands behind him cop looms over
contd she was on the couch telling all these lies
paramedics work on reggies bloodied face while to a female cop maxwell through sobs still frightened he was like an animal
he said hed rape me and kill me
then rape me again when i was dead
louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba bloody
thats when i saw shed set it up
set it up how
put blood on my hand
my left hand
but im right handed id use my right if i was going to
which is crazy
louis mimes throwing a punch in the air
louis never hit anyone in his life
what she did made sense
its the right side of her face that was hit she had to bloody your left
louis you said she opened the door a crack
did you see her face
not all of it
it open a crack
enough for her look out half her face
contd mainly her eye
her left eye
back to law office
mimes the opening of the door
she already had the injuries on the right
she was hiding it from him when he steps in
and then she clocks him
so our case is she beat herself up
mick takes the file takes the xl s reggies pulped face
were saying she pounded her face into hamburger meat or had her boyfriend do it hoping some far off day a jury would give her a big fat reward
she must have
she saw his porsche his rolex its known the family has money
ill wager shes already filed in civil court
then to raul okay the police report
lets hear how reggie tells it
shes opened a crack peering out
according to the victim she was at home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door as someone she knew
louis is there talks mos
reggie opens the rest of the way
contd upon letting him in she was immediately struck
which we see the vicious repeated pounding of her face bloodying her but its too fast jumbled for details
does it say he knocked her down
louis flies down on top of her
yeah then straddled her
held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate
louis does as described strangle hold
eventually lets her up turning her toward the bedroom
contd the suspect maintained a position behind her holding a knife against the left side of her throat
raul takes something new from the file photo of a bloody knife
sharpened to a point
louis looks at it
this isnt my knife
raul are his prints on there
thats what the report says
im not surprised if she put blood on his hands shes gonna put prints on his knife
i told you its not my knife
mick ignores still intent on rauls reading
okay hows she say he went down
campo entered the hallway she pushed the intruder backwards into a large floor vase
and reggie scurrying free
stay on the fallen louis as
realizing her attacker would catch her at the front door she ducked into the kitchen and seized a bottle of vodka
louis struggling to his feet hit on the head from behind
and clonked him when he got up
thats how she tells it
those are all lies this is bull if everything she said is a lie this will be the easiest case ever
ill tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea
he moves closer for you swear its all lies
is there anything you arent telling me
micks eyes burn into him
louis answers simply
mick holds him in a long hard assessing stare
over which eventually we pre lap
the way louis tells it
its just quirky enough
mick and raul coming out after having a few
its a lawyers hangout at this hour others are coming going
quirky enough for what
to be true
maybe it went down just like he says
off rauls look anyway theres a
in a party of law types we glimpse maggie who catches sight of mick in the doorway
while raul mulls what mick said
an innocent client
but you know what my father said about innocent clients
maggies overheard this gives the answer
he said theres no client as scary as an innocent man
mick seeing her smiles and continues a little tipsy
because if you screw up and he goes to prison it scars you for life
theres only one verdict
youve got to put an n
on the board
she reads the state hes in
raul if you let a man drive in his condition i think i can charge you both
the guys look at each other
maggie swipes the keys ill drive him to his house
and how will you get home
my friends brought me
ill keep the car he can pick it up at my place in the morning
and she gets in the drivers side waits
mick to raul okay you know the moves
make the rounds check out morgans bar
and regina campo
the way louis says she came ons got me wondering
mick gets in and closes the door
as maggie starts it up and pulls away and we see the nt glty plates again
ride in silence
then mick mischievous turns on the rap
god bless the dead and buried nigga dont worry if you see god first tell him shit got worse
youve got to be kidding me
earl lays this stuff on me
where is earl tonight
i never keep him this late
hasnt he worked your fee off yet
a while ago
but he likes driving keeps him out of trouble
hes taking courses too in music
you cant tell by this stuff
she snaps the rap off
you get used to it
besides tupac he helps me understand my clients
most of them go to school on his not roulet
not louis no
louis is my franchise player he pays for all the rest
after a beat
i heard smithson assigned ted minton to your case
never heard of him
hes brand new
georgetown buys his suits at brooks above all hes a guy
mick looks over at her as she flares calms
moonlight lines her profile
made self conscious by his watching her she moves her hair from her face
beyond pretty beautiful
lorna made me my schedule
saturdays fine to take hayley
saturday theres the sponge bob movie
im all over it
hows she doing
ill know when i drop you and get home to relieve the sitter
catches him looking what
moonlight becomes you
thats not doing me any good haller
the lincoln pulls up
mick gets out but stands there
she nods youre welcome
and pulls away
micks smile fades as he looks up at his dark lonely house
an answering machine hes just hit play
daddy mommy said i could call and say gnight
sorry youre not there
me too baby
then mick hits play again
daddy mommy said i could call
off a framed photo hayley b curls irish eyes
micks got a drink in his hand
is spread out wide white scattering of lights
put on irish brogue top o the mornin mr

micks client darius mcginley black b in chains
mick is beside him as he answers confused the day i get my sentence

judge flynn contd lets get on with your sentence for the sale of rock cocaine and get you off to prison shall we
raul waves to mick wants to talk
darius led off by guards mick defeated confronts raul
what couldnt wait raul
brightens a little wanna see a movie
fixed downward angle on the bar near the cash register
tending bar two hot young women jeans white t shirts
frame counter ticks off bottom right p
we caught a break
the owner had a camera installed to watch his register after he caught the help dipping in last year
and here comes louis
said as louis enters frame sits
mos orders a drink
were while earl stands outside the car as if on guard
raul points out the action working the keys
i had the tape transferred to disc so i could manipulate yknow
raul starts to zoom
shows mick on the screen
id like you to meet reggie campo
zooming in on reggie and her guy over drinks
the corvette man
are you sure
wouldnt have popped a grand for the tape if i wasnt
starts playing image again widen to full shot
rauls voice contd nothing for like a half hour
he races the tape forward
time code flies
he slows it as it reaches
rauls voice contd then
x gets up with pack of cigarettes goes
i know the place
they got a smoking porch out front
thats where he goese
giving reggie her chance
she passes behind louis trails her hand along his shoulders
keeps going out of frame
thats not how he said it went down
he said she gave him her address on a napkin
whoa wait she just went to the little girls
but shes gotta come back no
and now he fast forwards tape again
and this time she stops by louis speaks into his ear presses her body against him
louis nods takes something from her
reggie kisses his cheek quickly continues on
rejoins x at the bar
takes it in excited do the cops have this
how can they

speeds the tape again reggie and x decide to split
guy takes a final swig finishing drink
they exit frame
check out his hand his watch
its on his left
thats no good
it means hes right handed
but the facial blows were from the left
you said you knew morgans
so you oughta realize
as mick stares this image is in the mirror over the bar
thats how the owner set the camera to watch his register
so everythings backwards
and x punches with his left
i told you you were beautiful
but its not on the tape
you know how you were wondering about regina
raul just looks at him
off mick jams wedges its way through traffic to halt at the curb
mick exits heads towards
behind the reception desk is robin tan sexy blonde hair hanging straight over one eye like a scythe
here to see louis
roulet is with someone
he cant be disturbed
its like he doesnt hear her walks calmly past her to the door to louis roulets office mick enters finds louis with his loafers off on the couch with his
cell phone cradled to his ear
robin chases behind
im sorry mr
roulet this man just came back here its okay robin

louis mutters an apology into his cell phone and rings off
looks annoyed at mick
i was setting up a showing
there wont be any showings in pelican bay
its a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders
youll fit in real good in your loafers
whats the matter
you lied to me louis
im about to go and see the new prosecutor whos doing everything he can to put you away and now i find out youve been lying
before louis can deny tell me about reggie campo
what about her
ive told you you didnt tell me
that you were going to pay her for sex
off louiss surprise you think its hard to find out somebodys not snow white
alright yes i was going to pay
she wrote down a price on the napkin four hundred dollars
why didnt you tell me this in cecils office
i didnt want my mother to know
cecil tells her everything
and can we keep it down
her office is on the other side of that door
mick looks at louiss concern
this changes things
you see that dont you
im not a lawyer
explain it to me
alright i will
you know that guy on the venice boardwalk
the one who has all those plates spinning on sticks
what does this have to do with just listen
a bunch of spinning plates thats the states case
in the middle is a big one
its a fucking platter
and if that falls it takes the others down with it
he gets closer to louis the big plate is the victim
the only witness against you
i knock her down the act is over and the crowd goes home
mick has louis attention now
you can make this trial go away
weve lost time
you concealed from me the fact that could do it
it comes down to why
why would a guy with a porsche and a rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway
the answer is he wouldnt
and when you see that you see the set up the trap
and suddenly its the defendant who looks like the victim
louis gets it
youre going to the prosecutor now
young hot shot named ted minton
he wants to give me the discovery file
poor guy doesnt know that raul already got it
hes new to felonies but hes no dope
when he hears his vics a hooker hell know weve knocked all his plates down
then itll be over
no promises louis
louis closes his eyes savors the prospect
then sees mick to the door
when he opens it mary windsors there
surprised to see haller
i didnt know you were here
is there news
there will be mother
and puts out a hand to mick
hesitating half a beat mick shakes it and goes
louis and his mother
regard each other
face to face
mick in a chair
legal secretaries prosecutors etc
come and go when a guy mick recognizes detective kurlen fat approaches a desk with a stack of papers are these for a
yeah and theyre my only copies
ill wait while you copy them
ill have to ask her
but he holds them back
ill run them for you now
just what i wanted to hear
mick tries to avoid kurlen but too late well look whos come callin
re papers he dropped off puttin a case away
guy drowned his neighbors kid in a tub to see what it felt like
it wont shock you to hear he was high
thanks for clearing that up
if he gets san quentin maybe he can look up your boy jesus martinez
mick bristles at this reference
turns away again
to a to a passing secretary is minton back yet
hell be a few more minutes sir
kurlen seeing hes drawn blood continues to needle
hows he doin up there anyway
he make the pucker up and kiss me team
i havent talked to him
i guess once they plead guilty theyre not much use to you
rubbing it in he went down forever right
he got life but hell be out
i dont know when
cause his victim martha renteria
shes dead forever
you dont have to remind me you were lead dick on that
shakes his head
hows a guy like you sleep at night
with the scum you represent
micks had enough
to tell him a story
i had a client once he decapitated his ex wife then kept her head in the refrigerator
naturally you got him off
tried to pile on two unsolved murders trick up evidence to stick my guy with them
its called the justice system we dont do things that way
so your guys out walkin around
he ever do it again
i dont know
i never heard of him after that
but he could have
fuck you haller
fuck the d
before kurlen can react ted minton arrives
fresh faced ivy league
mick stands relieved
sorry you had to wait
i hope itll be worth your while
he gives mick a thin white covered file from a briefcase
mick leaving the still sneering kurlen behind takes the file and follows minton off tapping the file with a finger looks kinda thin for a discovery yes well we can
go to my office ive got a question first
he takes from his pocket rauls disc
the dvd raul gave him
you have something to play this on
angle the young prosecutors face as he watches the bar tape
and mick watching him for his reaction
when its done ted clicks it off
not much reaction at all
what else do you have
the simple polite question throws mick
look ted lets cut the bullshit
not only is your so called victim a working prostitute but weve got her on tape soliciting my client
maybe youre new but you gotta know how hard its gonna be to convince a jury a guy would have to rape a hooker to have sex with her
nothing youre telling mes going to change my offer
youre making an offer
not the way mick thought it would go
ted goes on
well drop the charges to assault with a deadly and attempted sexual battery
the guidelines put him at seven years maybe hell do four
mick uncertain now doubts himself for the first time
what am i missing here
ted stays innocent looking
mick with his daughter hayley
micks on a bench near where hayley waits on line for the next pony
earl approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice cream for hayley and one for himself
kids playing everywhere a miniature train chugs past
but micks lost in thought his beat up briefcase open hes working
got you the good stuff hayley
thank you earl
just then a little girl gets off a pony
the attendant holds it for hayley
mans got your ride ready
go on ill hold your ice cream
excited hayley goes
the attendant lifts her up and on and the pony carrying hayley joins the others in the wide ring
mick watches her for a moment waves then balancing the ice cream returns to his files
theres something right in front of me and im not seeing it
on his lap hes spread out pages from the two files the blue covered one raul gave him
the white covered from ted
mick starts turning pages compares
the same the same
when he turns the next one over its the page raul gave him showing the picture of a knife the picture we saw in cecil dobbs office
turns to the matching page from teds file
in the parking lot pulls up
louis is in front of the club golf clothes waiting
comes out to meet the lincoln
you said we re going to the movies
you promised me last week
daddys got to talk to somebody
you stay with earl
mick gets out hayley stays
louis hurries over as far from the clubhouse as possible in order not to be seen or heard eager whats happened
is it over
you said it would be over by now that was before i found out you were still lying to me
he shoves a sheet at louis
louis looks picture of a knife but different from the knife picture we saw before
you know what that is
its a picture of your knife
the one you had on you when you went to reggie campos
the one the cops have
look at the blood on the blade
look at the initials
louis is stuck for an answer thats why ted minton didnt care when i told him reggies a prostitute
whats it matter when hes got a knife with her blood and your initials on it
this wasnt the knife in the file scowls sore thats right
the file raul got us was a loaded deck
the cops must have been on to him because they used it to set us up
so wed think they had nothing when in fact they had enough to put your hugo boss golf playing ass away for twenty years
mick looks back towards the car parked maybe yards off
he sees hayley in the backseat looking out
so does louis
mick sees him looking her way
feeling the mans look hayley sits back
out of sight
then mick resumes
cold and firm
explain to me why you lied about the knife
i didnt lie
i said the one in the picture wasnt mine
mick frowns grins at the answer
i said it twice
what are you now a lawyer
a clever third rate fucking lawyer with smart ass technicalities
you said it wasnt yours what you should have said was i had a knife but this isnt it
what did you think it would just go away
closing in on him you brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute louis
how am i supposed to make that look like she set you up
off which mick stares hard at louis
at his frightened look
then tries slowly as if for the last time then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom made knife serrated tip with lr engraved on
i always carry it
for a moment mick takes this in
you always carry it
in real estate we show homes to people we dont know
this one time
like its difficult
then goes ahead
she was showing a place
it was in bel air so she thought it was okay to go alone even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way
he was there
who was there
he raped her
when she didnt come back i went to the house and found her
like hes seeing a possibility
thats when she stopped showing property
i do the selling now
and i started carrying a knife
mick turns it over
thats quite a story louis
your mother will have to testify
we dont want that
i dont give a damn what you think we want
from now on you do what i tell you while i try this case
do i make myself clear
louis is silent
mick looks off
towards hayley in the car
on the cut she opens to mick carrying hayley in his armsi fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn
maggie leads mick with hayley through hayley snuggles further in her fathers arms
as they continue
if she wasnt so darn heavy id carry her all night i swear
defense lawyers will swear to anything
hes at the door about to go
maggie delays him with you look like youre in a daze
it turned into a rough week
being with hayley was the only high
she cant find anything to say
as he heads out again
nobodys seen you at four green fields lately
i stopped going
too much of a scene
if you start going again
now she has his attention
if i start again what
smiles shrugs to cover bunch of us from the office are there
tuesdays after work
s zrprising him
ill keep it in mind
after more awkwardness goes
she closes the door
noisy drinking crowd of legal types were moving through it dont realize it at first but its micks pov hes trying to shoulder his way through towards a booth of
women from maggies office maggie sees him lights up a little haller
let him in girls
buy you a beer
you wont make it to the bar
then lets share this
they fight to a table for two edge of the crowd
when he balks at sipping from her glass weve had a taste of each other before
he laughs a little reads that shes had a few
feeling a little better tonight
or did ted minton sandbag you
howd she know
yeah thats exactly what with that guy corliss right
i told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play
but youll take the the guys head off on the stand
micks off guard doesnt know what shes talking about
catches herself giggles whoops i shouldnt say that
to keep it alive so ted talked to you about corliss
it was me who sent him to ted
corliss thought it was my case because i handled first appearance
sees mick is too eager im telling you too much
nah nothing i dont know they always use a professional snitch
when she doesnt bite i mean corliss has done this before right
clams up with cant we just forget work and have a friendly guiness
how about we go somewhere to eat
before she objects so we can talk about our daughter
let me tell my friends im leaving
and mick quick writes the name corliss on napkin
ill bet you didnt know sponge bob movies could be so much fun
the funs watching her
maggie likes this
after a quiet moment
you didnt know minton had corliss til i blabbed did you
he was hiding something i thought it might be a jailhouse snitch
you got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know
except i was already drunk
good point right
he feels something
angle her hand on his knee
hayleys probably asleep
i gotta go relieve the sitter makes a face only i dont think i can drive myself home
one good turn
ill drive you
and will you take me back to get my car in the morning
a loaded proposition
covers her hand with his own
cut to angle hayley sleeping between her two parents
mick opens his eyes maggies awake and staring at him
this is not fair to her
waking up and finding you here
shell get her hopes up
howd she get in here
she comes in here when she has nightmares
she has nightmares
so she sleeps in here a lot
you have no idea what its like raising a child alone
he can tell by her tone all last nights tenderness gone
hes dressing she enters to him in a robe look ill leave then come back in an hour
well go together to get your car then i can take her to just like that
youre gonna start taking her to school
dont you remember what we talked about last night
i thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case or get me into bed getting angry now i cant win with you not when youre
being a defense lawyer
do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it
me trying to get dirtbags off the street you keeping them there just go
edward hopper drabness
to lose himself in work looks down at his files an x of reggie campos battered face
waitress s pours coffee
recoils as she glimpses the picture the gruesome wounds mick didnt mean her to see
i just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her
mick tucks the picture under some papers to hide it but finds that hes only hid it halfway
leaving half her face exposed
the good half
something about this
he picks it up again folds it
leaning over the sink mick holds the folded photo against the mirror the unhurt left side showing
creates a full image of a face
he stares a long time
then to himself martha renteria
three lincolns lined up along a wall
california plates nt glty nt glty nt glty
to some battered file cabinets
he turns on a single bulb lamp
drawer opening on file cabinet
micks fingers fly through the tabs of old files stops at martinez
cut to martinez files on desk moments later mick examines them police reports printouts
until he finds
name renteria maria
bx photo woman dead on a bed naked
next photo tighter knife wounds
next photo her face beaten injuries to the left side opposite of reggies
dark haired large brown eyes
folds this one in half
takes the folded shot of reggie fits them together crease to crease so alike they form what could be the face of one woman
not wanting to face the memory a voice in his head i wish youd called me before you talked to the cops jesus
flashback of mick with martinez whos stalking around in a panic while mick is laying out the bad news
i seen my picture every place
they was gonna bring me in so
but you told kurlen you were in her apartment
he didnt have that he doesnt even have any prints
that shit i tol is true man
i seen her at the cobra room she said if i paid we could go to her place she didnt care about the other guy
nobody saw any other guy
there was another guy bpi guy that she was talking to
plus the coroner says her vagina was brutalized
are you my lawyer or what man
insists crazy now when i left that chick was fine
i fucked her but i didnt hurt her you aint even listenin three people saw you throwing a knife into the l
cause i had that knife in my car
i knew they was gonna find it
if all you did was fuck her then why didnt you leave any prints
the place was wiped down
but your semen was on the towel you forgot you wiped your penis on that towel
i didnt forget nothing
i jus used that towel then i give the chick the money and i left
its not gonna make
dont say that
jesus they want the death penalty
i can see to it that never happens but not if you dont plead
you want me to say i did this
mick hesitates but stays level
jesus theres a deal to be made
i can do that
i can get you life
life means youll do fifteen
you know what that means
mick just looks at him
not much traffic rolling out of the city mid morning
mick at the wheel
beside him his briefcase
sees out on the water the prison fortress of san quentin
on the cut jesus martinez sits
only a few years older than when we saw him but looks bad
glass wall divide them
im not going to ask you how you are because i know
martinez glares at him then spits on the floor
i need to ask some questions
you didnt have no questions then
never ask did you kill that girl
i am trying to make it right
martinez is silent
tell me again about the cobra room
tell you what
the black light latina club music smoke in the middle is a pit iwith a big cobra basket out of which a girl in a snake costume emerges martha
watching is martinez martinez v
contd she was workin
later after the act camera finds renteria half curling herself around martinez martinez v
cont d then she came and talked to me
shes whispering martinez is loving it martinez v
contd she tol me i could take her home
i did but i didnt kill her
you said there was another guy
disentangling from martinez martha slides toward a man tall his back to us
si she talk to him too but she come back to me
though shes with the other man she glances back at jesus
mick opens his briefcase takes out a stack of photos
one by one holds them against the glass with his fingers
when frustrated mick complies but calls guard
mick shows the stack
i need him to look at these
you cant give him anything
but if you wont let him close to the glass how can he see them
thats not my problem
all right but can you stay a minute
if he ids one of these mug shots i need you to witness it
dont drag me into your bullshit
then to martinez try
see if one is the guy
mick holds up one after another
martinez shakes his head no then the booking photo of louis roulet
mick holds it up
off jesus as his eyes narrow
pre lap the yelping snarling of a small fierce dog
were raul in shorts lets mick in over the barks of his shih tzu
cool it ahab
cmon in mick
leaves mick alone while he puts out the dog mick cools his heels
takes in cubs pennant rauls old peaked policemans cap mounted
finally pours himself a vodka
notes the photo of a younger guy its frame hung with the fight aids ribbon
raul re enters
re the drink i helped myself
i owe you the way i let you down on that discovery file it wasnt you
the cops set you up
who was it slipped you the file anyway
some guy in vice i play cards with
you dont know him
youre right i dont
but i know who his partner was when he was in homicide
ill make him sorry
weve got bigger problems
the way mick says it
raul sits asks
where were you today anyway
you were hard to reach
cell phones dont work too well where i was
knows this is why mick came here
i came to tell you a story
about jesus martinez
you were at san quentin
its about what happened after he left martha renterias apartment
after he killed her
he never killed her
he went there had sex flushed the condom wiped his prick on the pink towel and then went home
the story starts after he left
the real killer
the real killer
she lets him in
maybe he fakes like its still martinez and he forgot something
or maybe it was an appointment
we see the door open but we dont see who enters
the other guy from the club
the one jesus said he bid against
he comes in punches her a few times to soften her up
renteria staggers as shes suddenly pummeled then spun
contd then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom
we see the knife tip against her throat
contd only she isnt lucky like reggie campo will be
he climbs on top puts on a condom rapes her
cut to bedroom as mick gives us the action
contd and when hes done he stabs her over and over fifty two times while he works out something in his sick fucking mind
we see the stabbing bleeding then do you need to ask what kind of knife it was based on the wounds
a short blade folding knife
or whose face martinez picked out of the mug shots i brought him
rauls dog barks from outside
of course the story goes on from there
from there its about the lawyer martinez gets himself
dont do this to yourself
ignores on a roll now the lawyer who just assumes he did it because of the dna
the lawyer who gets him the best deal he can and feels pretty good because the deal keeps his client off death row
and this guy this lawyer hes all about the deal see
mick you cant beat yourself up for what you didnt know i just saw him and hes twenty six going on forty
hes a little guy
you know what happens to the little ones up there
he has a type
its more than a type renteria and campo you put their faces together you get the same face
off the drink mick takes you better take it easy
listen i was thinking about this the whole way down on the plane that night with renteria
it was like he hit the jackpot got to do his thing and get away with it
then hes in a bar sees reggie who hes seen before remember yeah but tonight he sees who she looks like
and hes right back there
mick were talking about a really were talking about a killer at work
you know that video from the bar
just like you he saw that mr
x was left handed
struck by this smart as the devil he knows what hes doing
reggies the luckiest woman alive
you think there are others
with that face or you find out
dig into roulet
all youll find is parking tickets i dont buy that anymore
check out knife murders of women
not just the unsolved ones martha renteria was a closed case
look man i cant throw a net like that
im just one guy
you gotta bring the cops in
hes my client
clear on this thats why he hired me
raul looks up startled by this
mick lays it out
i was thinking about that on the plane too he was worried i might hear about the case and put it together
but if he was my client id be bound to keep my mouth shut and protect him
attorney client privilege
i told you he knows what hes doing
you got one guy in prison for what your other client did
what are you going to do mick
im working on it
lincoln in front
mick working on rauls question
trudges up the steps
phone rings before he gets in he fumbles keys this is haller
did you get my messages
maggie no i was up in san francisco for the day
no you werent
you dont go to san francisco you go to san quentin
must have been seeing a client
you always were too smart for me
is hayley okay
look shes playing soccer tomorrow and she wants you to come to the match
youve started something mickey
fine i look forward to it
youll need to pick her up at noon
but under this he sees down the hallway light from a room
angling to see keeping a normal voice
noon ill do that
see you then
and hangs up before she can say goodbye
eyes on the light at the end of the hall
carefully mick begins to move down the hall
pauses at the door he comes to first bedroom dark
kicks it nothing
starts walking again when theres a sound
what was it
mick continues to the lit room side angle we see its the den mick braces and bursts in suddenly sitting in micks chair leg up on the desk
what the hell are you doing here
funny thing is ive been here before
i was offered the house to show never gave back the key over doesnt give a shit get out of my house
rising but but sees mick noticing the electronic anklet on his leg
your friend valenzuela put this on
as if i were going anywhere
i said get up
get up and get out of this house
off micks force micks almost crazy louis smirks goes turns to him to i couldnt reach you
im on trial for my life mick and i get nervous when i cant reach yout and you were away all day
like you told maggie
meaning he listened to the call
mick goes white
you dont come near this house again do you understand me
we arent friends we arent partners youre my client eriod just what i wanted to remind you of
im your client
louis lets in sink in then besides i like it in your house mick
pretty pictures of your kid hayley
dont what dont say shes pretty
but i saw her the other day at the club
at which micks had enough belts louis in the mouth
his lip bloodied louis flashes with anger but then just as suddenly he steels himself
glares coldly at mick
okay im going
but and extends his hand with micks house key in it
first i think i should give you back your key
it isnt right that i have it
now that we can trust each other
mick takes the key
panting he watches louis go down the fucking steps
hayley defending scrambles to get in the way of another girl a forward dribbling towards her
angle mick on the sideline
among other parents
thats it hayley get in her way
hayley isnt quick enough the forward dribbles round her goes in for the score
hayley looks despondently at mick its okay honey
when his cell phone rings
into it this is haller
he strains to listen
his look darkens
even from the field hayley sees this
moving on the cut with mick as he enters
its a crime scene swarms with cops forensics technicians
mick distressed moves as if through heavy water
detectives are leading him lankford clean marine and heidi sobel
they wear paper booties thin rubber gloves
levin was back in his office
we wouldnt have found him if a neighbor hadnt brought the dog back
it was running loose
shows a desk calendar your names all over this
were you the only guy he worked for
no but ive got a big trial next month attempted rape and murder
he was helping me
is that the roulet case
how did you know
because every file thats been rifled has the name
only thing roulet himself is already cleared for this
weve checked the tracking on his tracer anklet and it doesnt show him anywhere near this place
and theres no way to trick those things no way in the world
we see mick register this wants to ask about it but before by the way counsellor where were you this morning
mick rocked by the question
what it means
im a suspect
he knew whoever shot him
there are no signs of forcible he even let the killer into the back room
i was watching my daughter play soccer
a couple of dozen people can confirm i was there
provisionally buying this lankford takes out booties
put these on and dont touch anything back there
raul face down on the floor in front of his desk chair
can you tell us if you see anything unusual
mick draws close
lankford abruptly all i see are pictures of a guy
was he a fruit
he was a hell of an ex cop is what he was
crimes against persons back in chicago
and yeah he was gay and what the hells that got to do with it
if the murder was some kind of gay thing whyd they ransack the office
isnt it obvious they were looking for something to do with his work
lankford cant argue with this
when sobel near the body look
the position of his hands
angle two middle fingers point down
two outside fingers up
was this guy a longhorns fan or what
or is it some kind of sign like he was trying to tell us who the devil did it
seen from the pov of he drives the street his focus pumped up
until he comes to a house its garage door wide open
mick pulls into the drive behind it
what he finds inside beside a family van is a large thin cardboard box
its upright marked fragile
mick stands there knocking at the door
its opened by hey mick
a mix of emotions
whatre you doin here
and i heard about raul levin man
ignores all that you know your garage doors open
shit i just had a plasma delivered
and rushes to
vals relieved to find the box is okay
oh man if we still lived in van nuys this suckerd be gone
set me back eight grand too
but its gonna be great for the games
notes micks silent mood whats up anyway
what brings you out here
val waits listens
ive been with the cops
they cant tie roulet to it because your ankle bracelet doesnt put him near the house
i know i gave them the trace
the bracelets got a mass detector theres no way to beat that
did the cops ask you where you were this morning val
vals slow at first to register just what micks asking
somehow some way louis killed raul levin
and it didnt show up on the trace
mick looks at the plasma tv then back at val
val reddens you better not be sayin what i think that i cut him loose to let him kill raul
maybe you didnt know what he was going to do over angry you think id let that happen
for a fuckin tv
and he lunges at mick shoves him back agains the van mick shoves back harder backwards into the tv box it hits the cement floor hard and val falls on
top of it sickening snap crunch from within the box shit man whered you get the money for an eight thousand dollar tv val
i didnt do that
how dare you say that to me im inocente man mick reacts to the word martinezs word as val glares at him from the ground
get outa here get out of here mick and get outa my life
micks already backing off towards the car keep going man
mick keeps going down the drive and into his car cut to drinking camera moves on him he taps the glass for another
bartender comes over like hes going to pour one
micks keys are on the bar instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys
mick looks at him uncomprehending
youre done here pal
and youre not driving either
shows keys keeps them call yourself a cab or something
off mick maggie lugs him into his room hes a mess
being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service
thats the idea yknow
car service with the lincolns drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to lax
ill be your first customer
and rolls him onto the bed
he looks at her
drunk as he is lemme ask you something
the name corliss
you didnt just give me that just because youd been drinking
you wanted me to have it
she doesnt confirm or deny
just gets him into bed says im not staying

straightens his pillow
how do you do it haller
youre a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex wives and a daughter and we all still love you
we stay on him as she stands up goes
to no one i cant do this anymore
hes in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom
stares at the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch
finds theres a dollar taped to the glass
also the message light on his phone is on
moments later hes pressed the button listens to
message received yesterday eleven
mick its me

rauls voice micks not sure he can deal
but pulls the pencil pad near him and presses start again
rauls voice contd first that witness name you gave me

they put him in usc lock up just to make it harder
under which mick excited is writing down d j corliss
then usc circles this last
rauls voice contd other thing is you asked me to dig deep on roulet

when on the tape he hears dog barking
and a door bell
rauls voice contd uh thats somebody at the door

mick thinks a moment
tries to clear his head
then pulls out a card and dials a number

just before he was killed
i didnt know
the message came at eleven oh seven
he said i think i found martinez ticket out of the q
meaning jesus martinez thats a former client of yours in san quentin
did he say anything else
looks down at his notes
as he tears off the note stuffs it in his pocket
no no thats it
then the dog barked somebody was at the door
he hung up
before she can ask more look maybe you can tell me if theres any progress on the case
when she hesitates he was my friend
sobel makes a decision
well we did catch a break
we found a bullet casing in the room from a
it turns out levin owned a
but when we checked it out it wasnt a woodsman like the gun that killed him
to which mick reacts
as she goes on
the other thing is we cant find his cell phone
noticing mick is silent are you still there
just ill let you know if i think of anything
about his cell phone i mean
and hangs up
leaves sobel wondering
down the hall to a closet climbs clumsily above to a shelf tossing clothes out of the way
finds an old wooden gun box
the top has a brass plate colt woodsman
mick in a cold sweat opens the box
suddenly for air he can hardly breathe straightens his thoughts takes the note from his pocket studies it
guard leads him down a hall
leads him to a room and leaves him there
in prison jumper
gloria im not here about you
im here about me
i need your help
louis lanky graceful takes a seat at the defense table
mick sorts papers
louis turns seems to watch him
angles the gallery dobbs and mary windsor shes on edge but hides also lorna to support mick
while at the table mick
i want to tell you something before we start
better make it fast
youre my lawyer right
so i can tell you anything even a crime ive committed and you have to keep it secret
a beat uncomfortable thats right
unless its one youre going to commit
ive killed people mick
just then courtroom clerk gives a warning two minutes people
why now are you telling me this
because i know your plan
mick looks at him
before he can deny your plan is to defend me on this then when im not your client throw me to the cops
when mick says nothing i cant let that happen
so im telling you ive killed people and guess what
martha renteria was one of them
if you use what ive told you you might get jesus martinez out of jail but youll never practice law again
and ill never be prosecuted
i think its called fruits of the poisoned tree come with me
cuts louis off rises leads him
past prosecution table ted minton turns watches them
as mick leads louis out to
he suddenly spins on louis and puts him against a wall
you son of a bitch
you killed raul
youre right about one thing
i am a son of a bitch
how did you do it
the trace said you werent even in glendale
he was getting too close
yanks louiss lapels you piece of shit do you think you have this wired
i do have an insurance policy
he grabs micks wrists
strong pulls them off his chest
i want my gun louis i walk away from this trial a free man and remain free and it never falls into wrong hands
micks close to hitting him when the door opens judge fullbright is on the bench
nice of you to join us
shes bad hair tough
micks off on the wrong foot
im sorry your honor
what this case is about is a predator
on the night of march sixth louis roulet was out stalking his prey
jury of twelve two alternates
you are going to hear from the victim herself about her lifestyle one that we would not condone
but remember that anyone anyone can be the victim of a violent crime
approaches the jury box the case is clear
a man attacked a woman in her home in order to rape and kill her
it is only by the grace of god that shes here to tell you the story
over ted ladies and gentlemen of the jury
my names michael haller and im representing louis roulet
glances at ted mr
minton doesnt want to use the word prostitute for the woman whos supposed to be louiss victim
he neednt worry this case isnt about how she makes her money
but it is about her actions
how she saw a young man with signs of wealth and chose to target him
closes in on the jury
what she didnt count on was you
the fact that youd put two and two together and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator
as mick exits with lorna for the lunch break
low voiced you had a message from gloria
she thinks she can do what you asked
corliss has the same meal time
she can try
let her try
but it may not matter
what do you mean
i mean corliss isnt on the witness list
it could be ted minton is holding him back
he wont use him until he has to
until i screw up his case so bad he has no choice
can you do that
off mick tries for a confident smile
id describe ms
campo when we got there as
hurt and frightened
she kept asking us if she was safe even after roulet was taken away
mick has maxwell on cross
clerk hands her pages
officer would you read from your arrest report where its marked
the victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked
why did you write that she didnt know him
because thats what she said
so she just opened the door at ten oclock to a stranger
she didnt put it like that
was there blood on his right hand
confused by the shift no his left
or we would have bagged his right one too
as a new witness is on the stand teds witness
talbot you were with miss campo on the night of march sixth
charles talbot the customer from the video
blurred tattoos on muscled forearms dyed blonde hair
had a date with her at morgans
then from there we went to her place and had another date if you know what i mean
air of a sleaze ball sex player but calm and good humored
had you known miss campo before
just called her up
how did you know to call her
from her website
shes got a real good website
jury laughs a little
fascinated but repulsed by this guy
but fullbright stirs disliking talbots tone
did you have sexual relations
four hundred bucks worth
and she earned every cent
angle a male juror red faced with disapproval
mick catches his reaction likes it
ted goes on
and what time did you leave
about five minutes before ten
she say she had another engagement
no she acted like she was done for the night
objection i dont think mr
talbots qualified to interpret ms
campos thinking or plans
i just mean she acted satisfied
go on mr
when you left what condition was she in
was she hurt
no she was fit as a fiddle
i know because id just played her
before fullbright bursts sorry your honor
she was fine
minton goes lifts a sheet over an easel reveals the blown up photos of the reggies battered face
she didnt look like this
what kind of bastard does something like that
answer the question
we made consensual and pleasurable love
which is what life is all about
then i paid her
talbot are you right or left handed
and isnt it true that before you left regina campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face
your honor theres no basis for this sort of questioning
haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements
fullbright looks to mick for a reply
mick half shrugs
part of the defense theory judge
the witness can answer
i never hit her or any other woman
do you know a prostitute named
checks his sheet shaquille barton
shaquilla shakels is her work name
i seen her one time
and if i brought her here and she said you had struck her with your left hand
shed be lying
i tried shaquilla that rough stuffs not for me
im a missionary man
with a strong left
and mick sits drawing a nasty look from ted for this last and a pleased one from louis
cut to where mick as he exits the courtroom for the day is him
sobel holds documents
reaction mick oh shit
mick looks over the pages sobel hands him
this warrant is bullshit good enough to search your house
for a woodsman registered to you
we need to run ballistics on it
she turns around the good cop but shes hurt it would have been better if youd told me that you had a woodsman
i dont anymore
it was stolen
the worst yet
lankford laughs how convenient
the box for the woodsman sobel in gloves examines while we got the history on the piece
turns out it belonged to mickey cohen the gangster in the forties
my father represented him
he got him off for using it in self defense so cohen made him a present of it
sobel careful opens it
like mick said
why didnt you report it stolen
because i knew who took it
they look at him
he told me so i couldnt turn him in without breaking a trust
they do that
doesnt buy this still and all mind if i look around
just in case you havent had time to toss it off a pier
youve got the warrant
lankford sneers starts for the next room
heidi bag the box
as she bags it he wonders why
you cant do ballistics on a box
she glances seeing lankfords gone explains
that old mickey cohen shooting
its kind of famous
it turns out the county still has the evidence in storage
you can match casings to a slug thats fifty years old
itd be easier with the gun but yeah
she goes to join her partner
mick stops her with detective
how long will ballistics take
youll make me think youre worried what well find
im in the middle of a trial
maybe forty eight hours
micks gaze in the mirror fear
mick and ted at the same time
as they move to the front
word is you had interesting visitors last night
worry about yourself ted
youre dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you dont even know it
they peel off mick to the defense table where louis waits for him
before louis can speak low listen you little shit this gun scheme of yours is about to blow up and im not going down for it
if i have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life
mick is seething
one last witness your honor
the prosecution calls regina campo
diminutive conservative dress dark curls around her pretty face none of the aggressive sexiness
hesitant but frank
its true that i lied
i knew him when he came to the door
in fact youd arranged his coming miss campo why did you lie
i was scared
i wasnt sure the police would believe me and i wanted to make sure they arrested him
because hes an animal
she looks tentatively at louis as if still scared then she looks away
louis is blank
mick takes it in
ted follows up do you regret that decision now
if it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else
your honor prejudicial sustained
but angle the jury the damage is done
reggies moved them
i have no further questions for regina your honor
your witness mr
mick about to rise when louis grabs his hand
low voiced i want to remind you of your words
you were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea
thats it keep acting like you pull the strings
mick frees his hand straightens himself
watched by louis
then all at once to surprise her ms
campo have you engaged an attorney to sue mr
roulet for the events of march sixth
recovers no i havent
but have you talked to an attorney
i havent hired anybody or i asked if you talked to one
about a possible lawsuit
micks crisp like he knows for sure
she wilts a little
it was nothing more than talk
did you ask if you could sue mr
roulet for damages
i thought what you say to lawyers is private
if you wish you can tell the jurors
ted squirms seeing the box shes in
i think i want to keep it private
ted squirms again
okay lets go back to the night at morgans
had you ever seen louis roulet before that night
there and other places
ever noticed he wore a rolex watch
or that he drove one of two cars a porsche or a range rover
i never saw him driving
and what made you approach him
i knew he was in the life
i had seen him leave with girls who do what i do
to go to a hotel or their apartments
i dont know where
so how do you know they left
maybe they just went out for a smoke
because they got in his car and drove away
but you just testified that you never saw mr
now you saw him leave with a prostitute like yourself
which is it
the contradiction rings round the room
i saw him get in a car but i didnt know what kind it was
do you know the difference between a porsche and a range rover
ones big and ones small i guess
reggie shakes her head knows shes not making it
but mick like hes just getting started
the women he left with when you saw them again had they been beaten or injured
i dont know i didnt ask
but girls in your profession talk about customers dont you
warn each other if someones a freak
and how many had warned you about louis roulet
so you believed youd be safe
i thought he was a known quantity and i needed the money so
so you thought he could solve your need for money
isnt that why were sitting here
because you zeroed in on him
i mean yes but not like that looking round a plea to he attacked me i swear
the bar tape blown up projection shows reggie passes louis angle courtroom on reggie watching the tape
also jurors reacting enthralled and mick watching them
resume court mick signals the technician
it goes off
what did the napkin say ms
my name and address
and your price
four hundred dollars
after a beat its a hard line of work
in fact havent you told friends you were looking for a way out
im not proud of what i do and so isnt it true nothing would be easier to understand that you saw louis roulet and his money as a way out
thats not what this is about
that man hit me and tried to kill me
yes weve heard you say that judge may i ask the witness to stand up
surprised but the witness will stand
i hope youre going somewhere with this mr
now if you please walk over to my client
she goes stands before louis
who rises on cue from mick
this is the man you broke free from overpowered knocked out
yes you can do amazing things when youre afraid how much do you weigh ms
because your website reggie for fun dot com says one hundred three
reggie stands there
ive got no further questions for the witness your honor
reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutors table
where we pick up ted minton
staring at mick hiding the sense of damage as best he can
hes startled when mr
do you have another witness for us
ted rouses summons confidence rises
while aside louis to mick re ted
he looks worried
mick watching ted waits tense
the state rests your honor
micks disappointed no corliss
not worried enough
raises a gavel
then the defense will call its first witness after lunch
and the gavel comes down
yes i recognize this knife
holding an evidence bag its the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years
why would he need protection
because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt
even raped or murdered
but has louis ever been the subject of such a crime
but he knew someone who
go on please
she was raped and robbed by a man
louis found her
it was terrible
the first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry at all times
looks at ted minton march sixth would have been no different
windsor you seemed pretty exact about when your son started carrying around this this weapon a five inch folding knife
the incident took place on june ninth two thousand one
mick watches ted carefully
cat and mouse
was it in the newspapers
or do you somehow remember because the police came to talk to louis
there was no police investigation
then how can you remember the exact date so well
sly look at mick were you given the date before testifying here
i know the date because ill never forget the day i was attacked
the news falls on ted
she goes on before he can rally
mary windsor contd louis will never forget it either
he found me in that house tied up
it was traumatic for him
shes perfect a strong woman unused to showing emotion
mick smiles impressed
when with some sarcasm mr
minton anything else
ted still thrown stares down at his notes
as louiss mother youd do or say anything to save him wouldnt you
i wouldnt lie
not about what happened that day
we have no police or hospital record that it even occurred
i never reported it
i was ashamed
if you dont understand that i cant explain it to you
and yet i live with it every day
but its only you who says so mary looks at ted and at the judge as if confused is that a question
off mick admiring go to mick packing his stuff looks up as ted approaches
ive been thinking about the thousand razors
louis waits on the steps mick comes out
where theyre alone
weve had an offer
want to spend six months in county jail
i told you from the beginning i know the only verdicts not guilty
well get there
grateful for this louis puts a hand on micks arm
but dont touch me louis
you want to show your gratitude give me my gun back
louis grins meaning no way
i thought so
you still sure you want me to put you on the stand
i insist on it
then get some rest tonight youre up next
leaving louis mick continues down the steps to where the lincoln waits
he gets in
earl in the front seat
theres something i need you to get me earl
a tone earl never heard him use before
earl turns around
mick steps past ted on his way to his desk
as he passes did you talk to your client
ted feigns surprise but acceptance
while to the judge the defense calls louis ross roulet your honor
i turned toward the living room the way she pointed
angle mick has a floorplan of the apartment on an easel
and what happened when you turned
something hit me and i blacked out
i dont know for how long
that was all
then when i woke up these guys were on me telling me not to move
i couldnt anyway
i was too scared
mick moves toward louis as if determined to find flaws
but there was blood on your jacket and your left hand
someone put it there because i didnt
are you left handed
you didnt strike ms
campo with your left fist
threaten to rape her or kill her
passionate but simple do you know what its like to be accused of something like this
to listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful
i i understand i had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything but if guilty people have rights what about innocent people
i am innocent
meets louiss eye communicates you were perfect
nothing further judge
ted already up moving passes mick as he takes his seat according to you ms
campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set up
all i know is that i didnt
and this knife you always carry how did she know shed find it on you as part of the set up
she couldnt could she
i mean i never took it out or showed it to anybody so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money i had
that i was going to pay her with right
id really prefer it if i ask the questions and you answer them
then calming himself would you look at this please goes to the easel reveals photo of reggies beaten face
please tell us again if you think regina campo would or could have done this to herself
i dont know who did it but it wasnt me
nobody deserves that to happen
seizes on this what do you mean by deserves
do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she deserves
right back at him i mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is no woman deserves that
ted keeps staring at the photo wants the jury looking there
i have no more questions
at which suddenly theres a wave of movement slow motion louis dismissed from the chair ted returning to his seat passing mick as mick rises louis gives mick a howd
look mick nods unmistakably you did fine
micks look finds ted mick and ted holding each other in a gaze micks face in a kind of smile ted grim as mick brings out speaking to the judge
but his smiling eyes fixed on the unhappy ted resume normal speed for micks confident fateful words your honor the defense rests
ted hears this sets his jaw
fullbright turns to him
ted is uncertain
the state needs the night to decide your honor
to decide what
frankly i wasnt anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses
i id like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness
reacts objects your honor first weve heard of i said consider
i need to find out if the witness is even the state still has an obligation to disclose the identity not if i decide not to use him
a note of pleading im begging the courts indulgence your honor
fulbright doesnt like it
but weighs yields
go to its the vast view from micks porch
he has a drink in his hand
and holds a phone to his ear
theres a rumor in the office
how im the one who shot raul
in the bg we see hayley in pajamas jumping on her bed
maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak
haller is this serious
id say so
im being set up for his murder
couple of detectives from glendale are following me around just waiting for the go ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant
could be any minute
how is this possible
bad timing bad client me being dumb
is it roulet
is that the client
i cant talk to you about my clients
how is hayley
but haller if she ever hears anything about this she wont
not if i play it right
what are you going to do
a long beat
then he says just as he told raul im working on it
i have a plan
close on mick in the back seat
looking out at the rain
his look a little different close shave neat suit
fade up sound of earl meanwhile rattling on
when not guilty two gets to four thousand miles thats two cars ready thats enough to start the airport runs
scene we saw at the opening
you gettin any of this mr
mick opens the file back seat office extraordinarily neat
top of the print out the people of the state of california vs
earl holds an umbrella over mick they hurry into the building
the items in his briefcase checked wand passed over him
as he moves down the hall
everything counts today
enters ted prepares at his table
look at each other without greeting as mick moves to the clerk who shuffles papers
bill im getting coffee
any for you
no man im off caffeine
hey is that the custody list
can i see if any of my no good clients are on it
bill lets him have it
mick casual looks over the names
lorna shes paying for a take out coffee when mick scoops her up by the arm urgent hes been looking for her mintons putting on corliss
hes got him in lock up already
but gloria still hasnt let us know if she got to him
you said she had mealtimes to work it
ill take my chances
meantime did you serve kurlen
moving her out of the cafe down the hall hushed fast yes but i didnt like forging the judges signature
yes you did
yes i did
just then approaching he sees sobel lankford are they coming for him
no they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trials last day
relieved now go and be ready for my call
lorna starts to go then pauses
im crazy about the power suit
extra flip to her hips as she goes because micks watching
no sooner enters than kurlens in his face waves a document
what shit is this haller
i got nothing to do with your case
mick innocent inspects the papers
with surprise subpoena to appear as a witness
youll just have to wait and see
its a legal document detective
cursing kurlen takes himself off to a corner
leaving mick with the legal document
he tucks it away and continues to the front past cecil dobbs and mary windsor to louis at the defense table
over which pre lap mr
minton does the state have any rebuttal
rises ready the state calls dwayne jeffrey corliss as rebuttal witness
who is this witness
why wasnt i told before now
a fair question
dwayne corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with mr
roulet in custody following his arrest
shouts suddenly bullshit
i didnt to talk to quiet mr
haller control your client
mick bends over to louis sotto voce that was good
now leave it to me
to the court i do share my clients outrage your honor
id at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony
corliss did not come forward until yesterday
this is incredible
do you want to go back and talk to him
given the timing id allow it
no judge we all know what this is this is a jailhouse snitch and anything hed say would be a lie thats groundless your honor i just want my objection
then im going to rule he can can i ask one indulgence
can i step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator
for whatever good it will do at this late date
mick already dialling lorna answering yep here
put your watch at quarter of
at ten fifteen you enter the room
with the printouts
mickey i know the moves
he snaps shut his cell phone
we recognize him the holding cell junky
corliss are you incarcerated at this time
um no now im just in the courtroom
dumb answer draws laughs
angle louis seething
but you are currently held in the jail ward at usc hospital
since i got arrested
for burglary and drug possession
do you know the defendant
i met him in lock up
we was bussed over from jail and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance
and did you talk at that time
we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes
you know what are you in for
did he say what he was in for
he said for giving a bitch exactly what she deserved
those were his words
reaction louis stirs like a caged animal
i have only one more question
have i or has anyone made you promises to get you to testify
its the right thing to do
judge turns to mick whos just staring angrily
like he doesnt know what to do
louis the others watch anxiously
mick crosses to the front steals a glance at the rear sees kurlen standing against the wall lankford and sobel seated in front of him
how many times have you been arrested mr
about seven in l
couple of times in phoenix if you count those
so you know how the system works
i try to survive
and sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates is that it
objection your honor
take a seat mr
i gave you leeway bringing this witness in
thank you your honor
but ill rephrase how many times have you snitched on an inmate
testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution
this makes my fourth
people just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them people talk to me
im a friendly guy
mick walks toward louis indicates him so you and my client were friends thats right we was friendly and he just said what you said he said about what the
woman deserved and then you went back to talking about cigarettes
he was like bragging
he told me he did it before
like hes in a mine field and cant move
he said the other time he killed the bitch
he got away with it then and he would get away with it now
staring at corliss you
all eyes on mick
the judge prompts
no more questions your honor
re direct your honor
fullbright nods permission
while louis leans over to mick
what the hell is this
you tell me
what did you say to this guy
through gritted teeth nothing
this is a set up
youre doing this
how am i doing this
but louis has no answer
meanwhile teds taken the floor
you said he was bragging
well like he told me the details
about the other one that he killed
he called her a snake dancer
she danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit
angle reaction detective kurlen he leans forward at this
same time reaction at the defense table mick alarmed low to louis how does he know this
do you think i know
if you didnt tell him this shit somebody did
resume ted moving closer to corliss is there anything else he told you
no that snake girl stuff was it
after a beat then no further questions your honor
the look he gives mick in passing is one of abounding confidence
covert glance micks pov looks to see if kurlen is where he was against the wall
so is lankford
and the courtroom door still swings slightly as if theyve just left
while in front any re cross from the defense
mick rises to answer hesitates and just then turns to see lorna enter and approach down the aisle
a moment with my staff judge
he meets lorna at the gate
brings his head close to hers
this is where i whisper in your ear tell you stuff
takes a file from her its all here right
you go now i dont want anyone talking to you
she goes he returns to the table
before louis can speak i dont know whats going on here but it wont matter if its two murders or a hundred if i can show hes a liar if
you set me up i swear ill just tell me if theres anything else he knows
anything else i have to stay away from
i dont know because i never talked to him
im not that stupid
it doesnt matter
if i destroy him none of it counts
from his gut then destroy him
returns to the witness corliss dwayne if i can call you that its what people call me dont they also call you d
for example down in phoenix right
hes a bit wary
mick looks through the file lorna brought because you know my assistant she was just reading on the internet about d
corliss arrested in phoenix on drug charges hometown of mesa arizona
yeah thatd be me
but you remember fred bentley right
corliss darkens stumbles at this teds quick i object your honor where is the defense going with this
connect the dots soon mr
but the witness can answer
i dont remember any bentley sure you do
you testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with rape of a ten year old girl even though he denied his guilt in court
i ringing any bells d
uh i was high a lot theres not much i recall then id like you to read this to us d
its a printout of a news story from the arizona star thats eight years after he was convicted
i ask that it be admitted into evidence your honor
a news report
lets see where it takes us
the state can object later
mick hands printout to the bailiff who gives it to corliss
ive marked the paragraph
i aint too good at reading
clears his throat a man frederick bentley wrongly convicted of rape was released saturday after con conclusive dna results cleared him of the crime
the case was bolstered at trial by testimony from an informant d
corliss of mesa who claimed bentley had bragged to him about the rape while together in a holding cell thats enough
takes it from him were you charged with perjury for that incident d
no i was not
was that because the police were complicit in your confession
rises angry judge how can the witness know what went into the d
ignores over were you promised the same deal here mr
to say that louis roulet bragged to you in the holding cell
haller that will do
i have no more questions
and mick sits
until im excusing the jury for an early lunch
bailiff see them out
maintains a smile as the jurors leave
then her smile dies
no sooner through the door than fullbright wheels on ted mr
minton do you know what you have done
youve put a documented liar on the stand a man with a record of putting innocent people your honor i you shut the fuck up when im talking to you
i can think of nothing more prejudicial or corrupt than what i just saw out therel in a rage now do you realize what youve done to my trial
as mick and ted exit into hall ted hurrying off angry mick to louis dobbs and mary windsor tells them re ted hes going to see his boss
to decide what to do before the judge comes down with a directed verdict
whats a directed verdict
she takes it out of the jurys hand and declares an acquittal
oh my god
well know in a few minutes
and heads off
louiss cold stare watches him go
mick at the urinal
louis enters in and slides behind him
im not celebrating just yet mick
yeah i can see that
i want to know how corliss got that shit he was saying
let it go
youre getting what you want im getting you off
what i want is get off for good
leans into him
pushes a hand into his back
youd better understand that
youve got enough reasons to be afraid of me already
when door opens the courtroom clerk bill enters
i just spoke to the district attorney your honor
the state wishes to dismiss all charges
heres a motion
mick louis watch ted hand it to fullbright
it acknowledges that the procedures which guarantee justice were not followed in this case
as she reads this is a motion to dismiss with prejudice
no coming back
yes your honor
tearful at the news grips micks hand
she and dobbs
haller thank you for my son
you were splendid and louis
private a few feet away
i knew i wasnt wrong about you
i want the gun

no more can be said because mrs
windsor descends on mick mr
haller this time i insist you come to orso for a celebration i dont think so
mary would insist but before she can out of the elevator comes kurlen with lankford and sobel
mick freezes expects the worst but they move around him and close in on louis roulet you are under arrest
turn around and place your hands behind your back
as kurlen cuffs him mick
this shouldnt be happening
windsor rushes kurlen sobel tries forcing her back no
take your hands off my son
louis voice controls her
stricken mary gives up
then what are you arresting him for
starting to take louis suspicion of murder
the murder of martha renteria
that snake dancer nonsense
are you crazy
everything that man corliss said was a lie
which stops kurlen
he grins confirmed
if it was all lies howd you know i meant the snake dancer
dobbs sees his mistake
kurlen begins again to take louis a moment with my client detective
kurlen nods why not
mick leads louis a few steps away
this is it louis
i got you off
now get yourself a new lawyer
youre forgetting i have the gun
yeah and youll have to explain how you got it
but you know what
ive stopped giving a shit
youre going down and martinez is getting out and thats all i care about
when they stick that needle in your arm that will be me
and what if i dont go down
but micks finished ready to leave though louis persists
because i dont think they have enough to hold me
i could be out by tomorrow
youve got women youve got a daughter
at this micks head snaps to him angrily
you cant protect everybody
kurlen arrives takes louiss elbow
micks already moving to the elevators
watched by sobel
sobel catches up as mick reaches the lincoln
they move to beneath an overhang where theyre almost dry
please tell me youve got enough on louis for the murder of renteria
we have the ticket
the parking ticket that raul found
that was the phone message he left you
sees mick doesnt know raul checked
louis got one at a meter outside the victims place same time she was murdered
what about rauls murder
do you have him for that
we still dont know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet
before mick can ask more haller
leave it alone
he hesitates but goes
into the rain
gets into he watches sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain
got that thing you asked for
and he hands mick something wrapped in a towel a gun
mick puts it away in the armrest
a bit regretful because i said id never do this
ask you to violate your parole
its called lookin out for your blood
mick sits back
earl pops in a rap cd tupac
to be a man in this wicked land
hand held mick in windbreaker jogging
as rap fades camera trails micks messy kitchen take out pizza beer bottles
and the gun
barrel protrudes from under the thrown aside windbreaker
micks seen on the porch
phone rings he rushes into answer
mick its maggie

youre calling to congratulate me
no listen to me roulet is out
theyve had him half a dayl i know
but the d

sonofabitch sailed right past the turn
screen cursor travelling
so wheres he going

keep track of him
hangs up again
looks around as if looking for an idea then frantic looks up a number cant find it finds it dials it rings cold sweat til somebody answers eddie
its mick haller
as the road saints eddie hard case others pour out of the bar jump on their harleys
inside which the ringing of a phone brings us back to yes
mick its me
wheres maggie live
hes almost there mick
descending on the valley side
harleys pouring it on in formation like fighter jets
she screeches to the curb hops out
school bus stop where other parents wait in cars under umbrellas
maggie rushes forward scans for the approaching bus
nowhere in sight
hes holding a phone squeezing it listening to a ring at the other end
to himself a prayer
maggie be there maggie pick up
stands there with the sitter
sees the bus approaching
her cell phone left on its dashboard rack ringing
frantic for her to answer
youve reached the cell phone of maggie mcpherson
slams down the phone
desperate grabs his jacket his gun flies towards the front door
opens it and mary windsor stands there
before he speaks she raises her hand and shoots him
bright flash nicks pov woozy he falls back she raises her gun again you took my son away from me
she raises her gun again mick fires at her from inside the jacket
her body jerks back she falls
mick stunned lies there
he watches through the haze of his condition as mary windsors fallen body jerks on the floor
cut to hate contorting his features hes checking out the street numbers through the downward slash of rain
the road saints motorcycles spanning the street are heading off louis his confusion and dawning fear
cut to out steps hayley safe into maggies arms
sitter looks on as maggie hugs her
where he was shot
hes alert but still
then rouses more as he hears feet come up the front steps
forces out the words theyre down
suddenly lankford sobel are through the door lankford sees mary on the floor while dont move haller she rushes to him
lankfords already on his phone this is lankford weve got a shooting twelve twelve creek off laurel we need paramedics ambulance transport for two during which hes checking mary windsors
body revises transport for one
sobel takes micks hand presses it to his wound press hard and keep pressing
micks hand is on a blood soaked hole hurting like hell
while lankford makes another call
yeah its lankford again
tell them its over they can grab roulet and bring him in
so bring him to the emergency room first then bring him in
rings off to sobel dig this
the uniforms had some help picking up roulet
some motorcycle gang was already beating the shit out of him
figures it out the police were tailing him
we thought hed come after you
we couldnt tell you
the truth is we had plenty on him for killing renteria
jesus martinez will be released
but we wanted roulet for levin too
i told you we had to find out how he beat the trace
now we know
her glance goes to mary it was almost perfect
hes still wearing the anklet
and it puts him half a city away
just like last time
they share a look at the cleverness of it
when look at this
mick looks his woozy pov again lankford wearing a glove lifts marys gun
pearl handled the woodsman
admiring they dont makem like this anymore
mick makes a shape with his free hand
the longhorns sign inner fingers pointing down
like raul made
which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking
s best weather smog blue
the tree off micks porch
hayleys skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch
from the angle we can tell someone is watching her
and so pretty
watching is recovering but not fully there
maggie sits into frame beside him
i didnt know you were awake
he looks at her
dont worry we havent been living here
we did for a while
when you were touch and go
returns his gaze to hayley going branch to branch
id better get her down she can get hurt up there you can get hurt anywhere
let her climb
an almost normal tone of voice
cut to keep your speed up earl
hes in the back seat its a mess
hes scribbling on papers as they ride
his cell phone rings
this is haller
