b if window
href b b the battle of algiers the battle of algiers inside a three story villa just built with whitewashed walls
an elevator shaft is empty the large cables dangle
on every landing two apartments
the front doors are wide open
whitewash on the floor of the halls swirls of whitewash on the windowpanes naked light bulbs hung from electric wires
the rooms contain hardly any furnishings
the kitchens are still without sinks and stoves
an agitated bustle a rhythm of efficiency
paratroopers go up and down the stairs pass along the halls enter and leave the rooms
the sounds in the background are indecipherable
the scene is tense
when the paras are tired they move to another room
they sit down stretch out on the floor drink coffee or beer and smoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift
suddenly the rhythm of this routine the timing of these images is upset
a para rushes down the stairs and asks cheerfully while running the colonel
wheres the colonel
we know where ali la pointe is
one of them spoke
his voice echoes through the corridors on the landings from one floor to another
the excitement is contagious
many crowd around the door of the kitchen
the algerian who has spoken is there
he is young with a thin face and feverish eyes
the paras are all around him they help him stand up dry him clean his face with a rag give him some coffee in a thermos cover
they are full of attention sincerely concerned
one of them tries to push away the others
cmon let him breathe
meanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true
so he spoke
does he really know where ali is
it seems so
well go see
give him a little coffee
marc is tall and husky his eyes young and cheerful
one of the others asks him with a shade of admiration hey marc you made him talk
he then begins to smoke again and moves aside to rest a bit
the algerian is trying to drink but his hands are trembling
someone helps him and holds still the cover of the thermos drawing it to his mouth cmon sadek
drink youll feel better
the algerian drinks but his stomach cant take it causing him to double over and vomit again
colonel mathieu enters elegant and graceful
smiling at ease
is it true
i think so
rue des abderames three
the colonel turns to the para who had gone to call him and who is holding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands
then he goes near the algerian lifts his chin inspects him for a moment with curiosity
chin up its all over
nothing can happen to you now youll see
can you stand up
the algerian nods yes
the colonel turns to the paras who are holding him up
let him go
he takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the algerian
here put them on
the algerian mechanically takes the fatigues but he doesnt understand
the colonel explains to him were trying to help you
were going to the casbah
dressed like this they wont be able to recognize you
were going to see the place then youll be free
and under our protection
the algerian shivers from the cold
he is completely naked
he laboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him
go on give him the cap
they give him a wide belt and buckle it
the other paras one on either side of him pull up his sleeves to the elbows
a third places the cap on his head and cocks it
the colonel turn to him angrily dont be an idiot lagloy
the algerian is ready
the paras look at him repressing their laughter
the algerian continues to tremble
his breath is short his eyes glossy
he is crying
the algerian looks around
he breathes deeply
then suddenly unexpectedly he lets out a hoarse cry no
and tries to jerk forward toward the window
marc seizes him immediately and with his right hand grabs him by the chest almost lifting him
with his left hand he gives him two quick slaps not very hard
persuadingly what do you think youre doing you fool
do you want us to start all over again
cmon be good
dont make me look like an idiot in front of the others
he makes a reassuring sign to the colonel
then he takes the algerian by the arms and they move off
the city is gray and white by the sea which looks like milk
the dawn outlines her features sharply
the streets and wide avenues of the european quarters are empty
silence until gradually is heard
one truck after another
their headlights on with an opaque glow by now useless
a line of trucks follow one another along the sea front all at the same speed
they turn right and go up toward place du gouvernement
here without stopping the columns divide in two
the two lines enter each of the two roads that lead up to surround the casbah
in the brighter light the casbah appears completely white limestone
enclosed by the european city it stands at a greater height and overlooks it
mosaic of terraces
white pavement pavement interspersed by the black outlays of narrow alleys
only a jump from one terrace to another
agile and silent the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry
they arrange themselves geometrically their movements synchronized
they disperse and disappear in the alleys
they reappear together then once again scatter
they meet without looking at one another each one takes his own course
in like manner without a sound they are above even on the terraces in perfect geometry
even up here the paras tighten their grip
every three yards there is a para even at all four corners of an intersection
they are also in the side streets as well as the main streets
and also above against the sky many other paras appear
the doorway is the height of a man
a squadron stands ready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position
marc continues to hold up the algerian by his arm
the captain glances at his watch then looks up at the terrace and gives a signal
in a lowered voice without turning around he speaks to the para who is at his back fire
the para nears the front door his legs wide open his machine gun clenched at his side and aims at the lock
he moves the gun barrel in a circular direction
immediately the others hurl themselves against the door
at the same time the door of the terrace is broken down and the paras burst into the house below
the inner courtyard is square
in the center there is a well above a patch of sky on four sides the arcades columns and majolica arches
beneath the porches there is a door for every dwelling
and above a balcony with railings and other doors
the doors are wide open
the paras quickly carry out their orders
the people are used to all this and know how to obey
the scene takes place exactly as if it were an arranged maneuver a practice drill
the rooms are emptied in a few seconds
the people are crowded together in the courtyard
eyes wide with fright
men women and children with blankets and sheets thrown around their shoulders
by now it is almost day
a soft light is diffused from above
the algerian walks with his head lowered marc on one side the captain on the other
they climb to the first floor and go along the balcony
the algerian stops in front of a door
the captain murmurs softly here
the algerian nods yes
the room is badly lit
there is a mattress on the floor and another on the table a cupboard against the wall some chairs
at the back of the room to the left there is a dividing curtain hung by a cord at medium height
the curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass headboards is visible
the algerian points in that direction the captain signals for him to go there
they go forward silently and push aside the curtain
there is a small light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with postcards and photos
the baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by majolica tiles
the algerian points to a spot in the brick structure on the back wall between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room
marc and the captain have their machine guns ready
the captain goes near the wall his breath drawn and begins to examine it
he runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally between one row of tiles and another
he taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the interstices crumble
he looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his nail
he squeezes it in his fingertips it is soft newly laid
then he bends over places his ear to the wall and listens
suddenly he smiles
there isnt enough air in the hiding place
the four are forced to breathe deeply
and in that small space their laborious breaths resound like splashes
ali la pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that seals the hiding place
his eyes are large black slanted his eyelids heavy somewhat lowered so that the black of the irises appears even blacker in the shadows deeper and more sullen
petit omar is with him a boy of twelve and mahmoud who is eighteen
there is also hassiba a kabyle girl blond blue eyed and fair skinned
the hiding place is only five feet high and hardly holds them
they are sitting or stretched out on the ground close to one another
the entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall which matches exactly the rest
it is held firm by a bar through an iron ring attached at the center
on the other side of the cell above them there is a hole for air
they are tense and do not move
their lips are dry half open and their breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe
off ali la pointe
the house is surrounded
you havent got a chance
let the child and the girl come out then you and the other one
leave your weapons inside
its useless to try anything
our machine guns are ready to fire you wouldnt have time
do you understand
alis face is motionless and hasnt changed its expression
off ali do you hear me
you are the last one
the organization is finished
all your friends are dead or in prison
youll have a fair trial
come out surrender
why are they breathing so heavily
they havent got enough air inside
and again the voice of the captain clear and somewhat distant off make up your mind ali
do you want us to wall you in or do you prefer that we blow you to pieces
so much the worse for you
alis expression is still firm his stare is dark and sullen
the casbah compressed humanity swarming in the alleyways on the steps in the cafes in the arab baths in the mosques and in the markets a tangle of voices gestures
faces veiled women eyes
someone is putting up a handbill another distributes them
national liberation front
the time has come to break loose at long last from the bonds of misery in which one hundred and thirty years of colonial oppression has kept us chained
the moment of struggle is near our goal national independence
the european city reinforced concrete asphalt steel lights shop windows buildings automobiles
a steady rhythm of efficiency music cordiality an aperitif
in order to avoid a fatal and bloody conflict we propose an honorable program of discussion to the french authorities on condition that they recognize the right of our people
to self government
and the algerians who work in the european city the dockers waiters laborers street cleaners farm hands and gardeners
be ready for action
the national liberation front calls you to struggle
unemployed peddlers beggars shoeshine boys
two hands are moving one over the other they criss cross with incredible speed at the same time they are shifting three small pieces of wood which appear to be
the hand movements are marked by a kind of algerian chant
from time to time the pieces of wood are overturned for a split second so that the other sides are visible
robust hands thick unusually agile for their size
the hands of ali la pointe younger then twenty four years old
a european quarter of algiers
coming and going of people automobile traffic
on the sidewalk a small group of european and two algerian boys
other passersby stop to watch
the group crowds around the stand where ali la pointe is playing his game
the entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood
alis hands seem to move by themselves
his glance always a bit sullen apparently distracted indifferent passes from one face to another and then to the street from one side to another
at fifty yards a policeman
two europeans a man and a woman are speaking to him in an excited manner and nudging him along pointing to ali
yes thats him
ali is no longer singing
his hands have stopped moving
ali pushes his way through the crowd
he breaks into a run
the policeman also begins to run
the street is sloping
ali flees pursued by the policeman
he dodges passersby with agility
he gains ground
but nearby are heard
and also in front of him
another two policemen they too are running
there is an intersection
at the corner a cafe
young europeans leaning against a shop window stop chattering and look
ali reaches the corner crosses the street passes by the bar
there is a blond youth about eighteen who seems to be a student who stretches out his foot and pushes a chair in front of him
ali stumbles and falls
the youth attempts a laugh and at the same time moves backward
ali is lying face downward but suddenly turns his head toward the youth and stares at him
then lifting himself by his arms he turns to look back
the police are now twenty yards away
ali gets to his feet
for a split second he hesitates
he hurls himself against the youth headfirst
using his head ali rams into the youths face striking him in the nose and splurting blood everywhere
the youth is unable to shout
he opens his mouth in the attempt but the only result is a gurgling sound and blood
his friends intervene
ali is surrounded
the police arrive
a mass of people jump on ali kicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please
finally the police aid ali and disperse the crowd
ali is now in handcuffs and being led away
more people have arrived
they are yelling shouting insults and spitting on ali
ali passes in their midst protected by the police
he pays no heed to the fist blows the shouts the spits but seems neither to see nor hear as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle
this time and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance
he is walking with an unfaltering step
his face is emotionless oval swarthy
his hair black and wavy his forehead low and wide his eyes large and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered his mouth firm and proud
omar ali known as ali la pointe born in miliana march
occupation manual laborer farm hand boxer presently unemployed
former convictions oran juvenile court one year of reformatory school for acts of vandalism
two years of reformatory school for theft
court of algiers eight months for compulsory prostitution and resisting arrest
the air is clear and springlike
a cv citroen delivery van is parked in front of the minister of the interior warehouses
the rear door is open the motor is running a policeman is at the wheel
two workers in overalls exit from the warehouses
each one is carrying a box and places it inside the van
the boxes are made of seasoned wood both of them rectangular
they are each about eight inches long one and two yards high respectively
the two workers sit down inside the van toward the rear
they are facing toward the exterior
their feet are dangling and almost touch the ground
the jolting movement of the van in motion causes them to laugh
streets of paris
girls with lightweight clinging dresses
the two workers call them whistle gesture and then move off in the distance
the van stops in front of a warehouse
the two workers jump to the ground place the boxes on their shoulders and enter the warehouse
the boxes are moving on a mobile ramp
there is a large label on each one which says republic of france
minister of the interior
barberousse prison is situated on the outskirts of the upper casbah
it is an ancient fortress with thick high surrounding walls which appear to vanish in contrast with the central building which dominates them
the whole structure is covered with limestone like the other houses of the casbah
only the bars on the windows and the big gate are black
the gate opens
a covered jeep enters the prison courtyard
in the stronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from paris
the sky is pale blue
in the prison courtyard the workers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine
it is possible to see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard
faces of prisoners appear between the bars of some windows
the workers have disappeared
only the delicate makeshift structure of the guillotine is visible its slender outline lengthened
in one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners
the cell is huge there are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling
a prisoner is standing on the urine bucket and looks outside through the barred window
on the ground there are some mats which serve as beds
about ten prisoners are in a group seated on the ground and they are speaking in whispers
two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the dirt others are speaking among themselves
one is reading a mickey mouse comic book and laughing to himself
but all of them in appearance and behavior are distinguished from those who make up the more numerous group
these solitary men are different in some way they are not ordinary delinquents
ali la pointe is alone withdrawn from the others seated on the ground his shoulders propped against the wall his knees raised
he is barefoot
on his left ankle directly above his foot are tattooed two words in print tais toi
his shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are other tattoos in a strange design
ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words absent mindedly
his expression is taciturn reserved and indifferent
ali turns to the prisoner at the window
look at them
ali jumps to his feet
everyone moves toward the two windows
ali moves away two yards at a quick pace then runs toward the window and grabbing hold of the bars heaves himself up to it
the condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows
he seems to smile although his face is motionless
in a soft voice he speaks to those faces which appear behind the bars tahia el djez air
long live algeria
the political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally keeping time to the steps of the condemned man
tahia el djez air
the condemned man walks toward the guillotine accompanied by guards and a priest reading the koran
there is also the executioner wearing a black hood
the executioner tries to appear indifferent
the priest recites his prayers
the entire ceremony seems improvised and hasty
the epilogue is reached quickly
the condemned man bends
the executioner places his neck in the right position adjusts it turns his head a bit then pushes his body forward
he releases the mechanism
the blade falls the head rolls
there is no longer a chorus
no one is chanting
alis eyes have remained motionless
then from above as the dismembered body is being carried away in a basket as the priest the guards and the officer are leaving as the workers dismantle the guillotine
from above from the balconies of the casbah suddenly the ju jus of the women are heard dense like the cries of birds shrill metallic angry
it is raining
the water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys
the white houses have turned spongy gray
the children of the casbah are playing and spattering mud
skinny and half naked children with bloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores
their mothers call them in vain
they continue to run play and wallow in the mud with a despairing gaiety
petit omar was then ten years old
he is slender dressed in long pants and a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems almost clownish
calm and absorbed he passes in the midst of the other children but doesnt notice them or their games
a small square on a sloping ascent
in the center a fountain
on the elevated side of the square on a corner there is a mosque
standing still at the foot of the steps is an algerian in white cloak and hood down to his eyes
other people pass by
the algerian is turned to one side so as not to be seen
petit omar walks toward him and nears his back
the algerian turns it is ali la pointe
he tells the boy with a tone of boredom and curtness go away
men have two faces one that laughs and one that cries
ali looks at him incredulously and asks and they sent you
the child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest
sure something wrong with that
omar takes out a piece of paper folded in four and hands it to ali
everythings written here
he turns away and begins to run
omar stops running and turns to ali
omar retraces his footsteps
ali goes to meet him
in a brusque manner can you read
ali hands back the paper
ali turns and looks around him
he squats on his heels in order to reach omars height
it is still drizzling
omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it
the following day at p
the street is fairly wide for a street in the arab quarter and at this hour it is crowded with people
there are algerians in traditional costumes and others in european clothes
noisy and tumultuous background
veiled women with intent glances
silent women who seem to float through the crowds untouchable
an arab cafe filled with customers at the tables and bar
through the large shop window a smoky steamy interior is visible
the cafe is located in rue random number
off there is an arab cafe at rue random
the owners name is medjebri
he is a police informer
medjebri is standing behind the cash register smiling very busy
he is wearing a traditional costume
he is very clearly visible through the shop window above the heads of the customers
in a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in front of a store
it is five oclock
a french policeman enters the cafe
off every day at p
a french policeman goes to see him
he stops for a few minutes to get information with the excuse of drinking a cup of tea
you have to kill the policeman
off not medjebri
medjebri moves away from the register still standing behind the bar to where the policeman is seated
he greets him and hands him a cup of tea
it says the policeman
the policeman is leaning on the bar
he is tall and husky and is wearing a scruffy uniform with a kepi pushed back somewhat
now his thick lips are sipping the scalding mint tea
the large clock and store signboard
standing in front there is a slender girl veiled her eyes darting in contrast with the rigid form of her motionless body
her arms are raised to form an arch her hands supporting the edges of a large basket balanced on her head
off at the corner right in front of the large clock there will be a girl carrying a basket
when the policeman comes out you will follow him together
at the right moment she will give you a pistol
you have only to shoot
quickly and in the back
now the policeman has finished drinking his tea
he makes a sign to pay
smiling medjebri refuses the money and says good bye
ali approaches the girl
they exchange glances
the girl puts down her basket which is filled with corn and rests it by her side
she moves slowly toward the cafe
ali walks beside her
the policeman is coming out of the cafe
he rudely bumps into those who are entering
he makes his way along the sidewalk and moves further away balancing his heavy body at every step
ali and the girl are about a yard away from him
they follow him pushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk
then the girl plunges her hand into the corn
in a second she places the revolver in alis right hand
he holds it under his cloak
the policemans back is a hands bredth away
but ali does not shoot
he moves forward to pass by the policeman
alarmed the girl looks at him and tries to hold him back
she shakes her head as if to speak
ali smiles at her
his eyes have a hard glint
he moves a few steps past the policeman
suddenly ali turns lifts his arm as if to push his way through and then stretches out his hand with the revolver aimed
the policeman stops his eyes are wide with fear
instinctively he lifts his arms and opens his palms
terror paralyzes him
ali glances about him
many people are moving away hastily but others stand still in a circle and watch fascinated
ali speaks to all of them in a loud voice
his eyes are alight
look at him
youre not giving any orders now
your hands are up eh
do you see him brothers
our masters arent very special are they
a sharp metallic click
ali tries a second time presses the trigger again
ali rolls the gun barrel it is empty
the policeman slowly lowers his hands
his right hand rushes to his holster
ali is ready to jump throws away the gun and starts to move forward
he knocks down the policeman who is overwhelmed and falls backward
the crowd moves away quickly
ali starts to throw himself on the frenchman lying on the ground but stops halfway
a thought restrains him
he turns and sees the girl who has picked up the revolver and hidden it again in her basket
then she moves away hurriedly
ali curses angrily then kicks the policemans head twice and runs after the girl
he reaches her grabs her shoulder so roughly that she shouts
in a whisper bastard
the girl struggles free from his grip
at the same time they hear behind them
the girl quickens her step
the girl arrives at a side street enters it and breaks into a run
ali is again beside her but unexpectedly the girl enters a front door
she bends places the basket on the ground removes the revolver and hides it in her breast beneath her shawl
she gets up again and leaves the basket
ali blocks her way
tell me what this joke is all about
the girl attempts to push past him toward the door
lets move now or theyll catch us
ali grabs her by the arm shakes her and shouts uncontrollably i want to know who sent me that letter
whats his name
hes waiting for you
were going there
if you dont get us arrested first
the girl nods toward the street where two policemen are passing by hastily
ali moves backward into the shadow of the doorway
he regains control of his nerves loosens his cloak and lets it fall on the basket
he is dressed in european clothes trousers and pullover
pushing her ahead move
ill follow you
the girl takes a look outside then goes out
ali follows her a few steps behind
by now it is dusk
it is a starry night and there are few lights visible in the windows of the casbah
in the background there is the triumphant neon of the european city the sea the ships at anchor the shining beams of a lighthouse
kader turns around gracefully and goes to sit on the wall of the terrace
you could have been a spy
we had to put you to the test
ali looks at him sullenly
with an unloaded pistol
kader is a few years older than ali but not so tall
he is slender with a slight yet sturdy bone structure
the shape of his face is triangular aristocratic his lips thin his eyes burning with hatred but at the same time cunning
he continues to speak in a calm tone which has an ironic touch to it
lets suppose you were a spy
in prison when the nlf contacts you you pretend to support the revolution and then the french help you to escape
by shooting at me
even that could be a trick
you escape then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you and so you are able to contact me
i dont even know your name yet
my name is kader ali
in other words in order to join the organization you had to undergo a test
i could have told you to murder the barman but hes an algerian
and the police would let you kill him even though he is one of theirs
by obeying such an order you still could have been a double agent
and thats why i told you to kill the french policeman because the french wouldnt have let you do it
if you were with the police you wouldnt have done it
ali has followed kaders logic a bit laboriously and he is fascinated by it
but not everything is clear yet
but i havent shot him
smiling you werent able to
but whats important is that you tried
whats important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing
the orders were to shoot him in the back
i dont do that kind of thing
then dont complain
you still havent told me why you didnt let me kill him
because we arent ready yet for the french
before attacking we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge
of course there is the casbah
but even the casbah isnt safe yet
there are too many drunks pushers whores addicts spies
people who talk too much
people who are ready to sell themselves undecided people
we must either convince them or eliminate them
we must think of ourselves first
we must clean out the casbah first
only then will we be able to deal with the french
do you understand ali
ali doesnt answer
kader has come down from the wall and looks toward the casbah
ali too looks toward the casbah immersed in the night
and how many are we
a warm spring wind large white clouds
at the western edge of the casbah from the upper to lower casbah the street of the algerian underworld descends to the brothel quarter
national liberation front bulletin number
brothers of the casbah
the colonial administration is responsible not only for our peoples great misery but also for the degrading vices of many of our brothers who have forgotten their own dignity
shady bars for gamblers and opium smokers shops filled with tourist trinkets merchants fences pimps children with adult faces ghastly old women and young girls whores standing in the doorways
of their houses
the girls having their faces uncovered have put scarves on their heads knotted at the nape
corruption and brutality have always been the most dangerous weapons of colonialism
the national liberation front calls all the people to struggle for their own physical and moral redemption indispensable conditions for the reconquest of independence
therefore beginning today the clandestine authority of the nlf prohibits the following activities gambling the sale and usage of all types of drugs the sale and usage of alcoholic beverages
prostitution and its solicitation
transgressors will be punished
habitual transgressors will be punished by death
it is dusk
in the european city the first lights are visible
people begin to crowd the bars for an aperitif
an algerian shoeshine man leaves his workbox at the entrance of the bar
he goes to the counter
he is tall and thin as a reed
he takes from his pocket a handful of change his hands tremble slightly as he counts it
the barman recognizes him fills a glass of wine and places it in front of him
the algerian pays and takes the glass
its probably not his first the trembling of his hands increases
the algerian drinks the wine in one gulp then goes to the door
he waits patiently while some europeans enter
he goes out picks up his workbox and moves away
the algerian is standing at the top of some steep almost vertical steps that lead from the european quarters to the casbah
now he is in rue marengo
there is still some daylight
the street is crowded
the algerian is unsteady on his legs
he stops and mutters something to himself
it is obvious that he is trying to hide his drunkenness
he begins to walk his hand against the wall for support
the workbox falls scattering brushes and cans of shoe polish on the ground
the algerian bends down and begins to pick up his tools
he is swearing
others have seen him
a peddler points him out to a child of about ten
it is petit omar who nods yes then whistles
another whistle answers him then another and another
there are other children at every corner of the street
they arrive in a run and gather together
omar points to the drunk who is now moving away and gives the order to attack
it is evident that this is not a game for them but a duty
there is a chorus of brief shouting of insults and whistles
the drunk sees them approaching
he is terrified
he tries to quicken his step
they reach him quickly and surround him
they attack him and then flee small yet elusive
they do not laugh even once their faces are hard and cruel
the drunk swings around holding his workbox by its strap
some children are hit some fall
the drunk avails himself of this chance to escape and retraces his steps to the staircase
he begins to descend toward the european quarters
but the children are again upon him
they are shouting more loudly now and pushing him
he quickens his step and staggering jumps the steps two by two
the children trip him and he falls
he is crying
he shields himself with his hands
the workbox has fallen and is rolling down the steps
the children are now on top of him like small beasts on a carrion
they smother him push him and pull him
they are no longer shouting
all of them are intent upon their efforts
only the drunk is shouting despairingly
they succeed in moving him and hurl him down the steps
he rolls downward trying in vain to grab something with his hands
outside the suns light is blinding
inside the small bar there is fresh air and shade
a young algerian with lifeless eyes and an idle expression is rolling an opium cigarette
he lights it
two slaps cause the cigarette to fall from his lips
ali la pointe is wearing a djellabah a type of cloak without buttoning which slips on over the head
there is an opening of about eight inches at the waist
ali has stretched his arm through the opening to slap the opium addict who recognizes ali smiles and makes a dazed grimace
ali la pointe
have you seen hacene le bonois
shaking his head not today
then he gets up laboriously bends down and looks for the cigarette that had fallen from his hand
he doesnt reach it
ali quickly crushes the cigarette with his foot
he is wearing a pair of sneakers
he moves away and leaves the bar
ali continues to scour the streets
from time to time without lingering he asks someone seen hacene le bonois
then adds tell him im looking for him
entrance to the brothel quarters
the street widens the alleys branch off and seem to broaden
there are one or two europeans not only tourists in search of adventure but also elements of the international criminal underworld who mingle here with the algerians
almost all the buildings house a brothel or other place of ill repute
on some doorways signs are hanging which read ali has entered a brothel
it is morning and there are few clients
the whores are algerian and european
some of them are pretty
the madam is an algerian dressed in european clothes
she is about forty heavily made up
when she spots ali she interrupts her usual professional chant
she seems curious yet glad
shouting ali la pointe
she stops herself already sorry for having spoken so quickly and imprudently
ali doesnt answer her but approaches with a steady and serious glance
changing tone havent seen you around for some time
i thought you were still in prison
ali leans against the counter never once taking his eyes off her
is hacene le bonois here
he left early this morning
you know how it is with the boss
i want to see him
if he shows up tell him that im around
ali moves away from the counter and turns
he leaves without a word
the woman tries to understand what has happened and follows him with a worried glance
ali my son
where have you been hiding
ali turns suddenly then pulls back so that his back is against the wall of the alley
in sharp voice dont move
then he glances at the others
the others are three young algerians hacenes bodyguards
hacene le bonois is tall with short legs out of proportion with his enormous chest
he is somewhat corpulent
he has a wide face a cheerful and self confident expression
his clothing is a strange combination of algerian and european which does not however appear ridiculous but imposing
at alis remark his expression changes becomes amazed and baffled
but at the same time his eyes give away the brains attempt to find an explanation and a solution
astonished you know i never carry weapons
ali keeps his arms and hands hidden under his djellabah
hacene laughs warmly and stretches out his hands which are enormous thick and rough
you afraid of these
dont move hacene
why are you afraid
weve always been friends
one might even say that i brought you up
isnt it true ali
whats happened to you
the nlf has condemned you to death
hacene is stunned
he speaks aloud his thoughts in a soft voice
ah so its come to this
then he bursts into loud laughter and seems to turn to the three guards at his back
im dying of laughter
ali doesnt speak
he continues to stare at hacene
hacene suddenly stops laughing
his tone of voice changes becomes brusque and hurried
how much are they paying you
theyre not paying me anything
theyve already warned you twice this is the last warning
what must i decide
youve got to change occupations hacene
hacene makes a gesture as if to emphasize what he is going to say
with irony okay you convince me
then suddenly unexpectedly he lets out a shrill scream like fencers who before plunging their swords try to frighten their adversaries
simultaneously he hurls himself forward head lowered and arms outstretched
ali steps aside and releases a blast of machine gun fire
hacene falls flat on his face
there is movement
some passersby approach
the three boys try to escape
the barrel of the machine gun is visible through the opening in his djellabah
alis voice is quivering angrily look at him well
now nobody can do whatever he wants in the casbah
not even hacene
least of all you three pieces of shit
go away now
go away and spread the word
there is a garland of flowers strung across an alley
a front door is open and the guests continue to arrive
in the inner courtyard there are benches and chairs arranged in rows
in front of all of them there are two chairs separated from the rest one next to the other
in front of them there is a small table with a pen and inkstand on top
the people remain standing about twenty algerians of all ages
they are speaking among themselves in thick whispers
there is an expectant and ceremonious atmosphere
mahmoud was seventeen then
he has soft down on his cheeks his first beard
he is thin his neck long and tense his glance nervous
he appears to be the protagonist of what is about to take place
his hair is combed with care and covered with much hair cream
he is wearing a clean and newly bought white costume
many of the others come to speak with him the younger ones are joking and trying to provoke him
mahmoud reacts comically with a grim frown with which he tries in vain to hide his shyness
at the same time he glances secretly anxiously up to the empty balcony on the first floor
much gay and lively chattering can be heard from an open door above
in the room a group of girls are busy preparing trays with cups of coffee
they are little more than children twelve or thirteen years old with soft complexions white teeth and shining eyes
they seem children who are playing but beneath that veneer of gaiety some anxiety is noticeable emotions in suspense
the faltering voice of an old woman calls from the adjoining room
a girl leaves the group lifts the dividing curtain and nearing the bed where the old woman is lying she kneels beside her
the old woman lifts her hand and places it on the girls hair caressing her tenderly
she speaks in a wavering voice and her small yet kind eyes fill with tears
the girl nods yes then she gets up and goes to rejoin her companions
passing before a mirror she stops a minute to tidy her hair
they appear on the balcony then descend to the courtyard
the nervous glance of mahmoud scans their faces then rests upon that girl who with lowered eyelids also glances quickly at him
meanwhile the trays are being passed among the guests
now the people turn to face the front door
a young man has entered carrying a briefcase under his arm
behind him are two boys who seem to be his bodyguards and are the only ones dressed in european clothes
both of them have their right hands under their jackets which are old and torn
they seem to be armed
they close the door and remain standing on either side of it
the man with the briefcase walks toward the table
all present look at him respectfully
he smiles responds to their greetings shakes hands with all
but he refuses coffee and seems to be in a hurry
he sits down places his briefcase on the table opens it and takes out a large notebook
from the open briefcase the metallic butt of a sub machine gun appears
on the cover of the notebook is written nlf algerian autonomous he turns the pages of the notebook until he reaches the last written page
then he glances up toward the people who in the meantime have taken their seats
he smiles says a few words then calls two names
mahmoud walks forward stiffly erect his eyes staring straight ahead of him
the girl also walks forward with a perplexed expression
they sit down next to each other but without looking at each other
the ceremony consists of a few words
finally the two youths look at each other
mahmoud tries to smile but he cannot
the girls expression softens somewhat
her glance is tender she lowers her face quickly
meanwhile the others recite the verses of the koran in low voices
there is a french guard no more than thirty years old
he has a blond mustache his beard recently shaved
there are few people in the street
the guard walks slowly glancing in the shop windows from time to time to admire his reflection
he stops adjusts his cap and smiles
an algerian appears beside him he is also young
the guard pretends to be interested in the photographic equipment which is on display then moves on
the algerians arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place
he plunges the knife into the guards neck
the guard opens his mouth wide to shout but he cannot
the blood gurgles in his gashed throat
none of the few passersby has seen what happened
the guard falls flat on his face
someone sees him and screams
the algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier opens his holster takes his pistol then gets up pulling the gun with him
the gun is fastened by a leather cord
the cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of the guard
the algerian pulls in vain
he looks about him with terrified eyes
people approach hurriedly
they are shouting
the algerian pulls the cord a second time desperately
he regains his control picks up the knife which is lying on the ground and cuts the leather cord thus freeing the pistol
the others have almost reached him and he is surrounded but he manages to dodge them and escapes
a group of zouaves on patrol three soldiers and an officer
the street is sloping on the right there is a high fence covered with advertising signs and cinematographic posters all of them torn and full of holes the emptiness on
the other side is visible through the holes
the soldiers are chatting among themselves and looking at the posters
a soldier stops because he sees something moving on the other side of the fence
he points to it and shouts but not in time
the soldier falls the others remain motionless unbelieving
they begin to run and scatter and look for cover
an algerian appears on top of the fence
he moves like a cat and jumps from the other side
his invisible companions continue to shoot
he is unarmed and runs to the dead soldier
he grabs the machine gun and retraces his steps
the action takes place in a second
by now the soldiers too are shooting but it is too late
a police station in the casbah a small prefabricated one story building
at the main door there is a police guard
a group of five algerians is approaching
they are talking among themselves and gesticulating
the policeman enjoys watching them then asks what its about
all five of them answer him at once trying to outdo one another
the policeman has to shout to make them keep quiet
then assuming a very humble behavior they enter silently
the oldest among them speaks in a mournful voice
he seems to be crying and asks the sergeant something
the policeman calls a colleague and tells him to accompany the algerians
four of them go with the policeman while another remains in the waiting room saying that it is better because he is afraid of losing his control
then he begins to explain the reasons for the quarrel it concerns a will
the old man is his grandfather but he has recently remarried
then from inside is heard
the policeman reacts quickly and tries to draw his gun
but the algerian is faster and fires point blank
the four reappear
one of them is wounded
all of them are armed with revolvers and carry at their sides a machine gun and two sub machine guns that they have taken from the armory
other cries and shots are heard behind them
all five of them run out in haste
another police station
two policemen are chatting in front of the entrance
a black renault is passing by at a walking speed then slows down almost to the point of halting completely
the right door opens and there is a burst of machine gun fire
one of the policemen has been hit and grabs the other so as not to fall
another burst of
the two policemen fall down together
the car motor is accelerated the tires screech and the renault shoots forward
a military jeep arrives from the opposite direction crashes into the car and blocks its escape
an algerian flees and is pursued
another descends from the auto with his hands raised
the soldiers shoot and kill him
a large garage with workshop and filling station
in front are some automobiles and a military truck
a scooter with two algerian boys passes by rumbling noisily along the road
then at full speed it makes a sharp turn retraces its steps and turns again
the boys seem to be showing off for fun
meanwhile the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it is lunchtime
the attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone
the scooter stops in front of the high test gasoline pump
the attendant is a european an elderly man who approaches them holding in one hand some bread he has just unwrapped
he detaches the pump handle of high test and asks how many gallons
one of the algerians points a revolver at the attendant and tells him to pour out the gasoline on the ground all around
the other meanwhile goes to the other two gasoline pumps detaches the handles and fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of gasoline
he uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to clamp the handles open
he stretches the pump hoses as far as they can go toward the garage and the parked cars
the gasoline flows all over the large square
the two youths are again on the scooter they tell the european to move away
they have soaked a rag in gasoline and they light it
the gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps
the european is by now far away the scooter is already moving away and at the same time the boys hurl the lit rag into the square
it immediately bursts into flames
the night of the same day in an office of the police commissioners headquarters
on the desk photos of the days terroristic attempts are piled in a heap
an employee is in front of his typewriter
the assistant commissioner is about forty years old very robust
his face is somewhat wide ordinary and with heavy features
he leafs through the photos while speaking on the telephone
it is a very warm night and the window of the office is open
from outside is heard the sound of traffic
on telephone yes sir but they havent received a search warrant yet
we followed them for a while but then we lost track
yes sir but it is in another precinct
no it wasnt in theirs

he is requesting a formal investigation first
yes sir yes
yes sir yes but we havent enough men
of course i understand

he slams the receiver angrily and begins to dictate his report
his voice is harsh filled with rancor

wait a minute
the officer stops speaking takes a glass from his desk and goes near the window
on the ledge there is a bottle of beer left there evidently to keep it a bit cool
he takes it fills his glass and drinks
then he speaks in a lowered voice while looking outside without even giving any directions to the employee who waits with his hands poised about the keyboard of his typewriter
i want to see the newspapers tomorrow
if theyre still talking about pacification of our moslem brothers
he returns to his desk
where were we
intersection between consular street and general laquiere avenue
in front of police stations ain zeboudja
and all the others
in the casbah
in the european quarters
sandbag entrenchments are being prepared barbed wire is being stretched metallic lookout turrets are being set up
it is very hot
workers and policemen work in silence
there is an oppressive atmosphere
ordinance of the prefecture of algiers all police stations in algiers without exception and until further notice are required to prepare and maintain external protection devices
the shifting of guards outside must continue uninterrupted twenty four hours a day
sentinels must be equipped with automatic weapons
view of pharmacies in the european quarters and in the casbah
the shelves medicines people who are buying
the mustapha hospital reserved for algerians
the wards hospitalized algerians
the governor general of algiers decrees article no
the sale of medicinal and pharmaceutical products effective for the cures of gunshot wounds can be made only to those who present written authorization from the commissioner of police
directors of all hospitals and clinics must produce to the police authorities an immediate listing of all patients admitted to their institutions for the care and treatment of gunshot wounds
the casbah is being closed off
every point of entrance every alley every street that joins the casbah and the european quarters has been blocked off with wooden horses and with barbed wire nine feet high
there are also workers policemen and soldiers who are working at the barricades
beyond them on the other side of the barbed wire the algerians seem to be encaged
the prefecture of algiers states in the course of these last few days dozens of assaults have been committed in this city
we have reason to believe that the assailants originate in the casbah and that they have always found a speedy and easy refuge in the alleys of the arab quarters
as a result and in order to alleviate without delay the insecurity that now reigns in the city the prefecture of algiers has decided that entrance to the casbah can
only he permitted at those points in the blockade under military control where citizens in transit must exhibit their documents at request and submit to eventual searches
the casbah is imprisoned like a huge concentration camp
only five streets have been left open the widest streets
there are five exits where the wooden horses serve to restrict passage and where some wooden posts for the guards are being built
every exit is marked by a sign with large lettering
at each blockade there are two ramps an entrance and an exit to the casbah
the algerians and some europeans crowd around in both directions
the soldiers are wearing fatigues with helmets and machine guns
the europeans are not requested to show identity papers
the algerians are often frisked and accept this fact silently patiently without any sign of intolerance
but if the soldiers attempt to search a woman then it is different
a woman begins to shout while waving her arms wildly and pushes away the soldier who had tried to search her
a stream of incoherent words
other algerians intervene they push forward threateningly
the soldier is young he is timid and frightened
he looks over his back for help
a police officer approaches
he has a different tone and a very self assured manner
he shouts at the algerians to calm down
are you mad touching one of their women
go on go on alright
go ahead keep moving
the woman passes the blockade but still continues her protest with a shrill and unbearable voice
an algerian woman walks along the sidewalk
she is elderly fat and is wearing a traditional costume with her face veiled
she walks slowly toward a bar which has its tables outside and already some customers
near the bar leaning against a wall there is an algerian who now begins to move and goes to meet the old woman
they greet one another with much warmth like a mother and son who havent seen each other for a long time
they embrace and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her veil
he finds a revolver which is hung by a cord and grabs it
they are at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar
at a table there is a french soldier having coffee with cream croissant and an open newspaper
the algerian continues to embrace the old woman and aims from above her shoulders
only one shot the newspaper rips the soldier tries to get up again his face full of blood
then he collapses on the table
the algerian has hidden the revolver in the womans veil
the two separate from their embrace
they seem terrified and surprised and move away from each other in different directions while the people are rushing about and shouting
the cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent
an algerian is squatting on his heels in front of his wares scattered on the ground clusters of aromatic herbs jars of spices
a youth is in front of him and from time to time he looks around him
he seems to be waiting
now he bends down and begins to rummage through the herbs
he selects a bunch of mint weighs it in his hand and argues the price with the peddler
a policeman in the market passes nearby and watches
the youth waits a second then turns toward the back of the policeman and stretches out his arm
he has in his hand the bunch of mint a revolver is hidden among the greens
he shoots twice
the french policeman falls down
the youth drops the mint with the revolver among the other herbs and moves away in the midst of the crowd
in front of the police station there are sandbags and a police guard at duty with helmet and machine gun
the policeman jumps to attention and salutes
an officer has come out of the station and returns his salute
he moves away and walks along the sidewalk
there are few people
an algerian seems to appear from nowhere and walks behind him
he is very young is wearing a short sleeved shirt and blue jeans
the officer turns at the first corner
further on there is a row of cars and a metallic sign which warns that the parking space is reserved for police vehicles only
the officer hears the steps of the boy behind him and summons him in a brusque manner
what are you doing here
where are you going
the boy shrugs his thin shoulders and lowers his head
in servile tone im going for a swim my friends are waiting for me
the officer curses under his breath and proceeds
he stops in front of a dyna panhard parked not too far away
the boy moves on a few yards past the automobile until he reaches a metallic wastebasket which is fastened to the pole of a street lamp
he stops there then glances around
the officer is not far behind him he has taken his car keys from his pocket and is about to open the car door
the boy plunges his hand into the basket rummages among the torn papers then suddenly turns points a revolver at the officers back and shoots
the man tries to clutch something but slips and falls down
the boy shoots again at the man on the ground then plunges his hand again into the wastebasket drops the revolver and glances around him
he breaks into a run
the policemen come out of the police station hurriedly
they turn the corner
some rush to the man lying on the ground
others jump into a jeep
four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in the rack
they move off in two directions
at the same time wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the distance
the street is deserted
there is no trace of the boy
people are seen at their windows
the officer is lifted by his arms
an ambulance arrives and stops its siren at full blast its doors wide open
the officer is placed inside
the motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets
the jeep converges on them then reverses its direction moving while balanced on two wheels
passersby stop to watch all of them europeans
the sirens wail is at a high pitch
a deserted street recently covered with wet asphalt
a moslem road worker is sitting on the ground next to a steamroller
he is eating his lunch
the combined sounds of the sirens wail and the rumbling of the motorcycles are heard approaching
two motorcyclists appear in the street passing by the road worker
one of them stops and turns around
the road worker moves backward to the street corner
he breaks into a run
his eyes are burning with fear his face is anxious undecided
from the windows the people point to him and shout after him
a jeep appears in the street in front of him
the motorcyclist approaches from the opposite direction
the algerian stops running he doesnt know what to do
from the windows continuous shouting
the algerian leans against the wall watches the scene and begins to cry
the policemen jump down from the jeep and leap at him
the algerian isnt able to speak but only shakes his head
a room inside the police station
the algerians face is beaten from right and left by a series of slaps
the room is filled with policemen
all of them are practically on top of the algerian all of them are shouting
in the confusion can be heard shouts
do you know hes dead you bastard
do you know you killed him
they try to reach him pushing against one another in order to get closer and hit him
the algerian is crying and speaks in broken off phrases half arabic and half french
his continual efforts to repeat certain words are heard no no no no
an officer arrives making his way
get out go on outside
get out of the way
they make way for him he reaches the algerian who tries to smile at him continually shaking his head sir
whats your name
the algerians mouth is dry he tries to swallow
whats your name
straining still trying to swallow lardjane boualem sir
in the commissioners office the assistant commissioner dictates guilty lardjane boualem manual worker married with three children
resident in rue de thebes number eight

the employee removes the copies from the typewriter and begins to put them in order
seven assaults three dead
then he moves to the desk and hands over the various copies for signature
here one for the commissioner
the press offices
and one for you sir
the assistant commissioner signs
good thank you corbiere

the employee salutes then moves toward the door
he is about to go out when the assistant commissioner stops him
where is this rue de thebes
rue de thebes
in the upper casbah i think
see you tomorrow corbiere
good evening sir
the employee leaves and closes the door
the assistant commissioner crosses the room to the large map of algiers which covers the entire wall
he moves his finger along the casbah zone as he moves it he follows it with his glance in that tangle of streets
to himself rue de thebes
he has found it
he observes it for a minute then moves his finger along the road leading to the european quarters
he finds the right route then concentrates in order to memorize it
he returns to the desk lifts the receiver and dials a number
on the phone hello engineer henry amaud please
hes already left
alright yes yes alright
i have the number
he clicks the receiver then dials another number
at the other end of the line a feminine voice is heard
the assistant commissioner abandons his usual peremptory tone
yes right away
im going to change my clothes first and ill be right there
my wife is already there right
no its not important
but call henry for me
just for a minute
he places the receiver on the desk then puts on his jacket which is on the back of his chair
he straightens his tie
now from the receiver a muffled voice is heard the assistant commissioner picks up the receiver
what are we going to tell our wives
good idea yes
ill be there right away
just give me time to change my clothes
ah ive found the address
no its better to talk in person
yes its the right place
he puts down the receiver then goes to the coat hanger and takes his beret
he goes out after glancing again at the photos of the days assaults
two small children are kneeling in front of their beds
notre pere dans le ciel
two children five or six years old blond charming but not affected
they seem to be twins and are wearing identical pajamas
at the same time a servant is preparing their beds for the night
she is about fifty years old her apron clean and ironed she has gray hair her face that of a good woman
she is algerian
when the children falter in their prayers she helps them
when they have finished she says with an algerian accent now lets go to say good night
in the dining room there is a large open window
the beach the sea and the sound of the surf are outside not too distant
it is a starry night
at a table there are four men and four women all of them well dressed and tanned
it is the home of henry and bernadette arnaud
the assistant commissioner is in plain clothes
he and his wife seem ill at ease somewhat out of place
the maid and children have entered the room
come here children
the others smile
the servant accompanies the children to their parents
good night daddy
good night mommy
good night dear
at the same time the women make the usual delighted exclamations
one of the men attracts the assistant commissioners attention points to his watch and makes a sign
the assistant commissioner nods his head affirmatively
a ds citroen is crossing the city at high speed
the four men are inside
arnaud is at the wheel
the assistant commissioner is sitting in the back seat
the automobile arrives at place du gouvernement takes a turn around the square then turns toward the blockade and slows down
one of the soldiers moves to the center of the ramp and raises the phosphorescent flag
the car lowers its headlights and stops
the soldier goes to the drivers window
in his right hand he is holding a machine gun which hangs from his shoulders
he greets them
he bends to window level good evening
arnaud responds in an innocent cheerful tone good evening
can we pass
its too late
no one is allowed to enter the casbah at this hour
but its not even midnight yet
its ten minutes past midnight
curfew begins at midnight
please we just want to take a short ride
a friend of mine has never seen the casbah
tonight is out of the question
the assistant commissioner intervenes with the self assured and somewhat arrogant tone common to all policemen
he stretches his arm toward the window and hands the soldier a card
its alright theyre with me
the soldier examines the card by the glare of the headlights hands it back and bringing his hand to his visor he salutes
the assistant commissioner salutes with his hand
lets go henry
he changes gears thank you
the soldier steps aside and salutes again
the automobile begins to move steadily increasing its speed
the streets of the casbah are deserted almost completely blackened
some cats are frightened by the headlights and run close to the walls
inside the car the four men are silent
they keep their eyes fixed straight ahead of them their faces concentrating taut
yes its the first intersection
or the second
the automobile slows down at the first intersection
arnaud leans out the window and looks
there is an enamel nameplate rue de thebes
right or left
try going to the right
the car turns right moving slowly
on one side of the street the even numbers are getting higher
what number is it
the man next to the assistant commissioner says lets park here
it doesnt matter
in sharp tone it does matter
go back henry
lets go to number eight
arnaud puts the gears in reverse the car moves back quickly and passes the intersection
arnaud puts it in neutral
with the motor still running he presses the cigarette lighter on the dashboard
the assistant commissioner takes a large package that he is holding under his legs on the car floor
it is wrapped in pieces of newspaper
he lifts it forward
the man who is next to arnaud takes it leans it against the back of his seat touches it until he finds the right spot unwraps it from that part
and straightens a small plastic tube which appears at the opening
it is a fuse
how long do you want the timing device
give me a match
arnaud takes the cigarette lighter from the dashboard
the other man has opened the car door
he takes the lighter and touches it to the fuse which ignites immediately
the door of number eight is very near almost directly opposite the car door
the man places the package in a shady area and returns to the car in a run
arnaud has already changed gears releases the clutch and the automobile shoots forward
the explosion is very violent
the fronts of buildings number eight ten and twelve explode and collapse
the echo of the explosion has ended
there is a long pause only some isolated noises resound
they are stressed recognizable a burning beam the thud of falling debris broken glass
then suddenly and almost simultaneously with the other sounds after the shock the human voices the shouts and weeping are heard
the dawns light is clear and white
it dispels every shadow and designs precisely every outline
here and there in the middle of the sky there are numerous clouds of dust strangely motionless
in the light the human figures seem black
seen from a distance they seem to be ants upon heaps of debris
there are women motionless weeping softly their voices similar to prayer
from time to time there is a sudden scream a despairing sob someone running
another corpse is pulled out from the rubble bodies mutilated or still intact they are all dead
the people continue to rummage through the debris and to wait around pitifully
but there is no pity in the other streets and alleys of the casbah or at the top of the steps
there is anger and hatred
the people are running and shouting
they are shouting from their windows and balconies they smother every other sound
the excitement increases
they run where there is more shouting more people
they dont know what to do yet but want to be together
until there is a voice stronger and clearer than the others which gives them a goal and direction
ali la pointe points below beyond the slopes of the alleys and stairways
there below are the european quarters which widen near the sea
the crowd is shouting pushing rushing forward with him like a raging stream tumultuous and unrestrainable
ali is together with his men five boys one of them older than twenty
all of them are armed
the crowd forces them to quicken their step to a run
petit omar is furthest in the rear
he is wearing a pair of short pants his chest bare he is barefoot
he calls ali with all his might but in vain
he tries to join ali to make his way through the legs of the others he runs clinging to the others pushes passes near the walls then turning into a
side street he rushes into an alleyway and finally arrives in front
he runs to ali almost out of breath
shouting kader says to stop them
he says weve got to stop them
ali slows down as much as he can with the crowd pushing him from behind
with the others
they are trying to stop the people
their voices can hardly be heard or understood amid the loud noises
but he says that if we go on like this were playing their game and theyll murder everyone
ali continues to run
his face is sullen frowning as always when he must choose between instinct and reason
omar calls him again
his voice is hysterical repeating again to stop
he is hanging on one of alis arms
ali jerks himself free violently he strikes the child
omar sways and falls against the wall
with this movement ali seems to release his anger at not being able to carry out his actions
he slows down speaks to his men a few words in arabic his voice cold and bitter
ali extends his arm and the others imitate him
each man grabs another by the arm forming a chain
they check the flow behind them and hold back the crowd that is pressing forward
djamila the girl who in january in rue random gave the revolver to ali la pointe is now standing in front of a large mirror
she removes the veil from her face
her glance is hard and intense her face is expressionless
the mirror reflects a large part of the room it is a bedroom
there are three other girls
there is zohra who is about the same age as djamila
she undresses removing her traditional costume and is wearing a slip
there is hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin
she dips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond
every action is performed precisely and carefully
they are like three actresses preparing for the stage
but there is no gaiety no one is speaking
only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their transformation
djamilas lightweight european dress of printed silk
zohras blouse and short skirt to her knees
make up lipstick high heeled shoes silk stockings
hassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it
a pair of blue jeans a striped clinging tee shirt
her blond hair is now dry
she ties it behind in a ponytail
hassiba has a young slim figure
she seems to be a young european girl who is preparing to go to the beach
djamila and zohra have finished their preparations and sit down to wait
hassiba is still barefoot
she is putting on her sandals when someone knocks at the door
djamila gets up and goes to open it
it is kader
a quick attentive glance djamila
hassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish expression she says stressing her french ca va monsieur
kader smiles for a second without any gaiety but to please her
then he speaks briefly and harshly in arabic
and turning one at a time to each of the three he gives them three addresses
to djamila number three rue de chene
to zohra number fourteen rue monseigneur leynaud
to hassiba number twenty one rue de lhydre
each one of the girls repeats in turn the address which he has given her
each one of the three responds emotionally
the atmosphere is tense
kader bids them farewell according to the algerian custom first bringing his right hand over his heart
then he embraces them
they look at him for a moment they are embarrassed
kader tries to ease their discomfort smiles and answers hassibas previous remark
et bonnes chances
at number twenty one rue de lhydre there is a bread store
hassiba has again covered her face with a veil and is also wearing a white cloak which covers her whole body
she enters the store
there are other women who are buying bread
hassiba waits for them to leave then says in arabic to the shopkeeper ive come to take the package
the shopkeeper empties half a basket of bread at the bottom there is a beach bag with a shoulder strap and he gives it to hassiba
hassiba hides it under her cloak bends her head in a sign of farewell and leaves
at number fourteen rue monseigneur leynaud there is a tailor shop and clothing store
zohra is also wearing the veil and white cloak
ive come to take the package
the tailor accompanies her to the back of the shop where there is a workroom and young girls who are sewing
he rummages in a closet takes out an air france utility bag and gives it to zohra who hides it under her cloak greets him and leaves
inside number three rue du chene an algerian craftsman is working in filigree
djamila takes a small leather cosmetic case
djamila hides it greets the man and leaves
at an intersection of rue marengo an alley hassiba enters a large door and shuts it
in a second she has removed her veil and cloak
her face is made up she is wearing pants and a jersey top
she places the strap of her bag on her shoulder
inside the bag a towel and bathing suit are visible
hassiba goes out the door proceeds down the alley until she reaches rue marengo
she approaches the blockade
it is saturday evening there is a hurried bustle of algerians and europeans
soldiers and policemen are very busy with their usual requests for documents
hassibas arrival is quickly noticed for she is very pretty and attracts much attention
some soldiers whistle
an elderly algerian woman looks at her with dislike
hassiba is indifferent and waits her turn
a french soldier approaches her
id like to search you miss
for an instant hassiba is dismayed then she glances down at her clinging shirt and pants
the boy is young handsome and cheeky
theres too many people
but you dont understand
i was saying that theres nothing to search
thats what you think
some europeans laugh the algerians seem not to see or hear but it is evident that they are scornful
are you going for a swim miss
all by yourself
no with some friends
at the same time she passes the blockade
next sunday im free
shall we go together
hassiba shrugs her shoulders smiles again and moves away
at the rue du divan blockade zohra too is dressed like a european and seems to be calm
there are not too many people
a soldier makes a sign for her to pass in a hurried manner and the girl passes
djamila is tense pale her features are strained
her eyes seem even larger with make up
now at the blockade at rue de la lyre the casbah exit is blocked
an algerian has been discovered without documents
he argues shouts and says that he wants to go back
the soldiers try to catch him he struggles to get free
meanwhile the people push forward in protest
two soldiers catch the algerian and drag him bodily into the guard posts
the flow of people continues
djamila steps forward holding the cosmetic case with both of her hands
she doesnt know how to carry it and from time to time she changes her position
she realizes that she looks awkward
its now her turn
the soldiers tone is arrogant
the previous scene has made them nervous
an officer signals her to pass then points to the cosmetic case
instinctively djamila lifts the case and looks at it she feels herself failing but makes an effort to answer
djamila uses all her strength to smile and she succeeds
her eyes light up defiantly
the officer signals her to pass
a large warehouse in the fish market
there are enormous iceboxes with cartons of frozen fish and tubs with running water and live fish
the three girls are next to one another
the three bags are on top of the counter a few steps away
with them is a thin algerian about twenty five years old
he has thick black hair straight and combed neatly
he is wearing glasses
with his rough and nervous hands he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from hassibas bag then delicately and carefully a square wooden box
he opens it and turning to the girl signals her to move away a bit
the girl steps back
in the box there is a huge iron tube sealed at both ends by two clock dials
inside the tube two batteries with wires are attached to the dials
the youth glances at his wristwatch then adjusts the hands of the dials to six forty five
he puts the bomb back into the box closes it and places it in the bag
he replaces the towel and bathing suit then hands the bag to hassiba
he is smiling slightly
hassiba takes the bag and goes away
the box fits perfectly into djamilas cosmetic case
the youth opens it without removing it from the case adjusts the two dials to six fifty puts everything back in its place and hands the case to djamila
he smiles at her and she moves away
in the air france bag there are newspapers and magazines on top and the same box
the youth adjusts the bomb to six fifty five arranges it again inside the bag closes the zipper and hands the bag to zohra
he smiles at her
his smile is more genuine less mechanical
there is less tension than before
the youth smiles at the girl and says in arabic may allah protect you
zohra thanks him in a whisper bends her head and moves away
the youth takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket places it between his lips and lights it
his hand is trembling a little
cafeteria rue michelet
the club is very crowded
there are two rooms one at the entrance with an american style bar and one at the back with tables
it is saturday and at this hour many european families go out to have an ice cream
there is not too much confusion or uproar
the people are calm they take their places at the bar and small tables and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly
hassiba enters glances at the large clock above the cash register
it is half past six
she goes to the register and waits her turn
the different orders mingle she orders a coca cola
they give her the check
she goes to the bar all the seats are taken
she gives her order and the ticket to the waiter
a man moves aside looks at her then steps down from his stool and offers it to her
hassiba tells him that it doesnt matter but the man insists
hassiba thanks him and sits down
the man is about fifty well groomed
he smiles again and turns to chat with some friends
hassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat then removes the bag from her shoulder
holding it by the strap she places it on the floor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean ones feet
the waiter has brought her the drink
hassiba drinks slowly from time to time glancing at the clock
she finishes drinking
the bag is in a vertical position
moving her feet slowly and carefully hassiba lets the bag slip on its side
she gets down from the seat and points it out to the man who is standing next to her
im giving your seat back
are you already leaving miss
hassiba smiles nods yes
the man sits down
milk bar rue disly at the corner of place bugeand
the jukebox is playing full blast
it is a bar for young people
there is much bustle and confusion much laughter
the girls are making plans for sunday
djamila enters and moves to the jukebox which is in the corner near the door
there are playbills for various theater performances hanging on the wall
djamila stops to look at them and reads the bottom lines
she places the cosmetic case on the floor
rising again she looks around her and pushes the case behind the jukebox with her foot
maison blanche immeuble mauretania
the entire ground floor is filled with ticket counters and a waiting room for the airlines
there are some employees stewardesses and some travelers
zohra passes through the large glass door at the entrance goes to the air france counter takes a time schedule then goes to sit down on a sofa which runs
along the opposite wall
she sits down and places the airline bag on the ground in front of her and begins to leaf through the timetable from time to time glancing around
using her heels she pushes the bag under the sofa
she looks at the large electric clock which is hanging in the center of the room it is forty minutes past six
it is six forty four by the cafeteria clock
the second hand is moving
there are more or less the same people
the old man is still seated on the barstool and continues to chat
hassibas bag is still at his feet the second hand is racing
a five year old child hands a coin to the waiter ice cream
the father and mother are watching him delighted
the waiter smiles at the child and points to the cash register
he speaks to the child in the usual tone of a grownup when speaking to children you have to go there first
and then come back to me
the second hand reaches twenty five then thirty
the child goes to the cashier and pays
the cashier smiles at him and gives him the check
what a good boy
the child returns to the counter
the waiter has already prepared the ice cream for him and hands it to him
the child is standing on tiptoes
the second hand the explosion bodies flung into the air arms legs white smoke screams
bodies thrown outside the doors unhinged the windows broken empty
the people watch from their windows the passersby move closer they bend down to look at those who are writhing on the ground
astonished and incredulous faces
no one speaks
only screams and weeping
sirens which are drawing nearer
firemen and police arriving
the ambulance sirens on rue disly one car after another
at the milk bar the people go to the doors to look at the ambulances which are racing toward place bugeand
the sirens fade in the distance and move away
the jukebox is again loud brigitte bardot bardot
the people re enter the bar chattering to have their aperitifs
it is six fifty the explosion
the jukebox is flung into the middle of the street
there is blood strips of flesh material the same scene as at the cafeteria the white smoke and shouts weeping hysterical girls screams
one of them no longer has an arm and runs around howling despairingly it is impossible to control her
the sound of sirens is heard again
the crowd of people the firemen police ambulances all rush to the scene from place bugeand
the ambulances arrive at rue michelet
they are already loaded with dead and wounded
the relatives of the wounded are forced to get out
the father of the child who was buying ice cream seems to be in a daze he doesnt understand
they pull him down by force
the child remains there his blond head a clot of blood
the policemen try to bring order to the chaos are forced to shout push threaten
the wounded swarm around the ambulances
a commissioner sends off the first one
what time is it
a quarter to seven
the commissioner goes to the second ambulance pulls down a man who is trying to enter by force slams the door and shouts to the driver
his face is pale and drawn the veins of his neck are swollen
go away for gods sake
the auto leaves and now the third explosion resounds in the distance
it is heard clearly and violently from the mauretania section
the commissioner stops midway in his last gesture and likewise all the others who are paralyzed with fright incapable of taking action again of accepting such reality for a third
in place bugeand there also the people are motionless
all of them are looking in the same direction
their faces are alike in their terror alike in their sense of impotence alike in their deep sadness
the sun appears then hides behind black clouds
there is a cool wind
it is ten in the morning and the european city has its usual rapid and efficient rhythm of every day at this hour only there is terror written on the
face of every person
that same terror has remained and suspicion and despairing impotence
patrols of soldiers and policemen move around the city search algerians and some europeans stop automobiles trucks buses and trams that they block at both doors
at the entrance to every shop the owner searches every customer before letting him enter
he does so politely with a drawn smile and methodically rummages through every handbag every package
so too in the bars in the offices in workshops
and now that it is already late afternoon also outside the brothels the cinemas the theaters
a young algerian boy thirteen or fourteen years old wearing sandals without socks trousers that reach to his ankles walks quickly carrying a cardboard box tied with a cord
it is dusk
a european woman sees him pass in front of her looks at him and follows him with her glance
on the sidewalk there are some youths
the woman points to the algerian boy says something
the traffic is heavy
her words are unclear
one youth calls to the boy who is by now thirty feet away hey little rat
the boy turns around for a second his face frightened and quickens his step
the youths follow behind him and the boy begins to run
the youths too begin to run and others join them people who are passing
they form a small mob and are shouting
the boy shoots into a sidestreet drops his box and races ahead
while some chase the boy others stop around the box make way look for a policeman a soldier an officer
a circle continues to form around the box
a patrol arrives
one of the soldiers has a geiger counter
he moves near the box carefully placing the counter above it then ceasing to be prudent he takes his bayonette cuts the cord and tears open the box lemons
the boy has been cornered surrounded pinned down kicked hit with umbrellas until he is exhausted and can no longer defend himself
he is no longer moving
he is lying on the ground dead
the air is gray now and slowly all the colors unite to form gray
lights are lit in the city and contrast with the whiteness of the casbah high above
the sky is still clear the black profiles of the mountains the straight coasts on the sea the sea itself that seems to be land until it reaches the horizon
where the moon rises between the clouds
following a lengthy discussion the general assembly of the united nations has decided its agenda for the forthcoming debates re unification of korea disarmament the algerian question
colombia has proposed that only the first two points be discussed for the day
however the afro asian nations opposed underlining the importance they attribute to the algerian question
the european crowd applauds their eyes aglow their mouths wide open shouting and yelling their teeth flashing in the sun
clapping of applause on the sea front of algiers
children are held up to see waving small flags
the paratroopers of the tenth division march past
raymond lefevre inspector general of the administration has presided over a meeting in which important decisions have been taken with the aim of securing public order and the protection of
persons and their property
in particular it has been decided to recall the tenth division of paratroopers to algiers that until now has been employed in the antiguerrilla operations on the cabiro plateau
the commander general of the tenth division will assume responsibility for the maintenance of order in algiers and will have at his disposal in order to achieve this goal all
civil and military means provided for the defense of the zone
massu and the authorities are standing on the balconies of the prefecture building
the paras are marching their sleeves rolled up their faces sunburned
machine guns bazookas crew cuts the eyes of singing boys silent steps one battalion after another
the dragon black berets pass by
the red berets of the nd regiment of colonial paratroopers
les casquettes of the rd regiment parade by les hommes peints mathieus paras
colonel mathieu is at the head of the regiment
he is tall slender over fifty
he has thinning gray hair a lean face blue eyes and a wide forehead
his face is lined with many wrinkles
were it not for the uniform the weapons his tanned skin his manner of walking and his energetic voice when giving orders he wouldnt seem a soldier but an intellectual
the rd regiment colonial paratroopers are now before the commissioner
mathieu turns his head slightly and rd regiment

in a villa in the military headquarters a reception room is visible through a large window on the first floor
there are about twenty officers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture
mathieu is in front of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk
at his back there is a blackboard and near it a large map with pyramid graphs cells arrows crossmarks and above them the title mathieus voice has nothing of the
military and traditional
his tone is neither harsh nor cold but rather kind and pleasing from it emanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position
the result is that in the last two months they have reached an average of
assaults per day including aggression against individuals and the explosions
of course the conditions of the problem are as usual first the adversary second the method to destroy him
there are arabs in the casbah
are they all against us
we know they are not
in reality it is only a small minority that dominates with terror and violence
this minority is our adversary and we must isolate and destroy it
while speaking he goes to the window and pulls down the shade
he interrupts his speech points to the rest of the window draw it down there too
two or three officers stand up to perform the task
at the back of the room there is a movie projector
next to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it
the other shades are drawn and gradually the room is darkened
mathieu meanwhile has resumed speaking he is an adversary who shifts his position above and below the surface with highly commendable revolutionary methods and original tactics
he is an anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who mingles with thousands of others who resemble him
we find him everywhere in the alleys of the casbah in the streets of the european city and in working places
mathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the room which is completely darkened
go ahead martin
martin turns on the projector
on the white wall next to the map and graph appear pictures of the casbah
there are the blockades the barbed wire the metal screens the algerians who exit and enter the policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone
from time to time close ups of the pictures are shown enlarged to the minutest details close ups of faces motionless images that last only for a few seconds
here is some film taken by the police
the cameras were hidden at the casbah exits
they thought these films might be useful and in fact they are useful in demonstrating the usefulness of certain methods
or at least their inadequacy
hassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her while she laughs jokes flirts in a provocative manner and passes the blockade
i chose these films because they were shot in the hours preceding some recent terroristic assaults
and so among all these arabs men and women there are the ones responsible
but which ones are they
how can we recognize them
controlling documents is ridiculous one who has everything in order is most likely to be the terrorist
an algerian is being dragged away while protesting kicking and trying to free himself
and then the scene changes
there is another casbah exit and an algerian who is being searched
smiling note the intuition of the cameraman
he realized that in that box there had to be something of interest and he paused to focus it
the picture is enlarged
the small box which the algerian is carrying on his shoulder is seen in detail
it is opened
the box is swarming with snakes the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward
the officers in the room burst into laughter
laughing maybe the bomb was hidden right there in a double bottom
well never know
using the barrel of his machine gun a soldier has closed the box
a snake has managed to jump out and fallen to the ground
the people are terrified and move away
others laugh among them petit omar who seems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself
thats enough martin
the lights are again switched on in the room
mathieu is again next to the desk and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides
we must start again from scratch
the only information that we have concerns the structure of the organization
and we shall begin from that
he takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the graph while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university professor
it is a pyramid like organization divided into a series of sectors
at the top of the pyramid is their general staff
he has moved near the blackboard and taken some chalk and slowly as he speaks he illustrates his speech
the military commander responsible for the executive body finds the right man and nominates him to responsibility for a sector number one
number one in his turn chooses another two number two and number three
and so they form the first triangle
he has written high on the board a number one and below it with some space between them the numbers two and three
he unites the three numbers with lines and forms a triangle
now number two and number three choose in their turn two men each
number four and five and so on
mathieu writes the new numbers spacing them on the next line
then he unites two to four and five and three to six and seven forming two new triangles
mathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the preceding line and thus forms other triangles
now the blackboard is covered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid
the reason for this geometry is so that every militant will know only three members in the entire organization his commander who has chosen him and the two members that
he himself has chosen
contacts take place only by written instructions
that is why we do not know our adversaries because in practice they do not even know each other
mathieu leaves the blackboard and moves near the officers
the tone of his voice changes
the explanation is now finished
he gives directions
to know them means to eliminate them
consequently the military aspect is secondary to the police method
i know we are not fond of this word but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform
we must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid
the reason for this work is information
the method is interrogation
and interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result or rather an answer
in practice demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence
i am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly
however success does not depend solely on us
we need to have the casbah at our disposal
we must sift through it
and interrogate everyone
and here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative as if algiers were a holiday resort and not a
we have requested a carte blanche
but it is very difficult to obtain
therefore it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention and make it possible
it is necessary to create it ourselves this excuse
unless our adversaries will think of it themselves which seems to be what they are doing
it is not a song but a type of spoken chorus an assembly of young voices words whispered from the throat both high and low and sudden silent pauses
it is monotonous but it is just such a repetition always with the same pattern of tones high low then silent that manages to transform itself into a motif reach
an excited pitch and acquire breadth and solemnity
the sound fills the alleys rises toward the long rectangle of sky and moves farther away as if it were meant to be heard by all
the alley is narrow and sloping with crumbling walls tufts of grass and refuse
it is located at the outer periphery of the casbah the countryside is in the background
an algerian is walking with large steps a five year old child is behind him moving quickly stumbling from time to time on the pavement although he does not cry
occasionally he calls to his father who proceeds forward and does not turn around
the chorus arises from behind them
it is incoherent
they stop in front of a door they have arrived
the door gives way and they enter
a large room like a shop or stable
here too on the ground and pavement there are tufts of grass
it is cold
the walls are unplastered the windows boarded
the roof is in sight but not the beams
the roof is made of tiles and covered with a coat of whitewash
there are about twenty children five to eight years old seated on the floor
the teacher is in front of them he too is seated
he is prompting the verses in a low voice almost in a whisper and the chorus repeats it
the koran school a bare wobbling place
the algerian who has entered takes the child by his hand and accompanies him to the teacher who is now standing the chorus continues the other children do not look
at the two who have just entered
the algerian and the teacher greet each other bringing their hands to their hearts and then to their mouths
at the same time the teacher takes an envelope from under his tunic and hands it over to the other
to all militants
after two years of hard struggle in the mountains and city the algerian people have obtained a great victory
the un assembly has placed the algerian question in its forthcoming agenda
the discussion will begin on monday january
starting monday for a duration of eight days the nlf is calling a general strike
for the duration of this period all forms of armed action or attempts at such are suspended
we are requesting that all militants mobilize for the strikes organization and success
the algerian has hidden the envelope inside his tunic then presents the child to the teacher who makes him sit down with the other children the teacher also returns to
his place and sits down and suggests a new phrase the chorus continues
the algerian leaves the school
having passed through the door he again moves along the alley this time descending with hurried steps
the chorus continues again heard from without but its echo is now different
bars stores market stalls arab baths
typewritten pieces of paper are used to wrap purchases or slipped inside bags or used on the blank side to add up bills and then handed to the customers
in the european city the algerian workers at the docks the central gas company on the trams the waiters in the restaurants in the bars the shoeshine men algerian brothers
a great hope has arisen for us
the world is watching us
the next few days may be decisive for our future and our freedom
the colonial powers will attempt to demonstrate to the un that the nfl does not represent the will of our people
our response will be unanimous support of the general strike
at the sea front there is a newspaper boy about twelve years old barefoot
his voice is shrill yet cheerful
he is smiling
some europeans buy the newspaper half heartedly grumbling disagreeably
the boy remains cheerful places the change inside the bag strapped to his shoulder thanks them
now he passes in front of a beggar an elderly algerian who is leaning against a railing
the boy winks at him while he continues to shout strike
during the eight days of the strike do not frequent the european city or leave the casbah
provide lodgings in your homes for the poor the beggars the brothers who do not have homes
store provisions of food and water for eight days
there is a strange atmosphere in the casbah
people are greeting each other in the streets a thick buzz of voices a festive mood a sense of brotherhood and the children who are taking advantage of the situation
and play and run everywhere
the shops are unusually crowded
the people enter and exit loaded with supplies
in the shops too there is the same festive mood almost as if the supplies were for a trip to the country
the shopkeepers are also cheerful
and the poor customers instead of paying hand over a ticket stamped late afternoon at the blockades of rue de la lyre rue du divan and rue marengo
the casbah exit ramps are deserted while the entrance ramps are overflowing with people
here too there is an intangible air of gaiety witty remarks laughter ironic glances toward the soldiers and policemen with cold faces immobile helmets and machine guns who stand at
the entrances without intervening
the image is shortened and focused through the lenses of binoculars
a paratrooper officer looks at the blockades of rue du divan from a government palace balcony
mathieu is beside him
no one is leaving eh
the officer hands him the binoculars
they continue to enter the rats
mathieu looks through the binoculars and comments in a low voice smiling rats in a trap we hope
but do you believe that the strike will be widespread
without a doubt
behind the two officers through a large open window a room is visible
there is a large table and around it other high officers of the various armed forces and some important officials in plainclothes
a general who has his back to the balcony turns and calls mathieu mathieu
mathieu a name
yes a name for the operation
mathieu moves the binoculars from the blockades and turns slowly around the government square until he reaches an advertising sign for a brand of champagne which now in the dusk
lights up with a sporadic rhythm mathieu pauses then turns toward the room and enters smiling champagne
the general repeats absent mindedly champagne
then in a convinced voice operation champagne yes alright
at the rue du divan blockade there is an incoherent monotonous and irritating chant
there is a blind beggar
he is light complexioned tall and thin his beard long his arms stretched out a cane in his hand
he arrives at last at the entrance ramp tries to find the way but cannot
he tries again and again with his cane continually repeating his sorrowful chant until a policeman takes him by his free hand placing the hand roughly on the metal screen
the beggar protests and waves his cane in a way that the policeman has to duck to prevent himself from being hit
the policeman curses spitefully coarsely
a soldier starts to laugh
the old man takes up his chant again and moves forward leaning on the metal screen
on the other side of the blockade behind the square there is a group of veiled girls who have seen the old man and seem to be waiting for him
two of them go to meet him and each one takes one of his arms
at the touch of their hands the old man is again infuriated
even the girls laugh
then one of them speaks to him slowly in a loud voice
it seems that the old man has understood
he is convinced
he mumbles something kindly and lets them accompany him
a poorly lit alley
a group of unemployed men and beggars are standing in front of a door
one of the three companions consults a list then points to two in the group
he signals them to enter
in the inner courtyard there is an elderly man who awaits them and receives them kindly
they greet each other in the customary algerian manner
courtyard and balcony
on the terrace also someone is looking toward the courtyard
kader is on the terrace together with a man about forty years old dressed in european clothes he has narrow shoulders and a sunken chest
his face is sensitive his forehead high and his hair and eyes black
his eyes are kind and thoughtful and twinkle with irony
he is ben mhidi one of the four members of the cce the central executive committee
to him they are beggars and unemployed homeless
we have organized things in such a way that during the strike they will be guests of other families who have homes and will provide shelter in the event of
but i didnt know that they would be brought to this house too
it is a mistake
because you are here too
it would be better for you to move to another house
ben mhidi moves away from the parapet
youre the one who must decide
kader follows him along the terrace
no if i were the one to decide you wouldnt be in algiers now
ben mhidi looks at him smiling
isnt it wise
kader smiles too and repeats it isnt wise
at the end of the terrace there is a construction raised to a level with the stairs that lead to the floor below
there is a large room through the open door the lighted interior is visible
the walls have high brick baseboards and at the bottom of one of the four walls there is a square opening that leads into a hiding place
the closure of the hiding place a square of very thick wall is placed to one side
ali la pointe is covering it with bricks
on the other side of the room next to the door there are some cement wash basins and a shed for rain water
kader appears at the door
ali you must accompany ben mhidi to the maison des arbres
ali doesnt answer immediately
he finishes placing the last brick then turns to kader
isnt he sleeping here
no its better if he doesnt
the house is filled with new people
ali gets up wipes his hands on his trousers at the same time inspecting the work that he has just completed
heres another one ready
what a hideout
it really looks like a wall
ill dirty it a bit and its perfect
want to give a look inside
kader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins and he tosses it to ali who catches it
no go now
its already late
they go out on the terrace
ali releases the catch of his machine gun so that the bullet slips into the barrel
to ben mhidi they are a family of militants from way back
everything will work out well youll see
cmon ali hurry up
see you tomorrow
they say good bye embracing one another
ali has already climbed over the terrace wall and has jumped to the next one
ben mhidi follows him he is less agile and moves with a bit of trouble
from the parapet kader says to him passing along the terraces only takes five minutes
and with ali la pointe youll be safe
while jumping ben mhidi loses his balance and has to grab on to ali to prevent himself from falling
but its he who wont be safe with me
the two figures move away from terrace to terrace and disappear in the dark
in the dark in front of them a metallic reflection is visible and the sharp and aggressive sound of an algerian voice is heard
ali responds to the password
a youth steps out from the shadows
he too is carrying a machine gun recognizes ali and greets him
ali and ben mhidi continue
until they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by an alley about ten feet wide
here it is
ben mhidi glances at the emptiness beneath them looks at ali and takes a deep breath
ali has climbed onto the parapet looks around him concentrating attentively for a moment and then jumps into the void reaching the opposite side
he bends searches for something in the dark and lifts a type of gangplank
he hands it over to ben mhidi and together they place it between the two terraces
be careful now
unless you know how it works its better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this
he tries to stand up on the gangplank but he lacks the necessary steadiness
he cant hold his balance
he does as ali has advised him he sits astride on the plank and using the force of his arms he pushes himself forward
he stops halfway to rest for a minute
its good nobody is following us
its a question of habit
and when ben mhidi is closer ali helps him to get down to the terrace
its better if i go first to make sure everythings okay
without waiting for an answer he moves toward the stairway that leads to the floor below his movements are silent and graceful
ben mhidi leans out from the terrace and looks toward the european city and the sea
at the port two searchlights are lit and their long bright rays move slowly toward the casbah
when ali la pointe returns ben mhidi is still leaning on the railing
he seems not to hear the sound of alis footsteps or his voice
theyre waiting for you
ali moves near him and ben mhidi turns and looks at him
what do you think of the strike ali
i think itll be a success
yes i think so too
its been organized well
but what will the french do
both the question and the answer seem obvious to ali
shrugging its clear
theyll do everything possible to make it fail
no theyll do even more
weve given them the opportunity to do a lot more
do you understand what i mean
starting tomorrow they wont be groping in the dark any more every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy a self confessed criminal
and they will be able to pass to the offensive
have you thought of this
ali has listened attentively
the effort with which he is trying to ask himself the meaning of these words is visible on his face
shaking his head no
but kader told me that you werent in favor of the strike
no and neither were my men
because they told us that we mustnt use weapons now when the time is right
wars arent won with terrorism neither wars nor revolutions
terrorism is a beginning but afterward all the people must act
this is the reason for the strike and its necessity to mobilize all algerians count them and measure their strength
to show them to the un right
smiling slightly yes
the problem also involves the un
i dont know what its worth but this way well give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength
ali breathes deeply instinctively unrestrainedly ben mhidi watches him smiles and says do you know something ali
starting a revolution is hard and its even harder to continue it
winning is hardest of all
but only afterward when we have won will the real hardships begin
he pats alis back fondly with his hand and continues smiling anyway theres still a lot to be done you arent already tired ali are you
ali looks at him and without reacting to his irony with conviction no
it is gray and smoky dawn a slow reabsorption of the night an opaque light which is diffused sprayed frozen to transparency and rediscovers its outlines and perspectives and finally
the sun golden light awakens all algiers
to the north the sea
to the south the mountains and the casbah situated halfway along the coast
the casbah still inert expectant on this first day of the strike
the paratroopers are already at their places one after another at equal distances like links of a very long chain strung through every alley spreading to every sidestreet twisting through
the squares climbing up the stairways dividing joining and lengthening again
the silence is perfect the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part of the landscape
then a brief and sharp hiss a hundred whistles together
a signal releases the still forms the attack begins
doors are beaten down shots screams rifle fire machine gun fire the doors opened or broken down the courtyards the houses the rooms invaded the men who are trying to
escape and who protest and try to save themselves
i was just going to work
ben mhidi is inside the hiding place
from outside an old man helps him to place the square piece of wall over the entrance and then in the spaces between the bricks he adds a paste of
plaster mixed with coal dust
when the paras arrive everything is in order
still men are being seized beaten dragged a cache of weapons men pushed down the stairs go on go on you little rats
get to work
women are clinging together after the beatings
someone is fleeing toward the terraces
we hear the deafening whirl of the helicopters flying against the wind their cabin doors open paras sitting on both sides with their legs dangling out their machine guns on
their knees a loudspeaker for every helicopter microphones turned on in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred times
the helicopters fly low again they skirt the terraces
the algerians are fleeing in terror the uproar begins to fade away is less intense microphones are turned on and off
the terraces are emptied men seized beaten dragged all the men are forced outside in the alleys the streets the squares every man is forced to face the wall his
a truck in reverse a rope fastened to the hub of the wheels its other end to a door latch
the motor is accelerated clouds of exhaust fumes
door latches pried open like lids of sardine cans shop windows smashed with machine gun butts the counters the shelves flung into the air the merchandise thrown into the streets
a game a frenzied excitement
the algerians watch but can not intervene
some shopkeepers rush to the scene crying despairingly while others are dragged away forcibly tossed about slapped pushed forced to open their shops
a shopkeeper is pushed behind the counter he gets up trembling with fear
a para asks him for a bag of candy pays politely smiles pats his bald head and asks him sweetly and the strike my friend
then he distributes the candy among the children who are outside
the children take the candy silently without thanking him then eat the candies slowly their faces unfriendly and cold
the black sky the trees the advertising signs
an equestrian statue a car radio a loudspeaker
attention people of the casbah
the nlf wants to stop you from working
the nlf forces you to close your shops
inhabitants of the casbah rebel against their orders
france is your country
france has given you civilization and prosperity schools streets hospitals
people of the casbah show your love for your mother country by disobeying the terrorists orders
algerians return to work
and then algerian music a cheerful and rhythmical melody the algerians are forced out of the casbah in columns and are pushed toward the military trucks which clutter the southern
side of the square and continue to arrive and depart
meanwhile the paras of the psychological divisions make their first selection randomly or else deliberately basing them on the slightest suspicions
they evaluate each man by his appearance or behavior
they block the algerians from the exit ramp and assault them with a battery of questions who are you
whats your name
where do you work
why did you strike
they forced you eh
tell the truth
you promised them right
then youre the one who wants to strike
do you belong to the nlf
cmon answer me
are you afraid to say it
never mind it doesnt matter
the algerian does not answer but stares into the paras eyes
the para turns to his companions and shouts jacques
another one to headquarters
the algerian is seized and pushed toward the truck
the nlf wants to stop you from working
the nlf forces you to close your shops
the nlf wants to starve you and condemn you to misery
algerians return to work
the port is deserted the cranes still
a loaded ship sways lazily at her moorings the fork lifts are filled with supplies
the limestone is dried out the bridges empty dangling cables swing slowly from the pulleys
there is silence in the docks
then the sound of motors approaching clouds of dust arabs pushed out of the trucks into the shipyard
in the streets of the european city there is an atmosphere of fear and doubt
the shop windows have their shutters lowered halfway the shopkeepers are standing in the doorways ready to close
the front doors of houses are shut
there are a few hurried passersby but no automobiles the trams are not running on the sidewalks the garbage is piled high nearby the long brooms of the algerian street
yelling sweep mes enfants sweep
an algerian with a very refined expression a gentle appearance says while excusing himself i dont know how sir im sorry
they shove the broom into his hands and shout to him learn
europeans of algiers
the strike called by the nlf is a failure
do not be afraid
return to your jobs
general massu guarantees your safety
the army will protect you
a jeep with loudspeaker precedes a row of military trucks loaded with algerians
in every truck there are two paras carrying machine guns by their sides
the algerians are standing crowded together one against the other
some of them are holding banners and signs the trucks turn a corner a youth jumps from the last truck falls gets up again and breaks into a run
the paras shout to him to stop their voices mix with that of the loudspeaker
the algerian continues to run
a burst of machine gun fire then another
the algerian jerks forward his back curved his arms raised
he falls down
noise confusion in the commissioners office press room ticking of the teletype machines throngs of journalists in the telephone room
they are trying to transmit the first news
shouting in every language is heard
we are now in the fourth day and the strike continues with total support by the arab population
the city is very calm
are you deaf
the city is peaceful
in the moslem quarters in the outskirts of the city in the casbah
bye will call again im busy
through the open door mathieu can be seen passing accompanied by another officer
some journalists see him and rush behind him
some others follow four or five in all trying to stop him
excuse me colonel a statement
we dont know anything
you promised us a press conference
now there is a meeting with the commissioner
will you tell us what is happening
we are still weighing the situation
they move to the landing and begin to ascend the stairway that leads to the second floor
the journalists have difficulty keeping up with mathieu
ive put everything at your disposal
go take a look with your own eyes
the strike is a success but
it has failed in its objective
but the nlf has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration
and you believe the nlf
they seemed to be plausible this time
a general strike is a good argument for the the un is far away dear sir
it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs
if i were in their place i would use bombs
but what is it exactly
it is an armed insurrection
they have arrived at the second floor landing hurry along and stop in front of a large door where there is a written sign prefect
mathieu at the same time has continued speaking
it is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war from terrorism one passes to insurrection
as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war the latter being the determining factor
dien bien phu
mathieu glances at the journalist as if to see if there were any irony in his remark but the journalists face is expressionless
in indochina they won
it depends on you
you arent thinking of drafting us by any chance are you colonel
mathieu leans his hand on the door handle and smiles at the journalists
we have enough fighters
you have only to write and well if possible
whats the problem then
sometimes its there sometimes not
sometimes its not enough
what were they saying in paris yesterday
sartre has written another article
mathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say see what i mean
at the same time he opens the door
but before entering he turns again to the journalists
will you kindly explain to me why all the sartres are always born on the other side
then you like sartre colonel
not really but hes even less appealing as an enemy
place du gouvernement dusk the other side of the blockade is silent only the uncovered eyes of the algerian women who await their men
the trucks continue to arrive the men are forced to descend and allowed to enter the casbah
there is an atmosphere of sadness for not all the men have returned
the women look at them scrutinize their faces from the first to the last in one glance then slowly
one face at a time
some women recognize their husbands or their brothers or their sons and run to meet them
but others continue to ask for news in lowered sorrowful voices
have you seen mohamed
why hasnt he returned
a steady hum of voices in arabic then the monotonous voice of a policeman who speaks in the microphone of the loudspeaker
the nlf wants to stop you from working
the nlf forces you to close your shops inhabitants of the casbah disobey their orders
france has given you civilization and prosperity schools streets hospitals
people of the casbah
show your love for your mother country by disobeying the terrorists orders
the loudspeaker is attached to one of the blockade posts and from it a long wire for the microphone is hanging
the policeman has a raspy and bored voice he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in front of him
he gets up lights a cigarette and moves away a few steps
two children are among the women and behind the wooden horses barricades
they were waiting for this moment
they bend seem to be playing but one of them lifts the barbed wire as high as he can from the ground
petit omar passes a wire underneath its farthest end bent in the form of a hook
he moves it toward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground
he succeeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly
the cord unwinds lengthens stretches until the microphone on the table begins to move until it reaches the edge of the table and falls
the noise re echoes in the loudspeaker but no one pays any attention to it
petit omar waits a second then begins to pull again
the microphone is dragged along the ground a humming sound it moves nearer inch by inch forward under the barbed wire until the children are able to take it and
disappear with it behind the women
do not be afraid
algeria will be free
be courageous brothers
do not listen to what they are telling you
algeria will be free
the voice is not violent but gentle somewhat breathless and hurried
it extends to the whole square so that all can hear it well the people stop what they are doing to listen
they are emotional proud or angry and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused as if those words should be written up above
the officer is slow to realize what has happened looks at the loudspeaker the cord and now grabs it cursing
he pulls and tugs it the wire yields and he wrenches it from the microphone
brothers the voice is no longer heard nothing more silence
silence only that something is changed in the womens eyes
the veils that cover the lower half of their faces suddenly begin to tremble sway as if shaken by a breath a light wind
there is no longer an atmosphere of sadness or silence
the ju jus attack the air invade it shake it make it vibrate as if they were electric charges or the sound produced by the wind on a field of
dry reeds or the sound produced by a hundred a thousand fingernails that are scratching a window pane
one two three four
the five algerians indicated are forced to get up taken pushed and brought inside a large deserted house which is the paras headquarters
the other algerians about a hundred of them are sitting on the ground in the clearing in front of the house and the paras of the first regiment continue to
guard them with pointed machine guns
suddenly from the villa the music of a french song comes forth at full blast
the algerians look at each other nervously
even a young para seems to be upset
turning to other para what are they doing
smiling dancing inside
a para rushes through a corridor carrying a tape recorder enters a room where there are some sergeants and an algerian
the adjoining room with white tiled walls and a sink is visible through an open door
two paras are sitting on the floor smoking and chatting between themselves in whispers
the para places the tape recorder on the table
the algerian is naked to the waist
signs of torture are visible
his face is swollen and wet
the sergeant places the chair near him and helps him to sit down then starts the tape recorder
he says to the algerian who is trembling go ahead
repeat everything from the beginning and then well let you go
which district do you belong to
second district casbah west algiers
whats your assignment
responsible for the sixth section
in a room on the ground floor a captain is bent over a large map with graphs and is writing the name sid ahmed sail in one of the blocks
at the bottom of the pyramid
at the same time paras are seen through the large window bringing other algerians to the villa and immediately afterward the music and song are heard again very loudly
night darkness locked doors
the casbah is silent
the paras tread noiselessly on their rubber soles
a flashlight searches for the number of a door then stops
a para knocks discreetly
who is it
sid ahmed sail
the door is opened the paras break in
another alley in the casbah other paras
another door forced open broken into
algerians are crowded together in a courtyard which is illuminated with electric flares
they are being interrogated
a cloudy day a light drizzle a sloping street algerian music
a company of zouaves walk two by two in the casbah through the alleys stop play their music and move on again alternating algerian music and a french song
behind them a line of donkeys with baskets full of packages and bags and cheerful paras who are joking as they distribute the supplies to the starving women and children
who stand ashamed in front of their houses their eyes lowered their gestures too brusque and hesitant
at the general assembly of the united nations none of the motions presented in the course of the debate has obtained the necessary majority
at last an agreement has been reached on a resolution that excludes any form of direct intervention by the un in the algerian question
the assembly of the united nations has limited itself to expressing the hope that in a spirit of cooperation a peaceful democratic and just solution will be found that conforms
to the principles of the united nations charter
the monotony of the last words is drowned out and lost
it is raining more heavily now
the water has begun to run along the sloping alleys
the walls are gray wet the doors of the cafes and shops are barred with signs nailed upon them
the band of zouaves has stopped again and now they are playing la vie en rose
in some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing la vie en rose
in the room on the first floor through the large window the whiteness of the dawn is visible
the desk is cluttered with beer cans and thermos
mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph where the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the pyramid
the scene is motionless their expressions are dull
everyone seems to be incapable of movement overcome by the dull apathy that always follows a sleepless night
until mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene
now we can all go to sleep
and moving together with the others he continues
the end of the strike doesnt change anything
the directives remain the same
give your men the usual shifts
we must remain in the casbah twenty four hours a day
he turns and points to the graph
we must cling to it and work fast
then he turns to the officers and smiling says in another tone of voice have any of you ever had a tapeworm
the officers say no and laugh
the tapeworm is a worm that can grow to infinity
there are thousands of segments
you can destroy all of them but as long as the head remains it reproduces itself immediately
it is the same thing with the nlf
the head is the general staff four persons
until we are able to eliminate them we must always start again from the beginning
while he is speaking mathieu takes his wallet from his back pocket opens it takes out four photos
i found these in the police archives
they are old shots but i made some close ups
ali la pointe
we must print a thousand copies and distribute them to the men
meanwhile the photos are passed around
there are photos taken from identification cards or blown up from some group shots figures somewhat blurred faded smiling peaceful
in the dim light the four faces are barely illuminated
the shadows tone down their expressions kader ali la pointe ramel si mourad
they are crowded into the hiding place sitting on the floor motionless their eyes staring straight ahead their breathing heavy
from outside noises voices that are fading in the distance
then a discreet knock a remark in arabic
the four breathe deeply look at each other then smile a little
ali unslips the beam which placed through an iron ring is holding shut the door of the hiding place
using the soles of his feet he pushes against the square of wall the light enters violently
it is not electric light but daylight
kader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light then goes out on all fours after him ramel and then the others
they leave the hiding place that ali built in the wash house on the terrace
all of them have machine guns
ramel is very tall and robust about thirty years old
si mourad is slightly older than ramel
his movements are slow and precise his glance expresses patience and authority
djamila is waiting for them
you can come out
there were so many this time about ten
ali recloses the hiding place
what do you think
did they come here on purpose or by accident
they asked some questions but they didnt touch anyone
ali has come out of the wash house
the sun is high and helicopters are seen passing one another in the sky
on some faraway terraces bivouacs of paras are visible
they are guarding the casbah from above
the rumble of motors and the voice of the loudspeaker are heard more clearly as they near the house
inhabitants of the casbah
the terrorist ben amin has been executed this morning
qrara normendine has been arrested
boussalem ali has been arrested
bel kasel maussa has been arrested
inhabitants of the casbah
the nfl has been defeated
rebel against the remaining terrorists who want to force you to continue a bloody and futile struggle
people of the casbah the terrorist ben amin has been executed
help us to build a free and peaceful algeria
inhabitants of the casbah the nlf has been defeated
rebel against the remaining terrorists who want to force you to continue a bloody and futile struggle
inhabitants of the casbah
the terrorist ben amin has been executed this morning
qrara normendine has been arrested
boussalem ali has been arrested
bel kasem moussa has been arrested
inhabitants of the casbah the nlf has been defeated
the voice fades away and is no longer heard
at the same time a woman has come up from the floor below carrying a tray of cups and a teapot
ali looks at her quickly but then watching her more closely he sees that she is crying
when she passes near him he stops her places his hand kindly on her shoulder and asks her in arabic why she is crying
the woman shakes her head tries to smile but says nothing
then she enters the wash house silently and begins to serve the tea
its better to split up to increase our chances
we must change hiding places and change them continually
in the meantime we must make new contacts replace our arrested brothers reorganize our sections interrupting him yes but we must also show them that we still exist
as soon as possible
the people are demoralized
leave this to me
not you or any one of us
as long as we are free the nlf continues to exist in the casbah
if they manage to take us too there wont be anything left
and from nothing comes nothing
intervening but its also necessary to do something
and we will do something dont worry
as soon as we have reestablished contacts
and our movements
for this too weve got to change methods
the municipal stadium is crowded with people
there is a football game between two european teams
it is almost the end of the first half
from above to the right of the guest box there is a very loud explosion
strips of flesh are hurled into the air
thick white smoke
there are screams of terror
the people try to move away in haste
they are shoving pushing bumping into one another
then calm returns
the sirens of the ambulances are heard
the stretcher the dead carried away scores of wounded
ben mhidi is standing in front of the journalists with handcuffs on his wrists and ankles
he is without a tie
he is smiling a little his glance ironical
there are two paras behind him with machine guns ready
the picture is still for an instant ben mhidis smile is steady so too his eyes his entire face
flashes clicking of cameras
dont you think it is a bit cowardly to use your womens baskets and handbags to carry explosive devices that kill so many innocent people
ben mhidi shrugs his shoulders in his usual manner and smiles a little
and doesnt it seem to you even more cowardly to drop napalm bombs on unarmed villages so that there are a thousand times more innocent victims
of course if we had your airplanes it would be a lot easier for us
give us your bombers and you can have our baskets
in your opinion has the nlf any chance to beat the french army
in my opinion the nlf has more chances of beating the french army than the french have to stop history
the press hall in the prefects office is crowded with journalists of every nationality
at the side and central aisles there are photographers and cameramen
ben mhidi is opposite them standing on a low wooden platform
mathieu is next to him seated behind a small desk
mathieu now gets up and signals to two paratroopers
another journalist simultaneously has asked another question mr
ben mhidi colonel mathieu has said that you have been arrested by accident practically by mistake
in fact it seems that the paratroopers were looking for someone much less important than yourself
can you tell us why you were in that apartment at rue debussy last night
the two paras have moved forward and they take ben mhidi by the arms
at the same time he answers
i can only tell you that it would have been better if i had never been there
intervening thats enough gentlemen
its late and we all have a lot of work
ben mhidi glances at him ironically
is the show already over
smiling yes its over
before it becomes self defeating
the paras lead ben mhidi away
he moves away with short steps as much as he can with the irons that are tightened around his ankles
mathieu has turned to the journalists and smiles again
colonel mathieu is standing
on his face is a brief smile motionless his eyes attentive but half closed somewhat due to the camera flashes
the spokesman for the residing minister mr
gorlin has stated that larbi ben mhidi committed suicide in his own cell hanging himself with pieces of his shirt that he had used to make a rope and then
attached to the bars of his cell window
in a preceding statement the same spokesman had specified that
due to the intention already expressed by the prisoner ben mhidi to escape at the first opportunity it has been necessary to keep his hands and feet bound continually
in your opinion colonel in such conditions is a man capable of tearing his shirt making a rope from it and attaching it to a bar of the window to
you should address that question to the ministers spokesman
im not the one who made those statements
on my part i will say that i had the opportunity to admire the moral strength intelligence and unwavering idealism demonstrated by ben mhidi
for these reasons although remembering the danger he represented i do not hesitate to pay homage to his memory
much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers but also of the methods that they have employed
can you tell us something about this
the successes obtained are the results of those methods
one presupposes the other and vice versa
excuse me colonel
i have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence
my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions to which you can only respond in an allusive manner
i think it would be better to call things by their right names if one means torture then one should call it torture
whats your question
the questions have already been asked
i would only like some precise answers thats all
lets try to be precise then
the word torture does not appear in our orders
we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies
as for the nlf they request that their members in the event of capture should maintain silence for twenty four hours and then they may talk
thus the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished
what type of interrogation should we choose
the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months
the law is often inconvenient colonel
and those who explode bombs in public places do they perhaps respect the law
when you asked that question to ben mhidi remember what he said
no gentlemen believe me it is a vicious circle
and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions
because the problem does not lie here
the problem is the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain
now it seems to me that despite varying shades of opinion you all agree that we must remain
when the rebellion first began there were not even shades of opinion
all the newspapers even the left wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed
and we were sent here for this very reason
and we are neither madmen nor sadists gentlemen
those who call us fascists today forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance
those who call us nazis do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald
we are soldiers and our only duty is to win
therefore to be precise i would now like to ask you a question should france remain in algeria
if you answer yes then you must accept all the necessary consequences
casbah bedrooms kitchens bathrooms
sharp white light motionless faces figures paused midway in gestures
background motionless like in a landscape
animals being led to slaughter
paras their every gesture measured exactly perfection achieved
an algerian is lying down on the table his arms and ankles bound with belts
an algerian in the form of a wheel an iron bar in the curvature of his knees his ankles tied to his wrists
electrical wires wrenched from their outlets a generator with crank extended pliers with their prongs open wide the tops of the wires held between two prongs the pliers applied to
a naked body the most sensitive parts lips tongue ears nipples heart sexual organs
faucets tubing buckets funnels a mouth forced open held open with a wooden wedge tubing in the mouth rags scattered around water a belly that is swelling
the torture is precise in every detail and every detail points to a technique that is taken apart and reassembled
the chorus of the koran school like ceaseless wailing like a stubborn will to survive that seems to be spreading through the casbah
petit omar looks up instinctively his small face hardened and taciturn like that of an adult then enters the school
the children are sitting on the mats motionless only their lips are moving
there is an oblique light the teacher is in the shadow
petit omar approaches the teacher who shakes his head in denial
omar goes out
the casbah is patrolled by paratroopers helmets machine guns portable radios police dogs
paratroopers are erecting loudspeakers at every street corner
paratroopers with brushes and buckets of paint are marking the doors of the casbah with large numbers
from time to time machine gun fire is heard in the distance
algerians are standing against the wall their hands up
there is a dead man a few feet away an algerian youth
the paratroopers turn him over and search him
a child with terrified eyes turns around a little
a para transmits the dead mans name into the portable radio
a car radio receives and transmits the same name and then the name is repeated by the loudspeakers scattered throughout the casbah
inhabitants of the casbah
the rebellion gets weaker every day
the terrorist ben amin has been executed
kasem moussa has been arrested
he was commander of the nd sector nlf
inhabitants of the casbah
the terrorists are not your true brothers
leave them to their fate
rely on the protection of the french army
denounce the terrorists and agitators
cooperate with us to reestablish peace and prosperity in algeria
four women their faces veiled meet a patrol of paras in a small street
two of the paras stop the last woman and lift her dress uncovering her feet and ankles those of a man
the tear away her veil
the man is ali
at the same time there is
the two paras fall to the ground
ali grasps his weapon visible through the opening of his cloak
the other paras fling themselves to the ground
the other three women flee while ali continues to shoot then runs away
the four flee through the narrow streets and alleys climb a stairway and leap from one terrace to another
behind them shouts whistles and machine gun fire are heard
and moving nearer
the four enter a courtyard
alis three companions have also lifted their veils
they are kader mourad and ramel
a woman rushes to shut the door while a man leads the four toward an opening hidden by some boxes
the others who are in the courtyard women and children are also busy helping silently hurriedly in a tense atmosphere of solidarity with the four fugitives
very near are heard
a woman runs toward the door and throws some large handfuls of pepper under the cracks
the group of pursuers paras who are holding police dogs by leashes slow down in front of the door
the animals sniff the ground then move on together with the paras
petit omar enters the large steamy room
he moves near the manager and hands him an envelope
the manager slips it quickly under the counter
to all nlf militants
replace your fallen and arrested brothers
make new contacts
this is a grave moment
the general staff leaves you free to take any and all necessary offensives
all the inhabitants of a house
the men are in a row on the balcony of the first floor their hands crossed behind their heads their backs to the wall while paras guard them with pointed
two paratroopers lead an algerian girl forward she seems to be exhausted and can barely walk her eyes half closed
they stop in front of the first man and ask her is this one
our hearts are breaking before such outrages our houses invaded our families massacred
bring terror to the european city
the european city evening houses are being lit
people have finished working
they are going to the bars cinemas or for walks or crowding the bus stops
the wail of a siren at full blast an ambulance driven at frightening speed
the people move aside jump to the sidewalks
the cars squeeze to the right stop
the ambulance door is opened a corpse is thrown out falls rolls into the street
the people rush to it
it is a hospital attendants in white uniform with a knife stuck in his throat
the sound of the siren decreases in intensity the ambulance is by now far away
in the drivers cab there are two algerian boys
their hair is curly their shirts old and torn
they are sweating their eyes wide open staring
the one who is driving barely reaches the height of the steering wheel
he clutches it desperately
the other has a machine gun
he makes a remark in arabic shouting to be heard above the siren
the driver takes a hand off the steering wheel places it on the dashboard and tries all the switches until he finds the one for the headlights
the high beams
the other meanwhile is now on his knees on the seat
he is leaning out the open window to his waist and he begins to shoot
the pictures succeed one another in a dizzy rhythm surprise terror someone falls
there is no more ammunition
the machine gun is thrown in the back of the ambulance
the siren is still at full blast
the auto races ahead at terrifying speed
the two boys dont know any more what to do where to go and the one who is driving has his eyes almost closed as if he were dizzy
they reach a square
the other points ahead to the left
the people are crowded in a bus shelter
the one who is driving doesnt understand or doesnt want to
the other shouts to him again and again the same phrase then flings himself on the steering wheel and turns it in that direction
the bus shelter is nearer and nearer
the people are paralyzed
they have no time to move
they are run down rammed into
the ambulance crashes into a pillar
on the ground all about the bodies of dead and wounded
the boys bodies remain motionless their foreheads resting on the smashed windshield
but the sound of the siren does not stop and is heard mournful and full of anguish
vincent de paul noon
there are helicopters in the sky and paras fill the alley
their faces are pale and tense their eyes wide open their hands clutch their machine guns
there is a strange silence
then a movement at the back of the alley a voice a brief greeting
mathieu has arrived and he is saying to an officer now is not the time for heroes
give me the megaphone
mathieu takes the megaphone in his hands and approaches an open door
through the doorway the inner courtyard of the house is visible where the corpses of four paras are strewn about
ramel and si mourad are on the first floor balcony lying in wait behind the railings so they are able to watch the door courtyard and the stairway that leads
from the balcony to the terrace
on the terrace there are other paras who are facing the balcony
from time to time they release a burst of machine gun fire
the voice of mathieu is heard over the loudspeaker
use your heads
if you go on like this i wouldnt want to be in your place when you are captured
because you will be captured in the end and you know it too
if you do it immediately i promise that you will not be harmed and you will have a fair trial
can you hear me
ramel and si mourad look at each other
who is speaking
we dont trust you colonel
come forward show yourself
a moment of silence
i dont trust you either
first stand up so i can see you and keep your hands still and well in sight
mourad hesitates an instant glances at ramel then okay
but we want your promise for a fair trial in writing
give us a written statement mathieu and then well surrender
how can i give you this statement
well lower a basket from the window
okay ill make the statement in writing
mourad shows his companion the two large time bombs that are on the floor in front of him
he takes one begins to prepare it and regulates the mechanism
at the same time he tells ramel in arabic to go find the basket
ramel crawls past the doors which are all closed and asks for a basket
a door opens and an old woman appears
she hands him a basket with its cord rolled up
without turning around a newspaper too or a piece of paper
ramel brings him the basket and newspaper
mourad has loaded the time bomb mechanism and the tic toc sound is sharp and clear
now he has to move the second hand
mourads hands do not tremble his glance is attentive concentrating
ramel watches him without saying a word his fear is obvious
without moving his eyes glued to the bomb dial loudly are you ready colonel
but let me first see you
mourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a minute
immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb in the bottom of the basket
the basket seems to be empty
the piece of newspaper protects its bottom
mourad tells ramel to get up and he too gets up
their machine guns are lying on the ground
meanwhile mourad has begun to count to himself silently his lips moving one two three four
from the terrace the paras can see ramel and mourad standing up not very far away their empty hands resting near the basket on the railing
a para shouts we see them
you can come
mourad begins to lower the basket very slowly
mathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras
he looks up toward the balcony smiles and shows them a folded piece of paper
here it is
you know that when i give my word i keep it
mourad does not answer but looks at mathieu as if to calculate the distance and time and slows down even more the baskets descent
mathieu moves forward a few steps as if to go for the basket that is hanging on the other side of the courtyard but suddenly he seems perplexed for a
second and then changes his mind
he turns to the nearest para and gives him the note
mourads face has remained motionless
in his expression there is a shade of disappointment
he sees mathieu retrace his steps toward the door and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers
the basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground
in order to reach it the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions his face hardens he reaches the basket and extending his arm he throws
in the note
the basket does not move the para looks up
muttering hurry up black bastard
mourad smiles at him and mumbles something in arabic a phrase that he doesnt manage to finish for now is heard the explosion
rue caton number four
it is p
a large badly lit room is filled with paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a stretcher
another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite side of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away
two paras are by the door
they look out from time to time and are attentive ready with machine guns clutched by their sides
on the other side of the room opposite the door the algerians who live in the house are standing against the wall
mathieu is in front of them and he is asking a group of women which one of you is fathia
a woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him
is it you
the woman nods yes
go up the stairs and tell kader that if they dont surrender well blow up everything
do you understand
the woman again nods yes and without waiting for more words she moves toward the door taciturn silent
mathieu follows her he pushes past her
try to convince him if you care about your house
wait a minute
do you want to get killed
he leans out the door and says loudly kader look
fathia is coming
i wouldnt shoot
then he steps aside and lets the woman pass
outside the door there is a small landing then a steep stairway and at the top a corridor
fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered with empty magazines with cartridge boxes
the walls are chipped from the shooting
the ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same inclination for part of its distance
but for the last few yards it straightens out and lowers to become horizontal
the floor of the hiding place is open
inside are zohra and kader
fathia repeats to them in arabic what mathieu has said to her
kader listens to her then answers he too in arabic
then he smiles
you can tell the colonel to blow up whatever he likes
go on now
fathia goes down the stairs and reenters the room
to mathieu he said that you can blow up whatever you like
she then rejoins the other women
mathieu seems to be tired he has lost weight he is nervous
he turns to his men and slowly as he gives the orders the paras begin to move
return to where the others are
prepare the plastic
it should be placed on the ceiling of the stairway under the hiding place
a long fuse rolled up
keep shooting while you are working
clear the house
bring them outside then check the rooms again
kader gives zohra a box of matches
she goes to the back of the hiding place where there is a bundle of papers
she lights them then returns near to kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun
there are only two shots left
the other empty magazines are scattered around
kader turns to zohra and starts to speak but suddenly his words are blurred by the sound of shots
kader and zohra have to step back a little because the shells are flashing at the edge of the opening
the shooting stops
from the stairway one end of a long fuse is thrown into the corridor
the other end is inserted into a plastic charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway under the hiding place
kader and zohra can see two or three yards in front of them below into the corridor where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning
kader too has lost weight his beard is long
he looks at the fuse then at zohra
a second passes in silence
now zohra too looks at him and kader says calmly in his usual voice it doesnt do any good to die like this
it doesnt help anybody
he leans out from the hiding place
if you give your word that you wont touch any of the other people in the house well come out
inside a military automobile
in the back seat mathieu is sitting next to kader who is handcuffed
zohra is in the front seat between the driver and a para who has in his hand a large regulation pistol
the interior is lighted by the headlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few yards
mathieu looks hastily at kader who is staring straight in front of him and appears to be sullen and downcast
then mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone as if in friendly conversation
if you had let me blow you up you would have disappointed me
kader turns to him and replies trying to maintain his own voice at the same level of indifference why
for many months ive had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you
and naturally i am under the illusion that i know you somewhat
you never seemed the type kader inclined to performing useless actions
kader doesnt answer right away then speaks slowly as if expressing the results of his doubts a new point of view
you seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive
of course i am
that proves that i was wrong
evidently i credited you with an advantage greater than i should have
lets just say that youve given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly
but from the technical point of view it isnt possible to speak of advantages
by now the game is over
the nlf has been defeated
zohra has turned around suddenly
she is crying and speaks hastily in arabic violently harshly
mathieu doesnt understand and turns to kader to ask him politely although with a bit of irony what is she saying
she says that ali is still in the casbah
ali la pointes glance is sullen heavy motionless
he moves his head slowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle
white beach fine sand transparent sea bodies stretched out in the sun golden skin of girls girls in bikinis sensual smiling young men with narrow hips with muscles well cared
for cheerful youth naturally happy enviable
the children are building sand castles near the waters edge the beach is shaped like a half moon with rocky reefs at both ends
a september sunday warm and calm
ali is leaning on the wall
he is wearing a white wool cloak
only his eyes are visible
the eyes of a hungry tiger perched above a path on the lookout for innocent prey
eyes that now gleam cruel eyes tension dilating the pupils
then again the calm a gloomy calm a gratifying tension
the place is right and the victims couldnt be better ones
ali moves leaves the wall crosses the street to a large city sanitation truck one of those metallic trucks with no visible openings
a young algerian is at the steering wheel a street cleaner
he is leaning his thin face on the wheel
his hands are dirty by now unwashable from years of work
ali has climbed into the cab
the truck is in motion and leaves
the name of the street cleaner is sadek
he seems frightened
he looks around hesitates before speaking
then the beach is okay ali
sadek looks at him again waiting but ali does not respond
ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight the tar that seems to be liquid the villas that surround algiers the lemon trees the oleanders
then he speaks but without turning to sadek
he speaks in a whisper his eyes continually staring straight ahead
we need two more the biggest ones
and the others
lets wait and see
sadek remains silent for a while
ive looked ali even where i work
the ones who have not been arrested have left algiers and gone into the mountains
and the others dont want to hear any more about it
ali doesnt answer him
cant you go any faster
sadek puts the truck in third gear accelerates the motor then shifts back again into fourth gear
the truck increases its speed
the road is straight the outskirts of algiers are visible
if we dont find any others
should we call it off
ali turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing
sadek can feel those eyes on him and tries to justify himself
we cant plant all of them by ourselves
ali speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice
you dont have to plant anything
you only have to carry them thats all
at number three rue des abderames on the first floor balcony the stove fires are glowing
the women are cooking outside on their stoves built from tin containers
they are cooking in front of the doors of their homes
the doorways are lit up
ali passes along the balcony passes by mahmoud and his wife who are speaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing
it is a warm and starry night
mahmoud says some more words to his wife still speaking in whispers tenderly
then he follows ali who has stopped in front of the door
in the room there is petit omar who is cutting out some pictures from a comic book
as soon as he sees ali at the door he stops closes his book puts the scissors in his pocket
he seems to be embarrassed at being caught in his childish game
in the center of the room there is a dividing curtain pulled halfway to the side
on the other side hassiba is typing
behind hassiba next to the bed the hiding place is open
he seems tired sweating
he removes his cloak tosses it on the chair and puts his machine gun on the table
turning to petit omar cmon hurry
go to sleep
tomorrow we four have a lot of work to do mahmoud hassiba you and i
mahmoud has remained motionless at the door
hassiba has stopped typing and approaches them
omar says nothing but there is a satisfied look in his eyes
he cant help stretching out his hand to touch the machine gun
ali sits down at the table moves the machine gun away from omar and continues to speak still talking to omar
because we cant find anyone else sadek will bring us there in the truck
you get out first and plant the bomb where i tell you
then return here quickly
but be careful that no one is following you
then hassiba will get out and after her mahmoud
then i will plant the ones that are left
theyll know that were still strong
you can be sure of that
the room is badly lit by a small lamp which is on the other side of the curtain
there is a mattress on the table and petit omar is lying on top asleep
ali is lying on a mattress on the ground fully dressed with his machine gun by his side
his eyes are open and he is listening to the far away sound of a motor
he looks at his watch gets up and goes to open the door
outside there is the first gray light of dawn
the sound is heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer
ali returns to petit omar stays a minute looking at him then shakes him roughly
the child gets up immediately
he is trembling as if he had slept with taut nerves and jumps down quickly from the table
his eyes are open but he is still sleepy
ali smiles for a moment and runs his fingers through omars hair
cmon wake up
hurry little one
today youre going to see fireworks
the child also smiles and his face relaxes then brightens up
at the same time he extends his hand and pats alis side
mahmoud enters the room from the balcony
he is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee
its almost time isnt it
then ali turns to the curtain and calls hassiba
ali sits down and puts on a pair of sneakers
petit omar has finished dressing
the curtain is drawn hassiba appears already dressed
i heard the sound of a truck before
but i dont think it was sadek
otherwise hed be here by now
hassiba is dressed in european clothes a skirt and blouse
she nears the table and takes a cup of coffee
smiling how is your wife now
mahmouds face is expressionless
he shakes his head
ali has finished putting on his shoes
he takes a cup of coffee
in the same moment outside the door is heard the four are startled
simultaneously all of them move toward the hiding place
mahmouds wife appears at the door
her face is despairing but she moves carefully quickly precisely
she closes the door
she puts the coffee cups back on the tray and hides everything in the sink
she goes to the other side of the curtain
ali is entering the hiding place
the other three are already inside
ali pushes the movable piece of wall toward him and the woman helps him
then she takes a can from the night table it is full of plaster mixed with coal dust
the woman spreads the paste in the joints between the bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place
at the same time shouting shots and the footsteps of paras are heard
as soon as she has finished the woman slips into bed under the sheets
the paratroopers break into the room shouting and make the woman get up
they drag her outside on the balcony
they drag mahmouds wife down from the balcony to the center of the courtyard where now all the inhabitants of the building are standing men women children all of them
with their hands to the wall in full sight of the paras who are guarding them
sadeks head is lowered
he passes along the balcony between marc and the captain
he stops in front of the door
mumbling softly here
the algerian nods yes
sadek points toward the curtain
the captain signals him to go there
the algerian points to a spot in the brick baseboard
the captain examines it and with his thumb he tests the fresh plaster
he bends down and leans his ear to the wall
he smiles as he listens to the
it is the same breathing that soon after mathieu hears bent in the same position as the captain
the colonel gets up and looks around him
four paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place
others are arranging plastic charges along the wall all of them connected to a single fuse
in a corner sadek wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues is sitting on a chair
he is watching the scene with his eyes wide open
he is trembling
his body is slouched forward
he seems to be lifeless without nerves
if it werent for his face he would seem to be a heap of rags
to the captain everything ready
he hasnt answered
i thought so
it was obvious
mathieu bends down again and leans his ear against the bricks
he gets up again
he remains a minute in this position lost in thought
loudly and markedly ali
ali la pointe
youre going to be blown up
let the others come out at least the child
well let him off with reformatory school
why do you want to make him die
mathieu stops and shakes his head
he turns to the captain lets go
a paratrooper is unrolling a large bundle of fuse
bring it down there till it reaches outside
mathieu has stopped in front of sadek
he looks at him
is this one still here
take him away
two paratroopers grab the street cleaner by the armpits and almost lifting him completely they lead him away
mathieu is about to go out then turns and takes the megaphone from the captains hands and places it to his mouth
ali la pointe
i am giving you another thirty seconds
what do you hope to gain
youve lost anyway
thirty seconds ali starting now
ali la pointes eyes are staring at the square piece of wall that seals the hiding place
his glance is taciturn gloomy
the others are watching ali
their lips are half open their breasts rise and fall in laborious breathing
in deep resigned voice who wants to leave
petit omar presses against alis arm he looks like a son with his father
mahmoud takes his head in his hands and squeezes it
what are you going to do
i dont deal with them
mathieu checks his watch thirty seconds have passed
he moves to go out
the four paras with machine guns are still in the room
to another paratrooper you stay here by the door to signal the others
when i call you all of you come down
the sun has risen to the height of the terraces
the terraces are swarming with people
the alley is empty and only the fuse is visible it reaches to a small clearing full of paratroopers
two more colonels and a general have arrived
there is a paratrooper with an arriflex ready to film the explosion
the atmosphere is that of a show
two paratroopers are connecting the ends of the fuse to the electric contact
on the terraces there are algerian women children and old people
their eyes are motionless someone is praying
there is an atmosphere of suspense
there is also the wife of mahmoud her eyes seem blank
five paras come out of the house quickly and pass along the alley toward the clearing
the captain signals and the para begins to lower the contact switch slowly
the eyes of all are motionless
the camera is ready
but the explosion does not occur
the paratrooper swears he examines the wires
pierre responds by mumbling something and at the same time his hands are moving frenziedly around the wires
ali la pointe bends over petit omar as if to cover him
hassiba has stopped breathing her eyes wide open mahmoud is crying
a single image a second and now the house collapses in a white cloud as if its foundations had suddenly been removed
mathieu and the other officers move away
behind them the echo of the explosion continues to resound then shouts orders and isolated ju ju
mathieus face is weary but his expression is relieved
he is smiling
and so the tapeworm no longer has a head
are you satisfied mathieu
in algiers everything should be over
yes i believe there wont be any more talk of the nlf for some time
lets hope forever
another colonel intervenes at heart they are good people
weve had good relations with them for a hundred and thirty years
i dont see why we shouldnt continue that way
yes but algiers is not the only city in algeria
smiling bah for that matter algeria isnt the only country in the world
smiling why yes of course
but for the moment lets be satisfied with algiers
in the mountains our work is always easier
gradually the officers move away down the slanting street toward their jeeps and their remarks fade away and are lost
like the cries of birds of thousands of wild birds the ju jus invade and shake the black sky
and below in the casbah the white cloaks of the algerians are like streams floods through the alleys down the stairways through the streets and the squares they flow toward
the european city
in the press hall the journalists are taking the telephones by force shouting at the top of their voices
an english journalist no one knows what could have been the pretext
the fact is that they seem to be unleashed without warning
i telephoned lausanne
i spoke with an nlf leader in exile
they dont know anything there
in front the adolescents very young boys and girls their mouths wide open their eyes burning laughing their arms stretched above them raised and lowered to mark the rhythm
mu sul mane
the paratroopers jump down from the trucks and rush forward
the policemen rush forward soldiers zouaves the crs
deployed in cordons in a wedge in turtle like formations in order to divide to scatter to hold back
but the demonstrators will not move back or divide
they continue to press forward pushing against the troops face to face
free ben bel la
free ben bel la
the europeans are closing their doors lowering shutters
they too the younger ones the more decisive are grouping together trying to confront the algerians
they are less numerous but armed
the first revolver shots resound in the streets from the windows
some algerians fall but the others continue to advance
they are running now scattering
ta hia et thou ar
long live the partisans
the jeeps the trucks the sirens the tear gas bombs machine gun fire
and then the tanks
the turrets move slowly in a semi circle
the machine gunner fires the first burst at point blank
ta hia el djez air
ta hia el djez air
meanwhile the sun has set and shadows of night are visible
off today the situation is tenser
in spite of pressure from the more intolerant colonialist group it seems that the government has given strict orders not to use arms except in emergency situations
but this afternoon there were attempts to enter the european city by force as a result the first casualties now calm has returned although from the casbah continue to be
heard those cries
incoherent rhythmic nightmarish cries
and then from time to time in the by now dark night the shrill and angry ju jus
those cries continued until the following day
the following day is sunny the scene begins again like the day before
off this morning for the first time the people appeared with their flags green and white with half moon and star
thousands of flags
they must have sewn them overnight
flags so to speak
many are strips of sheets shirts ribbons rags
but anyway they are flags
thousands of flags
all are carrying flags tied to poles or sticks or waving in their hands like handkerchiefs
waving in the sullen faces of the paratroopers on the black helmets of the soldiers
another two years had to pass and infinite losses on both sides and then july independence was obtained the algerian nation was born
ta hia el djez air
ta hia el djez air
ta hia el djez air
