written by kenneth lonergan november from across broadway we see a little girl waiting at the curb
she steps off the curb toward us a truck barrels into frame the long lens flattened perspective makes it look like shes just been crushed
but the truck flashes by and shes fine
more traffic passes to and fro through the frame
the light changes and a crowded corner full of new yorkers step off the curb and into the crosswalk before the first foot lands on the street we go to
super slow motion as the mid day work crowd crosses the street
montage slow motion shots of new yorkers mid day all kinds going all different ways all over the city
credits end with some high school kids with book bags walking among the crowds
an th grade math class at the ralph waldo emerson school one of the few remaining manhattan s inspired progressive schools
about twenty kids mostly white secular jewish
a sprinkling of black and hispanic kids
the teacher mr aaron late s is returning test papers
one after the other the students get up to collect their tests glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs
on lisa cohen just
not the best looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five
she listens listlessly somewhat bad temperedly
at cohen lisa gets up and heads for the desk
lisas pov closing in slowly on mr aaron who glances up at her as she approaches
their eyes meet
aaron has the classic handsome young teachers no nonsense expression on his face as she reaches out her hand thank you mr aaron
she walks back
on her test hes written b see me after class the last students go out as mr aaron gestures for lisa to take a seat
take a seat lisa
i just wanna talk about your test for a minute
i know you had a little help
well i mean i didnt cheat if thats what you mean
im just saying i know you had a little help
a lot of people did
be that as it may i mean ill take it over again if you want but like what would be the point
its not like im ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life
well lisa thats just not necessarily true
havent you ever developed an interest in something you didnt initially think you were going to develop an interest in
um no not really
mr aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement
lisa looks at him with secret adoration
he looks up
anyway it was open book
so whats the big difference between using a book and like i dont know using somebody elses mind whos like really good at math
its not like this person did the whole test for me
i did some of it
she smiles at him
he is no longer smiling back
well next time id appreciate it if you did all of it
you are so fair
tracking lisa from behind as she walks through the halls past her fellow students
she walks through a door where kids are smoking
lots of butts on the ground
the walls covered with graffiti
lisa goes to her friend becky and takes out her cigarettes
a kid named kurt smokes nearby
what did he say to you
mr aaron and i have an understanding about my math problem
he is so appealing
a long haired kid comes out followed by a somewhat preppier girl kirsten and her look alike friend leslie
ok mr ferrar is such an asshole
whatd he do call on you
kirsten is really upset
let me have one of those will you
leslie gives kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her
kirsten i didnt know you smoked
im just really angry
to leslie check out what he
said to me last week
she drops her voice
they whisper and then both laugh
lisa watches them
are you serious
lisa overhears monica an elegant th grader talking to some other girls seated on the steps
i just dont think you can really know a guy until youve slept with him
lisa listening is not so sure but wouldnt know
the class is taught by two teachers mr klein s and mr lewis s
on the blackboard are scrawled the words strikers pinkertons and prez
so the president of the united states william b
mckinley authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike and they went out there and shot them down
just like they did in virginia just like they did in pennsylvania
because they did not care
they did not care
low rumbling and thats basically it thats basically all there is to say
go ahead uhhhhh becky
well mr klein
i mean was there ever a good president of the united states
there is some laughter from the students
i dont know becky
i think thats a good question
what do you think
what do you think
did we ever have a good president
i dont know
i guess most of them have just been totally corrupt
can i just say im not necessarily like a big fan of all the presidents of the united states especially the current one but i still dont think its necessarily
all that useful to categorize every president as universally corrupt because that just seems very general to me
especially if youre going to judge them by the standard of whatever theyre supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of america that probably never existed to begin
anthony an intellectual smart ass leans back in his chair
lisa has raised a salient point
there are some laughs from the class
school is letting out
lisa walks away from the building
a short energetic kid named darren falls in step with her
hey howd you do
oh hey darren
it was fine
thank you so much
so he didnt give you a hard time or anything
well he knows im not planning to like go into mathematics or anything
he was totally cool about it
hes so cool
oh yeah everybody loves mr aaron
whats that supposed to mean
the man is very lovable
they stop at the corner
what are you doing now
i was gonna go look for a cowboy hat
why would you want to buy a cowboy hat
because my dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in new mexico to go horseback riding and i dont think it would be right to
appear on horseback in new mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia darren
you wouldnt understand these things
that is a definite possibility
before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat
what are you up to later
i dont know
you wanna go to a movie
what do you mean like on a date
no not on a date just go to amovie
i dont know if its a fucking date
what do you wanna see
i dont know i dont even know whats playing
i dont know if its a date
lets just forget it
i hate the fuckin movies anyway
theyre just bullshit
theyre all bullshit
ok take it easy i was just asking
what if it was a date anyway
would that be so horrendous
oh my god
are you like are you asking me out
pause are you
earth to darren
i dont know
i feel like were already really close
oh my god
and i think wed be a really good match what
this is nothing
i mean yes
yes i am
i mean i am really flattered
but i would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship
i view this as a way of strengthening our friendship
it would definitely change it
i know its a fairly dangerous move
i would definitely have to think about this
give it some thought
ok i will
he is looking at her like he wants something
why do you look like that
what do you want from me
not a thing
ill see you later
she turns and walks away pleased by the conversation
lisa walks down her street and lets herself into the prewar apartment building
she lets herself into the narrow apartment
a long hall covered with framed pictures photographs and play posters opens onto a cramped living room crammed with books plays and magazines
a stereo tv and computer are stuck in the corners
beyond this is the kitchen and another hallway leading to the bathrooms and bedrooms
lisa drops her bag and goes into the kitchen
she opens the refrigerator
her brother curtis comes in
is mom home
she went to the store
lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it
use a plate
dont be such a little fuckin goody two shoes
please dont say fuck curtis
you just said it
yeah thats because i know what it means
so do i
uh no you dont curtis
take my word for it
what does it mean
she looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately
its when a man puts his penis inside a womans vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body
no its not
yes it is
it is gross
he watches her
do you want to play a game
i dont feel like it curtis
quit bugging me
can i have some pizza
she gives him a piece of pizza
they eat together
curtis is practicing the piano
lisa on her cell phone rummages in her mothers bureau
during the following she finds a small supply of cash and steals forty dollars
on the phone what are you up to tonight
nothing darren wants me to go to the movies with him
you want to come
i guess around eight
pov lisa slowly passing by broadway clothing store windows
no cowboy hats
she walks down broadway window shopping enjoying herself
through the window we see lisa talk to the pretty mid s salesgirl with an embroidered cowboy hat
as lisa slowly passes by and looks in various store windows
she stops and looks at some shoes
reflected in the window behind her a city bus pulls up to a bus stop and wheezes as the doors open
the bus driver is wearing a cowboy hat
he is in his s and kind of good looking
past the disembarking passengers we see lisas back as she scans the shoe store
on lisa she turns around and sees the bus driver
she sees his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut hey
the bus lurches away
lisa takes off after it
in the bus close on the bus driver oblivious to lisa who we can see out the door and window falling behind
on the street the bus falls behind a slow moving car and lisa catches up
in the bus lisa appears at the bus doors waving and calling out
the bus driver sees her smiles and waves back
on the street lisa is running alongside the bus
whered you get your cowboy hat
in the bus the bus driver cant hear her but smiles at her with good natured flirtatiousness
on the street the light at the curb turns yellow
the slow moving car in front of the bus floors it to make the light
the bus driver sees his way is clear and steps on the gas
he turns and waves goodbye to lisa
she points at her head and then at him
he smiles not quite getting it
the light turns red
still looking at lisa the bus driver lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as
lisa sees the bus pass under the red light goldenrod revised page an upper west side woman s or s later identified as monica patterson holding some grocery bags steps
off the curb between two cars to cross broadway
the bus driver turns his head to look straight forward
pov bus driver monica is directly in front of him
pov monica the bus roars up at her
the bus driver slams on the brakes
pov lisa monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled tumbling underneath
pedestrians all over turn around
monica is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble
tracking lisa fast as she runs across the street toward the accident
as she gets closer she sees monicas leg sticking out from under the bus
then with some confusion she realizes that monica herself is right in front of her and that her blood is spreading everywhere
monica is reaching out vaguely unable to speak
she is making choking sounds
lisa stands over her for a second frozen
she crouches down and tries to do something but doesnt know what to do where to put her hands
other people start converging
in the bus the bus driver puts the bus in park opens the door and rushes out
we track him as he comes around to where a crowd has already formed
he hangs back on the outside but we break through till we find lisa kneeling next to the disoriented monica holding her hand
they are both covered in blood
several other people are shouting and talking all at once
somebody call an ambulance
call an ambulance
everyone calm down

the st man tries to pull her away
goldenrod revised page a she holds onto the dead womans hand and sobs
we see the bus driver standing just beyond it
a siren wails irrelevantly stuck in traffic
there are several cop cars now an ambulance a police barrier cops everywhere and a crowd of onlookers
lisa is giving a statement to detective mitchell
she is completely drenched in blood
her clothes boots everything
a few yards away the bus driver very shaken is giving his statement to another cop mos but also trying to hear what lisa is saying
lisa keeps looking over at him
i just want to ask you a couple of questions ok
now i want to ask you where you were and what you saw when the accident took place

lisa looks over at the bus driver
he looks back at her
i guess it was green
i didnt really see it
i think it was just an accident
behind the bus driver somebody moves from where they were and lisa gets a clear view of the womans covered body
lisa is being walked home by a big young cop
you go to school around here
whats that a private school

curtis watching tv looks up as lisa comes passes through the room
curtis sees she is covered in blood
what happened to you
nothing i saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus
she goes down the hall and into her room
joan her mother s appears from the kitchen
the room feels small and distorted
she starts to take off her blood soaked jacket but her purse is over her shoulder
she drops the purse and takes off the jacket
she doesnt know what to do with it
she hangs it on the closet door
she sits on the bed and then gets up and looks at where she sat
theres an imprint of blood on the white bedspread
good one lisa
she starts breathing heavily
she goes into her bathroom she kneels down next to the toilet and opens it
she throws up into the toilet
joan knocks on the door
just a second
joan comes into the bathroom
just a second
she throws up again
oh my god what happened to you
its ok mom its not my blood
what do you mean
whose blood is it
joan kneels down and tries to help her
lisa screams and puts her arms around her mother and cries
lisa is putting on a bathrobe
her hair and body are still matted and streaked with blood
joan is picking up the bloody clothes and boots
i dont know if im going to be able to get these clean again
just throw them out
let me see if i can get them clean
just throw them out
lisa stands under the faucet letting the water take the blood out of her hair and hands
she looks very young and little in the shower little feet and face
we hear the shower
joan scrubs at the bloody boots
joan lisa and curtis eat dinner
lisa has combed wet hair
she is very subdued
does anybody know who she was
i dont know
i guess she lived around here
she had all these fairway grocery bags
what did they do with her leg
i have no fucking idea
lisa is getting made up to go out
joan knocks and comes in

joan doesnt look so sure
darren under the marquee sees lisa and becky coming toward him
hes not happy to see becky

lisa darren and becky sit the light from the movie flickering on their faces
darren is mad
becky is enjoying their discomfiture
lisa is having trouble concentrating
she gets up and walks out
darren and becky look at each other not sure if she just went to the bathroom or left altogether
an upscale off broadway theater
the cast is taking a curtain call
joan the lead is in the middle
joan is taking her stage makeup off
theres a knock

a very well dressed ish interesting looking man is waiting in the middle of the room
this is ramon
he is watching joan across the room say good night to a group of friends and admirers

nd pink revised page she breaks away and crosses toward ramon
he speaks with colombian accent

joan sees lisa sitting across the room waiting
oh no thank you

she heads over to lisa as ramon heads for the stairs to leave the theater
i thought you were at the movies
it wasnt very good
i dont know
he sent me flowers
go out with him
ramon disappears up the stairs
joan and lisa look at each other
she kisses and hugs lisa squashing her a little
lisa gets a little tearful
joan squeezes her tighter
lisa is out with joan and some of the other actors from the show
they are laughing and having a good time
nd pink revised page a do shirley temple
joan does a very excellent shirley temple imitation
lisa laughs and smiles proudly
joan glances at lisa checking to see if this frivolity is really helpful or not such a good idea
at the door lisa is ready to go to school
joan in a bathrobe kisses her goodbye
i love you
i love you too
lisa goes out
we stay with joan who looks fretful
lisa walks down the street in slow motion
she passes through a gang of boys who hassle her as she goes by
still in slow motion she arrives at school
becky smoking outside sees her and approaches throwing away her cigarette as we resume normal camera speed
lisa sits in class dully
the class is reading paperbacks of king lear
the teacher john is a rather high strung slightly harsh enthusiast with glasses and a beard
matthew if you would read france
and anthony you read burgundy
with mock relish ah
and i guess im gonna hog the part of lear again
john is walking back and forth play in hand
the students are all reading along
most royal majesty i crave no more than hath your highness offerd nor will you tender less
right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is falln
lisa and darren sit in the diner eating club sandwiches
two neighborhood ladies s sit in a booth nearby
if you didnt want to go to the movies alone with me friday you could have just told me that
you didnt need to bring becky along as your bodyguard
i didnt bring her as a bodyguard
oh hes wonderful
he drives all the way to see her every saturday
then why did you
thats a long drive
i forgot i told becky i would do something with her neighborhood lady friday night so i invited you know he has three sisters
i didnt think the older ones dont speak
it was gonna sully our they havent spoken in four whole relationship
neighborhood lady what relationship
you dont say
neighborhood lady what are you muttering
oh that whole familys crazy
neighborhood lady nothing
ill try to fourteen years
improve my diction
pause whats the matter
and she has a little dog that lisa used to belong to the father nothing
very ugly face
but does she love that dog
when i saw that darren dog i says thats the ugliest something obviously is
dog i ever saw
she says good
nobodyll steal him
lisa everythings just fucked neighborhood lady up
whos gonna steal him
neighborhood lady like what
whos gonna steal him
neighborhood lady just everything
thats what i said
neighborhood lady but what specifically is whats the name of it
neighborhood lady lisa very low its called a bull terrier
no whats the name of the dog
the two ladies keep on talking
very low eyes down so
ive been thinking about your suggestion
i guess i dont think its a very good idea
i guess i dont feel that way about you
but those kinds of feelings can develop
i definitely feel like theres a connection there
i know there is
i just think youre scared
ithink youre scared of your own feelings
i think youve been hurt in the past by other guys and i think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you
she wipes her eyes because tears are running down her cheeks whats the matter
pause whats the matter
she wont look at him
audience applause takes us to joan and ramon are having a drink at a small table
my family are from colombia
father worked in the diplomatic service
nd pink revised page really
i grew up five years in panama four years in holland then nine years in paris
after i finish university i moved back to colombia
so when im speaking french they think im spanish
when im speaking spanish they think im french
and what do you do ramon
i have a company we design computer software to help companies in south american countries
that use an incompatible software so the computers cant talk to each other
its a big problem in central and south america where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications
so right now theres a big opportunity for us because for the big software companies its still in the backwoods
thats changing already but in the last ten years we have done extremely well
its the next ten years were going to see what happens
joan and ramon are leaving the restaurant can i give you a lift
oh no thank you im just gonna grab a cab but thank you
may i call you sometime
ok sure that would be great
may i have your telephone number
nd pink revised page a oh my god im sorry of course
hold on a minute do you have a pen
ramon takes out his cell phone
whats the number
joan lets herself in to the dark silent apartment
joan lies awake restless
she starts masturbating
she kicks off the covers and hikes her nightgown up
just as shes getting worked up theres a knock on the door and it partly opens
just a second
opening the door can i come in
just one second honey
covering herself up come in
lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed
can i talk to you
how was the show
it was ok
are you all right
i have to tell you something
a slow pan across the building
we pick out lisa talking to joan in one little window
they sit there
so what do you think i should do
it doesnt sound like it was anybodys fault
but dont you think i should say something to them now
i dont know sweetie
i mean that bus driver probably has a family to support he could probably lose his job
so i think you should really think about that before you say anything
you might end up feeling even worse
lisa was not expecting this response and doesnt like it
joan isnt sure what shes done wrong
think of the implications of what youre saying
angie a syrian american girl has her hand up
im saying what is the frame of reference for the average arab on the street
yeah my family is from syria
and i just want to say that americans have no idea how much people hate them all over the world
and all my relatives in syria think that what we did in afghanistan was terrorism
not to mention iraq
syria is a theocratic military dictatorship
um no its not sorry
syria is not a theocratic military dictatorship
um i think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually angie
no we dont
one at a time they blew up our city ok
so yeah i think we have a pretty good idea and personally i dont give a shit
there is some laughter from the class
nd blue revised page because the people who blew up the world trade center were a bunch of sick monsters oh they were monsters
because theyre arabs
no because they killed three thousand people for no reason
hey hey one at a time
maybe they think they had a reason
lisa hey hey hey
they didnt even have any demands
angie they just wanted to kill why did we drop bombs people
on innocent people in afghanistan
were still what do you think we doing it
why did we shouldve have done
the class becky on were they dont care about because they declared war civilian casualties
and on us angie
iraq has nothing to do with afghanistan
it has to do with angie oil
no they didnt
iraq didnt declare war on lewis anybody
they didnt co come on guys one at a time
anything to us
they did have a reason
they want to establish a medieval islamic caliphat in the middle east and destroy western civilization
oh where did you read that
nd blue revised page a its on their website
okay forget it
go ahead with what you were saying
why should i
green revised page but why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people
why are you defending a country that unilaterally invaded two muslim countries and supports the israeli occupation of palestine
the class roars
oh give me a break
and drops bombs on women and children and then calls other people terrorists for doing the exact same thing
ok ok because its not same thing
yes it is
yeah i just want to ask like why is ok to drop bombs on men but its not ok to drop bombs on women and children
isnt that just reverse sexism
i dont know
thats an interesting point
i agree its a bullshit term
this is totally stupid
looking for hands uhhhhhh
yeah i think this whole class should apologize to angie because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in syria think about the fact that we
bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture thank you
nd blue revised page and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the ku klux klan
they are the ku klux klan
they like to throw acid in womens faces
why dont you drop bombs afghanies
then why dont you drop bombs on the ku klux klan
lisa because theyre white
do you wish they were lionel still there
theres six people with their hands raised before anthony you lisa
the correct term is afghans
but im not even saying i disagree with you
im only saying i think its pathetic the way people in this class treated angie just for saying something they dont agree with
because thats censorship right
a joke right on
its not censorship
this class is not the angie government
thats not technically lewis true
oh my god no its not
lisa is sitting in the living room ready to go out
joan enters coat on purse in hand
joan and lisa go into the station
mitchell walks joan and lisa into the interview room
we actually work outta highway one
up in the bronx
so for somethin like this we just borrow a local precinct
lisa and joan sit with mitchell
would you say you had a clear line of vision
ok just describe what you saw to me in your own words
lisa glances at joan
joan smiles at her encouragingly
she just stepped out in the street
wide a shabby bungalow house off route in santa monica
the phone is ringing inside
he is ish with longish hair
new yorker who never quite calmed down
we cut between them
how are you
im looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean
doing a little work

no i was actually really thinking about doing that
so hows everything going
im kind of fucking up in geometry
but my teachers really cool
so i guess its not too serious
math was never my strong suit either
well i am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard how are you
things are picking up a little bit which is good
hows the boyfriend situation
oh the same
theyre all kind of the same
well next time you come out here ill try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment
thanks dad i dont really go for the california type
well i dont either per se
it somewhat depends on who it is obviously
hard to argue with
i think ill stop generalizing now
well thats about all on my end babe
ill give you a call in a week or two
give my love to curtis and say hello to your mom
ok i cant wait for our trip
i think were gonna have a really good time
well i love you
its gonna be really fun
um love you too
karl steps onto his deck
we hear the route traffic o
lisa lies on the bed next to the hung up phone
joan is on stage with fellow actor victor
two years of college
two years at the magazine
two years with you
bursts into tears im kind of a two year gal
in the laughing audience lisa watches unamused
joan and lisa sit silently in the rattling cab
what did you think of the play
it was ok
well thank you honey
what do you want me to say
joan i thought it was ok
you said it
next time ill lie
dont come next time
paul a droll handsome senior is holding court feet up on a desk an unlit cigarette in his hand
yeah like i would be in a movie only i would be doing exactly what im doing right now like id be sitting here smoking a cigarette and id have
my feet up on
the desk but the camera would be on me and id just be acting except i wouldnt do anything differently from how im doing it right now
nearby becky and lisa are looking at a poster for guys and dolls
it says only weeks before this earth shattering i still dont get why you didnt even audition
youre such a good singer
i still might do lights or something
but im not gonna make a fuckin ass out of myself parading around in a play so i can ask everyone how great i was for three years afterwards like
my fuck ass mother
everyone is smoking
lisa is holding forth to some girls
did i tell you guys i saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus
are you kidding
check out my boots
oh my god
where were you
what did you see etc
becky looks at lisa surprised and hurt that this is the first shes hearing about this
joan is at a table with ramon again
you do know i have two kids right
id like to meet them
you are really smooth
i would love to meet your kids
i have two boys myself
im not smooth
pause would you like to have a nightcap
becky and lisa are smoking pot
they are dolled up
are you aware that things have gotten to the point where i now have to hear things about you from other people and i cant even correct them because i
no longer have any first hand information about you myself
what are you talking about
i just feel like we used to be really close like up until a few days ago
and im not really getting that from you anymore
give me a break
i cant believe you just said that to me
that was really hard for me to say and thats you response
can we just go please
would you like to smoke any more of my pot before we leave or have you had as much as you want now
oh id like to have a little bit more please
get fuckin out of my house
but this is totally stupid because were both going to the same party
the door opens and we catch a glimpse of a big party in a brownstone full of circulating kids
lisa and paul cram into the bathroom and shut the door again
a moment later she is sitting on the toilet
he is on the hamper unscrewing a small vial of coke
its very hard to be cool under these circumstances
you dont have to be cool
all youhaveto do is snort it up your nose
he gives her the spoon
she snorts it
and then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical
she snorts some up the other nostril
paul does some too and closes the vial
you are so funny
pause so what do we do now
now we make out
what about your girlfriend
it just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend
oh never mind
they make out
he immediately starts feeling her up
she pushes his hand away
youre not serious
he moves his hand back
she lets him
lisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace
she sees darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of a dark hallway
she walks over to him and crouches down
you know i really love you right
she kisses him softly and they make out for a minute
i guess im not very consistent
i dont mind
he kisses her again
she draws back slightly
i gotta go home
joan sits on the toilet seat naked smoking hair tousled a little overexcited
are you all right
be out in a sec
she gets up flushes the cigarette looks in the mirror tousles her hair snaps off the light and opens the door
last students file out except lisa
aaron is erasing the blackboard
are you still mad at me about the test
whats going on lisa
lisa and mr aaron sit at his desk
because maybe my mother is right and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is
and im just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience and then ends up ruining somebodys life when im the one who
was distracting him in the first place
what does your being rich have to do with anything
you know what i mean
no i dont
oh my god i dont mean literally rich
my dad makes like one bad tv commercial like every two years and my mom lives from like voice over to voice over
i mean rich compared to the bus driver
but i still dont see what any of that has to do with what you do or dont want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed
nothing i guess
when youre raised to be a knee jerk liberal you tend to think about these things
lionel and a girl open the door
its gonna be five minutes
i just thought youd want to know theres like a lot of people out here and its getting kind of hard to breathe
you better close that door now lionel
lionel closes the door
all right i have to let those guys in
i dont want to leave you hanging
if youre really hurtin
we could get a cup of coffee after school
id do that
mr aaron sighs a little
through a window we see mr aaron and lisa talking mos
lisa is watching tv
joan comes in dressed for the opera
does this make me look fat
um a little
well theres nothing i can do about it
where are you going
why are you going to the opera
it turns out hes a really big opera fan
anyway dont you think its kind of fun
we should all go sometime
uh no thanks
i bet youd like it
i dont like that kind of singing
but you like classical music
but i dont like opera singing
but when have you ever its like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be
i dont really find that all that interesting
i know what you mean
but its not all like that
you like the magic flute
i guess im wrong
i guess i do like opera singing
i just didnt realize it
what is the matter with you
nothing at all
why are you pushing this
i dont want to go to the opera
its called an invitation
im not pushing anything
all you have say is no thanks
and then you were like why not
so then i told you and then you started like debating me
like you assume ive never thought this through for myself
which i have
ok well that was a really contemptuous assumption on my part
i dont actually like the opera that much myself
but im trying to expand my mind
maybe thats wrong
pause im sorry
i guess im a little nervous about you guys meeting ramon
whats the big deal
why are you so influenced by what me and curtis think
what curtis and i think
because obviously if im seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you
why wouldnt i be nervous about that
i guess you would
why does everything i say annoy you
jesus christ im just sitting here
here you be me and say anything and ill respond the way youve been responding to me this whole conversation
go ahead say something to lisa me and ill say something no
im not gonna do to you the way you say that
everything to me why not
because its dumb
i get your point
ok uh whatever
was that supposed to be an imitation of me
um ok withdrawn
well for someone whos supposed to be a professional actress thats a pretty lame ass impersonation of someone in your own family
lisa shakes her head and watches the tv
are you coming to my opening night
i will if i have to
youre a little cunt do you know that
youre a big cunt
lets not start talking to each other that way
you just called me a cunt mom
ok im sorry i said that
lisa but if youre really why
if youre really saying youre not aware that youve been really annoyed with me or really irritable with me and it doesnt matter if i express it exactly accurately you
know what im trying to say
if youre saying youre completely unaware of that then i have to say i dont think youre being honest about it
now maybe im doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it but i have a show opening in two weeks im very nervous about it im seeing
a new person and im obviously anxious about you and curtis liking him whether you think i should be or not
you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident youre going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father oh my god
which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me
and on top of everything else lisa ever since i told you about ramon youve been treating me like im insane
um i think youre exaggerating slightly
now what am i supposed to do
what am i supposed to do
just stop whining about everything
it doesnt matter
norte of that matters at all
youve been in a million plays you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play i dont frankly give a shit
about ramon or who youre going out with this week i never go out with anyone
lisa dont talk to me that way
i dont care
ive barely had a date in the last two years
but i dont care about any of this
it doesnt matter
your boyfriend doesnt matter
your play doesnt matter except to you
i dont care about new mexico because to tell you the truth im probably not even going what do you mean
and you want to know something else mom
there are more important problems in the world than our relationship
theres a whole city out there full of people who are dying
so who cares if i like your fucking boyfriend
its so trivial
why are you bothering me about all this
it doesnt matter
the intercom buzzer buzzes
well should i have him come up now
or should i have him wait downstairs
do whatever you want
i dont care
i dont even know what were talking about
i know you dont
thats the problem
oh give me a break
ramon and joan walk toward the metropolitan opera house
everything is all right
im so excited to be going to the opera
i dont think ive really gone more than one or two times
well i wish it wasnt norma but its still fun to go
what if we just went to see something else instead
you dont want to hear norma
no i dont mean that
i just meant wouldnt it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events like if we just went to see the daniel goldfarb play instead
i think you will enjoy this
joan and ramon sit in the audience listening to norma
joan leans in toward ramon and whispers its beautiful
smiling at her shhh
lisa dials a phone number off a slip of paper
the line rings
we cut between them
answering the phone yo
goldenrod revised page hey
its lisa cohen
yeah hows it going
pause what have you been up to
seeing some questionable movies
not deciding where to go to college
i was just thinking
this is gonna sound really queer but
by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like take away my virginity
god im so flattered
to what do i owe this inconceivable honor
actually its because of my deep passionate feelings for you paul
thats pretty much what i figured
pause so do you want to come over here
should i come over there
well my mom just went out for the evening
except my little brothers getting dropped off at some point come to think of it so im actually supposed to be here when he gets home
pause do you want to give me your address
blushing almost to death its west th street
green revised page darren lies on his bed depressed
he dials the phone
on the phone hello
what are you up to
writing my king lear paper
ive just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before
well i dont want to fail humanities
youre not gonna fail humanities
no probably not
so what did you do tonight
i dont really feel like talking right now
ill talk to you later
green revised page a bye
darren hangs up and starts crying
lisa dressed up a little and wearing some makeup opens the door for paul
hes not dressed up at all
hey come in
she steps aside
he passes her and comes in
i think i just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator
what did they say
she basically said there was no smoking in the elevator
tracking them as they come into the living room
so this is the living room
we like it
my mom hasnt read any of these books by the way
some of them
not all of them
paul looks at the rise and fall of the third reich
this book is a very cool book
yeah i think the third reich may be a little bit too much for me right now
its pretty hard to put down once you get started
do you want anything to drink
id take a beer
lisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers
ok i have no idea where the bottle opener is
here lemme have them
he takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter
he makes two marks in the counter doing this
i think i just permanently damaged your kitchen counter
oh thats ok
dont worry about it
wont your mother be upset
how come everything you say always sounds so ironic
you dont even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like totally ironic and funny
its just a gift
she laughs nervously
they drink beer
do you want to see my room
they come into her room
she closes the door
this is my room
she realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed
and these are my stuffed animals
always important to meet the stuffed animals
these are some drawings i did
not that i should be showing them to you because i know youre like a really good artist right
i would like to be a really good artist
at this point i think it would be more accurate to say im good at drawing
yeah i just do it for fun
but ive always really liked it
he looks at her pictures
can i ask you a question
this is probably gonna sound very immature but how can you be so relaxed knowing what were about to do
or is it just like no big deal to you
pause ok that was a really stupid question and im like totally embarrassed right now
im actually more embarrassed than ive ever been in my life
if you want to go home now thats totally easy there
dont be embarrassed
its basically like the worlds greatest activity but its not actually worth getting nervous about
yeah i dont usually get nervous because i think its worth it i usually get nervous because i cant help the way i feel
although i do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about its this
but maybe thats just really idealistic of me
there is that philosophy
you are so funny
do you have an ashtray
oh you can just chuck it out the window
paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette
he closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her
are we starting
i was thinking about it yeah
and am i being really dorky right now
youre not suave
i guess im a little nervous
dont be nervous
i promise this is gonna be a great experience for you
youre gonna have like four five hundred orgasms at least
he kisses her
they make out
ok lets talk about your kissing
its just a technical thing
lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame
what are you like the nicest guy in the world
their clothes are off but we dont see much
she is giving him a handjob
not quite but close enough yes
in i supposed to go really fast at the end or something
yeah but were gonna move on before he shifts around and tries to go down on her
you dont have to do that
i want to
she slides up away from him
dont do that ok
im just embarrassed
let me do it to you
he is positioning himself on top of her
are you ready
this is a little tricky its probably gonna hurt a little at first but then its gonna get better
just be patient
there are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or its not gonna happen
ok you sound insane
ok hang on
ok there we go
does it hurt now
kind of yeah
ok just try to relax
itll get better in a second
did you bring a condom
shouldnt you put it on
i will in a second
this is really kind of hurting
ok one second
i love you
ok hold on shit what
ok one second ohh
sorry sorry he comes inside her
he carefully rolls over
sorry about that
kind of got away from me
did any of it get inside me
i dont know
it definitely did
honest to god
its probably ok
the odds are overwhelmingly that its ok
the doorbell rings
thats my little brother
she gets a bathrobe and goes out
we track her through the whole apartment
she opens the door for curtis
we track her back to her room
she shuts the door
paul has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette
sits down can i have a drag
takes a drag of his cigarette thanks
gives it back to him im actually kind of mad at you
pause because we didnt use birth control
i guess so
it was at the ready
well i dont really want to get aids you know
and i really dont want to have an abortion because i know when you have one at my age it can be really hard to get pregnant later on and
i definitely want to have children some day
didnt you ever hear of the morning after the guy came too fast pill
oh the im a total fucking moron pill
thats the canadian name
i prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if i can avoid it
im sure its fine
try to listen to me
right about now is when youre traditionally supposed to freak out
so why dont you just not
youre not gonna get aids because i dont have aids how do you know
have you been tested
no but im pretty sure i dont have it because of my demographic
and the odds are youre probably not gonna have to have an abortion either
and since this was your first time it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one
im not completely in control of my emotions
thank you for deflowering me
did it freak you out that i said i love you
it didnt freak me out
you dont have to say it back because i know you probably have like no feelings at all for me
i think i just proved i have some feelings for you
you should probably go now
lisa walks paul past curtis who is practicing the piano
thats my brother
lisa walks paul to the front door
she changes into her pajamas
she washes her face and brushes her teeth
she comes out and settles down next to curtis to watch tv
the audience applauds the opera cast thunderously
near joan and ramon a male opera enthusiast is standing
joan and ramon walk arm in arm away from lincoln center
oh i loved it
it was so exciting
we should go again
but how about those people yelling bravi
how do you mean
its just so pretentious
why cant they just say bravo
well its the plural
i know its the plural of bravo
its what they say to acknowledge the ensemble
no i know i know its correct it just dont you think there was something a little pretentious about those people
i dont mean they didnt really enjoy it
but you know how you can really be enjoying something but youre also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye because you know people are watching
you enjoy it
does that make sense at all
yes but i wouldnt say that it was pretentious
in italian you say bravo for a man and brava for a woman and bravi for the whole company
ok i see what you mean
you use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer
anyway i really enjoyed it
well have to go again
it was so glamorous
lisa is on a headset
below on the stage matthew is singing to a girl
my time of day is the dark time
cue thirty six go
ok hold up a second
ok were gonna do that one more time please
lets back it up please
why are we stopping
all the kids in the show are sitting more or less in a circle
gary the theater teacher s has the floor
now i know theres been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room
but i wanna tell you something youve worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit i know has been going on around
now ill bet you theres not one person working on this show who hasnt got somebody they want to say something to including me
so im gonna start
by matthew i assume you mean me
i mean you
matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle
you are probably one of the most talented kids whos ever performed at this school
but youre too goddamn lazy you think you can just waltz through this part and its pissing me off
because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines
so youd like me to memorize them
yes id like you to memorize them
brightly your turn
but im not mad at anyone
i just want everyone to think im a great guy
becky and lisa are in the circle both crying
but im jealous of you
why would you be jealous of me
because of everything
cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money and your parents are still together and im really jealous of your other friends
well im really sorry if i hurt you
they embrace tearfully
many of the kids are moved
some are not
becky leaves lisa in the circle
lisa wipes her eyes
darren unglues himself from his perch on a table and sits in the circle with her
i know that im not who you want me to be to you
and i know how much ive hurt you
but i still cant believe it means we cant be friends anymore
so much has been happening to me this semester i know
and its like i cant even talk to you about it because i hurt you so bad
yes you can
of course you can
you can talk to me about anything
i dont love anybody more than you
youre practically my best friend
i love you too
i really do
they hug and cry
leslie raises her hand
can i just say i think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing and if we could all just work together instead of
being at each other all the time i think we could all just be incredible
everyone applauds except angie who raises her hand
green revised page yeah
long pause yeah
im gonna say it
i feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room
im not saying im not gonna do my job but for some reason a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about
and i think i speak for a lot of the techies when i say that i feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over
and i dont know if i can get over it
nobody says anything
paul raises a hand
his pretty girlfriend is seated next to him
yeah im just playing in the band you know
this is hicrh school
i dont really feel a strong need to like all be on the same team with everybody
i just want to come to rehearsals do the show go up on the roof and smoke some pot and then like go on home
i dont really wanna cry and hug anybody
there are laughs and some cheers
oh you wanna hug me a little dont you paul
ok gary man ill give you a little hug
no kissin though
gary charges over and hugs paul
everyone laughs and claps
gary grabs pauls face and kisses him on the cheek
everyone is laughing
lisa looks at paul who settles back with his girlfriend
he sees lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute
lisa catches darrens eye
he is looking at her with the unwelcome gaze of love
she looks away
his heart hardens against her
lisa is at the breakfast table looking through a stack of back issues of the new york times
she finds the item she accident
monica patterson a long time upper west sider was struck by and killed by a city bus friday afternoon on broadway
the bus driver gerald maretti was not at fault police said
lisa is on the phone
curtis is watching tv
hi my name is lisa cohen
i was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago
yeah hi lisa what can i do for you
well this is probably gonna sound a little weird but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that womans family
im obviously probably too late to go to the funeral but i really wanted to send some flowers or something
yeah i can or is that like classified information
familys been notified
lemme see what i got
she mentioned she had a daughter
ok i dont have anything for a daughter
the only contact i have is a cousin abigail berwitz
i got a number in arizona
so did you have the trial or whatever
or did you make the did they have a ruling yet
it was uh no criminality found
thats a great system you got
lisa is on the phone
yes im trying to reach abigail berwitz
this is abigail
hi my name is lisa cohen
you dont know me
i was actually calling about your cousin monica patterson
i was actually there when she had during the accident
i didnt know her but i was the one who was with her when she died
i was sort of holding her hand at the time
what can i do for you
well ummm i saw her obituary in the paper but i didnt see anything about a funeral
i assume they had one because no
as far as i know theyre doing something or other next week
but im sorry and i was also wondering she said something about her daughter
her daughter she wanted someone no hers daughters to get ahold of her
not alive she im sorry passed away quite a long time ago
oh my god
was she sick
or was she had leukemia
oh my gosh
and do you mind if i ask was her name lisa
ok see that explains it
see i think she thought could i just interrupt
how did you get this number
oh the police i asked the accident investigating investigator who to contact if i wanted to well they really shouldnt be giving out my number
blurts out this is harassment
im not trying to harass i have been getting calls about this for three weeks
one of monicas neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden i am the focal point for all these arrangements
and i gotta tell you people i didnt have any kind of relationship with monica whatsoever unless you want to count the fact that she held up my childrens inheritance
for fifteen years
i guess were just supposed to forget about all that now
and i am more than willing
but the perso n you should be calling is emily morrison who was monicas friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in new york
but it has nothing to do with me
i didnt really know who to now i can give you her number but i would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop
can you hold on while i get a pen
yes all right
emily morrison s is on the phone in her upper west side apartment
shes on the phone with lisa
i guess it would be all right
its only going to be a few close friends and some clients i imagine
oh so was she a lawyer
she was a social worker
she used to be anyway
she had several careers
were you really good friends with her
yes i was
joan is reading audition sides
lisa passes through dressed somberly
where you going sweetie
im going to that womans funeral
are you sure you dont want me to come
i dont even know her
i would be coming for you
emily opens the door for lisa
in the b
about thirty people are gathered
a mix of upper west siders social workers and monicas multi ethnic clients
are you lisa
thank you so much for letting me come
why dont you come on in
were about to start
do you want anything to drink
oh um no thanks
we have bad hors doeuvres and good hors doeuvres
oh thats quite all right thank you
everyone is seated on emilys chairs and borrowed chairs
well thank you all for coming
thank you for doing this emily
yes thank you emily
as you all know monica was not a religious woman
anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions
so harry and elise and i when we were talking about this decided we would just have everyone over and let
anyone who wanted to
about monica just talk about her
maybe share some remembrances of her
some of us know each other some of us dont
but were all here because we loved monica
gets a hold of herself and because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her
everyone laughs slightly
i dont want to tell anyone what to think or how to feel
and i dont want to kid myself about the stupid meaningless way she died because it would really make her throw up
but i dont want it to become the summation of her life
because its not
when her lisa died i said to her how can you stand it
and she said
first of all i cant
but i dont want to take away the twelve years she did have and turn them all into leukemia
because they werent
so despite the fact that she got ripped off i do think its important to remember that monica got a lot out of life
she was the most fully developed person i personally have ever known
she was also impossible to get along with but thats another story
as most of you know she had more than her share of trouble over the years
but that never diminished her compassion or stopped her from embracing life to the absolute fullest measure
she sure did
now ive said my little piece
and now i want to talk a little bit about the first time we met
she was twenty one
emily stops so as not to cry
there is a long charged silence
its ok emily
she waits and i was nineteen
even though its impossible for my children to believe i
was ever that young
emilys college age kids a boy and a girl smile warmly at her from across the room
everyone is milling around
lisa is talking to emily
emily thank you so much for letting me be here
dont be silly honey
you were sweet to come by
didnt she have any family
no she was the last one
except for some cousins in arizona
you talked to abigail
shes the one who gave you my number
well shes a living nightmare
they never got along at all
good bye emily
thank you so much for doing this
emily and the woman mourner hug each other goodbye
i still cant believe this is happening
she starts crying i mean what the fuck is wrong with her
i dont know
i dont understand why she didnt kill herself when lisa died
and then barry and then after all that with her mother and then her father she gets hit by a fucking bus
its like a joke
but thats monica
always the worst luck
noticing lisa ok sweetheart
thank you for coming
please dont stand there staring at me ok
startled embarrassed im sorry
i just wanted to say goodbye
thank you for coming
youre very sweet
to woman mourner goodbye
as lisa goes out she hears who is that
thats a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident
she was right there when she died and she wanted to come to the funeral
i told her there was no funeral but she wanted to come anyway
i wouldnt have done that at her age would you
lisa is on the phone
the times article about the accident is on her bed
we hear curtis practicing his scales
no m a r e t t i
what about brooklyn
she writes down the number and hangs up
looks at the number
dials the phone
it rings once
she hangs up
lisa is very disengaged from the discussion
john is walking back and forth reading aloud from king lear
we are to the gods as flies to wanton boys
they kill us for their sport
pause we are to the gods as flies to wanton boys
they kill us for their sport
what do you make of that
i dont know
take a stab
what do you think shakespeare is saying about human suffering here
i dont know
you know what lisa
thats not good enough
thats not good enough
shakespeare wrote something whats your response
and dont tell me you dont have one because i dont buy it
i dont really have a lot to say
it seems pretty self evident to me
i think it is self evident
i think hes saying that human beings dont mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun
green revised page like as far as the gods are concerned were just ants
like a newscaster turning to his colleague darren
the class laughs
responding in kind thank you matthew
yeah i agree
only its not shakespeare saying it its gloucester
maybe another character would have a different point of view
ok thats a valid point
just because shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesnt mean he personally agrees with it
yeah maybe shakespeare isnt saying the gods dont care about us
maybe hes saying theres a higher consciousness that we cant see
that the gods perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception our perceptions are like comparing flies to ok
i dont think thats what hes getting at
i think what hes getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering
but maybe hes not
maybe hes comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness and hes saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary thats just because were limited by
well lets look at the text
lets test davids hypothesis
we are to the gods as flies to wanton boys
they kill us for their sport
i have to agree with matthew that seems pretty unambiguous
yeah because hes saying theres a higher purpose that we cant see
hes saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isnt developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us
nd blue revised page ok but i still dont think thats what hes trying to say
no like if you say they kill us for their sport when our perception of the gods is so meager that we cant even tell what theyre doing then how
can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport
i dont know
i dont think thats what hes saying at all
i think hes saying the gods dont give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun yes
much like flies to wanton boys
but if the gods consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them then how can we be sure what they have in mind
for us or why they do anything
david i think youve made your point
but its not what shakespeare meant
scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that hes trying to say something about human suffering here scholarly opinion
and in this particular play what i think hes trying to say is pretty black pretty bleak but what are you saying
a thousand frenchmen cant be wrong
nd blue revised page no im not saying that
but i would like to move on i think he is saying that because hes comparing human consciousness to flies and hes saying that we cant see the truth around
us because our consciousness is undeveloped
no david thats not what shakespeare meant
he says it somewhere else in the play but i dont want to get hung up on this any more because its not what shakespeare meant and i would really
like to move on
david laughs derisively
lisa is on the phone with karl
we cut between them
hows everything been going
how are you
not too bad
im sitting here listening to some music
having a glass of delicious beer
that sounds pleasant
how are you
hows the boyfriend situation
theres this one guy i sort of had something going with
but he kind of has a girlfriend so
nd blue revised page a i realize im incredibly enthralling
youre a beautiful girl
and youve got brains
that makes you dangerous
dont forget mature
well im hoping youre not too mature
that was a good answer
anyway i do think its a pretty long standing relationship
ok then you know what
you do nothing
you do absolutely nothing
and one of two things will happen
either hes gonna start doing back flips to get your attention or youre gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesnt do back flips hes not gonna
get your attention
well i think he already knows i like him
i think i might have spilled the beans on that one a little thats ok
because now if now you stop acknowledging him you just suddenly give him nothing hes gonna go berserk
unless hes just not interested
in which case you gotta take your lumps
which is tough
well thanks dad
ill be sure to try out the technique next time i see him
lemme know what happens
well everythings ok here
a little actually dad
i definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute but i actually have something kind of serious i want to ask you about
im kind of soliciting people i respect for their views on this
wider through the glass doors of karls bungalow as he listens to the story
so do you think i should go back to the police or what
ok well first of all im very glad you told me
second of all i think you should let me call my friend whos a lawyer just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be
you mean to protect myself before i go back

lisa puts a new cowboy hat in her luggage
she tries to zip the bag but it wont zip

joan starts coughing
blood starts coming out with every cough first a little then a gruesome amount lisa wakes up breathing hard short breaths
the room is dark and quiet
she calms down and gets up
yellow revised page she comes in without turning on the light
she turns on the faucet
in the dim bathroom the water looks strangely dark
she switches on the light blood is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin
she looks up
monica the dead woman is standing behind her in the mirror
lisa jumps lisa wakes up sharply breathing hard drenched in sweat
she dials marettis number
she hangs up
lisa rides the subway past brooklyn stations
lisa emerges from the subway station
the verrazano narrows bridge dominates the background
lisa turns the unfamiliar corner
little kids play in the street
she checks the address on the piece of paper
she rings the doorbell
inside she hears kids playing
the door opens
its mrs maretti around

lisa follows mrs maretti into the small apartment
we hear two small boys running around and shouting

mrs maretti goes over and speaks to him low
he sees lisa and slowly gets up
im really sorry to bother you

lisa latches the door of the cluttered little bathroom
she sits on the toilet and tries to pee
after a minute a tiny amount of pee comes out
lisa comes out
the marettis are waiting for her as before
we hear the boys yelling at each other
maretti mrs maretti and lisa come out
to mrs maretti honey just do me a favor wait inside

yellow revised page no its not ok

lisa looks at them wishing mrs maretti would leave
i hope this isnt going to insult you too much
i was just wondering if you felt bad at all about what happened

im upset about the accident
im very upset about the accident
i was covered in blood
ive never been covered in blood before and i wanted to talk to you about it for a minute

so whynt you calm down
look go ahead inside
let me find out what this is
meantime whynt you make sure those kids arent killin each other all right
yellow revised page a as mrs maretti goes inside no you know what
let em kill each other
give us all a rest
to lisa all right lisa
yellow revised page i just
well i just want you to know
you probably already know obviously that i told the police on the police report that i thought the whole thing was an accident
because it was an accident
well i mean i know you didnt do it on purpose
but it wasnt like
we were looking at each other
who was looking at each other
you and me
romantically or anything
ok scratch that
cause thats not even
youre not comin through very clearly
i can see the way this is
the way what is
speak to me
yellow revised page a i am dont drag me outta my house on a saturday afternoon and then make me stand here pullin teeth to find out what youre talkin
yellow revised page ive got my kids inside youre an attractive young lady you show up at the house please
get to the point or go home
because i dont care enough frankly to stand around here tryin to figure out what youre doin here
the way i remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat yes its my cowboy hat that i wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus yes
i was probably wearing my cowboy hat yes
if you could just let me
from my point of view i was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat so i was waving at you becase i was looking for one
and you were kind of waving back
and i know the police already decided it was no fault or no criminality or whatever they call it no criminality thats right
i guess partly because of what i told them
and i know i was distracting you but i did see the bus go through the red light
and thats when it hit that woman
im gettin a little confused over here
only nobody said that to them
and i just wanted to like acknowledge with you that thats what happened
first of all i dont really know what you mean by wavin at you
what were you tryin to catch the bus
but i wanted to ask about your yellow revised page a maybe i was wavin at you like wavin to say you know step away from the bus if the
bus was in motion i wouldve waved you away for your own safety but thats all that would be
yellow revised page you dont remember looking at me and waving at me
maretti comes out again
i think we both remember something different
your brothers on the phone
tell him ill call him back
mrs maretti goes back inside
im not trying to get you in trouble
i know youre not because you couldnt get me in trouble
uhhhh theres no criminality found
the report is uh final
and thats it
so youre just gonna leave it
im gonna leave it because thats all that it was
if something else would have happened id take it to whatever that was
it was tragic it was a tragedy
but theres only a certain speed the brakes can react
thats a physical limitation of the machine
i dont know what else to tell you
it was a shock
but thats it
cant bring her back
cannot bring her back
im not talking about bringing her back
im talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened
but you already talked to them
yellow revised page i know that
but i lied
and i can understand if you dont want to get in trouble but
then how come nobody else saw it
i cant help what other people saw you would think somebody else would see it
i just know what i saw
then why didnt you say something right then
because when they were asking me what happened it seemed like you were kind of looking at me like we were saying to each other lets not say anything about
oh now i really dont know what youre talkin about
i cant prove that you were doing that mrs maretti comes back outside
what did i say anything to you
did i threaten you
and i am not blaming you for any of this
all im saying is that i didnt really tell the cops what happened and i didnt want to go back without but you told em what you saw
you told em what you saw
and so did i
only im the one behind the wheel
yellow revised page gerry
take it easy
to mrs maretti no its all right
leave it alone
to lisa you wanna ruin my life start tellin em about looks and you waved at me and i had on my cowboy hat go ahead
youre gonna go back to school and do your homework and im gonna lose my job
and whos gonna feed my kids
are you gonna do it
and for what
and theres nothin i can do to bring her back
i just want to say what really happened
hey do whatever you fuckin want
but those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin face because this was not my fault
it was both our fault
whatd you say
it was both our fault
maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen
dont say that to me
again without a lawyer
gimme your phone number
whats your number
gimme lisa your number
oh you wanna mjy
why do you want it
come to my house like some anonymous person i cant get in touch with you
mrs maretti whats your fuckin number gerry
take it easy
its um yellow revised page a hold on
writes yellow revised page
why do you need it
do whatever youre gonna do
i hope you got a good lawyer
i dont know why youre maretti turns and goes in the house
you know this was very traumatic for him
its almost as bad as getting your deg cut does your mother know youre here
cu on lisa as she rides back toward manhattan
emily sits with lisa at the kitchen table
why didnt you say anything before
i guess i was afraid
i didnt know what to do
a you didnt know what to do
the woman is killed right in front of you and you didnt know what to do
i know it doesnt sound very impressive
pause all right i know youre trying to do the right thing now
what does your mother say
my mother hasnt really been that helpful
what do you mean
i mean shes got a lot going on right now and she just hasnt been that interested i guess
what could she possibly have going on
her show is opening
what do you mean her show
shes in a play
my friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it and your mother cant be bothered because shes in a
well its kind of a big deal for her
she has a really big part
i dont know your mother but that is pretty shocking
i guess shes really worried about getting a bad review or something
im gonna talk to my friend whos a lawyer and im gonna call monicas cousin you talked to her and youre gonna go talk to the police
do you want meto go with you
do you think maybe you should ask your mother to go with you
i think i can handle this part myself
oh i am so angry
i am so angry
he didnt do it on purpose
im gonna run over his best friend and then coerce some teenage girl into lying to the police about it
he had his chance
now are you gonna see this through or not
i will if you will
emily impulsively and somewhat tearfully embraces lisa who is flooded with relief
joan waits in the wings
her cue light goes on and off
tracking her onstage as she enters
let me tell you something eliot she is interrupted by entrance applause
you want to fire me go ahead and fire me
only dont tiptoe around me like
some kind of deranged ballerina every time i see you in the fucking hall
now do you have anything to say to me eliot
um youre not fired
this gets a pretty big laugh from the audience
abashed friendly what are you guys talking about
another big laugh
in the audience lisa curtis and ramon sit together dressed up for opening night
ramon nudges lisa
shes good eh
grudging but proud yes
lisa is on the computer
joan is standing behind her
did you find it
just a minute
can we just forget it
if they were any good somebody would have called me last night
no we cant forget it because i cant take this anymore
what do you care what they say about you anyway
its just a lousy feeling
cant you understand that
if they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldnt like it
even if you didnt agree with it or base your self esteem on it
why cant you understand that
i do understand it because we have this conversation every time
youre great in the play youre a great actress everybody thinks youre great everything about you is great youre really really pretty oh shut up
so let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves ok
lisa finds the new york times review online
did you find it
green revised page yes
is it bad
let me read it
she reads ok its really good
oh my god
listen to this dont read it to me
but it is the frankly extraordinary joan kaplan who transforms the savage wit of david holmes acid comedy drama into something approaching sheer luminosity
but dont be misled by her feather light touch and expert comic timing
with the canny has trouble enunciating bray
of an actor at the joan top of craft ms
kaplan takes top of craft
us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking maddening and magical
this is the best review ive ever read
just for me or for everyone
green revised page a no he likes the play he likes the cast but the main thrust of it is basically what a genius you are and how your time
nd blue revised page fuck him what does he know
a la noel coward maddening and magical eh
if only i knew what that meant
oh my god youre a huge star
oh my god
can i make coffee now
thank you honey
lisa heads for the kitchen as the phone rings
here come the offers
picks up the phone hello
i know can you believe it
lisa is eating breakfast and listening intently to the radio
she hears joan talking on the phone o
when the seventeen year no lisa read it
no old palestinian was stopped i never read them unless by israeli police from boarding i know theres nothing a school bus yesterday carrying mean in them
victor forty pounds of explosive under i wish you wouldnt her jacket speak to me that way you know im top of craft
lisa closes the door or turns up the radio
john is reading from a paperback poetry anthology
on the blackboard it says th century poets gerard manley hopkins
slow push in on lisa
spring and fall to a young girl by gerard manley hopkins
margaret are you grieving over goldengrove unleaving
leaves like the things of man you with your fresh thoughts care for can you
ahl as the heart grows older it will come to such thoughts colder nd blue revised page a by and by nor spare a sigh though worlds of wanwood leafmeal
lie and yet you will weep and know why
now no matter child the name sorrow springs are the same
nor mouth had no nor mind expressed what heart heard of ghost guessed it is the blight man was born for it is margaret you mourn for
lisa looks up slowly
lisa gets out a taxi in front of the station
lisa walks up to the desk of a nd a
could i help you
is detective mitchell here
no hes not
um i talked to him on monday and he said hed be here after three
yeah hes not back yet
could i help you with something
um well do you know when do you expect him
whats this about
i was involved in an accident a few weeks uh huh
and i filled out a report with detective mitchell but wanted to amend the report so i thought i should what do you mean amend the report
how do you want to amend it
well there was something i didnt tell him and i wanted to tell him because so wait i dont understand
you wanna change your statement
i want to change my statement
well youd usually have to talk to the investigating detective on the case
thats why i asked to see detective mitchell
who said hed be here now
which hes not
you remember the case number
it was that woman monica patterson who got run over by the bus on broadway it was in a lot of the newspapers
ok yeah sure ok
sit down sit down
i you know the case is closed
i assume it was
but part of the reason its closed is because of my statement
and the statement i gave because of your statement
another male detective walks by behind lisa
the two men exchange a glance referring to lisa being a cute girl
what do you mean it was closed because of your statement
i mean the das office closes the case
you dont close the case
the das office closes the case
im sure it does
i obviously didnt mean i personally closed the case like legally
i meant that what i said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed because i was the whats your name honey
dont call me honey ok
are you not gonna help me now that i said that
look whats your name
ok lisa first thing youre gonna calm im calm right now
second thing oh
here he is your knight in shining armor
mitchell has just come in
lisa gets up
this guy been givin you a hard time
whats this guy been sayin to you
i dont know if you remember me
im lisa cohen
i called you on monday
sure i do
lisa sits across from mitchell
so now youre sayin he ran the light
he wasnt even looking at the road
and i was definitely trying to get his attention
no i get the picture
so youre flirtin with this guy hes wavin at you he runs the light hits the decedent she dies on the scene
the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements and then somewheres in there you turn around decide the guy belongs in jail
that about right
i dont have any control over if he goes to jail or not
i certainly have my hopes
i just want to set the record straight so that if he gets away with this i wont have been a part of it
and what do you think i should do with you
just gimmeaa clue
cause im just a little bit lost over here
do whatever you want
i know what i did
before we do anything lisa anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence
even if he kills someone
even if you cause an accidental death thats right
for this to be a criminal offense the law says you need two aggravating circumstances
like he ran a red light and he was speeding
or he ran a red light and he was on nd red so hes not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter
or second degree murder
he could be charged with reckless driving and fillip out a false police report
which thats no joke thats unbelievable
what does he have to do
kill her on purpose
because thats the definition of murder
killin somebody on purpose
youre not sayin he ran her over on purpose are you
all right look
lemme take another statement and uh
we look into it youre kidding
ill go over it with my sergeant probably pull this guy in again
put a little pressure on him
see what he says
lisa and her coed class watch bonnie the young tall beautiful no makeup gymnastics teacher
ok so were just gonna start with a couple of simple stretches
lisa notices the boys looking at bonnie
lisa and becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench
holding in smoke yeah because the central park conservatory or whatever its called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty looking fences all over the park
which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for
she exhales and hands becky the joint
we are totally gonna miss the game
oh my god its john
they try to hide the joint from john the english teacher who approaches them and stops
pause want some
come on guys
you cant be smokin a j
on your way to a school soccer game
now come on
were really sorry
john glares at them then turns and walks away
ok how about how hes like smokin a j
like you cant be smokin a j
they all burst out laughing
cu on the angry embarrassed back of johns reddening grown up neck as he keeps walking away
lisa walks through the park somewhat stoned enjoying the sunshine
she sees mr aaron approaching on a bike
he bikes up to her and stops
hi mr aaron
how are you lisa
im pretty damn good
how are you
im all right im all right tell me something
whatever happened with that situation
aim working on it
ill tell you all about it sometime
squinting at him in the sunshine hey what kind of a bike is that
um a trek
im supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over christmas break and i was just wondering does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle
as far as i know no it doesnt no
but you must have ridden a lot of horses
what makes you say so
arent you from texas or wyoming or someplace like that
someplace like what
you know not new york
im actually from indiana
but dont let me overwhelm you with superfluous details
god so what are you doing at a new york private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal jews
is that a real question or a lisa question
whats a lisa question
a question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer
about half and half
in that case before you go i am actually thinking of getting one of these
can i try it
just for one second
aaron gets off the bike
she climbs on
the seat is too high for her
you want me to adjust the seat
this actually feels really really good
god im kidding
you are so easy to tease
she bikes away awkwardly turns around and bikes back toward him wobbling badly
i like your bicycle
can i have it
she tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her
can i just ask you how is it possible that i am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever
its not like id ever say anything if you ever deigned to like you know be with me
i can tell you like me
its not like im a virgin if thats what youre worried about
im not even close
i cant even be having this conversation with you
yeah you keep saying that but i notice youre still standing here
youre absolutely right
he gets on the bike
its not my fault if i revere you as a god
he laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself
oh my god
i made you laugh
i am so happy right now
ill see you in class
we pull away with him as she watches him go
lisa walks in as joan is putting on her coat
where have you been
i didnt know
if you wanted dinner
oh no thanks
ill order something
someone named emily called
and detective mitchell called from the accident investigation squad
is that the one you talked to
yeah did he say anything
just to call him back
whats going on
did you ever go back and see him
id rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door
ill tell you later if thats ok
of course it is
shes the friend of the woman who died the one who had the funeral
oh yeah ok
well her numbers by the phone
i dont know
i mean i really like him
hes really nice
green revised page but im not sure he actually ever understands a word i say
give him a chance mom you just met the guy
but dont you know what i mean
i just feel kind of lonely when im with him
you feel lonely when youre with him
you never felt that way when you were with someone
i guess so
i feel that way all the time
you get used to it
i dont know how serious i want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way
so dont get serious
thats my advice
im gonna go
have a good show
calling goodbye curtis
curtis busy with his computer doesnt answer
back in the front hall joan shrugs it off
she hits the elevator button
sees her reflection in the little round elevator window
she looks old to herself and haggard
she touches under her chin
joan gets in
the door shuts
she leans her head against the wall and bursts into tears
the elevator stops with a ding
she wipes her eyes quickly
a woman neighbor comes in
congratulations on the show
that was such a wonderful review
and i read somewhere it might be going to broadway
yeah its going well
lisa emily and dave a good natured intelligent ish lawyer are at a window table
lisa dave is one of my best friends
hes a terrific lawyer and if he doesnt know what to do himself hell certainly know someone we can talk to
so dave just tell lisa everything you told me if you dont mind repeating not at all
i love to repeat myself
are you guys gonna order something
they are drinking coffee
when someone is killed its what you call a wrongful death suit which is a statutory case which just means theres a statute passed by the legislature which gives you
the right to bring the case
as opposed to what
as opposed to common law which is law made by judges
which is why the damages are limited
i dont understand
look just skip that part
we dont care about that
i thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy
no the police are not uh why not
they told me they dave doesnt think the were gonna look into it police are gonna again
im just telling you that even if they do there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the da that they charge this guy
thats why so what can we do
pink revised page thats ok thats ok honey
im just getting to that
you cant do anything unless youre a relative she didnt have any relatives except for those idiots in arizona or hang on a minute unless youre executor of her estate
i am the executor of her estate
which is emily
this is good
because the executor of the estate cdn bring a wrongful death suit but the beneficiary has to be a relative
so let me explain about that
in a wrongful death suit you can sue for pain and suffering pecuniary losses lose of support or services
and also whats called care comfort and society like advice counseling of the parent that the kids arent gonna get anymore
you can really sue for that
yeah and thats probably what we would do so i dont understand
who are we suing
the bus driver
well no because the bus driver wouldnt have any money
you basically sue everybody and hope something sticks
the person who pays will be the mtas insurance company
but do you think the driver would get fired
pink revised page a no
even if all the facts came out at the trial
i dont know
but how much could they be liable for
it depends how badly do you think we could ever hurt them
if she was alive in great pain for an extended period of time they give more money for that
id say she was alive for ten minutes
and i gather in a lot
her leg was cut off
and but was she conscious
awake the whole time
im sorry emily
to dave yeah awake
well if she was in a lot of pain for that long
i dont know
maybe or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict
a brain damaged baby would bea three million
but the truth is lisa after alls said and done its not a very good case
because its your word against his and because you already lied on your first deposition
a red light case is a fifty fifty proposition already
and with only one eyewitness with two conflicting statements
i wouldnt take that case
pink revised page nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here
i understand that we just want this prick to buffer
and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy
but no matter how you slice it the fact that lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer
cant i explain why i lied the first time
its not like im trying to get any money for myself
thats true since she have no financial interest she cant be impeached for bias
impeached for what
she cant have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows youre not getting any money if you win
so thatssomething isnt it
but do you really think we know what that means
thats what its called
but who are you talking to
you know we dont know what that means
its like youre not really concentrating
i dont know
i am concentrating
im just thinking out loud
i pink revised page a he wasnt always a lawyer you know
he used to be a very nice little boy
pink revised page anyway
the only thing i could think of is it i the mta
so theyre not gonna want a lot of publicity
anyway the whole point is to get this guy is to fucking get this guyl no its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus
did she know she was dying
i only ask because the terror of knowing youre dying raises the damages
i think she had a pretty good idea
if she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better
i know this sounds horrible but this is what it comes down to
we know dave
emily starts to speak i actually did have one more thought
i do know one guy whos uh
you know what
yo know what i want to do i want to make a few phone calls and then just let me get back to you
i would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened
lisa is on the kitchen phone
yes detective mitchell please
my name is lisa cohen
c h yes ill hold
on hold fuck you
pink revised page a mitchell picks up the phone
we cut between them
oh hi its lisa cohen calling
hi lisa what can i do for you
well i was just wondering what ever happened if anything with the case
you said you might re interview the bus driver
yes we did
we brought him back in you did
well he basically stuck to his original representation and that was pretty much it
i brought it up with my sergeant but he agrees with me we still dont have enough to charge this guy so theres really not a lot more we can
do at this point
but how did you ask the questions
hes obviously not gonna change his statement if you just ask him like really politely why would he
we already know hes a liar
hey you know lisa in the old days wed just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and wed get whatever answer we want out of him
but fortunately we dont do that kind of thing anymore yeah not to white people
you dont do it to white people
anyway im not saying you we dont do it to who
oh my god
first of all i dont know why youre bringin the guys race into it
theres forty thousand cops in this city yes thank you yes
and i hate to disillusion you but most of em are pretty good guys just tryin to do their job
bottom line is the das not gonna take this case
pause now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to but yes i would
joan dressed to go to work drops her keys in her purse as she comes down the hall and lingers in the kitchen doorway to find lisa on the phone
listening then so theres no way to appeal over the phone flat theres nothin to appeal
theres no case
but how do you know detective mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you werent there
whats going on
lisa waves her away
joan and ramon are having drinks and looking at his great view of the upper west side
joan is smoking
so funny its the same show but now they all read how great it is we get these big standing ovations every night and its the exact same show as
but why do you put yourself down
its a wonderful show and a wonderful performance
no its not im not putting myself down
its just that the audience always reacts differently if theyve been told its good
a lot of actors have that experience
she takes a few steps away
i love this view
pause you know ramon
this may sound very stupid to you but do you ever worry that we dont have very much in common
what do you mean
well i dont mean to sound dissatisfied or disgruntled
but i feel like were always misunderstanding each other
do you feel that way at all
or am i just completely off the beam
i dont think we should talk about that joan
i think its kind of important or i wouldnt have brought it up
i like you very much
but lets not talk about what you are like and what i am like
that never makes a good result
talk about it with your friends
nd pink revised page he sips his drink
joan doesnt know what to say
may i show you some pictures of my boys
just dont tell me what theyre like
ramon and joan are in his modernistic scrupulously clean carpeted living room on the sofa looking at pictures
thats a little place we used to go on holiday two hours outside of cartagena
my family is all there still but rodrigo is studying in london and hector is in geneva
im sure they will go back eventually because they like to do something for their country
but its a worry because its very bad there now
i havent really been following it
its a big big mess
last year i helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed or the parents have been kidnapped so they dont know if they are
alive or dead
we try to find homes for them preferably in colombia because if we lose our young people thats it thats the future
we have raised a lot of money but theres only so much we can do
you dont like to say its hopeless but its hard to see the solution
i wish i knew more about it
do you mind if i ask you something
of course not
why are you interested in me
nd pink revised page a you dont think i should be
i just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world
you think it would be better if we knew about all the same things
not really not exclusively
its just unusual
dont you think its unusual
nd pink revised page not for me
i guess you travel a lot
ive only been out of the country a few times in my whole life
you should travel more
ive always wanted to
its hard when youre in the theater
still you should try
its a big world
youre an artist
you should see more of it
you dont have to keep saying that
ive always wanted to travel
its just a little difficult with two kids and no husband but its hard to make a lot of money in the theater
i was on a tv show a few years back and i socked away some money because of that but my ex husband karl
karl yes you remembered very good
karls very generous with the kids when he can be but hes struggling too hes a director he directs commercials and now hes trying to produce them
anyway im not ignorant because i enjoy it
i dont say youre ignorant
do you think lisa will be interested in acting
i dont think so
i thinks shes got a lot of contempt for it
of course that may be the age
she would prefer the world with no plays
nd pink revised page a would you like to see a picture of my mother
these are all my aunts and uncles
she looks at him as he turns the pages
lisa and emily meet in front of daves office building
dave walks lisa and emily into his office
so after i talked to you guys i called this p
i know and i asked him to pink revised page you called a what
private investigator to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver really
yeah so he dave
wait let me tell you what he said
so he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the mta
did you know the mta have their own police
the mta police
they have their own uniforms
and just a minutel jesus christ
what do we give a fuck about the mta police and their uniforms
so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guys file
and it turns out hes had two previous accidents less than two years apart one of them on the job one in his own car what
where there was some allegation that he was drinking which was dropped but that hes never been cited or disciplined just moved around to different shifts are you fucking kidding
why does this not shock me
because surprise surprise his brother in law is a very big muckety muck in the transit workers union pink revised page i
i get it
l and if you read the paper youll know theyre going through a protracted labor dispute at the mta right now and according to my pi the management doesnt want
to aggravate the situation by firing this guy
especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault
this is making me sick
i know but what it means lisa is that we have a case
what it means in fact is that we have a very good case because we can sue for whats called negligent retention
which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody
and you can prove that
sure because we can subpoena their personnel records which we already know contain damaging information because my investigator got a look at them beforehand
which youre not supposed to do but we did it anyway
and that means
that means were in great shape and i think we should go in there and sue their fuckin asses off
but you wouldnt be our lawyer right
pink revised page no no
im not a personal injury its not his area
i dont know enough about it
i would lose
but you could recommend someone
i know a guy whos very good
his name is russel deutsch
hes not a sleazebag
let me give you his number
dave thank you so much
but you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because shes gonna be your beneficiary
shes not gonna want to come to new york i can tell you that right now
if you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars
shes gonna come to new york
lisa and emily walk up the busy avenue
whats with monica and her cousin
oh monicas father left some money to abigails kids and he made monica the executor of the estate because he didnt want abigail and her idiot husband to get their
hands on the money before the kids were grown up
green revised page for which abigail rewarded her by badgering her about it on the phone for fifteen years always trying to borrow money against the estate accusing her of
making lousy investments with it nasty phone calls nasty letters every month for fifteen years until abigails daughter turned twenty one and got married
then monica goes to the wedding in fucking arizona and abigail literally wont speak to her
shes a dream
so thats who were getting the money for
its not who were getting it for its who were getting it from
emily and lisa sit with russel deutsch s
his law office is slightly smaller and less nice than daves
first thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the mta
they get twenty days to respond and when they do we can make our discovery requests accident reports personnel records et cetera
but you gotta realize its gonna take some time
the law says you have to get a court date within a year
usually it takes about six
now i mentioned to dave i have a friend who writes for the metro section of the times
yes now this if it could really happen this changes everything in our favor
if they think theres gonna be adverse publicity especially in the new york times theyre gonna want to settle right away soon as possible and as quietly as so theyd
make it a condition that its usually done you get the money but you cant talk about it
nobody knows the terms
so what good does that do
you get the money
pause is that bad
pause i thought thats what were all here for
pause this is how our society punishes people for doing bad things
by getting money from their employers insurance
its called punitive damages
could we insist they fire the driver
as part of the settlement
yes sure why not
but is that something people do
its one of your conditions
and you think were gonna win
theyre gonna settle
oh theyre gonna settle
this is emily and lisa take hands and squeeze
joan is reading lisas c average report card and an accompanying letter
lisa comes in and stops short
i want to talk to you
whatd i do now
emily opens the front door for joan and lisa
its nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
come on in
emily joan and lisa settle on the sofa and chairs
i had a friend who used to live on this block at
yeah i dont know if you know her
shes a physiotherapist
no i dont know her
i think about a thousand people must
lisa says youre in a play joan
you should go see it its really good
well the play is great and its a really nice cast
shes just being modest
shes gonna win every award in new york
oh all that stuffs a long way off
i dont go to the theater very much
well its just nice because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of recognition
and even though you dont necessarily do it for that as your primary motive it is very nice when people do notice something youve done
i was on a television show a few years ago and i had been doing theater all my life and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate
me because they thought i finally made it
and it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while
that show was so stupid
it wasnt that bad
anyway i realize this is horribly embarrassing for lisa but i really wanted to meet you emily because youve frankly become such a big part of lisas life and i
dont want to be intrusive but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and i cant get lisa to tell me anything about it thats not true
well i cant
and i want you to know lisa that im very very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have
but i cant let you pursue it to the point where its taking over your life or interfering with your school work
to emily its really come down to a question of homework
lisa is on a half scholarship at her school
and i know she feels a real sense of responsibility about what happened yeah i do
i know you do
i know you do
but you cant not do your homework and you cant throw away your scholarship because of it
my grades slipped a little
theyll get better
anyone can do their homework
you just sit down and do it
ive been distracted
all right we didnt need to have a big conference about it
its not a big conference i just want to know whats going on
and i wanted to meet emily
to emily i know its a little awkward
if lisa hasnt been keeping you apprised of whats been going on i think she should
theres nothing to keep her apprised of
were just waiting for them to schedule the discovery conference
now what is that
it really doesnt matter
a discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order
authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records interviewing witnesses talking to monicas cousin
ok now where does she fit in
she gets the money
abigail berwitz s gets out the taxi as the driver comes around with her matching luggage
abigail sits with deutsch
how would you describe the relationship overall
did you talk on the phone a lot
were there a lot of visits i would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least
sometimes more than that
i would call her she would call me
and what were the nature of these conversations
oh family stuff mostly
her family my kids
and she would advise you about your family
that kind of thing
oh i would say so yes
would you have any phone records
or i have all my phone bills if thats what you mean
i didnt record the actual conversations
no no youll see we talked on the phone quite frequently
ok thats terrific
i see you came prepared
well i wanted to bring everything
now when they take your deposition youre gonna say the same thing you just told me
talk about the relationship
kind of advice she used to give you
emily lisa and abigail sit over their lunch
abigail is drinking a white wine
now emily where did you find this lawyer
he was recommended by a friend
im asking because my husband knows a real good new york lawyer and im not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of my friends heard of
he says hes very good
im sure he does
but i have a responsibility in this situation and i would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didnt just drop in out of the clear blue sky
nd green revised page he didnt drop in out of the clear blue sky
he was recommended by my friend
but even if we switched lawyers wed still have to pay him
but it all comes out of the settlement so its really up to you
no if you all think hes good
i dont know whether he is or not
my friend thinks he is
now lisa what is your involvement in all this
whats your angle
i just wanted to
i was just there
emily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee
lisa is standing over the table looking at some of monicas photos and belongings which are spread out all over the table
emily starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes
oh my god is that you
and thats you and monica obviously
oh my god
is that her daughter
so how old was she when she died
i cant even imagine
neither could we
emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put them in the box
lisa sits down too
nd green revised page aa you know monica asked about her when she was dying
nd green revised page a emily looks up
i think she was confused
like i think she thought i was her daughter for a minute
and then she was asking me to call her like to tell her what happened you know like she didnt remember she was dead
what do you mean
what did she say
she just asked if somebody could call her daughter
but then it got confusing because i said sure whats her name
and she said her name was lisa
and i said no thats my name
because it took me a minute i didnt realize we had the same name
emily does not respond
but i couldnt tell if what i was saying was registering with her
emily does not respond
but then when i found out her daughter was dead ever since then i keep having this really strong feeling that some way for those last five minutes i kind
of was her daughter
like maybe thats the reason i was there like in some weird way this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes right before she
and is she still inhabiting your body
or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over
i didnt mean she ws literally inhabiting my body
i dont believe in all that stuff at all
i dont give a fuck what you believe in
nd green revised page aa oh my god
why are you so mad at me
because this is not an opera
you think i think this is an opera
nd green revised page a yes
you think im making this into a dramatic situation because i think its dramatic
i think youre very young
what does that have to do with anything
if anything i think it means i care more than someone whos older
because this kind of thing has never happened to me before
no it means you care more easily
theres a big difference
except that its not you its happening to
yes it is
i know im not the one who was run over thats right you werent
and youre not the one who died of leukemia and youre not the one who just died in an earthquake in algeria
but you will be
do you understand me
you will be
and its not an opera and its not dramatic im well aware of that
and this first blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing
do you understand
its not worth anything because itll be troweled over in a month or two
and then when you get older and you dont have a big reaction every time a d gets run over then then well find out what kind of a person
but this is nothing
im sorry but i didnt start this conversation and i dont play these games
nd green revised page drawing herself up i am not and dont look so outraged
because im not saying anything very outrageous
im telling you to knock it off
you have every right to falsify your own life but you have no right to falsify anyone elses
its what makes people into nazis
and im sorry but its a little suspicious that youre making such a fuss about this when you didnt know her and youre having troubles with your own mother oh
but this is nm life were talking about much more than it is yours
because its my real friend who got killed who im never going to see again really
whom i have known since i was nineteen years old myself
and i dont want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self dramatization
im not fucking dramatizing anything
not having it i was there and you werent
and if i happen to express myself a little hyperbolically emily thats just the way i talk
i cant help it if my mother is an actress
why are you being so fucking strident
um you should leave
because i called you strident
you should leave
i dont wanna be called strident and youre deliberately misunderstanding me
no im not
youre insulting me enough as it is you dont have to call me stupid too
well i cant stop you doing this so i think you had better go
let me get my purse
lisa grabs her purse and coat
emily half walks half drives her toward the door
does this mean were dropping the whole inquiry
it means youre leaving
i dont know what else it means
all i meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic
i obviously misused the word
look it up when you get home
bursts into tears why are you doing this
lisa im not doing anything
im a human being
monica was a human being
so was her daughter
and so is your mother
nd green revised page we are not supporting characters in the fascinating story of your life
i never said or thought you were
and i really didnt mean to call you strident
i totally misused the word
i wasnt trying to insult you emily i really wasnt
i feel so bad about what happened and im trying so hard to do something about it
and i dont understand why if i say something wrong you cant just give me a break
i didnt mean i thought her daughter took over my body
im not an idiot
it was just this feeling i had because she was holding onto my hand so hard before she died and because we had the same first name
but im not trying to dramatize anything emily
i really know about that trend and i really dont think ive been doing that
i believe you
and look up strident
they kiss and make up but its still a little ugly
lisa joan and curtis are watching joan being interviewed on tv
we dont see the screen
ive been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to me
now any talk of the play becoming a film
oh im sure
but i would never get cast in that
im not a movie star
but youre a theater star
i dont know about that either
nd green revised page a you are
joan buries her face in her hands
lisa watches scowling
joan is serving lisa and curtis dinner
do you think emily would like to come see the play
i thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards
let me ask her
dig in everybody
they start eating
i was thinking about spending next year with dad
youre all worried about my grades
they have really good public schools in santa monica and if iofficially lived with him you wouldnt have to worry about my scholarship
have you talked to him about this
weve had some general discussions
do you want to go too
do you want to move to la too
well just let me know if you do
why are you being like this
why am i being like what
why are you about to start crying
because its your intention to make me start crying
no its not you want to move to la
move to la
but why cant this even be mentioned without you taking it personally
im just introducing a possibility
joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go
she comes back and upsets more things on the table
heres a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner
heres a possibility lisa that you can do whatever you jesus christ
want to do because i dont what is with you
even care anymore you heartless little fuckin bitch
keep it up
it really makes me want to stay here
you think youre so fucking perfect
she breaks something else and walks out
green revised page on the blackboard klein finishes writing should teenagers ok
go ahead kirsten
lionel put your drum away
lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers
i think that teenagers should definitely rule the world because teenagers arent corrupted by adult life yet and theyre idealists and they care
and i know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive which they are many of them
but they still havent had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game
so yes i would vote yes
all right lisa
i would tend to agree with all of that except i do think that teenagers dont always necessarily think things through very carefully and they dont have enough experience to
know what the right thing to do is all the time
i also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves
such as what
such as what
such as gee i dont know the hitler youth
or what about all these teenage suicide bombers
not that i want to get into the whole palestinian thing again but assuming you dont think suicide bombing is a good thing wouldnt you say thats an example of
being idealistic without using your critical faculties
green revised page and maybe running the risk of having your youthful enthusiasm be co opted by adults for purposes of their own that you might not even ultimately agree
angies hand shoots up
so do several others
yeah i dont want to get into the whole palestinian thing again either because i realize im completely outnumbered not unlike the palestinians themselves
thats not really funny anthony
angie to lisa klein and im not even going to segal cut the comedy
comment on the fact that you just compared a year old anthony palestinian to a member of i thought it was funny
the hitler youth which i personally find so offensive lisa i dont even know where to athats right
because start oh its not because they both like to kill theyve been occupied and jews
humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last klein fifty years
come on guys
thats partly why they like it
theres angie still a million pale if anyones acting like stinians who dont blow nazis its the israeli up children on busses government
because theyre so frustrated
well i dont know if this is good or bad but speaking of ideology its interesting that the suicide bombers just for example care enough about what they believe in
to sacrifice their lives for it
nd blue revised page yes
i think its fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in
i actually think thats really noble
its a little different when youre willing to sacrifice someone elses life you know
i personally dont think thats such a big ideological achievement
um even if theres no other way to get you out of my country
raise your hands
they havent tried any other ways
its not angie like killing civilians yes they have
theyre is their last resort
trying it right now
its their first resort
because its easy and they like it
oh they like it
theyre just bad people and they like it
there are bad people in the world
i think they liked blowing up the world trade center
they kill their own sisters when they get raped
its called barbarism
who kills their own sisters
its practically all people do is kill each other
lionel if they didnt like it they you guys are not the only wouldnt do it
ones in this class
if you ladies cant make your points without yelling or interrupting each other or raising your hands id say it was a pretty good argument for no
why adults dont yell and interrupt each other
nd blue revised page a lisa
lets try to put this in a broader perspective
the question was not actually whos to blame in the arab israeli conflict the israelis
ok youre a moron
hes had enough lisa
youre not even jewish lisa
the next goddamn person who opens their mouth without lisa raising their hand is
im fuckin half jewish and outta this class
who cares what i am
im anti murder not pro israel
you can leave
lisa passes the blackboard grabs some chalk and checks no
by the way she just proved my point
no i didnt
lewis turns to the class
burst of applause takes us to ramon claps as joan comes out to greet him lisa and emily
thats the best show yet
every time its a better performance
god thank you
hi emily thanks so much for coming
oh thank you for the tickets
joan waits for emily or lisa to say something nice
shall we go
joan lisa emily and ramon are having drinks
and i guess i lost my cool a little but i just love itwhen people start comparing the israelis to nazis
but who is running these discussions
well but lisa you have to remember its always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo
how do you mean ramon
i mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because its his law and his order
he uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law
but when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status hes called a criminal and a terrorist and the violence of the state is called upon to put him
down and once again its called the rule of law
in i see
and what would you like them to do
they meaning the jew oppressors
what would you like them to do
i didnt use that expression
emily but since you ask no you didnt
you didnt have to
um i just spent the whole day arguing about this i didnt really mean to bring it up again
turning on her dont handle me
im not handling you
what did you think of the play
and i think its ironic in dont bother mom
the extreme that the victims of nazis find it essential emily find it essential to if the israelis were like use the nazi tactics to nazis there wouldnt be sustain
any arabs left and im leaving
agreeing with emily thats what i think
emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair
that seems excessive emily come on thats the response
thats the jewish response
its the what
its the jewish response
you dont like what i am saying or what i do so you thats my jewish response
emily throws her drink in his face and walks away
oh my god
its all right
wiping off his face thats all right
its a perfect little encapsule
its the jewish response
a horrible silence as they watch ramon clean his shirt
joan is getting ready for bed
lisa appears in the doorway
sorry about all that tonight
your friend is a delight
shes a really passionate person
she really cares about things
shes rude lisa
ramon was my guest not hers
was she as a matter of fact so what
why is it so joan important that people be no im not ar im polite all the time
why not arguing about this with is that the big priority
im not interested in an exchange of ideas
as it happens ramon said a few things i wasnt too crazy about either so i guess thats the end of that
oh is that supposed to be emilys fault too
i dont want to talk to you right now
please go away
ramon is on the phone in his big midtown corner office
on the phone joan i wont defend myself
all what i meant was that was the typical response you will get from someone who will take that position that that woman was taking
but if you like to break up with me because i used the wrong adjective what im going to do
im not going to beg you
joan enters slowly and checks the water on the stove
lisa is eating a carrot and reading a magazine
hows that anti semitic piece of shit ramon
oh god i dont know
the phone rings
lisa picks up
hi dad how are you
im really looking forward to our horseback riding trip
thats why im calling
i dont think its going to happen
whats the matter
nothings the matter
nobody seems to really want to go and i dont really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in
so i think its obviously better for everyone if we just cancel
i never said i didnt want to go
well i cant seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat um annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule i talk to curtis
and all i get are monosyllables so i think hes really looking forward to it uh huh
well you know that hasnt really been my impression
i also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year
it looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the fall which means im probably not gonna be around the house all that much and since you
and annette detest each other i dont uh i dont think thats what i want to come home to after a fourteen hour day
we dont detest each other ok well it doesnt really strike me as something youre that serious about anyway so what do you say we just table it for the
so tell curtis uh that new mexicos off
ummm and i will talk to you ummm whenever
he hangs up
lisa hangs up too
dads cancelling the trip
hes says nobody wants to go and he doesnt want to spend the money
did you say you didnt want to go
no i know there was some problem with annette about arranging for food because i dont eat dead animals but
i didnt think it was
going to wreck the whole trip
i thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster
personally im relieved
im not moving out there either by the way obviously
which is fine too
karl sits holding the phone in a savage depression
lisa sits on a sofa
she takes a sip of coffee
thank you for letting me come up
i dont know who else to talk to
shes talking to mr aaron who looks very uncomfortable
thats all right
youve always been very sympathetic to my craziness and i may not show it all the time but i actually really appreciate it
its no problem lisa
whats been going on
i just need to talk to somebody who doesnt completely misunderstand who iam
or not even who i am but whats going on inside me or all around me
sound confused enough
anyway for whatever reason i always felt like we understood each other on some level even though im like a mass of conflicting impulses and youre basically the most grown
up rational man i know
i doubt thats actually true but thank you
you seem pretty fuckin rational to me
like that seems to be your leading feature
i mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings
so when youre rational just to finish my thought its like this really interesting way of governing yourself
and you dont have to get all uncomfortable again im not talking about what you think im talking about because i know that subject is off limits
im talking about your soul i guess and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible
do you know what im saying at all
we all have feelings lisa
i happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings
somebody makes you mad you dont just pick up a gun and shoot them
or if you do that says something about who you are and how youve been raised
well i dont want to disillusion you but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do
more often than not
thats not true lisa
i think its very sad that you see it that way
theres eight billion people alive in the world and you think they dont all want to kill someone once in a while
but they dont
most of them
or they see some person they pause i think most people do try to be civilized by some standard
even if its a standard you and i might not agree with
no i get it
thats actually the most hopeful thing anybodys said to me for a long time
i dont know why i take such a dire view of things i really dont
she removes her jacket
shes wearing a small clingy t shirt
just a little hot
a little warm
is this all right
do you allow smoking in your apartment
you can smoke
she gets her cigarettes out and lights one
he gets up and brings her an ashtray
they meet at the sofa and sit
i like your apartment
she blows some smoke out and waves it away
thats all right
this is terrible
i just like you so much
smooths her ash on the ashtray
what a moron
taking her hand hey
im your friend
and thats not gonna change
thats not gonna change
she kisses his hand a couple of times
please just let me for a second
i like you so much
i like you so so much
she kisses his hand more elaborately
he lets this go on
she lifts her head up and they kiss for real
after a moment she slides her hand onto his leg
dont stop me yet ok
they kiss some more
she bends down to unzip his fly
please dont do that
just let me for one second
she bends her head over his lap
he lets her
close on their faces as they are have having sex on the sofa
she freezes up and starts freaking out
are you all right
maybe we should stop
are you all right
yes yes you dont have to keep asking me that
i think we should stop
no keep going
she keeps pushing against him
at the door
she is leaving
he is burning with guilt and shame
then all i can say is i better get a pretty fuckin good grade in geometry this year
pause lighten up
i really didnt expect anything like this to happen
im really not sure how to react
im not gonna tell anybody if thats what youre worried about
i totally initiated the whole thing
anyway its just sex
youre acting like a little kid
ill see you in school
she walks out
he is very flummoxed
the driver of a city bus which killed an upper west side woman last month had two previous driving violations on his record according to lisa and emily sit in
the office with deutsch
well they want to settle
i have a meeting with their lawyer this afternoon and they want to discuss a settlement
so we should get abigail on the phone and talk about what were gonna do
lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles embarrassed
they sit around the speaker phone
abigails husband rob berwitz is also on the other end
mr im right here
i just had the thought mr deutsch im just gonna give my husband the floor because he had a few green revised page mr deutsch i had the thought if
theyre willing to settle so quickly maybe were better off waiting a little bit maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more
yes if theyre so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis what you gotta realize what you gotta abigail russel doesnt think sorry go ahead
my friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is could i interject
but if they responded so strongly based on one story
maybe were cuttin our own throats here
they are responding to the story in the paper
thats just common sense
but what you gotta understand is theyre offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper
thats why russel thinks besides the main point is not to jack up the price
im sorry we didnt hear that last
green revised page a to emily and lisa ladies let me just abigail
green revised page if i could finish my thought theyre jumpin at the bait right now but if another six months goes by we run a serious risk of losing
you see what i mean
now im gonna hit em very very hard i guarantee you
thats why i wanted all of us together on the phone so we could talk about your other terms besides the damages
i promise you weere gonna be very very aggressive what other terms would there be
what do you mean like some kind of a fund
some kind of fund
for the kids
i dont understand what you mean by a fund
to abigail mr
do you mean what does he mean besides some kind of trust fund the damages
a fund that would be set up by the bus company for emily our kids
for tax purposes
what fuckin fund
these people are retarded
because i have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with monica and our children and it was not a pleasant experience
we just want a clean straight damages is fine
a regular payment
well pay the taxes on it
at least well have something in our hand
i dont really know what kind of fund youre talking about
were not talking about hi this is lisa
were abigail talking were talking hello lisa
green revised page pause
were still here
were talking about the driver getting the driver fired oh yes as part of the conditions
yes abigail its very important to us that the company know thats an absolute pre condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever
if you think hes at just as long as they dont think they can buy us off just by gettin rid of this guy
you see what i mean
what were most concerned about here is the amount
yes were getting that rob
but you see what i mean
yes i do
i just want to go on record as saying i think this whole meeting is premature
were not lawyers abigail
i just wanna make something clear
one conversation does not commit you to anything
green revised page a and im not gonna agree to anything without consulting you
but im working for you
so if youre telling me not to take the meeting im not gonna take the meeting
were not saying that
no no no go for it
lisa has just told joan the news
joan is on the sofa
lisa im really proud of you
really really proud
joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up
are you upset about something
this house is really beginning to get to me
and im a little confused what to do about ramon
i mean you were there what do you think
uh gee mom maybe you should really think about it some more
because it would probably hurt ramons feelings if you broke up with him and i think you better think about it before you do something like that to him
i know im supposed to understand what youre doing right now but if theres some kind of hidden message here im not getting it
youre on your own mom
thanks a lot
the phone rings
joan picks it up
what do you mean
whats the matter
to lisa ramon had a heart attack
is he gonna be uiet
they both watch joan at the phone
instead of dissolving joan listens straightens up and calms down as the person on the phone talks
mourners are going inside the funeral parlor
joan and lisa look around the room
ok im really not trying to be funny but isnt this a jewish funeral home
i guess they do both
they notice a few too many good looking women crying a little too hard
lisa and joan look at each other
rodrigo a handsome slender kid of comes up to joan
his accent is british with a slight colombian cadence
you must be rodrigo
oh my god oh im so sorry
she impulsively embraces him
rodrigo this is my i want to tell you joan my dad talked about you all the time
the night he met you he called me in england and woke me to tell me about it he was so excited
i never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died
i dont know if this is appropriate
no its ok
but he went out a lot
do you know the last time i spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you because for the first
time since he lost my mother he finally met a woman he could really connect with
at a total loss well he was a very sweet man
and i know he loved you and your brother very much
yeah i know he did
lisa is at her computer
joan is by the doorway
thanks for coming with me today
i really appreciate it
oh youre welcome
i dont want to be macabre but ramon and i were supposed to go to hear the tales of hoffman the week after next and i still have the tickets
would you be interested in going
or should i give them away
nd pink revised page um ill go
its monday night
we can dress up
what did you make of that
people dont relate to each other mom
theyre totally disconnected
and if they have any time for each other at all its either like a biological imperative or like some weird cultural anomaly
thats what i make of it
i think its pretty unfortunate that you think that
because i feel like you and i used to relate to each other really well
im not trying to hurt your feelings
its just a general observation
hey could i get a hug
lisa rises and hugs joan
its not a good hug
i just feel totally at sea
they break apart
mr aaron and lisa sit in a booth
mr aaron looks grim
ive thought about this a great deal and im going to come forward
what does that mean
nd pink revised page a youre gonna come forward
and do what
you didnt kill anybody
you just had sex with me after i practically begged you to
youre a guy
im gonna come forward
well thats what im comfortable doing
ill deny everything and youre gonna look like a total psycho
and then my mom have you arrested and then spend the rest of her life feeling bad about it
so why dont we just skip the whole thing and forget about it
im not sure i know how to do that
lisa looks at a pregnancy test stick
both lines are red
joan looks up as lisa comes in
joan and lisa are looking at the little stick
what do you want to do
what do you mean
arent joan you going to tell me
its your body
its your what to do
what do you want to do
now who is the father
it could be a lot of people
joan looks at her
lisa haltingly holds her ground
joan takes a sympathetic step toward her
lisa shrinks back
her expression hardens
im never gonna tell you mom
its against my principles
such as they are
no but you want to send that bus driver to jail for running a red light
and you wont tell me about these boys
she looks around the small room
there are two couples and two lone women
a nurse appears
tracking joan as she gets up and follows the nurse down a hall
shes still a little woozy from the anaesthetic
joan goes into the recovery room
lisa is on the table in a crumpled paper robe looking like a small crumpled piece of paper herself
joan sits down
im sorry mom
lets talk about it later
deutsch sits with emily and lisa
the berwitzes are on the speaker phone
im very pleased to be able to inform you all that i had a long meeting with the lawyer for the bus company and theyve agreed to settle out of
court for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
im assuming this is agreeable to yes fantastic that is fantastic
but i gotta obviously i gotta bring the offer to you get your approval mr deutsch
now i know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit thats ok were only abigail
if we could just listen to what russel has to say and then talk about it once hes told us the whole story and given us his recommendation
i was gonna say i know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit thats ok we were just would you
let him talk please
i want to tell you i think its a very good offer
i think theyre very anxious to settle but i also do think that at this moment theyre under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear and
i dont believe theyre gonna come up any higher hey
three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
ok now let me just thats nothin to sneeze at
i just want to introduce now think can the thought you all hear me
was that everybody
ok what about emily
what do you think
i think it sounds like we should do it
but id like to discuss some of the hey if thats the vote
unless you think theres something to be gained from holding out for more
i think it would be a big mistake
robbie what do you think
now the only down side to this as it stands and the reason i asked emily and lisa to be here is because i know this may be a serious
wrinkle for you all is that the bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver
what do you mean
then forget it
tell them to what do you mean they forget it
wont discuss the removal of the driver
let me rob finish what im saying
its just a blast in our ears
let him finish
i want you to understand lisa i pressed them very very hard on this but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement because
it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the mta what does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean
settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt
it simply does not carry the same stigma
on top of that you may not know lisa theyre involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the mta right yeah we know all about that
just tell them to forget it
i know thats your reaction
its the only reason were here
can i jump in here
but its really not your decision
are you still with us
its emilys decision
theyre not listening robbie
its abigails decision because shes the next of kin
but she didnt even know about it
that doesnt matter
could we get back in this conversation please
obviously theres some very strong emotions going either way on this listen emily
i dont know what youre thinking but rob and i are thinking we should take russels recommendation while we can
because if they wont fire the guy theyre not gonna fire him
and six months or a year from now were gonna exactly
were gonna be in a situation where were beggin them for half this much which is gonna hurt em half as much as now and theyre still not gonna fire
or maybe hell have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then
do you see what i mean
the entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesnt kill somebody else
lemme just clarify it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didnt know you were entitled to for somebody you didnt even like
this is a distortion and the only reason youre getting the money at all is because i started this whole fucking thing in motion
im sorry for swearing but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street for getting him abigail
well im sorry but i have a responsibility to monica and i take that responsibility very seriously
you are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we dont do something about it right now
and rather than being abused over the telephone and cursed at for having the courtesy to involve you in these discussions lisa i would hope you would be guided by
unless im wrong about that
none of that matters unless im wrong about that
just what is your interest in this
because im the one who killed her
im the one who killed her
but at least i know i did it and that guy has no idea
and hes wandering around blaming everybody else and all i want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong
and if they dont fire him and all you want is the money and the police wont do anything how is he gonna know hes wrong
you cant take the deal abigail
it wasnt so you could get any money it was because we wanted to get him fired
it doesnt matter about the money
you wouldnt have gotten it before
well it may not matter to you but where i come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money and to my mind is a
positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative
not just getting someone fired for one mistake no matter how bad it was oh shove it up your ass
she knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears
you sleazy fucking lawyer
and youre a moralistic cunt
she runs out
tracking in front of lisa as she walk runs down the busy street
a city bus appears behind her and goes by
she cranes to see the driver
its not her guy
she keeps going
lisa stands against a car smoking as the kids flow out of the building
mr aaron comes out talking with bonnie the gymnastics teacher
they walk away from the school together
lisa catches up with them
hey did you guys know i had an abortion last week
i didnt know that
yeah it cost four hundred dollars
um should i
no no dont go anywhere
yeah dont go anywhere
bonnie doesnt know what to make of this
mr aaron looks steadily at lisa
do you want to tell us about it
she doesnt speak
do your parents know about this lisa
have you told the father honey
theres a couple of people it could be
i think you better tell them
whoever they are
im sure hes sorry anyway whichever one he is
i dont see what difference that makes if hes sorry
and i think whoever it is should know about this
i shouldnt have brought this up
please dont tell anyone
were not gonna tell anyone
but youre gonna have to tell whoever it could be on have to thats ok
i gotta go
thanks for listening
its it doesnt matter about the father because the whole thing was my fault
she shakes her head and runs away
what was that
lisa comes in
curtis is doing his homework at the table
moms looking for you
she thinks youre going out with her tonight
where are we going
i dont know
lisa heads for her room
joan appears half dressed
did you forget were going to the opera
i didnt remind you because i didnt want to nag you
lisa starts to cross the street against the light
joan takes her arm
dont get run over
a cab rattles by
lisa looks down the street
a bus is approaching
i want to see if thats him
the bus gets closer heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop
lisa grabs her mothers arm
it is him
mom thats the one
joan and lisa look at him
hes staring out ahead of him as people board the bus
he sees lisa and joan but cant see their faces and doesnt recognize lisa he just sees two dolled up women under the street light
he smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave
joan looks at lisa
she looks like shes about to throw up
were gonna miss the curtain
lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette looking out over lincoln center
joan comes out and stands next to her but lisa wont look at her or interact
well so far its not the greatest opera i ever heard
what do you mean
the end of intermission chimes sound
people start going in
joan turns and goes in too
lisa keeps smoking
lisa comes down the stairs and goes into lisa hurries down the long aisle
the lights dim
the audience applauds the entering conductor
she picks her way past the other patrons in the row whispering excuse me and takes her seat just as the music starts
joan looks at her
lisa stares straight ahead
the curtain rises
on stage the two women start singing the barcarole belle nuit
its very beautiful
joan looks next to her at lisa
lisa is trying not to cry but tears are dripping slowly down her face
she sniffs and wipes them away but they keep coming
joan looks at her again but lisa still wont look at her
joan takes lisas hand and lisa breaks down completely clutching joans hand back squeezing it hard
joan starts crying too out of sympathy
as the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands lisa crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand and joan crying too but
not as hard grateful finally that the spell has been broken
the duet ends and we cut to black
