oscars moves towards the cellphone
oscar stops in his tracks

the phone rings again
oscars hand quickly picks it up and flips it open
we follow the phone to his face and we see him for the first time a year old black man with a warm smile

he closes it before the guy on the other end can respond
he takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with sophina mesa a curvy year old mexican american woman

she kisses him back a bit then scoots away

sophina scoots away from him
knock knock knock
oscar and sophina look over at the door
oscar looks at sophina

oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser and hides it in the closet
he rushes over and opens the door where we see tatiana grant a cute year old girl standing wearing footie pajamas
i cant sleep
before tatiana can even finish oscar has her in his arms
he brings her over to the bed and places her next to sophina
you want to sleep in here with mommy and daddy
you know better than that t
to oscar what time is it
oscar picks up his phone and looks at it
damn its after midnight
he opens his phone up
presses compose text message as he types the message the words appear as graphics across the screen like sub titles oscar sends the text off
he hooks his phone up to the charger and hits the light switch leaving us in darkness
i dont want to move to livermore
oscar and sophina laugh at this
dont worry t aint nobodys moving right now
go to sleep
oscar stands in the shower letting the water run over his head
there looks to be a lot on his mind
sophina and oscar move around the small kitchen like a well oiled machine
sophina wearing a walmart uniform makes two lunches
oscar wipes milk from tatianas face and fixes her hair
mommy can i have two of the fruit snacks today
you can take an extra apple if you want
but mommy i dont argue t
sophina downs a cup full of orange juice grabs both lunch bags tatiana and heads for the door
we gotta stop and get gas too
we got enough to get yall there
sophina shoots oscar a look
go start the car up
you got your keys
i gotta grab my beanie
sophina and tatiana leave
oscar watches them go for a beat
he turns to the cabinet
oscar and tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two story house
a picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door
oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair
he looks back at the car
we see that sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror
oscar turns to tatiana
he then takes her hand and places something inside of it
tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks
she looks up at oscar with a bright eyed expression
but oscar quickly places his finger over his lips
tatiana nods in agreement trying to hold back a huge smile
she gives him a swift kiss on the cheek
he stands up and knocks on the front door
stacy a motherly looking black woman in her s opens the door
good morning tatiana
good morning mrs
tatiana heads into the house
oscar smiles at mrs
stacey and she nods back
he watches tatiana run off into house
oscar and sophina look on at the wal mart entrance
told you wed make it
the light aint even on yet
she looks at the dashboard where there is a picture of oscar holding tatiana tucked in the glass
the fuel gage sits almost under e but the light still isnt on
she stares at the store entrance

sophina smiles at the idea of frisco for a beat
let me get in here
she quickly sits up
oscar leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek makes a farting sound on her neck instead
sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car
playfully love you too
sophina shuts the door on him
his smile fades as he watches her go inside
oscar now in the car by himself rides in the car listening to hip hop music
he comes to a red light
he looks at the car radio clock am
he thinks to himself for a beat he looks dissatisfied
he turns his music up for a beat and listens to it
he looks around still not at ease
he turns off his music and pulls out his cellphone
he takes a quick look around to see what cars are around before dialing numbers
calling mom flashes on the screen
he holds the phone to his ear
a beautiful black woman in her late s wears a ups managers uniform this is wanda johnson
she walks towards the entrance of her store when her cellphone rings in her purse
she pulls it out stressed
answers it without looking
last shot right here you sure you want to work on your birthday
you still got time to catch a cold
wandas face brightens up with a familiar looking smile
thanks for the text last night

wanda laughs at this
as tempting as that sounds
this place would be a mess without me today

oscar hesitates for a beat

he pulls the car over
he looks around for his earpiece for beat no luck
he takes his cellphone and slides it into the elastic of his beanie a poor mans bluetooth
he pulls off

wanda hangs up the phone
she looks at it for a beat
then puts it back in her purse and heads into the warehouse
we see the entrance of farmer joes and shoppers coming in and out
oscar looks around for a beat and takes off his hoody and puts it into his back pocket
we follow him into it is a moderately sized grocery store but several shoppers move about the aisles
oscar walks over to the seafood section where cato caldwell a year old charismatic black male stands behind the counter wearing a deli apron
cato sees oscar and smiles brightly
he takes a pile of fish off the scale bags it ands it to an older black woman
he takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with oscar over the counter
sup osc bruh

cato looks around at the surrounding aisles
no signs of him
i came to get some crabs too
oh yeah tell moms i said happy birthday

bruh i wish i could but i gotta bust a couple moves tonight
whats good for the countdown though
fireworks and the whole shit oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye
he motions his head for cato to look
cato turns and sees katie a white girl in her mid s playing with her iphone while waiting for help
cato quickly makes his way over
i want to get a pound of wait
can i see what your sole looks like
cato takes a sidestep over to his left and motions to a pile of fish
yeah no wait
let me see what that looks like
cato points to the catfish
katie looks at it then looks down to her phone
okay but i want to fry it
like a fish fry

cato gives her an are you serious

katie looks at him still flustered
okay let me have a second
she looks back down at her iphone and takes a step back
cato turns to oscar

cato nods and walks over to the crab

oscar turns to katie
your family having a fish fry for new years or something
katie looks up from her phone a bit caught off guard
something like that

she looks at oscar suspiciously
its my day off
katie smiles nervously
looks at cato who nods at katie in approval
beat well im cooking dinner tonight for my friend before we go to the city
and he really likes fried fish like southern style
and i maybe lied a bit and said that i know how to cook like that
oscar laughs at this
katie shakes her head
is he black
but he knows a lot of black people
hes not my boyfriend either
oscar chuckles at this
katie looks down at her phone again
she uses her fingers to zoom in on something
im not sure what type of fish he wants
and most of these recipes are different on this site
oscar watches her with a look of pity
suddenly an idea flashes before his eyes
he pulls out his cellphone quickly dials a number and holds it to his ear
we see grandma bonnie a black woman in her early s putting flowers into a vase on her kitchen counter
a cordless phone rings on the counter
she looks at the phone for a beat then she cheers up
into phone hello
oscar holds his cellphone and snaps at katie to get her attention

oscar holds out the phone for katie
she reaches out apprehensively
he gives her a reassuring look
she takes it
whispering whats her name
whispering back grandma bonnie
into phone hello grandma bonnie its katie nice to meet you
katie smiles and blocks her other ear to hear better
oscar snaps his head to cato who motions for oscar to look down the aisle
oscar looks over and sees emi a thirtysomething hispanic man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag
he checks the shelves with a barcode scanning device
oscar slowly heads over

she extends her hand to shake with oscar
oscar smiles shakes it

oscar shakes his head at this
katie starts off towards the register
he walks back over to cato who is weighing fish for another customer
he spots oscar
how it go
oscar smiles wide and nods
he reaches over the counter and grabs the bag of crabs then bumps fists with cato
thats wussup bruh

oscar nods and heads towards the checkout line his smile fading
oscar places the bag of crabs in the refrigerator
he closes it and looks at the refrigerator for a beat
on it we see several drawings done by tatiana held on the door by magnets
oscar smiles at these
his phone rings big sis calling green
chantay a year old black woman wearing a kfc employee uniform pinches a cellphone between her ear and her shoulder
she organizes papers in a folder while she talks into the phone

oscar closes his phone
thinks to himself for a beat
he opens his phone back up and punches some numbers
calling marcus flashes across the screen
marcus a tough looking asian american man about oscars age sits in a barbers chair a black barber cuts his hair
his phone vibrates in his pocket and the barber steps back to let him answer it
he pulls out an iphone and talks into it

oscar hangs up his phone
oscar quickly walks over to his closet and grabs the bag of weed
he neatens up the room a bit and takes off
the store is small and brightly lit
oscar is reading a card from off the birthday for mother rack
we see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her sons hand
inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem footsteps by anonymous
oscars eyes quickly scan the poem hes read it before
oscar opens the card and looks inside for a beat
he looks up moved by the words
he stares off into space
we look through a foggy window at wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them
there are a few visitors already sitting at tables with inmates
several corrections officers stand by
we see oscar shirtless arms behind his head is looking through the glass window of the search room
a corrections officer is conducting a search
oscars face is bruised under his left eye and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face
he turns around bends over and coughs
he turns back around and the officer hands him his blue shirt and pants
oscar puts them on and buzz
the door opens and oscar walks through the large room to wandas table
as he approaches she stands up
oscar gives her a hug leaning across the table
what happened to your face
you look nice
wanda shakes her head
my girls come over last night
laughs a bit
we played board games
laughing a bit more now
yall let her win too i bet
yall hella weak for that
she gets no easy victories with me around
oscar smiles and notices wanda is smiling about something on her mind
do you remember that microwave popcorn you bought a while back
yeah the kettle corn
yes kettle corn
i popped some of that for us and i was putting it into a bowl
tatianas looking up at me like she wants something
wanda starts to chuckle a bit again
what she say
she looks up at me and says grandma do we have any dark butter
oscar looks at wanda with a confused look
yeah im thinking she saw food network or something
so i say whats dark butter sweetheart
she says when daddy took me to see wall
e he asked for light butter so i want to try some dark butter this time
oscar looks at wanda with a bright eyed expression
she is gettin way too smart
another buzz from the door is heard
as the two share a moment daniel cale a stocky white inmate in his early s walks past oscar and wandas table
he has a large square bandage under his left eye
just loud enough for oscar to hear this moms right here
anger flashes over oscars eyes
she a snitch to
what the fuck you say about my mom bruh
fuck you and that bitch
you tough in here with these guards huh
two corrections officers move quickly over to oscars table
cale continues to walk towards a the table with the woman and the frizzy haired girl
is there a problem here
naw we good
thats my best friend right there
cale flashes a mischievous smile
the corrections officer comes over and stands between the two
oscar watches as cale sits down across from the woman who holds the baby
cale smiles at the woman and makes coochie coo faces at the baby
woman passes the child to cale over the table
oscar looks on with malice
oscar calm down
wandas voice snaps the anger off of his face
he looks back to wanda and his anger subsides
what happened to your face
dark butter huh
she always listening
wanda stares at oscar
she too smart for her own good man
the preschool said we should think about starting her in school early
phina tell you that
wanda doesnt respond
yeah were gonna put her in private school
i was lookin at st
bede the other day
its this other school that starts them off learning spanish then it gradually gets them back going on english

oscar stops in his tracks

im not coming here to these visits anymore
this is the last time
i know i know i know
this is my last time too
i told you that
i aint goin down no more
you want to keep putting sophina through this
but tatiana doesnt deserve this
she didnt have a choice
oscar takes this in
she too young to know whats going on right now
i guess thats why she asked me why you love taking your vacations more than being with her
oscar cut his eyes from wanda
she aint say that
so im the liar now
oscar takes a beat to think about this
tell her that i love her more than anything in the world
and that i green
tell her yourself
next time you call
tell your daughter how much you love her over the phone
or better yet just let her come visit you
i dont want her to see me like this
in a box
but this is how you are right now
i dont want her to be exposed to this
youve already exposed her to it
wanda leans back in her chair shes done
so you really not gonna visit me no more
i got four more months
oscar leans in
whispering ma this shit aint like rita
its crazy in here
i dont know if i can make it without you seeing you that long
i love you oscar im praying for you and ill see you when you get home
wanda scoots back in her chair stands up and heads towards the exit
oscar remains seated in his chair
ma hold up
let me get a hug
wanda continues to walk
oscar stands up and follows behind wanda
his feet pass a yellow line
wanda continues on not turning around
grant back in your assigned visiting area
oscar ignores him and continues to follow his mom
hits a button on his walkie and motions to the other c
they quickly move towards oscar and attempt to grab him
get the fuck off me
oscar jerks away
s grab oscar and lift him up off of the ground
get off me
wanda continues on
s let me just give her a hug right quick before she leave
we pull back with wanda as she walks away trying to hide her pain
another corrections officer sprints past her towards oscar who we can still see in the distance
to the c
s get the fuck off me
to wanda ma
oscar looks on at wanda as she leaves growing small in the distance
oscar still stares off into space moved by this memory
he snaps out of it heads towards the register with the cards in hand
oscar starts the car up looks at his dashboard
he sees that the fuel light is on
oscar pumps his gas
he looks at a poster of obama that reads change posted on the gas pump
he looks across the lot and notices a zales engagement ring poster
he pulls out his phone
starts to text
he sends it off
closes waits for a bit
he opens it
oscar puts his phone back into his pocket
he turns and begins to pump his gas
he sets the handle to automatically pump and looks up and notices something
we see it is a gnarly looking male pit bull sniffing around a few feet from oscars tires
it looks to be maybe or years old
oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over
oscar pets him on the head we see its ears are a bit scarred but it has beautiful brown eyes
he feels around the dogs neck no collar
oscar looks around for an owner for a beat while the dog licks his hand
click oscars gas tank is full
he turns away from the dog places the pump back on the base and screws his fuel cap back in
he looks back to where the dog was and doesnt see him
he scans the block and panic strikes his face
he takes off running towards the street
no no no stop
we hear it before we see it
a sickening sound
an animal yelps a car speeds off
oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see
at the car hey
stop you bitch ass muthafucka
he stops turns around and runs over to something lying in the street
its the dog and hes in bad shape
oscar picks the dog up out of the street and places him on the sidewalk
whispering comeon boy
the dogs breathing grows more struggled
to himself shit
shouting somebody help
somebody fucking help
oscar continues to pet his head
the dog starts to violently shake
he becomes unnaturally still
oscar stares at the dog for a long beat shaken up by this
he looks around no one seems to have noticed
he bends down closes the dogs eyes and heads for his car
it is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the bay
oscars car pulls up
after a short beat
a lexus pulls up along side of it
marcus hops out of the lexus and walks over to oscars car
oscar leans over and opens the passenger side door for marcus to get in
shit bruh i didnt think we was ever gonna link up

oscar stares out of the window
i got good news and bad news my nigg
awww naw osc bruh dont tell me you aint got it

marcus makes a face
no way i was goin that high

oscar turns to marcus hands him a brown pre rolled joint
for your troubles

he pulls out a wad of money

marcus pulls out a lighter

marcus lights up the joint takes a hit holds it out for oscar but oscar just stares out of the window
im good thats all you bruh
marcus puts it back into his mouth
right on osc then bruh
they slap hands and marcus gets out of the car
we hear him get into his car and start his car up
oscar waits for a beat
he then reaches under his seat and grabs something
oscar walks out onto the shoreline looking at the water
he looks around for a beat
he walks all the way out into the water
standing on rocks
he looks over both shoulders to make sure no one is watching
he then goes into his waistband and pulls out the ziplock bag of weed
he squats down opens the bag and dumps it into the water
he watches as the green buds float off
oscar walks up to the heavily crowded store entrance
we see sophina exiting holding a large cardboard cake box
oscar takes it from her
what flavor did you get
oscar looks at the cake box
why you didnt get ice cream
cause it aint your birthday nigga
can you take me by my grandmas house so i can get changed
you know it would be hella easier if you just had your stuff at my spot right
when you gonna move in
probably when you stop having trees in the car before we pick up t
she gets into the car
we follow oscar as he turns the corner into a backyard full of toys and kids tatianas age
stacey watches them smiling but with vigilant eyes
tatiana spots oscar and runs up and gives him a hug
oscar waves and smiles at mrs
stacey who waves back
he walks over to the sign out sheet and grabs a pen
we played freeze tag today
they couldnt catch me
oscar looks up from the sign in sheet
you think youre faster than daddy
tatiana looks back at oscar challengingly
oscar looks at something behind tatiana with concern
whats that right there
tatiana takes the bait the oldest trick in the book
oscar takes off
oscar is beating tatiana to the car by a mile
tatiana follows him laughing loudly
a small television sits next to the stove playing a telenovella
looking at the episode from the kitchen doorway is mariana pangelina sophinas year old grandmother
sizzling can be heard coming from the kitchen
the front door opens and in walks sophina oscar and tatiana
tatiana runs to mariana and gives her a hug
oscar gives her a kiss on the cheek
sophina gives her a hug
the three take a seat at the kitchen table
mariana continues to cook

mariana shakes her head

but whats the difference between watching six kids and watching seven
sophina think about this

sophina sighs pulls out her cell phone and heads out of the kitchen
mariana turns to oscar
to oscar hows work
oscar thinks on this exits the kitchen in the direction of sophina
only tatiana is left at the table
she puts some pollo on a fork and takes it over to her
as oscar enters we see sophina is in her bra and panties talking into her cellphone
she lays several different outfits out on the bed
oscar closes the bedroom door leans on it

she looks through the clothes on her bed and lifts up a checkered hoodie puts it to her chest
looks at herself in a full body mirror sighs at her reflection

sophina turns around and looks at oscar senses something is eating at him

oscar kisses her neck
sophina reaches back and unhooks her bra

mariana and tatiana sit side by side at the table spellbound by the telenovella
oscar with tatiana sitting on his shoulders and a bag of crabs in his hand walks up to the porch of a modest house
sophina stands at his side holding a cake
oscar uses his key to open the door
the three enter the house and walk through the house into the kitchen
wanda wearing casual clothes now fills up a pot with water
grandma bonnie washes a basin full of vegetables
oscar takes tatiana off her shoulders and sits her down
everyone greets each other

oscar sits the crabs down on the counter next to the sink
he gives his mother a big bear hug
she smiles hugs him back just as tight
oscar lets go and moves on to his grandmother
sophina and tatiana come give wanda hugs
oh my god you guys got a cake too
everyone laughs at this
wanda and grandma bonnie begin to take the groceries out of the plastic bag
wanda pulls out two massive crabs
looks in the bag and sees the third
you know all i needed was two you didnt have to spend so much money

oscar turns from the kitchen into the den
two men in their s sit down on the couch across from a tv playing espn
these are oscars uncles daryl and ceephus johnson
oscar walks over to a recliner adjacent to them and pulls the hallmark bag out of his waistband
he sits down in the recliner and signs his moms card

daryl shakes his head at this
a raiders fan cheering for the steelers

tatiana watches oscar closely
a large pot is placed atop the gas stove
the burner blazes under it as wanda drops the now clean crabs into the bucket
she drops in the vegetables and begins to stir
bowls are grabbed by everyone and they are filled up by wanda with white rice first and then the brown gumbo is poured over it along with large pieces of
un cracked crab
everyone eats their gumbo in the kitchen
wanda blows out the candles on her cake cuts it hands out everyone a slice
everyone is finishing up their cake its about half gone now
oscar sits on the couch between wanda and sophina
ceephus and daryl now sit in plush chairs with metal frames pulled up next to the coffee table
grandma bonnie sits in a recliner at the foot of the coffee table
if somebody told me say twenty years ago that i would live to see it happen id have laughed in their face
if somebody would have told me that two years ago i would have laughed in their face
and here we are
and its happened
but i think its a sign of the times
the country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy
look if bush hadnt have messed the country up so bad
would he have even had a shot
i think he still would have had a shot
but would he have won though
well im happy the did win
if the country really is as messed up as you say i think hes our best chance of fixing it
i keep thinking about how much it means for t
when i was coming up teachers used to love to tell me you can be the president of the united states
youd make a great politician
you can talk your way out of anything
sophina and oscar share a look
but ill never forget in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster
it had all some odd presidents on that thang
and i looked at all they faces
and it was all white dudes
at that point i realized my teachers was lying to me
beat a part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since
now there will be a black face on those posters
well lets let him get in there first
i know i still feel like its just too good to be true
whats so good about it
a black man one of us has been elected president fair and square
ceephus shakes his head at this
but hes not one of us
he wasnt affected by slavery
wanda has had enough of this
she stands up and starts to grab everyones plates
she heads into the kitchen to wash
oscar watches her for a beat then follows after her
wanda stands over the sink washing the dishes
oscar stands next to her drying them

she looks up at a bright flash of light in the sky
we see outside her window a group of young teenagers stand on a street corner and shoot off a roman candle

the screen reads sophina calling
sophina now frantic stands with her cellphone to her ear
kris and vanessa talk to three police officers who are guarding the entrance like club bouncers
sophina hangs up the phone then quickly dials another number

sophina hangs up the phone and watches as the ambulance speeds off down fruitvale blvd
cato still in the back of the police car is kicking the window with both feet
brandon continues to scream from his car
the police cars pull off
the doors burst open and the paramedics wheel oscar into the er trauma room
we are close on oscar as he lies on his back unconscious breathing tubes are attached to his mouth
his chest rises up and down slowly struggled
surgeons and paramedics move around oscar
the lead surgeon a tall slim black man in his s points to an object that lies just under oscars right clavicle just under his skin
its here its right beneath the skin
the surgeon takes a scalpel and cuts into oscars skin just above the protruding mass
blood runs out he presses down and pops out the bullet that looks like a large metal mushroom
the surgeon examines it
its like it hit something solid
bone wouldnt do this
he places the bullet into an empty beaker atop a cart
he turns back to oscar and begins to stitch up the incision
the lead surgeon looks at xrays of oscars chest on a light board
paramedic stands over his shoulder
he was lying face down on the ground
a resident surgeon points to a large dark cloud on the xrays
right here right lung looks to be whats causing the pulse problem
the surgeon sticks a tube into the right side of oscars chest and blood flows out of the tube uncontrollably
spilling onto the floor
shit shit we gotta get him upstairs
the medical staff sees this and kicks their movements into high gear
oscar lies on the operating table sedated
the surgeons talk medical speak
they move with astounding quickness and precision
lead surgeon takes a large scalpel and makes a inch incision under oscars right nipple
blood rushes out its worse than they thought
it begins to hit the floor
a resident surgeon reacts to this and quickly grabs a large emesis basin
he puts it underneath the wound catching the blood
another surgeon places a spreader into the wound and opens it up
the lead surgeon looks inside of the incision
he lets his head down in frustration at what he sees
his lungs gone
we gotta prep for removal
a nurse stands behind a reception desk
wanda sophina vanessa and kris storm into the room
wanda goes up to the receptionist a black woman in her s
my son is oscar julius grant iii
hes been shot and they told me to come here the nurse sits at the computer
hes still in the operating room

wanda nods and walks over towards the chairs
under her breath lord please let him be okay
please watch over him with your healing hands lord
keep him safe lord
keep him safe so that i can hold him once again
the operation is fully underway
a surgeon removes oscars lung from the incision
we see a nurse change out a bag of donor blood on one of the many iv systems oscar is hooked up to
she tosses into a bin where it lands atop five other empty bags
wanda sits in the waiting room next to sophina
the boys storm into the room along with jack bryson sr
a hispanic looking man in his s
kris greets the boys and they head over to wanda
he stands close to his sons jack and tim
the nurse walks out from behind the back room with the lead surgeon who now wears fresh scrubs
wanda nods and stands up
oscar was shot okay
weve stabilized him but hes in critical condition
the bullet caused massive internal bleeding and we had to remove the right lung
how is he
how is he going to be able to breathe
well his breathing isnt our concern
its the bleeding

but right now his body isnt taking the transfusions
but hes going to make it right
hard to say but were gonna do everything we can okay
please do whatever you can okay
my son is a good boy

he nods and pats wanda on the shoulder for a beat then turns and heads back into the icu
wanda walks back over to the group
she gives them the news from the doctor
several nurses operate around oscar who still lies unconscious his breathing sounding more struggled than ever
suddenly blood begins to run from his right nostril then his right eyelid and his left nostril after that
his ekg machine begins to beep loudly
the nurses go into panic mode
early morning daylight streams into the waiting area
where wanda sophina chantay ceephus daryl and oscars friends hold hands
wanda leads them in prayer
and we ask that you may put your healing hands around your child we ask that you may operate through these doctors and breathe strength into their hands as they
work on him
heal him lord so that we may one day see his smile again
lines of blood trickle from oscars eyes nose and mouth
the lead is now in the room and has taken over commands
loosing a pulse
oscars body begins to violently shake
a young male resident doctor grabs the paddles the lead surgeon touches oscars chest we see under his skin is filled with fluid
he taps the resident doctor on the shoulder and shakes his head
he looks up at the clock
time of death am
he pulls off his mask frustrated and walks out
oscars convulsions stop
a morbid continuous beep echoes from the the lead surgeon walks out and wanda is still in the circle praying
the nurse goes over to her pulls her aside
wanda approaches the lead surgeon with a hopeful look in her eyes
she reads his eyes for a beat
the lead surgeon looks at her for a beat
and shakes his head
wanda puts her face in her hands her legs wobble
sophina who was watching and listening closely sees this
she breaks down buries her face in oscars hoodie
daryl and ceephus run over to wanda just as he arrives her legs buckle a bit he catches her
oscars friends begin to break down

the lead surgeon nods
but its a homicide so they cant let you in the room with him ok
how many of you will be coming down
wanda are you sure
nurse looks at the surgeon
i can take her down
he heads towards the exit doors with wanda
the nurse walks wanda through a long corridor
wanda steps up to the glass and looks into it
the mortician pulls back a white sheet and we see oscars mangled body lying on the slab
i told him to catch the train
i told him to catch bart
i didnt know they were gonna hurt him
i didnt know
i should have just let him drive
i should have let him drive
i wanted him to be safe

sophina sits in a chair still smelling oscars hoodie her head spinning
reporters are starting to show up at the hospital
we see katie there still wearing the same clothes talking to brandons father pointing at her cellphone
sophina looks up at a flat screen television in the hospital sees a report that showing oscars picture
she takes out her cellphone
dials a number puts it to her ear

sophina hangs up the phone and runs over to brandons father

sophina lets herself into the house
we see rose in the bathroom sitting on the stool grief stricken
sophina turns into the den where tatiana and her cousins are still asleep
she steps over them to get to tatiana
t come on
tatiana groggily wakes up
sophina picks her up
sophina walks in and looks around the house
tatiana walks inside
and goes straight for oscar and sophinas bedroom
time to go to chuck e cheese
tatiana comes out of the bedroom looking confused
come on t we gotta take a shower
the same shower from earlier
sophina turns the water on helps tatiana with her clothes and puts her in
she takes off her own clothes and steps in as well
is the water okay t

sophina tries to find her words
lets the water run on her face for a bit then rubs down the friz in tatianas hair
remember when i told you about god
and the angels
and about how when we die we go to heaven
well god needed another angel so he took daddy to come and live in heaven with him
tatiana looks at sophina for a long beat
but i dont want daddy to live in heaven
i want him to be with me

tatiana thinks about this
well does he have his cellphone
maybe if i call him and talk to him he will come back
daddy doesnt have his cellphone baby
