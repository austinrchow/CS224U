written by michael blake final draft a black screen
the sound of a knife cutting through boot leather
fade in on the waists of two men the surgeons hovering around a crude operating table
in the extreme background two stretcher bearers are just leaving
is this the last one
one of the bearers stops and looks back
his face is numb
and he nods hollowly
we cannot see the patient stretched out on the table
but we do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the mans boot off
god what a mess
at least theres no gangrene
there will be if it doesnt come off
well i cant saw if i cant keep my eyes open
lets coffee up
he can wait a few more minutes
as the two surgeons duck through a tent flap in the background we see a mangled foot torn by shrapnel it oozes blood from a cut clear to the bone
lieutenant john j
dunbars eyes are now open
hes a young man his features sharp and handsome
with effort he lifts his head and searches the room
his eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in bloodsoaked sheets
hes whimpering like a child
dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table
as his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs
a cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the boots
lieutenant dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table
he tries to pull it on his mangled foot but the pain makes him cry out
deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a piece of it between his teeth
tears of pain are rolling down his face
a sweat has broken out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls the boot on
the two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee their white coats spattered with blood
their brief respite is interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream
together they turn and rush back into the tent
the operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small pool of blood
dunbar is gone
in a natural valley below is a peaceful field
and on either side of the field seperated by a hundred yards of green are low rock walls
several dairy cows are lying dead in the field
a group of mounted union officers ride onto the crest of the hill and look down at the field
the distinguished man with a long grey beard is general tide
ragged confederate soldiers crouch sullenly behind one of the walls
and just behind the other wall are union men better equipped perhaps but just as weary as their enemies
we hold on one man an enlisted soldier sergeant pepper
he chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight
a solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him
the sun is at his back giving him a ghostly feel
eerily he takes a step or two forward
hes limping badly
the sergeant recognizes him
dunbar says nothing
he just stands and stares
it unnerves the sergeant
whatre you doing here lieutenant
this is where i belong
this is my outfit
the sergeant stares at dunbars foot
you went to hospital
it was no good
whats going on here
a ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant dives for the wall
he calls over his shoulder
better come to cover lieutenant
those boys are shooters
dunbar settles next to the sergeant
whats goin on here
seems to be the question alright
you could ask the major but he dont know
hes busy tryin to figger out how come the officers mess run outta peach ice cream
the sergeant nods at the distant hill and dunbar looks too
generals come up to see the show but all he knows is there aint no show
now he nods toward the trees behind them and the lieutenant follows
several union men are clustered around a huge hunk of material attached to a gondola
we started a balloon up but they shot her down fore she was ten feet off the ground
so nobodys made a run either way
its been a stand off all damn day
the major hes lookin at the general and hes thinkin i better do somethin and you know what that means
more riflefire comes in and some of the union men answer with a few rounds of their own
the sergeant watches the confederate line across the field through a crack in the wall
lieutenant dunbar is not watching the enemy
hes looking at some horses picketed in the trees behind the union lines
theres a nice bay
theres a big roan
theyre sposed to be beat up just like us but everybody knows that tuckers men are tough as cobs
i sure dont wanna die out there with them cows
dunbar is still watching the horses
hes holding on a small well muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the others
now he moves away from the wall heading for the horses
the sergeant squeezes off a shot
squinting across the field he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet waving at him disrespectfully
the sergeant rolls on his side to reload
he keeps on talking to the lieutenant but the lieutenant is gone
some of the boys are sayin that if we aint gonna fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high stakes poker
wouldnt that be a sight
a bunch of fellas sittin in the middle of this field drawin cards
the sergeants chatter is interrupted by a sound
the sound of hoofbeats rushing in behind him
men on either side are scattering but theres no time for the sergeant
he turns to the sound and cringes against the wall as the buckskinned belly of a horse soars over his head
dunbar and his horse hit the ground with a thud and dig for the confederate line
some of the confederate riflemen can see the wild rider headed for their lines
a sharpshooter ray calls over his shoulder
a man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks up from an impromptu meeting
like the others general tide is absorbed with the spectacle of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the enemy
he holds out his hand and an aide slips a pocket telescope into his palm
the general sights through his telescope
what is it sir
tide lowers the telescope glances at the aide and peers back down at the field
looks like a suicide
dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now
theyre rising up behind the wall to aim and fire
fifty yards from the enemy line hes still unhit
he wheels the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak parallel to the confederate flank
the buckskin is charging hard his heels throwing out clumps of dirt
the firing is tremendous
the lieutenants hat is torn away
a slug lifts off one of the officers epaulettes but still no bullet finds him
the entire union line is standing strangely quiet in their disbelief
the lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and pulls the buckskin up at the far end of the field
the little horse is pitching and rearing ready for another run
the lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion but a sound coming across the field brings his head up quickly
a great cheer is rolling along the union line
general tide is furiously spurring his horse as he tears down the hill
his aides are trying desperately to keep up
theres action along the confederate line
the men dunbar passed are desperately trying to reload
those at the end are jeering taunting the lieutenant to take another pass
tucker is moving along the line
the battle ground has suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and tucker doesnt like it
come on you son of a bitch you wont make it a second time
alright by me
dunbar gazes down along his leg
blood is pumping from his wound
forgive me father
again he digs his heels into the buckskins flanks and they fly down the line
the confederates are trying to reload
a few are able to get off a hasty shot but theyre all too late
dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he approaches the other half of the confederate ranks
theyre standing ready like a firing squad
tucker has just reached the side of ray the sharpshooter
the lieutenant shuts his eyes lets the reins flop on the buckskins neck and spreads his arms as they thunder toward the line of riflemen
rays finger squeezes the trigger his keen eye sights down the barrel of his gun
a rifle ball buries itself in rays forehead
the union trooper who fired the fatal shot gets up from a kneeling position and scrambles after some of his comrades
with his aides coming behind general tide leaps his horse over the wall at a dead run
the entire union line pours after him screaming a thunderous battlecry in unison
pepper is one of the last to scurry over the wall
the union troops have the rebels in full flight chasing them into the woods beyond the field
suddenly the field is quiet
there is rifle fire in the distance but otherwise everything is still
the field is almost empty
the three dead dairy cows are still there
and at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse
his rider lies on the ground a foot hooked in one stirrup
the sound of mens voices is coming near
suddenly general tide is peering down at him
dunbar stares back glassy eyed
dont take off my foot
general tide stares down into dunbars blank face
he kneels next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear
you rest easy son
youll keep youre foot
as god is my judge youll keep it
the general looks up at one of his aides
bring up my ambulance
bring up my ambulance
and bring my surgeon with it
weve got an officer whos worth something lying here
the aide dashes off to do what hes told as general tide gently removes dunbars foot from the stirrup and lays it carefully on the ground
the image fades out
the image of a boot fades in pull back to see that a lone rider is coming toward us
he has had a long and dusty trip
its lieutenant dunbar
hes still riding the little buckskin
dunbar pulls up short
he stares thoughtfully at something in the distance
the strangeness of this life cannot be measured
in trying to produce my own death i was elevated to the status of a living hero
dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover his back
in the distance we can see an isolated and dreary military post
the sky is very blue
the sun is bright
a rough hewn unfenced fort is straight ahead
there are several miscellaneous stone structures a well stocked stable barracks officers quarters and in the center of it all a headquarters building
lieutenant dunbar riding straight and tall on his powerfully built buckskin cisco passes into view
hes headed for the center of the fort
silhouetted against the outside lieutenant dunbar pauses in the wide doorway of headquarters
we can hear the distant sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here its strangely quiet
a sergeant sits at a desk in the foyer
across the way at another desk is an enlisted clerk
both men glance from their paperwork at the man in the doorway
but its only a glance and they go right on shuffling paper
footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue eyed officer with slick black hair swings into the foyer
he too has a slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post
the blue eyed officer lieutenant elgin and dunbar meet at the doorway
dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his hand
where can i find major
all the way to the end of the hall
being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle awhile but dunbar is eager
hes already moving
dunbar stops and turns peering down the hallway
no one is there
sitting behind the desk holding a set of orders is major lt
dunbar is standing in front of the desk
indian fighter huh
indicating paper your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier
the frontier is indian country
i quickly deduced that you are an indian fighter
he arches an eyebrow challenging the lieutenant
he has sad swollen eyes
he is an army lifer passed over too many times for promotion and right now does not look like a well man
i did not ascend to this position by being stupid
fambrough returns to the order
dunbar watches him in silence
the majors tunic is covered with food stains
sweat has broken out all over his head
his grooming is awful
his hands are trembling slightly
something is very wrong with him
now the major sees something on the official paper
he looks quickly at the lieutenant then back at the paper moving his lips but making no sound
it says here youve been decorated
and they sent you out here to be posted
actually sir im here at my own request
i want to see the frontier
you want to see the frontier
before its gone
the major fixes dunbar with a sly look
such a smart lad coming straight to me
still sly fambrough digs into a side drawer
there is the distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages
now fambrough has what he wants a blank official form
he begins to fill it out writing in a disturbingly childish way
sir knight i am sending you on a knights errand
you will report to captain cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm
he looks over his work with a schoolboys excitement and affixes his signature with a wild flourish
my personal seal will assure you safe passage through many miles of wild hostile country
he folds the order and hands it to dunbar
im wondering sir how will i be getting there
you think i dont know
no sir its just that i dont know
hold your tongue
the major turns in his chair to stare through a single dusty window
he can see a teamster outside tying down canvas on a heavily loaded wagon
im in a generous mood and will grant your boon
you see that peasant
he calls himself timmons
he leaves this very afternoon for your fort sedgewick
ride with him if you like
he knows the way
that is all
dunbar stands and salutes
fambrough returns it snappily
the lieutenant starts for the door
dunbar turns around
fambrough is standing in front of his desk
theres a large dark splotch on the majors trouser front
he jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and giggles
i just pissed in my pants
and nobody can do anything about it
lieutenant dunbar skips down the steps picks up ciscos reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front of the building
he looks briefly at his orders stops and turns back towards fambroughs office
and there is fambrough with a full glass of booze in hand toasting the young lieutenant from the window
a wide grin on his face
a wagon is pulling slowly away from the lonely headquarters
the insane face of major fambrough peeks around the corner of a building
on his head is a ridiculous plumed hat
now he looks both ways as if preparing to cross a busy street
seeing that the coast is clear he minces into the parade ground in front of headquarters
the plume is waving in the breeze and the major carries something in each hand
an officers sword and a revolver
except for these items the unfortunate major is naked
as he trots onto the parade ground fambrough is startled to find that elgin is following him
he begins to run faster
fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground and turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol menacingly
its alright major
now elgin sees a grizzled sergeant approaching fambrough from the opposite direction
leave him alone lieutenant
fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his pistol at the sergeant
but fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of the sergeants raised pistol
in a panic fambrough wheels back on lieutenant elgin
are you deaf fool
i said ill have my crown this instant
slowly and kindly elgin is walking toward him
he holds out his hand
lets have the pistol
to elgin dont do it
but the lieutenant keeps his hand held out
fambrough eyes him silently
then he screws up his face like a crybaby
the king is dead
long live the king
in one swift motion fambrough brings the revolver up swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger
at the sound of a single shot behind him dunbar twists around on the wagon seat
seeing nothing he turns back to face the front and takes stock of the driver timmons
he doesnt like what he sees
timmons is not what would be called a credit to his race
if all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their absolute ruler
his stink must be incredible
he leans over the side of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of spittle
afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean of prairie
the wagon passes camera headed towards an endless expanse of prairie
the sky is filled with stars
one suddenly catches fire and shoots across the heavens
dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out
timmons is bending over the fire
he farts then turns to dunbar with a smile good one huh
he spits for good measure and for dunbar the moment is broken but not forgotten
were it not for my companion i believe i would be having the time of my life
he is quite possibly the foulest person i have ever met
looking over his shoulder at the journal we see that this latest entry is one of many and dunbar is embellishing it with a drawing of a star
dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies
he is writing in his journal
we have been gone four days now and still we have seen no signs of life
only earth and sky
dunbar stops his writing
how far do you make the fort
forty or fifty miles maybe
whats the big hurry on sedgewick
its going to be my post
you aint hard to please ill say that
timmons slows the wagon and stops
he has seen something
a cluster of bones bleached white are lying in the tall grass
dunbar is squatting next to them
timmons head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamsters mouth splits into a toothless grin
somebody back east is sayin
why dont he write
the teamster spits and starts for the wagon
dunbar comes to his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon
then he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel
looking off he can only guess at the drama here
the sun is sinking fast below the great expanse of prairie
a hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat captain cargill is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope
one hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw
he sticks the telescope in his overcoat pocket
he wedges a hand into his mouth and wiggles a loose tooth
he gives it a tug but it is not ready to come out
the breeze is coming up and captain cargill pulls his overcoat closed
as he slips his last button through the hole it breaks off bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet down the bluff
captain cargill watches the button forlornly making no move to go after it
he raises his head once more and looks to the east
nothing is out there
cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank
he stops staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff
their entrance covered with found draperies of all description
he works up the courage to call out
corporal guest you dont have to talk to me
just please come out
at last theres some real movement behind one of the holes and corporal guest crawls through one of the curtains
he neither salutes nor speaks
he blinks down at cargill looking more like a hobo than a soldier
its the end
assemble the men in front of my quarters
the men have lined up in front of cargills sad sod hut pitiful men
sick moth eaten crushed in spirit
there are nine of them
just behind cargill is a half collapsed supply house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses
cargill has a brave face and a broken heart
you hate me
but i feel none of the same for you
you men stayed
you stayed after they took all our horses
you stayed after all the others deserted
you stayed on the promise that the army would resupply us
ive looked for that wagon from fort hays just as you have
day after miserable day
all i can say is that im proud of you
get your things men were leaving this place
can go to hell
the zombie troops have already broken ranks lurching back to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks
cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign that hangs askew above his quarters fort sedgewick
a solitary wolf trots along the top of a bluff overlooking the river
he has two white socks running up his front legs
an old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle
hes watching the ruins of fort sedgewick
the little band of troops all on foot with their two lame horses trailing behind are fading in the distance
the wagon is parked in a shallow depression its team unhitched
under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled up in blankets
dunbar is sleeping peacefully his nose pressed against a jacket
now his nostrils begin to twitch
his face turns sour and he wakes to find that hes been sleeping against the stink of timmons
flies buzz about the teamsters sleeping body
dunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell
he rolls out from under the wagon and clambers to his feet
lieutenant dunbar looks out over the prairie
its going to be a spectacular day
in the far distance a column of buzzards is circling
dunbar has paused to watch them
he ducks back under the wagon
no response from the deep sleeping driver
dunbar starts to move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes him think twice
he snatches up the arrow and probes under the wagon
the teamster comes awake with a squeal he joins dunbar staring up at the circling birds
somethings out there
might have a look
might stay clear of whatever did the killin
timmons mood is different now
he begins to hitch the team with a new sense of urgency
from a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving west
and no more than half a mile away we can see cargills column moving east
neither is aware of the others presence
several buzzards are settling on a half butchered horse
its one of the animals that was with cargills command
we can hear men singing
the shaky little column from fort sedgewick is marching east for fort hays
dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall rich grass
the wagon is nowhere in sight
he looks back at cisco who is also wandering by himself searching for prime shoots
timmons wagon comes into view now
how come we havent seen any buffalo
cant figger the stinkin buffalo
sometimes you dont see em for days sometimes theyre thick as curls on a whore
what about indians
goddamn indians youd jus as soon not see lessen the bastardsre dead
nothing but thieves and beggars
timmons as usual laughs at his own imagined wit
the wagon disappears over a ridge and again dunbar is alone
in gentle awe he runs his palm over the top of the grass swirling about his waist
a meadow larks mournful call startles him
dunbar brings his head up at the sound and so does cisco
now theres a sudden lifting of the breeze
it sweeps through the valley making the grass roll with a life of its own
the larks sad call and the sudden violent movement of the wind sends a shudder through lieutenant dunbar
he scans the horizon in all directions aware all at once of his aloneness
he flips the reins over ciscos neck and sticks a foot in the stirrup
dunbar heads for the ridge
as dunbar comes over the hill he sees the wagon has ground to a stop
the wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff
dunbar and timmons are peering into the little valley below not what youd call a going concern
the wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down
we see the pathetic remains of fort sedgewick
a full view of the deserted fort
timmons sits on the wagon by himself
aint nothin here lieutenant
dunbar appears from cargills former quarters
everybodys run off
or got kilt
the lieutenant looks briefly at timmons and marches over to the caved in supply house
again he ducks inside
dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at the wagon driver
lets unload the wagon
what and leave it all here
im staying too
we dont know whats happened
dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon
there aint nothin here lieutenant
not at the moment no
so things bein the way they are we might as well turn around and get started back
this is my post
this is my
are you crazy boy
the lieutenants eyes have gone absolutely black
the heel of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long revolver at his hip
this is my post
and these are the posts provisions
now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload
timmons leaps down
the half caved in supply house bulges with supplies
cargills late quarters are also filled with new goods
theres barely enough room to reach the little bunk
timmons is atop his wagon seat reins in hand
ill let em know where you are
good luck lieutenant
timmons clucks to his team and the wagon pulls out
the light on the prairie is fading fast
the wolf with two socks is patrolling along the edge of the river
a lamp turns up casting a glow over dunbars incredibly cramped quarters
he adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk his journal on his lap
he begins an entry
have arrived to find fort sedgewick deserted
am now waiting for the garrisons return or word from headquarters
post is in exceedingly poor condition
have decided to assign myself clean up duty beginning tomorrow
the country is everything i dreamed it would be
there can be no place like this on earth
dunbar signs the entry yawns contentedly and reaches to turn down the lamp
a wolf howls somewhere outside
its low at first but it keeps on building
at its height the howl sounds as though it is coming from something gigantic
dunbar is still listening after its gone
he hears wood snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again
without hesitating he slips the big revolver out of its holster and cradling it like a teddy bear slips it under his blanket
the light is left blazing
first light over the sad fort
dunbar is sleeping quietly
he opens his eyes and rears his head to get his bearings
then he flops back down and shuts his eyes hoping for more sleep
he hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession
dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway
quietly he pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway
suddenly a shadow starts across the threshold followed quickly by ciscos big buckskin head
the horse watches dunbar a moment then looks curiously around the room
dressed in pants old boots and a threadbare shirt dunbar bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate
he tests the gates swing and satisfied with this he latches it leaving cisco inside
the lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he walks the few quick yards it takes to reach the bank overlooking the river
when he sees what lies along the slope below he stops
at this spot just below the fort a garbage dump falls away to the stream
old containers sacks rags trash bottles and a thousand other miscellaneous scraps
dunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down the gentle incline eyeing the trash as he goes
now he reaches the stream and kneels preparing to dip the bucket
he sniffs a bad odor looks across the stagnant stream and sees something sticking out of the water
its a cloven hoof
and further out another
and part of an antler
there are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere
an antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck
dunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through deep water
covering his face against the stink is a bandana
his pants are soaked and hes sweating hard
at the streams edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile holding several others
under the bodies is a huge bed of trash which he has already collected
the body he tosses up slips and he has to right it
now he wades back into the river and searches the water with his hands for more
dunbar fastens the last of the traces to a pile of garbage spread out on a sheet of canvas
he picks up a set of long reins clucks to cisco and they start up the steep bank with the load
a distinct change has taken place with the water
oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap
dunbar empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto the pile
he takes the match hes been holding between his teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail
he flips it onto the heap
the fire catches immediately and dunbar has to back away a few steps as the flames send a column of thick black smoke into the air
to dunbars horror the smoke billows bigger and bigger
climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see
he stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the slope
the lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to scan the horizon
but we continue following the black smoke as it towers higher and higher until it is just a wisp
four fantastic faces fill the screen three together one a little apart
they are tired frustrated faces and also very fierce
they are painted
several wear their hair in spiked roaches one has brightly colored eagle feathers jutting out of his scalp at all angles
the four warriors are naked from the waist up
they are pawnee the scariest of all the plains tribes
the man a little apart looks the toughest
the four men are squatting on their haunches and four scrawny ponies stand behind them
all the men are staring in the same direction from a low rise on the prairie
its smoke a column much smaller than dunbars
the smoke is drifting up from the furthest of a line of rolling gullies
we can see the whole indian party now the four men and their ponies two injured men on travois and two extra ponies
only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see
maybe theres more than one
the toughest turns back to face the others
without another word he jumps on his horse
another silence as the three warriors consider what to do
we have no rifles
white men are sure to have rifles
we should forget this and go home
the toughest has listened all the while growing more and more disgusted
he pulls the blanket from his shoulders and flings it angrily at his companions
i for one will not debate the merit of a single line of smoke in my own country
he starts his pony walking down the rise toward the smoke
shaking his head he will not quit until we are all dead
the third pawnee starts after the toughest
the other two follow
were dropping down through the smoke right down to the supper fire of timmons the teamster
hes cooking slab bacon in a pan
risking the heat he dips a finger into the pan and sucks off the grease
theres a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split second later an arrow goes deep into the wagon drivers ass knocking him clear across the fire
timmons screams like a half butchered hog and starts into an odd crippled run
he clears the gully where hes been camped and struggles up the incline
another swish and another scream as another arrow catches him high on the shoulder
terrified with pain and fear timmons looks back as he scrambles up the slope
here comes the toughest at a lazy gallop
hes riding only with his legs
his hands are busy with bow and arrows
casual but blink quick the toughest snatches another arrow from the quiver at his waist strings it and fires
this arrow catches timmons in the gut
he falls squirming against the slope
the toughest is still coming his face like granite as he fires arrow after arrow
the three warriors who came with the toughest have reached the wagon
two of them are slicing away harness on the team of nice army horses
the third is rifling through timmons gear
this man unwittingly picks up timmons blanket
when he gets a whiff of its stink the warrior flings it far out on the grass
then he drops to one knee scoops up some dirt and rubs it between his soiled hands
a lone arrow remains in timmons dead body jutting out of his privates
now the pawnee warriors pass by heading for home in no particular hurry
the toughest passes by with timmons scalp hanging from his bow
none of the men give timmons a parting glance
were close on dunbar his face is grimy with sweat and dirt
hes working hard at something
we pull back and see that dunbar is half way up the bluff hes been filling up the pockmarks the holes where cargills men once lived
exhausted he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses to look over his work all of the holes have been filled
his eyes sweep over the prairie across the river
he sees something moving its the wolf
dunbar instinctively goes for his rifle
before he can bring it up to aim he has second thoughts
he lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer then walks up the hill and disappears into the sky
fingers are playing with a button
it appears to be the same one that came off captain cargills coat
dunbar stands atop the hill sighting across the prairie
no sign of captain cargills command
i dont know what to do
communication can only take place if i leave and i dont want to abandon my post
he sticks a hand in his overcoat pulls out a piece of dried meat and bites off a hunk
dunbar starts down the hill toward the fort
he watches the horizon as he goes
made a short patrol yesterday p
will go further tomorrow
his long day has drawn to a close
dunbar sits on the stoop of his quarters
his journal open in his lap
the sign over the doorway has been straightened
dunbar is staring at something
one hundred yards away sitting in the grass is the outline of a wolf
there is a wolf who seems intent on the goings on here
he does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and aside from cisco has been my only company
he has appeared each afternoon for the past two days
he has milky white socks on both feet
if he comes calling tomorrow i will name him two socks
with a grunt dunbar lugs an army saddle out of the supply house and starts for the door
he slows to a stop and stares down at the saddle as if in a trance
in a moment he is tossing the saddle back where he found it
dunbar is leading cisco to the top of a low hill
he glances over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed
the wolf with two socks stops when dunbar looks back at him
dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues leading cisco up the hill
but now hes glancing regularly over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves so does the wolf
reaching the top of the hill dunbar pauses
he pulls out the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie
there is nothing
now dunbar swings onto ciscos bare back and with a last glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the open prairie at an easy canter
we follow for a little distance
dunbar glances once more over his shoulder
the wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching
he has decided to come no further
considerable time has passed
dunbar bundled warmly against the chill of an oncoming storm and cisco are coming back into camp from a hunting foray
a brace of grouse is slung over ciscos withers
its storming outside
rain is pouring down its patter broken from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and the boom of thunder
but inside its cozy
the quarters are still crowded but considerable order has been brought to bear on the place
he is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits on the table
open at his side is his journal
almost a month and no one has come
the longer this condition persists the less inclined i am to believe that anyone will
rain has forced me indoors for most of two days
i have begun an awning
the work has ruined my hands but i am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place
a great bolt of lightning strikes outside filling the room with violent white light
dunbar walks to the door and tosses out a handful of bones
two socks scurries to collect the bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree
it is the loneliest of times
but i cannot say that i am unhappy
just as dunbar did on his trip out with timmons someone is running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass
this hand however is red
a lone indian is standing in the grass his pony at his side
he is a real indian tough wild and free
he is a person of special maturity
he radiates wisdom and is a man of responsibility in his community
he is a sioux medicine man
he is kicking bird
dunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream pounding the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge
he rises wringing out the pants and wades across the river
on the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush
then he looks along the river
for some distance every bush and shrub is draped with the lieutenants laundry all of it drying in the sun
the spectacular face of kicking bird is staring at something
hes looking thoughtfully at the new fort sedgewick the tidy grounds the great awning the repaired corral
the beautiful buckskin standing inside
comfortable with his nakedness dunbar is meandering along the stream in no particular hurry
hes very white
his skin practically sparkles in the sun
dunbar is making his way up the bluff
the steepest part is at the lip and here he drops to all fours
dunbars face comes into view
someone is creeping under the shade of the awning
an aboriginal man
dunbars head pops down behind the bluff
the lieutenant is down on his naked haunches
his heart is pounding in his ears
sweat has broken out on his face
his mouth is dry as ash
hes playing back images in fragments
a deerskin shirt strands of hair sewn along each sleeve
a dark faded breechclout
moccasins with beading
a single large feather drooping behind a head of shiny black hair
braids wrapped in fur
a lethal stone club hanging from a red hand
no eyebrows on a magnificent primitive face
dunbar stays in a crouch trying to think on jellied legs
his breathing has quickened
his mouth is open
a horses whinny startles him
ever so slowly the lieutenant peers over the bluff
the aboriginal man is in the corral
hes walking slowly toward cisco
one hand is held out reassuringly the other is grasping a rope
hes making gentle cooing sounds and is only a step or two from being able to loop his line over the horses neck
kicking bird jumps straight into the air
as he lands he whirls to meet the voice that startled him
dunbar is coming
his hands are clenched and his arms are swinging stiffly at his sides
kicking bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror
with a sharp intake of breath he staggers back a few steps
then he turns and runs tearing through the corral fence as if it were made of twigs
he leaps onto his horse and quirts the pony into full gallop
dunbar is watching from the yard
his jaw is clenched his hands are still fisted
the great grassland is empty
kicking bird is gone
the first of three carbine boxes is lugged off the stack
the three boxes are stacked on the open prairie
suddenly a shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the crates
another flying shovelful
have made first contact with a wild indian
one came to the fort and tried to steal my horse
do not know how many more are in the vicinity but i am taking steps for another visitation
am burying excess ordnance lest it fall into enemy hands
the last square of sod is placed carefully on the surface of the earth
dunbar drives a bleached rib bone into the ground at an angle just in front of his cache
dunbar steps back from his work
the replaced sod is invisible
the guns will not be found
the lieutenant sits atop cisco scouting along the bluff
fort sedgewick lies in the background
dunbars journal lies open on his bunk
we hear a digging sound in the background
the lieutenant is facing the wall of his quarters
using a bayonet as a cutting tool he has carved a window out of the sod
hes nearly finished and is just tidying up
have made all the preparations i can think of
i cannot mount an adequate defense but will try to make a big impression when they come
finished he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at his new window
he glances at the journal by his side and has a thought
he picks it up and starts to write
the man i encountered was a magnificent looking fellow
an old indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge
his skin is leathery his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are bright as diamonds
he is ten bears well past sixty but still strong enough to be the head man
he is for the most part oblivious to the grandchild squirming in his lap
hes smoking a long stemmed pipe but the main object of his interest is an old woman squatting next to him
shes pounding away at something in a bowl
ten bears looks up to notice kicking bird
the medicine man is passing not far away and ten bears eyes follow him carefully not glancing away until kicking bird has ducked into his lodge
kicking bird has been keeping to himself these last few days
i do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone
the old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond
what does his wife say
he is keeping to himself
ten bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles
thats what she says
ten bears accepts this
then he looks down at the bowl
make sure that meat is soft
my teeth hurt
ten bears looks once more at the entrance of kicking birds lodge
kicking bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but he is preoccupied with something
there is a rustle of movement at the tent flap and ten bears peers in
may i come in
the little boy races over to the old chief kicking bird makes a move to pull him back but ten bears indicates the boy should stay
no no let him sit with me
there is silence as the two men settle themselves by the fire the little boy content in ten bears lap
our country seems good this summer but i have not been out to see it
it is good
the grass is rich
the game is plenty and not running away
i am glad to hear it
but the buffalo are late
i always worry about the bellies of our children
a brief silence
i was thinking of a dance
yes a dance is always a good idea
it would be good to have a strong sign
kicking bird seems suddenly uncomfortable
the little boy leaves
theres a funny thing about signs
they are always flying in our faces
we know when they are bad or good but sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them
sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign into himself and let it run around for two or three days
if he is still confused he will tell somebody
he might come to you or to me and tell it
a smart man always does that
ten bears picks up the pipe and puffs away seemingly without care
i have seen such a sign
i saw a man a white man
ten bears eyes get big for a moment
then he thinks
he was naked
ten bears thinks some more
are you sure it was a man
i saw his sex
did you speak to him
ten bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands
we will council on this
a teenaged boy smiles a lot and his two buddies otter and worm lie prone outside ten bears home
they are peeking under the tipis rolled up sides
their eyes are wide for inside theres plenty to see and hear
the villages most influential warriors have squeezed into the lodge for this big and important meeting the eldest and most respected men of the band including ten bears his pal
stone calf an influential warrior named wind in his hair and kicking bird are seated around the fire
crowded around them in a high state of excitement are the villages leading warriors
the meeting is in progress
he might be a god or he might be a special chief thats why we are thinking of having a talk with him
there is a little murmuring around the fire and it goes silent
wind in his hair rises to speak
i do not care for this talk about a white man
whatever kind of white man he is he is not sioux and that makes him less
weve camped here for ten days now and each day our scouts find nothing
one old bull with wolves tearing him apart nothing more
we need meat not talk
you are right we need meat today and tomorrow
but we must also have meat in ten years
kicking bird pauses here
everyone is listening attentively
but the whites are coming
our friends the shoshone and the kiowa even our enemies agree on this the whites are coming
more than can be counted
kicking bird is always looking ahead and that is good
but when i hear that more whites are coming more than can be counted i want to laugh
we took a hundred horses from these people there was no honor in it
they dont ride well they dont shoot well theyre dirty
they have no women no children
they could not even make it through one winter in our country
and these people are said to flourish
i think they will all be dead in ten years
there is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and wind in his hair is riding the crest of it
i think this white man is probably lost
this parting shot prompts a good natured round of laughter
wind in his hair has spoken straight his words are strong and i have heard them
its true the whites are a poor race and its hard to understand them
but when i see one white man alone without fear in our country i do not think he is lost
i think he may have medicine
i see someone who might speak for all the white people who are coming
i think this is a person with which treaties might be struck
this white man cannot cover our lodges or string our bows or feed our children
i will take some good men
there are many here tonight
we will ride to the soldier fort we will shoot some arrows into this white man
if he truly has medicine he will not be hurt
if he has no medicine he will be dead
this is the best idea so far and there is much talk around the fire
they quiet down as ten bears prepares to speak
it is easy to become confused by these questions
it is hard to know what to do
no man can tell another how he will be
but i know this
killing a white man is a delicate matter
if you kill one more are sure to come
we should talk about this some more
he drops his head closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep
the meeting is over
inside the meeting is breaking up
but smiles a lot is no longer watching
hes lost in thought as if he has got something on his mind
now he comes out of it
with a last look into the lodge he sneaks off into the night
three boys otter worm and their leader smiles a lot are riding to the fort
smiles a lot stops just realizing that the other two have fallen behind
he rides back to investigate
whats the matter now
otter doesnt want to go
smiles a lot trots his pony over to otter
if we take the horse of a white god they will make up songs about us
they will ask us to go on raids
who gets the white god horse
but we share
you and worm can ride him too
who can say this is not a great plan
otter and worm have blank expressions
dunbar is snoring
the lantern is turned down low
a horse whinnies loudly and dunbar arises
in the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the yelping of indian boys
reeling with sleep dunbar is up and moving
he grabs a rifle and lurches for the door
as he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the wooden cross beam
his skull cracks resoundingly against the
overhang and dunbar slumps onto his back
the three boys are shrieking as they race across the prairie with their prize
otter has cisco by a lead line
smiles a lot gallops alongside
let me take him otter
i have him
to smiles a lots amazement otter is suddenly gone
hes zooming backward in midair
otter comes to ground a few yards back throwing up a puff of dust
cisco has screeched to a halt
now he rears up twisting until the rope is free of otter
then he sticks his tail in the air and makes tracks in the direction of the fort
worm chases after cisco as smiles a lot sees to otter smiles a lot pulls his pony up next to otter and peers down at the fallen boy
i dont know
my arm doesnt work
you shouldnt have fallen down
now well get in trouble
it was your idea
my idea was only to take the horse
this squabble is interrupted by worms return
he gallops up and jumps off his pony
otter hurt himself
worm shakes his head in frustration
otter grabs a handful of dirt and flings it at smiles a lot and worm
to worm youre not hurt
i will be when my father finds out his bow will be across my back
its growing light and dunbar is just coming to
he rolls to one side and touches the egg that has risen on his forehead
he hears movement in the yard and looks out
cisco is pawing the ground
the indian line still around his neck
dunbar is sitting naked in the shallow river below the fort
he has worked up a good lather on his face and is shaving
the big navy revolver and his gunbelt are slung over his shoulder
dunbar glances at the far bluff
two socks is sitting quietly watching the shaving ritual below
the lieutenant is finishing shaving his moustache
he stares onto the surface of the water trying to get it just right
once again he glances up at two socks
two socks attention has been diverted
hes on guard staring intently across the river
dunbar looks quickly at the bluff nearest the fort
everything is still
he looks back at two socks
the wolf is gone
the lieutenant hears something now
hoofbeats coming in a rush
he bursts from the water and scrambles up the incline
theyre streaming past him
five mounted warriors bunched around cisco raw powerful men on painted feathered ponies
wind in his hair is one of them
their faces are streaked with colorful designs their weapons slung around the shoulders their nearly naked bodies all sinew and bone
they are the full and breathtaking glory of war
dunbar is struck dumb
he stands still as the pageant passes in front of him
the sight of dunbar troubles wind in his hair so much that he pulls up a hundred yards away
he sits a moment on his whirling pony trying to decide if he should confront this white god
he makes a warriors choice
wind in his hair shouts to his fellows to go on and charges down the slope
straight for dunbar
dunbars eyes are fixed on the closing horseman
he cant move
wind in his hair is coming flat out his lance extended
at the last moment he pulls up so hard that the black pony skids to a sit
the horse is up quickly and hard to manage
he pitches back and forth only a few feet in front of lieutenant dunbar
i am wind in his hair
do you not see that i am not afraid of you
do you see
dunbar stares expressionlessly into the siouxs eyes
he doesnt blink
wind in his hair suddenly turns his pony and whips after his comrades
a big smile breaks out across his face
dunbar stares after the disappearing horse and rider
he feels the weight of the gun and lets it drop to the ground
for two or three steps he staggers toward the quarters but his legs give way and he falls face first in a dead faint
wind in his hair is riding hard and happy
he really fixed that white god
but as he clears the brow of a rise a riderless horse blows past him running in the opposite direction
ciscos running back to the fort at full speed the lines of two ropes flying behind him
the big warriors smile is gone
he wheels his pony and charges over the rise nearly colliding with another warrior who has been in hot pursuit of cisco
the warrior pulls up and looks helplessly at wind in his hair
but wind in his hairs attention is focused on the rest of his party
the three remaining warriors who rode with him are all on foot
one is bending over a man lying unconscious on the ground
the third is limping badly trying to catch his horse
wind in his hair glances back in the direction of the fort but the buckskin is already gone
he starts down the incline to help his friends
wind in his hair and his friends two of them riding double are going slowly home when they see a courier coming in their direction
they rein in waiting for the young man cantering toward them
he speaks directly to wind in his hair
the party that went against the pawnee is coming in
wind in his hair says nothing
there are many hearts on the ground
several travois are parked in a clearing
its a scene of terrible woe
on the travois are dead bodies
women members of several families are grieving as they collect the dead men
some are shrieking some are crying softly and some are beating themselves
one group is just beginning to hoist a body off its litter when a strange looking woman appears in the clearing
shes been running
her light cherry colored hair is tangled
her face is creased with pain and disbelief as she rushes forward crying out in sioux
she pushes through the other women and tackles the body taking it to the ground
she climbs atop the dead man cradles his head against her face and says a single word softly
it is his name and she whispers it again
of course there is no answer
with each saying of the name she is more desperate her voice growing louder and louder
she arches her back eerily and wails the name to the heavens before flinging herself back at the lifeless face
at last the other mourners feel compelled to drag her away
the little woman does not go easily
her name is stands with a fist
the lieutenant rides a silhouette against a harvest moon
i realize now that i have been wrong
all this time i have been waiting
waiting for what
for someone to find me
for indians to take my horse
to see a buffalo
lieutenant dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his best boots
hes putting the finishing touches on one of the toes
dunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect a dress tunic laid out on the bunk
his open journal is lying next to it
he picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at the smudges
since i arrived at this post i have been walking on eggs
it has become a bad habit and i am sick of it
tomorrow morning i will ride out to the indians
i do not know the outcome or the wisdom of this thinking
but i have become a target and a target makes a poor impression
i am through waiting
the buckskins ears are pricked and his eyes are set
something has his complete attention
the something is lieutenant john dunbar
he looks like a recruiting poster full dress uniform red sash saber clanking at his side hair tied in a neat pony tail knee length riding boots
and all of it is gleaming
from the brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt buckle
the red sash flutters and cisco shies to one side
dunbar slaps at the sash calms his horse and jumps on
we stop with them at the supply house
old glory is standing against one of the crumbling walls
the flag has been affixed to a long willow branch
dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the staff into one of his boots
they start off at a jog the flag popping in the stiff morning breeze
just as they are getting small in the distance two socks comes into view
lieutenant dunbar has ridden deep into the prairie
watching the sky he takes a drink out of his canteen
the lieutenant hears something he turns cisco in that direction
he listens harder
a weird sort of singing
warily he goes ahead
stands with a fist is sitting under a solitary cottonwood
her hands are folded on her lap
a blood stained knife is held between them
she has ritually slashed her arms
the cuts are not deep but all are running with blood
blood pours from a deep cut in her thigh
she lets her song fade to nothing and bows her head
she dabs at a large pool of blood spreading in the ground next to her thigh
suddenly shes alert
stands with a fist has heard something too
a strange popping sound
the gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty feet behind her on the top of the knoll
a white soldier is sitting on the horse
a white soldier with a sword a bright uniform and a red sash
and most amazing of all no face
a shift in the breeze has wrapped the popping red white and blue flag around his head
one of the soldiers hands is trying to claw it away from his face
dunbar pulls the flag away
its an indian woman alright
but now that she is staring at him open mouthed and afraid he can see that there is something odd about her
too late for further study
shes risen and has taken a slow step backward from the knoll
shes covered with blood
reflexively he offers a helping hand and calls after her
shes still backing down the hill her steps a little faster now
hes following her at a walk
shes reached the base of the knoll and has begun to run
dunbar is trotting after her
let me help you
shes too weak to run and falls face first in the grass
she starts to crawl
dunbar slips off cisco and reaches down tentatively for her shoulder
she screams at his touch and he pulls away
but he follows on foot as she crawls
you need help
he takes her again this time holding her firmly
she struggles mightily twisting onto her back
she lashes out at his face but he grabs her hands holding them tight
theyre nose to nose
he cant believe he heard it and she cant believe she said it
she spits out a stream of sioux curses throws her head back and wails like a wolf
then she passes out
shes lying in the same spot still unconscious
the cuts on her arms have been bandaged up with strips of old glory
modestly dunbar lifts her dress to get at the bad thigh wound
as he ties it off the lieutenant notices how white her skin is
he runs a finger over it
she is very still and he presses an ear to her heart
shes still breathing
dunbar is on cisco
his big impression is gone
the uniform and his hands and face are smeared with stands with a fists blood
the girl is slung in front of him
his arms are holding her
her face is pressed against his chest
theyve come a good distance and are approaching a smokey cloud
smiles a lot worm and otter who now sports a crude splint on his arm are occupying an open space in the midst of a huge pony herd
they should be on guard against enemies but the three boys are sitting on the ground absorbed in a gambling game
dunbar is skirting the edge of the herd
leaving the horses behind him the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope
a powerful vision is upon him
ten bears village is rising slowly like a curtain going up
the smoke from many fires the willow poles fanning against the sky the conical houses covered with well used hides the horses along the river the children the women the
an ancient tableau fully alive before his eyes
dunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village taking it all in
no one has seen him
he can hear human voices drifting up from the camp
stands with a fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the lieutenant moves cisco ahead at a walk
a woman and her children have come out of the breaks along the river and are marching back to the village when one of the kids sees him
with an ear splitting shriek the woman grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of the village
theres pandemonium amongst the lodges
everyone seems to be running everywhere at once
dunbar pulls cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first of the conical houses and slides off taking the girl up in his arms
the people of ten bears village realizing now that there is only one white man and that he is carrying someone are massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of
warriors some of them mounted have taken the front ranks
the women and children and elderly are standing just behind
initial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone jockeys for a better look
still holding stands with a fist in his arms dunbar suddenly stops on a familiar face
wind in his hair
he lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out
as in offering
the sioux buzz is stronger now
the mounted warriors are getting excited
suddenly wind in his hair breaks ranks and starts for dunbar at a determined walk
a nasty war club is held tightly in hand
dunbar stands his ground
wind in his hair halts only a few steps in front of dunbar
he barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two
you are not welcome here
another step and he is close enough to touch the white man
go away from us
dunbar doesnt flinch
and wind in his hairs harangue is definitely part bluster
hes very curious about the woman in dunbars arms and now he peers down at her face
the lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out of his grasp
holding her in one strong arm wind in his hair backs a pace or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant
go away from us
he raises his club and shakes it at dunbar
though he doesnt understand the words dunbar gets the message
as he goes for his horse wind in his hair marches back to his people with stands with a fist
there is great commotion as the crowd surges in around wind in his hair
with a look of profound disappointment dunbar walks away on cisco
otter worm and smiles a lot are riding in drawn by the ruckus in the village
they see the white soldier oh his horse leaving the camp
they see the tumult in the village and realize they are in trouble again
some of the young mounted warriors are shouting taunts at the departing soldier calling for him to come back and fight
they seem set to take out after him when kicking bird suddenly appears in front of their ponies
the soldier did not come to fight he is going away and we will let him
no one is going to argue with one of the bands leading men
the young warriors shout a few more taunts and turn away
the medicine man glances after the boys who just came in
each boy confronted now by an angry father or uncle is being jerked off his pony
theres going to be discipline
kicking bird looks back at the lieutenant
dunbars head is down and his shoulders are slumped
it is a sight that makes the wheels in kicking birds head turn
another council is in progress
as before the leading men are seated around ten bears fire while the other warriors stand packed in the shadows
wind in his hair is seated close to the elders
i am in agreement with kicking bird
we will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is
wind in his hair jumps into the conversation
if this council decides to talk with the man at the soldier fort then it will be so
but in my mind it is not right that a sioux chief a chief as great as ten bears goes to ask the business of a puny trespassing white man
a white soldier who has only a smart horse and a few white man clothes
there are many yeses in response to this
as is his custom ten bears lets the outburst subside seeming unruffled all the while
casually he pops a piece of meat into his mouth and begins to chew
i will not go
you will go
you and kicking bird
that is all i have to say
dunbar is sitting cross legged in the grass
his mouth is occupied with chewing
in one hand is a knife in the other is a chunk of slab bacon
he saws off a slice and extends it waiting patiently
the wolf is sitting only a few feet away
he wants the offered meat but cannot bring himself to eat from a human hand
finally dunbar flips the bacon into the grass and two socks pounces on it
he takes his prize toward the river and out of view
dunbar starts for his quarters
the hair on the back of his neck is standing straight up
six sioux warriors the escort are sitting atop their ponies high on the ridge
dunbar buttons his tunic and casts a quick backward glance at the quarters
a rifle is standing near the door
dunbar decides not to go after it
he straightens his bearings and he watches the approaching riders
its only two wind in his hair and kicking bird
the lieutenant bows at the waist
gesturing at them come
the two men slide off their ponies
dunbar throws an unreturned wave to the escort warriors
there is a moment or two of silence
would you like some coffee
there is no response
ill get some cups
dunbar disappears inside his quarters
wind in his hair and kicking bird are sitting comfortably under the awning each holding steaming army issue cups
they are staring straight ahead with a curious expression
dunbar is turning a handle on a machine
it is a coffee grinder
the last of the beans goes down and dunbar pauses for dramatic effect
then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh grounds and passes it to the medicine man
kicking bird and wind in his hair both sniff the contents
dunbar gestures at their still full mugs neither one of them has taken a drink
is the coffee not good
too strong maybe
dunbar reaches for a sack by the fire
holding it in front of him dunbar suggests that wind in his hair put some of its contents into his mug
wind in his hair finally does but his blank expression indicates that he doesnt know what difference this could make
dunbar takes a lick at his fingers suggesting that wind in his hair should do the same
a smile creeps over his face as the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold
wind in his hair has licked every bit off each finger
to kicking bird do you want some
wind in his hair doesnt wait for kicking birds answer
he reaches over and dumps a good amount in kicking birds cup adding some more to his own for good measure
so what are you guys doing
looking for buffalo
there is no response
wind in his hairs attention is now on cisco
hes a good one
wind in his hairs interest borders on rude
prompted by a light tap on his leg from kicking bird wind in his hair turns his attention back to dunbar
no argument from wind in his hair
you see any buffalo
kicking bird and wind in his hair are baffled
the lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the back of his tunic
wait just a bit
to kicking bird his mind is gone
kicking bird doesnt respond
hes still intent on the lieutenant
in wedging the blanket under his tunic dunbar has become a hunchback
he bends over in a weird attitude and with a finger peeking over each side of his head he begins a bizarre display of dancing punctuated with snorts and bellows
incorrectly in sioux buffalo
getting it right buffalo
kicking bird nods his assent and dunbar flashes a pleased smile
dunbar is watching kicking bird and wind in his hair walk their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort
each horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers
occasionally wind in his hair dips a hand into one of the bags and carefully licks each finger
dunbar waves up at them but there is no response
the sugar didnt figure to last at that rate any way
i dont believe id go too far in saying that a foundation for good relations is being laid
they have come again as always the same two with an escort of six
dunbar is standing in the same spot it is a new day leaving their ever present escort behind kicking bird and wind in his hair ride into the fort
kicking birds pony is carrying something large and bulky on his withers
a buffalo robe
dunbar walks up to greet them
kicking bird returns the welcome and signs to him as he speaks
have you seen any buffalo
dunbar can only shake his head no
kicking bird accepts this and dismounts
dunbar throws his customary wave but the escort remains noncommittal
dunbar is lying on his buffalo robe his hand runs against the grain of the thick fur
he begins writing in his journal
i believe i am dealing with kiowa indians as i have heard that word on several occasions
he rolls on his back and lays aside the journal practicing the hand signals
i am learning the kiowa words for head hand horse fire coffee buffalo hello and goodbye
high on a hill the indian escort waits stoically horses heads bowed in the drizzle
on the haunches of one of the ponies is a single deer
down below wind in his hair and kicking bird are still mounted and converse with dunbar using sign talk
no i havent seen any buffalo
are you hungry
i have food
are you hungry
dunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but kicking bird will not stand for this
he waves dunbar off
the three men say their goodbyes and dunbar as usual throws a wave to the six men on the hill
unexpectedly one of them returns it and the other five react with surprise
nothing i have been told about these people is correct
they are not beggars and thieves
they are not the bogeymen they have been made out to be
kicking bird and wind in his hair disappear over the hill followed by their escort
lightning bursts far out on the prairie
dunbar huddles beneath the warmth of his buffalo robe
he is finishing up the second of two drawings
it is a portrait of wind in his hair he carefully titles it the fierce one
he has already completed a likeness of kicking bird and underneath it the words the quiet one
several children are playing close by as stands with a fist works over a staked out hide scraping away the excess flesh
though her arms are lined with scabs her work is methodical and unforced
she seems recovered
stands with a fist
she looks up to see the medicine man looming over her
we will talk awhile
except for kicking bird and stands with a fist the tipi is empty
they are just seating themselves at the firepit in the center of the lodge
a brief silence during which kicking bird studies the girl with the bowed head
your wounds are healing well
you are happy here with my family
i am glad to be here
i am missing my husband
perhaps you will marry again when the time is right
kicking bird is leading up to something and stands with a fist fears it
she keeps her head bowed
we have word from many places that the whites are
kicking bird stops himself he knows this must be hard
she brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man waiting to hear more
they are coming into everyones country
they will soon be in ours i think
this white man who lives at the old soldier fort the one who calls himself loo ten tant
i have visited him and i believe his heart is a good one
he knows things about the whites which we do not
he pauses letting this sink in
i am afraid of the man at the fort
he is only one man
i am afraid that he will tell some whites that i am here
i am afraid that they will try to take me away
every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried
she is not much reassured by this
in the way of a defeatist she lowers her eyes once more
i cannot make the white man talk
loo ten tant does not know sioux
kicking bird waits
still she does not raise her head
you have a certain medicine which no other sioux man or woman has
it has been a long time since i made the talk
i do not ask this for myself
i ask this for all our people
its dead in me
i want you to try and remember the the word
i dont know how
you dont want to know
this outburst shocks stands with a fist she runs out of the lodge
stands with a fist rushes past black shawl her face covered with tears
now kicking bird comes out
black shawl looks at kicking bird his face is not happy
will she make the white words
perhaps i am asking too much
stands with a fist is tearing through the thick willows growing alongside the river
shes crying her heart out
the big cry is over but stands with a fist is still sniffling as she emerges on a little patch of beach next to the river
she sits herself down under a cottonwood and looks hollowly at the surface of the water in front of her
somewhere in the distance is the sound of many drums with a sigh she drops her head
then as if shocked by some unseen force her eyes spring open
wide and unblinking her eyes stare deeply into space
someone is calling
the voice is so faint at first that the word cant be heard
but the calling grows and suddenly the word is upon her
a little girl of seven christine is lying in the grass of a sod roof
next to her is ten year old willie
they are planning their wedding and staring up at the sky
like many youngsters shes not eager to heed the persistent call of her mother
where are you
reluctantly the little girl gets up and looks over the edge of the roof to see her mother holding yet another child
she seems anxious
im right here mother
get inside both of you
just do what i
stay where you are
keep down do you hear me
four pawnee are riding up in the background
two men are moving out to meet them
who is it willie
willie is peeking over the edge of the roof
an old muzzle loading rifle is by his side
he whispers to her
they look like pawnee
my father and your father are talking to them
down in the yard out beyond a rough table set with the leavings of a sunday dinner two white men on foot are talking to the four mounted pawnee warriors
its an argument
as a baby cries somewhere inside the house the two white men sign the indians to go away
the pawnee make no move to go however and with their patience at an end the two white men turn back to the house
one of the warriors brings his hatchet down and nails a white man between the shoulder blades
the injured man grunts and hops sideways
the other runs for the house but is cut down by arrows
women begin to scream
willie is scooting down the roof his face white with fear
he gives her a hard shove which sends her rolling down the roof
christine runs past the point where the roof meets the natural hillside and down into the draw
shes running toward us
in the background we can see willie on the edge of the roof aiming his squirrel gun into the yard
he fires once then grasping the gun like a club he leaps off the roof and disappears
christine never looks back
she runs up the draw as fast as her skinny young legs can carry her
the moon is up
christine is feebly clawing at the ground trying to pry herself out of a tiny hole
she gives up
then from the burrows dark entrance comes the thin cracking voice of a little girl
now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord my soul to keep
if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take
stands with a fist is still in shock
the drumming in the village is very loud now
she rises unsteadily to her feet and starts back to camp
the moon is full
as we look down on the fort we can hear a new sound coming off the prairie
a light rumbling
lieutenant dunbar is asleep in the moonlight
the rumbling is getting louder
it wakes him
he gropes about lights the lantern and listens to the strange powerful sound
somethings in the air
he holds the lantern toward the ceiling
particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from the roof
its the earth thats trembling
dressed in only pants and boots dunbar walks along the bluff above the river his lantern held out in front of him
the sound is tremendous now
dunbar stops as a great wall of dust rises before him
at the same time he realizes something is alive behind the wall of dust he recognizes the sound
the sound of thousands of hoofbeats
he sees one veer out
and now another
and another darting briefly from the great cloud of dust
the most powerful force on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force on earth as it thunders by
dunbar and cisco are running flat out in the moonlight
the village is coming up
a great fire is blazing at the far end
horse and rider speed past the first lodge
its an important mission for the lieutenant
as he gallops through the village he says one word over and over trying to remember the correct pronunciation
its the sioux word for buffalo
everyone has gathered around the great blaze
in the center of the circle close to the fire the buffalo men are dancing
others are dancing too
the music is very loud
the little buckskin is out of his head with speed
he doesnt answer the bit when dunbar first tries to pull him up
people scatter in all directions as dunbar and cisco charge into their midst
dunbar pulls back with all his might and the buckskin sits down
hes wet from his long ride and dunbar cant stay on his back
as cisco rears he slides off and tumbles onto his back
angry warriors pile on top of him
dunbar shouts out the word for buffalo yelling it over and over as the warriors pummel him
so many men have rushed into the fray that none can deal the lieutenant a decisive blow
they roll about in the dust
just as dunbars cries have begun to lose their strength he feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him
as the men pile off dunbar is left flat on his back
his lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose
hes looking into a familiar face
the mans head is covered with the full skin and feathers of an eagle
kicking bird doesnt understand or cant hear
he brings his face close to dunbars
making horns with his fingers buffalo
kicking bird raises up and yells it out to his people
the buffalo have come
for a fleeting moment there is shocked silence
then the sioux explode with excitement
still dazed dunbar is pulled to his feet
the people are surging in around him with yelps of joy
a wide stretch of prairie falling away to nothing
the buffalo have left a trail in the form of a tremendous swath of torn up ground several hundred yards from side to side
indians on horseback move into the picture
most of ten bears camp is moving out in a long noisy column
spirits are high
first come the lead scouts followed by ten bears and his advisors kicking bird and wind in his hair among them
a large body of warriors come next
behind these men are the women children and elderly
dunbar is riding at the head of the last group
the attitudes of the people have changed significantly
people who catch his eye are openly smiling at the lieutenant
an old woman comes alongside and offers him a piece of dried meat patting his hand as he takes it
here comes smiles a lot worm and otter all on ponies galloping up beside him
they want to play
loo ten tant
he motions for dunbar to break ranks and while the lieutenant is puzzling this out a chorus of cries comes from the columns front
three far ranging scouts are coming in at a run
the scouts pull up in front of ten bears to make their report
theres no way to know whats going on but something important is happening
wind in his hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the main body of warriors
a dozen warriors strip off their shirts and leggings
theyre ready in moments
then with wind in his hair leading them the party breaks away from the column and rides east at a gallop
the column resumes its southward march
the day has grown hot as the column continues its march through changing terrain
dunbar is suffering some
the heat and dust are monstrous
at the moment however hes most concerned with stands with a fist
shes riding closeby and he watches her with interest
its easier to see now that she was once white
suddenly she looks in his direction
the lieutenant quickly tips his hat but she turns her shy eyes away before he has finished the motion
kicking bird is riding down the line
the medicine man gestures dunbar forward and the lieutenant guides cisco out of line
through her tangled hair stands with a fist watches the soldier and the medicine man ride up the line
dunbar and kicking bird are riding together at the flank of ten bears entourage
far in the distance the lieutenant sees something strange on the prairie
pink bumps are dotting the landscape up ahead
and black specks are moving about on the bumps
beneath droves of scavenging black birds lies the body of a buffalo
his hide has been peeled off and his tongue has been cut out
the rest of his body has been left to rot in the sun
the column so noisy and happy before winds its way through the killing ground in silence
there must be twenty five buffalo like the one we saw close up all of them stripped and rotting
dunbar looks queasy
the lieutenant glances at the medicine man riding next to him
kicking bird looks sick too
dunbar looks away
the entire column is stretched along the killing ground looking
a naked cow covered with birds lies on her side
her new born calf doomed to death cries for his dead mother
and next to the calf dunbar sees something else
he sees wagon tracks and the booted footprints of white men
the column is clear of the killing ground and heading deeper into the prairie
they have left everything untouched
while kicking birds lodge rises behind her stands with a fist digs out a firepit
she looks up from her work
watching bashfully from several yards away is lieutenant dunbar
now that she has seen him he starts forward perhaps to try some more talk
loo ten tant
dunbar turns to find kicking bird sitting on a pony just behind him
two dozen mounted buffalo scouts are gathered around him
kicking bird points at cisco indicating that dunbar should join them
tipping his hat to stands with a fist dunbar hustles away to his horse
stands with a fist faces the pit shes digging not bothering to look up as hoofbeats drum their way out of the temporary camp
she seems to have lost herself in her own hands
the hands that are digging out the soft prairie earth
there is crying but when stands with a fist looks up there is just one of kicking birds children standing there smiling at her
she goes back to her digging
the first light streaks through the burrow entrance
christine is exerting herself mightily in an effort to move
but she cant and again she begins to cry
more sounds from down below in the canyon
and a whinny or two
no way to tell whether this is friend or foe
but she cant stay in the burrow
the hoofbeats are gone
louder help me
i need to get out
someone is coming up the slope
a moment later hands are clawing at the walls of the burrow and she is looking into three surprised sioux faces
the face in the center is recognizable
a younger kicking bird
two dozen riderless indian ponies are tethered at the base of the draw
with kicking bird and the other buffalo scouts lieutenant dunbar is sneaking up one side of the draw
they all reach the summit together and peer over
they are there by the thousands grazing quietly in the twilight
the buffalo scouts dunbar included are galloping back to the temporary camp
it looms ahead of them the hide covered lodges glowing like candles in the last light of day
a big fire is blazing in the center of camp
dunbar hangs back as the other riders go into the noisy camp
a special event of some kind is taking place
as he looks this scene over dunbar sees something remarkable
back in the shadows behind the fire is a wagon
dunbar and cisco pace back and forth on the fringes of the camp
the lieutenant searches for any sign of the white people who came in the wagon but finding none he focuses on the dancers moving in a circle around the big
one of the men waving his lance is wind in his hair
dunbars eyes track up the lance and there he finds the white people
hanging from wind in his hairs lance tip is a fresh scalp blonde and wavy
several of the other men have scalps too
none of the hair is indian
dunbar can see into the wagonbed now
a couple of dozen fresh buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed
its all come clear
the white men who killed the buffalo for hides and tongues have themselves been killed
dunbar slowly retreats into the shadows
cisco has been hobbled nearby and with the temporary camp glowing on the plains a half mile away dunbar spreads his blanket on the open plain
a huddled body lies covered by the army issue blanket
a moccasined foot comes into view and prods the blanketed shape
lieutenant dunbars waking face pops out of the blanket
standing over him is wind in his hair stripped of all but his breechclout
the barrel of his rifle is hanging downward swaying in front of the lieutenants face
it is occurring to the lieutenant that his time may have run out
the warrior swings his rifle into a shooting position sights after some imaginary game and imitates the rifles recoil
he stares down at dunbar with a smile lifts his rifle overhead and barks out a cry of victory
the bands best hunters two dozen of them are making ready to chase the buffalo
its the big time no event is more important
the villagers mostly women children and elderly have gathered around each of the hunters
the largest audience has gathered around lieutenant dunbar and wind in his hair
wind in his hairs pony is ready
great bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump
right now the warrior is drawing the same design along ciscos rump
dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by silently
wind in his hair is finished
he looks at dunbar and nods at the paint as if asking for a response
i wish i knew what to say
a sioux voice using english words sails out of the circle of watchers
startled the men turn to the sound
the other sioux are stunned too
indicating the paint his speed
he takes the warriors hand in his own and shakes it crisply
its the first time weve seen the buffalo up close
theyre fantastic creatures powerful brutish untameable animals from another age
a great bull turns away from the others and lifts his purple horned head to sniff the breeze
he can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his browsing
the hunters are advancing across the prairie spreading out in a formation that will encircle part of the herd
the lightning bolts on wind in his hairs pony are in motion
ciscos bolts are moving too
theres a lump in dunbars throat
he knows nothing of what is expected of him but hes doing it anyway
he glances to his right at wind in his hair and to his left at kicking bird
theyre both concentrated on what lies ahead
from the corner of his eye he sees kicking bird look back
the lieutenant looks too
its a minor flap
three or four youngsters eager to distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters and are being turned back
dunbar recognizes one of them as the boy who took charge of cisco at the village
smiles a lot
like kicking bird dunbar swings his face back to the front
theyre close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the herd
a strike far up on the horned formation
their ponies leap forward
the mad dash is on
dunbars hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant and his horse are hurling over the prairie
the little buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put every ounce of his muscle to speed
theyre burning up the ground
when dunbar looks back over his shoulder hes shocked to find that the best buffalo ponies the siouxs have are far behind
he and cisco are on their own
the herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede is overwhelming
the buffalo are very fast but cisco is gaining with every stride
theyve formed a great running wall in front of him and now dunbar can see their rumps and tails and flying hooves
dunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as if in prayer
the sound of thousands of hooves is deafening
dunbar and cisco have caught the buffalo
a few more strides and theyll be in
dunbar and cisco are running with the buffalo
a shaggy head moves in and swipes at cisco but the little horse is too quick and too smart
he dodges away nearly dumping the lieutenant in the process
dunbar rights himself and fires
its a wild shot only grazing the buffalos shoulder
the report of the gun instantly scatters the herd and dunbar pulls up dust swirling all around him
sioux hunters stream past him every man for himself zeroing in on targets
dunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops him
a hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful of buffalo who have splintered off from the rest
its smiles a lot trying to make a kill of his own
as dunbar watches the boys inexperienced horse shies away and bucks pitching the kid to the ground
a big bull breaks away from the splinter group lowers his head and charges
dunbar kicks cisco into a run spits a spare bullet from his mouth and rams it into the chamber
smiles a lot is picking himself off the ground
the bull is in full charge
dunbar is riding with his knees
both hands are holding the rifle
hell never make it to the boy in time
hes got to make the shot
he squeezes the trigger
the bullet plows home exploding the bulls heart
the big buffalos legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts him into a skid
he comes to rest only a few yards away from smiles a lot
the boy stands as the lieutenant rides up
smiles a lot is dazed but hes okay
dunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo
hes a huge one a real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill
now he looks back to check the boy
smiles a lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the scene of his humiliation
the sounds of approaching riders turns dunbars attention in a different direction
the entire village is streaming onto the plains for the butchering
the riders bearing down on him are being lead by wind in his hair
wind in his hair jumps off his pony and smiling broadly slaps dunbars back with a good natured blow of congratulations
the buffalo has been split open and wind in his hair kneeling at the bulls side is feeling around in the cavity
he finds what hes looking for and gives it a jerk
its the liver still warm and steaming
he offers it to dunbar but the lieutenant not having the faintest idea only looks at it blankly
a sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual
wind in his hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and happily bites off a chunk letting the juices run from the edges of his mouth
now he figures the lieutenant knows what to do and hands the liver back to him
dunbar doesnt want to do this but with the pressure of so many eyes and so much good will he has little choice
tentatively he bites off a small piece and chews it thoughtfully
encouraged by this good taste dunbar takes a man sized bite
shrill sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the lieutenant
dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his head
little butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo
flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match dissolve the clusters of people have become groups surrounding fires at the temporary camp
all over camp people are crowding around fires feasting on fresh meat
children are playing everywhere the dogs are having a field day with scraps and the voices of the people are happy
at a little distance we see lieutenant dunbar and wind in his hair excusing themselves from one of the fires
they start toward us
wind in his hair is sucking on a rib bone and seems to show no sign of slowing down his celebrating
dunbar following a couple paces behind is a different story
hes had it
he spreads his hands to indicate an over sized belly
look im full
i cant tell the story again
wind in his hair doesnt seem to hear
he points at the epaulettes on dunbars tunic
wind in his hair reaches out and fingers the gold lieutenants bars
he fingers a couple of the brass buttons as well
the tunic is something he obviously puts much store in
signing you want to try
put it on
he unbuttons the tunic
he sloughs off the tunic and hands it over
wind in his hair slips out of the magnificent bone pipe breastplate hes wearing and gives it to dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic
the fit is too tight the material too scratchy but those things are of little consequence to wind in his hair
he loves the tunic
with urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the breastplate
dunbar slips it over his head and wind in his hair helps him with the ties
now its the lieutenants turn to be amazed
the breastplate as craftsmanship at its finest
he runs his fingers over the ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist
he looks up at wind in his hair
the warrior nods approvingly as though a good deal has heen struck
this is too much
i cant take this
but for wind in his hair it is already a trade
wind in his hair spots the next fireside and veers toward it
dunbar holds him back
wind in his hair grins
he holds up a single finger
i cant im full
still holding up the finger he guides dunbar into the firelight of the next party
immediately men jump up to greet the celebrities
women begin to saw off more meat
as dunbar gnaws on a rib he glances at the friendly faces around the fire
his eyes suddenly stop their roving
a big warrior is wearing the military hat he lost on the hunt
its a little too big
the brim touches the top of the big warriors ears
now the big warrior notices that dunbar is staring at him
their eyes meet
thats my hat
at the sound of these words the cheerful talk around the fire begins to fade
dunbar touches the top of his head and points to his hat
i found it on the prairie
a silence falls between the two men
wind in his hair speaks
that hat belongs to my friend here
he left it on the prairie
he didnt want it
you can see that he wants it now
the big warrior shakes his head
he wont budge
we all know that is a soldier hat
we all know who wears it
if you want to keep it thats alright
but give something for it
the other men around the fire murmur their assent
the big warrior thinks for a moment then abruptly gets to his feet
he looks at his waist and unfastens a knife in a beautiful worked scabbard
he tosses it across to dunbar
the lieutenant examines the trade item a moment
now he looks back at the big warrior
a smile breaks slowly across his face and dunbar nods
at last he smiles back
its a trade
and at that the cheerful voices around the fire are at it again
dunbar takes his new knife out and as he watches the light flicker off the blade a voice comes into his ear
pointing to his head good trade
dunbar looks into his smiling face
yes its good
but i have to sleep
he excuses himself and walks away from the light of the fire finds himself alone in the shadows still marveling at his breastplate
wind in his hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and tosses it to a dog thats been trailing him
kicking bird is walking toward him
he notices the new tunic and gives wind in his hair a dubious look
where is loo ten tant
i ate him
kicking bird reaches out and feels the strange material on either side of wind in his hairs chest
i traded for it
does it scratch the skin
but do you see how good it looks
everyone says it looks good
dunbar keeps to the shadows as he makes his way through camp
now he slows his step
light from another fire is spilling into his path
theres music too
the voices are high and feminine
dunbar peers around a lodge
a group of young women are dancing in a clockwise circle
their steps are light hearted
this is dancing purely for the fun of it
one of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge and theres a wave of shy giggling as news of loo ten tants presence is passed along
embarrassed dunbar starts along the fringe of the fires nodding politely to the women as he goes
one has more courage than the others
she breaks out takes his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle
whatever resistance he might have is buried by the girls insistent encouragement
she keeps showing him the step and the lieutenant tries to pick it up
the movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing
awkward at first dunbar quickly gets the hang of it
in short order hes keeping up with the others
and hes enjoying himself
soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes carried along by the eternal sound of the drums
he doesnt notice that the circle has begun to shrink
there is a touch of the devil in their eyes
he bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him
but the girls just laugh and so does dunbar
it was a pleasant accident
but quickly theres another accident
and then all their bodies are squeezing against his
the girls are murmuring good things to him
their hands are touching him everywhere
its okay with dunbar
everybodys having a good time
the drumming suddenly stops however and the women scatter away from the fire leaving dunbar suddenly alone
kicking bird is standing not far off
they asked me to dance
the medicine man says nothing
i was just dancing
the lieutenant does a step or two trying to explain
finally that strange half smile appears on kicking birds face
stands with a fist has been watching everything from the tipi flap
now she ducks back inside
the fire is still burning in the center of the lodge
dunbar is sleeping soundly
its not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of mumbling somewhere in the lodge
then its quiet
theres that mumbling again
and now a womans giggle
dunbar stirs waking and curious sits up a little and looks across the fire
there is movement on kicking birds platform
the medicine mans head and that of his wife come into view for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow
the movements and sound that follow become more forceful
theyre having sex
embarrassed the lieutenant averts his eyes they happen over the forms of kicking birds deeply sleeping children the low burning fire and settle on stands with a fists back
lieutenant dunbar the sounds of lovemaking floating over him peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling eyes of kicking bird and his wife
embarrassed again he stares open eyed at the ceiling
he looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesnt know what it is
stands with a fists eyes are open too
she doesnt move
the faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the eastern horizon
the camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon
its the pony herd
and dunbar is walking in that direction
his feet leave a trail in the wet grass
first one then two then whole groups of ponies lift their heads and prick their ears at dunbars approach
dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses he stops and gives a long whistle
a figure previously unseen sits up on the back of a pony
its smiles a lot
he and dunbar glance blankly at each other
but in a moment both are distracted by movement in the herd
horses are being gently eased out of the way by cisco who is answering dunbars call
a moment later and they are reunited at the edge of the herd
grasping a hunk of ciscos mane dunbar starts to lead him back to the village
the temporary camp is starting to come to life
and with cisco at his side dunbar pauses to take in the scene
an escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp
dunbar looks on a travois of meat next to him and gives a last wave
to stay any longer wouldve been useless
we had all the meat we could possibly carry
we had hunted for three days losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured
many times i have felt alone but until this afternoon i have never felt completely lonely
the person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance to the lieutenant dunbar weve known
his long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head
his skin is not so white anymore and the great bone pipe breastplate covers his torso
dunbar starts to write and stops he repeats this action
it is clear that as lieutenant dunbar he can find nothing to say
he lays the pen down momentarily
made a long patrol today
there is nothing to report
the truth is i am bored
there is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws
his eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored
watching the sacks more closely he sees that they are infested with mice
restlessly he walks to the doorway gazing out onto the old fort
the awning is beginning to tear at the corner
and then he spots something
a large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters
dunbar squats next to it
its neck carries punctures and when he dabs a finger on the wounds he finds that the blood is still wet
the lieutenant rises slowly his sharp eyes sweeping the fort
hes waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff overlooking the river
dunbar smiles and shakes his head
watching his old friend he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that suggests hes had some experience
dunbar is gnawing happily at the last of the bird still on its skewer
after a couple of bites he slips the carcass off the stick and chucks it out to two socks
he licks his fingers and gazes out into the night
though only two days it seems like a week
i am missing the company of my new friends
i can see all of their faces but somehow it is not enough
tomorrow i will make an unannounced visit
after all they are my neighbors what can it hurt
two socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the shadows
he munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him to attention
at the fort is an odd sight
dunbar is dancing around the fire occasionally singing out an energetic whoop
two socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl of his own
it could be the stone age
the silhouettes of three indians are watching the strange performance below
one of them is wind in his hair
down below dunbar continues to dance
there is nothing for miles
cisco and dunbar are walking toward us
his boots are pretty worn and his striped trousers have faded to almost nothing
the breastplate shines in the sun
his rifle lies in the crook of his arm indian style
dunbar twists around on cisco and looks back across the prairie
he calls out
dunbar watches a moment to see if hes done any good then turns forward with a sour look
dunbar makes his way through a small grassy valley borders by rolling slopes
he looks across the prairie
two socks is about fifty yards out trotting parallel to cisco and dunbar
exasperated dunbar pulls cisco up and slides off
two socks sits waiting and watching
far down in the valley the figure of lieutenant dunbar is striding through the grass
he looks angry
when hes within a few feet of two socks dunbar waves his arms and stamps a foot two socks scurries to one side but doesnt go far
cmon two socks
you cant go
so go home
dunbar repeats his shooing motion and the wolf hops a few feet
alright then dont go home
stay right here
dunbar turns away and as he does a long low and mournful howl swells behind him
he looks back
two socks muzzle is high in the air and one eye is trained on dunbar hoping for a good reaction
like an angry father whos had too much dunbar charges two sock with a roar
you go home
the wolf races away this time and dunbar immediately runs for cisco hoping to reach his horse and ditch two socks
but hes running long before the wolf comes bouncing alongside
dunbar weaves out at him startling two socks
he sidles away but as he does the lieutenant reaches out and gives the base of his tail a good hard squeeze
it might as well be a firecracker
tow socks gives a yelp and shoots off with his tail tucked
dunbar laughs out loud
he watches until the wolf has gone a fair distance without sign of slowing down
then still chuckling to himself he turns once again and starts for cisco at a trot
but moments later something grabs at one of his ankles the lieutenants legs tangle and he goes down face first into the grass
dunbars lying on his belly
not knowing what hit him he rolls onto his side for a closer look
theres two socks sitting in the grass a few feet back
dunbar sits up cross legged and smiles at his old friend
two socks catches something suddenly perhaps from a shift in the wind and starts to slink away
dunbar peers over the grass up at the bluff
its stone calf kicking bird and wind in his hair
the indian entourage is riding slowly toward lieutenant dunbar
stone calf is at kicking birds side
you were right about loo ten tant he is a special white man
kicking bird watches dunbar as he replies
yes he is special
he should have a real name
lieutenant dunbars arrival this day is different from the ones which have gone before
young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around him but theyre full of good cheer reserved for a special friend
theres much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake hands as they have seen him do
but some of the men have chosen to remain in front of their lodges
their expressionless faces anything but friendly
none of this is lost on wind in his hair
he has the look of a secret service man watching a president as the parade moves through the village
the escorts dismount and so does the lieutenant
smiles a lot suddenly comes forward and grasps ciscos reins
theres a brief tug of war
but before it gets out of hand kicking bird is reassuring dunbar with calm words and a smile with the lieutenant watching the boy takes ciscos muzzle between his hands
and blows breath into each nostril
he too gives dunbar a reassuring smile
in the next moment the lieutenant finds himself being gently pushed into kicking birds lodge
as kicking bird is about to duck in behind him a hand on his arm stops him
it is wind in his hair and his tone is strong with friendly advice
not everyone thinks it is a good idea that he is here
wind in his hair turns to the people that have gathered about
kicking bird has business with the white man
let him do it
kicking birds pipe is a beautiful piece of work
its being smoked
kicking bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to dunbar
the lieutenant aware that the pipe is something special handles it with care
he looks to kicking bird for guidance as he puts his mouth to the tip
the medicine man reassures him with a wave of the hand and dunbar begins to puff
dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes well watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff
he stops now and lowers the pipe
he stares down
the pipe seems almost alive as it lays in his hands
dunbar hands the pipe back and as kicking bird takes it he hears the light tinkling of bells
dunbar hears it too
as he looks toward the sound a shadow falls across the arbors entrance
we were waiting for you
stands with a fist ducks through the arbors entrance and seats herself between dunbar and kicking bird
stands with a fist is wearing a band of bells around one ankle
she has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her feet
her dress is old but well cared for
animal teeth are sewn along her bodice
on her wrist is a solid brass bracelet
her hair is tied back loosely with a bret accenting the feminine in her face
her whiteness seems to show more than ever
but it is not dominant
the sioux is dominant
to dunbar welcome
it is good that you are here
kicking bird looks to stands with a fist
she takes her time and the words are accented but they are close enough
the words are sweet music to the lieutenant
he replies with a feeling of great relief
i feel good
to kicking bird he thanks you
it is good
ask him why he is at the soldier fort
to dunbar uhh
dunbar jumps in
there are things he wants to know has waited a long time to know
what is your name
what does he say
he wants to know how we are called
the medicine man nods agreeably
he smiles at dunbar quite right introductions should come first
she kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin
dunbar doesnt get it
she kicks a little harder
to kicking bird kicking bird
to stands with a fist what does he
is he a chief
stands with a fist has the word but it takes a few seconds to make it come out of her mouth
glancing at kicking bird a brief silence
kicking bird seems ready to speak but dunbar is too quick
to stands with a fist your name
she smiles thinly
i dont know
an idea comes to her
she stands up quickly
she repeats the movement again
her smile is a little wider this time
dunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off
she draw something in the dirt
its an a
stands with a
now she makes a fist and holds it close to dunbars face
stands with a fist
kicking bird and dunbar are strolling through camp engaged in a real conversation stands with a fist is just behind them
i try to answer all of kicking birds questions but i know he is frustrated with me
he always wants to know how many more white people are coming
i tell him that it is impossible for me to say
when he persists i tell him that the white people will most likely pass through this country and nothing more
kicking bird and stands with a fist are walking away from dunbar who takes a few steps in the opposite direction before pausing
toward the end of the following speech he glances back at them and stands with a fist glances back at him
but i am speaking to him in half truths
one day there will be too many but i cannot bring myself to tell him that
i am sure that stands with a fist knows
his surroundings are completely indian dunbar is cleaning the big navy revolver
a war party is going against the pawnee soon and i have asked to go
i sensed that i have made a mistake in doing so but i could not bring myself to take it back
they are my friends and from what little i gather the pawnee have been very hard on these people
i hope i have not overstepped my bounds
the lodge flap rustles and in comes stands with a fist and kicking bird
dunbar stands to greet them
im glad to see you
kicking bird speaks and stands with a fist translates
translating kicking bird wants to know why you want to make war on the pawnee
they have done nothing to you
they are sioux enemies
translating only sioux warriors will go
i asked that he would think about my going
then tell him this
i have been a warrior for longer than many of the young men that will go on this war party
translating he says that the sioux way of being a warrior is not the white way
you are not ready
i know i understand
but i cannot learn these ways in camp
she translates this to kicking bird
the medicine man hesitates then speaks once more
he asks that you watch over his family while he is gone
dunbar looks to kicking bird then to stands with a fist unable to mask his disappointment
on her own this thing he asks you
it is a great honor for you
dunbar thinks a moment longer and speaks directly to kicking bird
i will be happy to watch over your family
translating he thanks dances with wolves for coming
who is dances with wolves
it is the name which everyone is calling you now
he thinks and remembers the night with two socks
dances with wolves
to stands with a fist how do you say it
in sioux dances with wolves
in sioux to kicking bird dances with wolves
the medicine man smiles
black shawl is hurrying out of the lodge with her husbands bow and arrows
a war party of twenty warriors is mounted and everyone except sleeping children is out to say goodbye
stands with a fist is helping to load kicking birds horse with last minute preparations
out of the tipi comes kicking birds eldest child
he is sleepy but almost on the verge of tears as he knows what is happening
kicking bird picks up the boy
what is said is between father and son
and it is just a look
he hands the child to stands with a fist and pauses to speak with his wife
she comes close to tears but there will be no crying
none from kicking bird either
he steps back to his horse
to stands with a fist keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you
i like to make the white man talk
dances with wolves is standing alone in front of his lodge
wind in his hair is riding past
he reaches down and shakes dances with wolves hand
the big warrior smiles
dances with wolves watches the warriors go by but his eyes begin to wander
hes looking for someone among the faces of the women
who ever it is he cant find her
dances with wolves sits alone in the arbor
now he hears a light tinkling of bells the sounds hes been waiting to hear
her feet appear in the doorway
dances with wolves
dances with wolves and stands with a fist are walking through the village talking and pointing things out to each other
slowly in english grass grows on the prairie
not sure in sioux fire lives on the prairie
stands with a fist chuckles but politely checks herself
she smiles and tries again
in english that man is a fighter
he really wants to get one right on the first try
his brows come together as he concentrates
he listens hard
that man is a fighter
dances with wolves thinks some more
when he speaks it is with quiet confidence
in english alright
i have it
in sioux that man
dances with wolves eyes get big
he leans forward for emphasis his whole face lit with the joy of having the right answer
stands with a fist doubles up and falls onto her side laughing all the way
stands with a fist doesnt really hear
shes rocking back and forth on the floor of the arbor laughing so hard that her eyes are tearing
her laughter subsides to an occasional chuckle but dances with wolves is quiet
he gazes at her face
what is the word for beautiful
stands with a fist hesitates in her answer meeting his gaze
a little boy pokes his head in
what are you doing here
the moment is broken
stands with a fist brings herself to respond
it is hot
we are sitting in the shade
this makes so much sense to the little boy that he trots in and flings himself on stands with a fists lap
then a squirm or two
stands with a fist leads the little boy off to a lodge
dances with wolves watches her walk away
from out of nowhere smiles a lot appears
hes been milling about the arbor eavesdropping and looks over to dunbar with a teasing smile
black shawl is settling the youngest children in for bed stands with a fist is playing with the oldest of the children
theyre setting up a childs tipi
how is dances with wolves
stands with a fist stares straight ahead as if she were wondering the same thing
which she was
what do you mean
how is he learning
he learns well
he is fast
case closed she goes back to playing and black shawl continues putting the kids to bed
she looks again at stands with a fist wondering what did you think i meant
dunbar is sitting on cisco
its plain hes been waiting for someone
stands with a fist pulls aside the lodge flap shes lugging a couple water bags
you go for water
his sioux is perfect and she smiles
let us take you
cisco makes his way down the river trail he shies at the flurry of wings as a covey of quail fly up before them
stands with a fist tightens her grip around dances with wolves waist
stands with a fist draws water into a set of bladder bags
dances with wolves squats next to her staring at the eddying stream
how did you get your name
stands with a fist smiles to herself as she fills up the last of the bags
i was not very old when i came to be with the people
i was made to work
she lugs the filled bags onto shore and sits next to dances with wolves
i worked every day
there was a woman who didnt like me
she called me bad names
sometimes she beat me
one day she was calling me these bad names her face in my face and i hit her
i was not very big but she fell down
she fell hard and didnt move
i stood over her with my fist and asked if any other woman wanted to call me bad names
laughing at the recollection no one bothered me after that day
i would not think so
a little silence
show me where you hit her
he taps his jaw
she makes a fist and brushes very gently at the point of his jaw
dances with wolves eyes flutter
they roll up in his head and he keels over backward
she goes with the joke
bending over him she slaps lightly at each side of his cheeks until dances with wolves revives
he sits up rubbing his jaw
neither one acknowledges the joke and a sudden awkwardness falls between them
stands with a fist fiddles shyly with the ties on the water bags while dances with wolves draws lines in the earth with a stick
finally he works up the courage to ask a delicate question
why are you not married
the question comes as a jolt to stands with a fist
she stops her fiddling
a visible stiffness overtakes her
she quickly stands up
i must go
dances with wolves doesnt know what to do
he only knows that he should not have asked the question
she slings the heavy bags over her shoulders and starts back up the path
dances with wolves jumps to his feet
let me help
but the words are delivered to her back
she is already hurrying up the path with her heavy load
five ponies have wondered into the middle of the path
she kicks violently at the nearest innocent bystander
the horses shy out of the way
hes left alone at the waters edge frustrated and confused
he watches her go for a moment
then he lets the stick drop from his hand
he stares at it for a second then gives it a vicious little kick
stands with a fist is sitting in the middle of the lodge she starts when black shawl walks in
you are not talking today
no im not
black shawl gives her a deeper look then lets it go
the sun is setting and the village is settling in for the evening
lying on his bed dances with wolves looks sleepy as he stares across at the small fire
even in his drowsiness it is easy to see hes concentrating
in this case on a certain someone
again dances with wolves is waiting
this time not so patiently
he gives up and leaves in search of something
dances with wolves is wandering through the village half heartedly looking for stands with a fist
the day is very hot and the village is quiet
most of the people have gone to shade
he sees stone calf sitting in the shade behind a lodge
a newly made shield hangs from a tripod and he is painting a design on it
dances with wolves sits in the shade with stone calf watching the older man paint
some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast
that is good
what can i tell you today
dances with wolves is a little taken aback
the elder has read his mind
he decides to speak it
i want to know about stands with a fist
for the first time stone calf leaves his work
he gives his visitor a quick and penetrating look
then he goes back to his shield
what is your question
there is no man with her
stone calf considers before he speaks
it is not something he wants to get into
she is in mourning
i do not understand mourning
she is crying for someone
crying for who
it is not polite to speak of the dead
but i will tell you
you are new
she cries for her husband
he was killed not long ago
the blood has gone out of dances with wolves face
he tries to digest this
how long will she cry
it is kicking birds place to say when she is finished
stands with a fist kneels before black shawl the older woman is combing out the tangles in her hair
black shawl senses a tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her
people are talking about you
stands with a fist stiffens a bit
what are they saying
they are proud of the medicine you are making with dances with wolves
stands with a fist is quiet
i have hurt him and i must go talk to him
you cant he is gone
stands with a fist bolts up racing to the lodge flap she pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of dances with wolves abandoned lodge cisco is nowhere
to be seen
she turns away tears coming to her eyes
black shawl is beside her watching the girls emotions have betrayed her
black shawl takes the crying girl into her arms
a child runs into the lodge but black shawl indicates not now
the message is clearly understood and the child digs in his heels and heads the other way
the breeze is up and the remaining shreds of canvas that were once the awning are flying like tattered flags
leading cisco dances with wolves walks into view
it will be his last visit to his old home and he is taking his time
he watches the blowing canvas
the sound of it snapping is all that can be heard
he steps over to the supply house
he starts to peer in but when he places a hand against the sod part of the wall gives way
part of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still strong enough for support and here dances with wolves is sitting as he leafs through his beloved
he reads a little entry here and there sometimes smiling at the memory
a few blank pages remain at the back of the book
reaching these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap letting his mind run for a moment
now he notices the old pen and ink
he picks them up and opens the journal for one last entry
he writes i love stands with a fist and signs himself dances with wolves
something is moving outside and dunbar stops drawing his gun out
he drops the book on the bed and carefully moves outside
lying in the sun a few feet away is two socks
he looks up hopefully at dances with wolves
the two partners stare at each other for a moment
then dances with wolves reaches into a little day pouch at his side and pulls out a strip of jerky
he squats close to the ground and offers the meat to the wolf
two socks is up now
he takes several tentative steps
his nose sniffs at the meat and he opens his mouth
teeth and fingers touch as the wolf takes the meat delicately
now in his customary style he moves away heading out onto the prairie with his prize
dances with wolves watches a moment longer
then he vaults onto ciscos back and they canter off in the direction of the village
stands with a fist is wading through the water her mind is far away
in a moment there is a shift in the wind
the rustling of the trees alerts her to a presence she had not thought to feel before
gradually she raises her eyes to see the figure of a man moving through the trees
dances with wolves
stands with a fist walks slowly out of the water
he opens his arms and she melts into them letting her head rest against his chest
i am in mourning
stone calf told me
she presses her body full against his feeling all of him
no one can know
we must be careful
we must be careful
she climbs higher into his arms for a moment
then supporting each other the lovers move into the cover of the willow breaks along the river
the path leading to the river is deserted
suddenly a couple steps out of the cover of the willows alongside the path
stands with a fist and dances with wolves look up and down the path
they start for the village holding hands
as they near the top of the trail their hands part
a few steps later and someone calls from the bushes startling dances with wolves
what are you doing
smiles a lot worm and otter are sitting pathside
worm is holding a sack
smiles a lot looks to stands with a fist
worm opens the sack
a large wriggling snake lies in the bottom
we got a snake
were gonna see if it can swim the river
you wanna come
the two parties split up and everyone says goodbye to stands with a fist
she makes her way up to the village
dances with wolves watches her go
turning back to head down to the river he is greeted by the open hissing mouth of worms snake
dont do that
worm and otter laugh and race off down the path
smiles a lot and dances with wolves follow dances with wolves a little ahead
something on his back something curious has captured smiles a lots attention
theres a strange coating of fuzz on dances with wolves back
something occurs to smiles a lot
he stops and turns his eyes going up the trail
stands with a fist is walking toward the village its there on her back too
smiles a lot laughs and runs to catch dances with wolves
the boy slaps dunbar with a knowing pat and a big grin
dances with wolves sits at his cozy fire working on a pipe
he follows a low rumble of thunder as it rolls overhead
thunder booms again and suddenly stands with a fist comes through the lodge flap
dances with wolves comes to his feet
they stare across at each other
dances with wolves walks slowly to her and they embrace lightly
stands with a fist starts to slip out of her dress
indian riders are coming into camp
there are three or four of them
one man is slung over a ponys back
all of the others are wounded
dances with wolves and stands with a fist are having sex
the sounds of their love making are suddenly joined by more insistent sounds from outside
the lovers freeze
stands with a fist props herself on an elbow listening
dances with wolves hurries through a light rain to the scene of a commotion going on at ten bears lodge
theres a real sense of panic in the air by the time he reaches the fire outside ten bears lodge
its a wild scene
ten bears is trying to huddle with his advisors the wounded men are trying to tend their injuries and the rest of the warriors in camp are holding little skull
sessions amidst much shouting
women are running to and fro rounding up their children
dances with wolves spots stands with a fist making her way toward him
her eyes are big with terror
a big party
thirty or forty men
indicating wounded the kiowa hunters found them not far to the north
the pawnee are coming his way
soon they will find our camp
stone calf is just passing by
dances with wolves stops him
i follow you
the older man doesnt mince words
the pawnee do not come for horses they come for blood
and with many men gone we are few
dances with wolves nods
get your weapons and come to my lodge
to dances with wolves i will go
she rushes off and dances with wolves falls into step behind stone calf
he hasnt gone two steps before a revelation hits him
the older warrior faces him
i have guns
many far shooting guns
amid the pandemonium of the village dances with wolves and ten bears are talking
stone calf stands at ten bears side listening
no the ride is long
the weather is bad
we can spare no men
guns would make one warrior like two
the idea intrigues ten bears
as he thinks he looks to stone calf
but the elder warrior says nothing
take one man and go quickly
dances with wolves turns away now hoping to make a quick choice
but in their excitement all the warriors are busy running to and fro
only one person is standing resolutely
he is staring straight at dances with wolves
it is smiles a lot and from the look on his face its easy to see that he wants to be chosen
dances with wolves returns the boys stare trying to make up his mind
he turns to ten bears
i will take smiles a lot
ten bears looks briefly at smiles a lot
he too can see resolve in the boys face
now he looks once again at dances with wolves
rain is pouring now
thunder is still booming
a great fork of lightning illuminates the ruins of the old fort
and nearby it reveals two riders out in the grass
dances with wolves and smiles a lot have brought a couple extra horses with travois but is is dark and in the rain theyve been reduced to looking for a
needle in a haystack
dances with wolves face is grim with frustration as it covers the ground at ciscos feet
smiles a lot and his pony are walking the soggy ground
over the tumult of the storm there is the faint but distinct sound of a snap
hes staring curiously at the ground beneath his ponys feet
smiles a lot jumps off and going on all fours he paws over the ground
his hand grasps something and he holds it up to his face
its a sliver of bone shattered at one end
quickly he gropes some more and finds the other half
together they are a buffalo rib
shouting over the storm dances with wolves
dances with wolves
frenzied hands claw away mud and sod
something wooden is uncovered the lid of a rifle crate
the sky is still full of thunder and lightning but in the breaking dawn the storm can be seen to be lifting
the village is just ahead down a long slope as the gun finders come into view
a great bolt of lightning hits just as dances with wolves starts down the slope
he sees something
smiles a lot stops
dances with wolves squints into the feeble light
he can see the outline of the village below but upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out
another bolt of lightning flashes
there they are
a long line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from the village
in front of ten bears lodge dances with wolves is passing out the last of the rifles
warriors are grabbing handfuls of bullets out of an open ammo box
ten bears is watching this procedure
and while he watches he thinks
the guns have been passed out and except for a slight murmur among the warriors its strangely quiet
the bands best fighters are gone and many men dont know what to do next
theyre looking to ten bears for leadership
but the old man is looking at dances with wolves
he holds up a hand for quiet
hear us now
to dances with wolves a white soldier with many far shooting guns
how would he fight the pawnee
everyone is waiting
i would hide in the village
the warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but ten bears angrily quiets them
dances with wolves has not finished
i would let the enemy think we are asleep
let him come close
then we would shoot together and run to fight them drive them into the river and kill so many that they would never trouble us again
ten bears smiles
i am of the same mind as dances with wolves
we should kill so many that they never trouble us again
two of the camp dogs are lapping water at the rivers edge behind them lies the quiet village
suddenly both heads jerk up
dances with wolves steps into the lodge followed by smiles a lot
they both have rifles and dances with wolves old long barreled revolver is holstered at his waist
before him is a quiet tense scene
the women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform
kicking birds three children nestled between them
two of the kids are crying softly
black shawl grips a hatchet and stands with a fist has a rifle
they will both fight
but they are both scared
everyone in the village has a life at stake
in one glimpse dances with wolves understands what he will be fighting for
he looks once more at the women and children and ducks out of the lodge
the feet of the enemy are moving past the dogs whose bodies are still and riddled with arrows
in front of them the river is full of pawnee crossing over toward the village
there is no sound
it has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an early morning fog is swirling through the camp
clumped in groups of five or six behind the lodges nearest the river are sioux warriors with rifles
theyre absolutely quiet as they wait for the enemy
dances with wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down to the breaks fronting the river
the heads of men lurking in the fog
he glances at the defenders
most of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges watching him
ten bears raises a hand
the pawnee are visible now a war party at its fiercest painted and feathered and armed to the teeth
coming on foot the first of them have reached the edge of the clearing
they start into a stealthy trot more and more of them breaking into a run
a pawnee war cry goes up and as the others join in
ten bears lowers his hand
in ragged formation the sioux pour from behind the lodges and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the pawnee charge
the smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the sioux run screaming down on the pawnee
dances with wolves screams too as he runs flat out down the slope
a pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they crash together violently
the two fighters tumble over the ground each grappling for an advantage
the hand to hand fighting all around them is furious and shrouded in smoke and fog it has a surreal quality
dances with wolves works the navy revolver from its holster and shoots the pawnee in the face
a child sticks his head out from under the edge of the lodge
momentarily he is jerked back into the lodge out of sight
now theres a ripping at the lodge entrance
the flap is being torn away
black shawl is desperately pulling the child back from the edge of the lodge
suddenly there he is
a pawnee warrior
but now its his turn to be surprised
he sees stands with a fist taking aim and its too late
she fires the rifle and the pawnee explodes back out of the lodge
through the smoke dances with wolves can just catch a glimpse of ten bears
he is moving through the village at a trot loading his gun
he spots a sioux warrior grappling with a pawnee sights and shoots the pawnee point blank
he trots off reloading once more
dances with wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to his knees
its a frantic pawnee war horse loose on the battlefield
dances with wolves grabs a hunk of mane and swings onto his back
he has a real view now
the pawnee are taking a terrible licking
already they are being beaten back to the river
a turbaned enemy is falling back to the river firing arrows as he goes
dances with wolves goes after him
still clutching his hatchet a wounded pawnee half staggers toward ten bears lodge
he is bleeding profusely and in a very bad mood
he reaches the closed lodge flap
pretty shield stands in front of a group of children ready to defend them
the pawnee is inside now
he has a wild desperate look and in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through these people
but he never takes a step
instead he suddenly sinks to his knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already buried in his back
the warrior keels over and pretty shield looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of stone calf
without hesitation pretty shield snatches a half burned log from the fire and finishes the pawnee
the children watch their faces a mixture of horror and intrigue
coming off the pony like a rodeo bulldogger dances with wolves crashes through the river taking the pawnee in a headlock
somehow they both keep their feet and hurtle down the hill at a weird run
a small cottonwood stops their momentum the pawnee taking most of the blow
dances with wolves grabs either side of the mans head and starts banging his skull against the tree trunk
shortly he notices that the mans eyes are dead
the pawnee was impaled on impact by the stub of a broken branch low on the trunk
dances with wolves shrinks back from this gruesome sight and staggers toward the village
stone calf his bow and arrow at the ready is looking for more enemies to kill
suddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an attack
but he is too late
a pawnee war club crushes his skull and the old man collapses
now we can see his attacker
it is the fierce pawnee warrior who killed timmons the wagon driver
he glowers down at the body of stone calf and swings his club toward the old mans head once again
dances with wolves squints toward the village just in time to see the toughest take another shot at the prostrate white headed form of stone calf
dances with wolves begins to run
the toughest has his knife to stone calfs forehead and is preparing to scalp his victim when something strikes him in the lower leg
he looks down to find a small arrow imbedded in his calf
he looks up to see three boys otter worm and smiles a lot huddled at the edge of the battlefield
he turns back to finish the job when another arrow hits him
enraged he breaks off the arrow leaps onto a horse and charges the kids
their faces go ashen as the toughest bears down on them
otters arrow flies weakly into the air
the boys turn and run for their lives
the toughest would catch them with ease but now he sees half a dozen howling sioux warriors angling in to cut him off
he knows in a glance that the fight has been lost
he also knows that he can still escape if he changes direction
he veers for the river
the sioux are distraught
the toughest will get away
but wait dances with wolves is at full speed now
he is streaking across the battlefield
suddenly the pawnee himself is hurtling through space driven there by the full force impact of dances with wolves shoulder which has caught him rib high
both men hit the ground grappling and rolling
a knife flashes in the toughests hand and dances with wolves can only react quick enough to keep the knife from a vital spot
as it is the blade lays open a huge gash on his arm
they square off
the toughest knows the advantage is his
he smiles grimly at dances with wolves and grunts sadistically
but the sound from his throat is cut short by the simultaneous arrival of five sioux arrows
before the pawnee can fall six sioux warriors are on him tearing him to pieces
dances with wolves climbs to his feet and discovers that the battlefield is no longer so
the fighting has stopped
its a scene of carnage and joy
the pawnee attackers lay where they fell
i killed this one
this one still breathes
the sioux victors are in high spirits as they hop around finishing off the wounded and counting coup on the dead
dances with wolves looks down at himself
his body is streaked with blood much of it his own
his arm is bleeding freely but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to retreat into the breaks
dances with wolves now looks up to see the lifeless body of stone calf
ten bears is hugging him
pretty shield starts to kneel beside her mourning husband
dances with wolves
before he knows it sioux fighters are moving all around him chanting his name
like ants rolling a pebble up a hill they push him into the middle of the battlefield
in a daze he allows himself to be carried along
when he looks up again he can see women and children emerging from the lodges
it was hard to know how to feel
i had never been in a battle like this one
this had not been a fight for territory or riches or to make men free
this battle had no ego
it had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through winter to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet
i felt a pride i had never felt before
dances with wolves looks down and recognizes the face of a man he has just killed
several warriors are crowding around him now
dances with wolves points at the body
i shot this one
yes i saw you shoot him
you killed that one too
as the sun breaks fully through the clouds the little knot of warriors dances with wolves in their midst continues its triumphant tour of the battleground
the men are hugging and slapping each other on the back
i had never really known who john dunbar was
perhaps because the name itself had no meaning
but as i heard my sioux name being called over and over i knew for the first time who i really was
the war party with kicking bird and wind in his hair at its head has halted in the middle of nowhere
the sioux riders are coming toward them at a run
they pull up excited with what they have to tell
the returning war party and the two riders who met them start ahead at a gallop
black shawl and stands with a fist are clearing things away
the medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now winding down
wind in his hair is there dances with wolves and several other prominent warriors
its purely social and all the men are enjoying themselves
dances with wolves sneaks a look of affection at stands with a fist and she returns it
then with more theatricality than is really necessary he stretches his arms and yawns
wind in his hair looks at his friend with surprise
dances with wolves gets to his feet
there is gambling tonight
at horse backs lodge
horse backs games are always good
i am tired
and horse back already has a good rifle of mine
to kicking bird thank you
to all goodnight
he slips out
in a few seconds the men have pick up another topic to jawbone
they pay no attention to stands with a fists momentary exit but black shawl does it doesnt bother her but she notices
the medicine mans wife is already in bed as he slips under the covers with a grunt
how long will stands with a fist mourn
kicking bird gives his wife an odd look
i dont know
i hope it will not be too long
kicking bird rises on his elbows
something has happened
she has found love again
dances with wolves
are you certain of this
when you see them together you will know
kicking bird stares wearily across the floor
what are people saying
theyre not angry
they like the match
it makes sense
they are both white
i suppose i will be the one to say something
a brief silence
shes your daughter now
kicking bird glances up frustrated with himself
you cant see everything coming
stands with a fist is walking through the village with kicking birds youngest child
theyre both carrying armloads of firewood
here comes kicking bird
hes out of breath
stands with a fist
you are no longer a widow
kicking bird turns abruptly and stalks off leaving stands with a fist to ponder the meaning of his curt announcement
a smile gradually works onto her face
dances with wolves sits waiting as a voice comes to him from the outside
wind in his hairs face pokes through the entrance
he steps inside followed by smiles a lot
theres talk that you want to get married
wind in his hair and smiles a lot share a smile
to stands with a fist
thats the one isnt it
shes in mourning
she has been released
kicking bird did it
wind in his hair isnt really listening
he glances around the lodge curiously
what are you doing
kicking bird told me to wait
you might be waiting a long time
smiles a lot says he saw kicking bird riding on the prairie
smiles a lot whispers in the warriors ear
he says he was talking to himself
when a medicine man is the last to know he can take it pretty hard
what do i do
wind in his hair looks around at the sparse furnishing
you are pretty poor my friend and a sioux girl is not for free
i dont know if you can get married
a long silence
dances with wolves looks around his lodge
wind in his hair is right
he really has nothing
i have the buckskin
thats too much medicine
to smiles a lot do you think the buckskin is too much medicine
smiles a lot is on the hot seat
he looks to wind in his hair but no luck hes on his own
for a girl
maybe we can help you
wait here for us
wind in his hair and smiles a lot leave
wind in his hair and smiles a lot are greeted by seven chuckling warriors
theyve been listening to the exchange and move off with the two helpers
dances with wolves is inspecting several new ponies which are tied outside his tipi
now he notices an old couple approaching
the old couple leaves a gift along with others that have already been brought
the old folks are shy and so is dances with wolves
they glance at one another and smile but do not speak
i thought we had been discreet but apparently we fooled no one
dances with wolves ties the last of the ponies in front of kicking birds lodge and starts back toward his own home
wind in his hair said if the match was acccepted the ponies would be gone in the morning
dances with wolves looks over his shoulder at the standing ponies then he continues on
dances with wolves tosses and turns in his bed
he slips out of the covers and ducks his head through the lodge flap checking again on the ponies
the ponies are gone
dances with wolves hair is shiny
his breastplate gleams the officers pants have been dusted and his old boots have something resembling a shine
the groom is ready
dances with wolves does a three sixty
a brief silence as wind in his hair contemplates something he wants to say
you know the man she mourned for was my best friend
i didnt know that
he was a good man
its been hard for me
i am not the thinker kicking bird is
but i think he went away from her because you were coming
that is how i see it now
the sound of music and people outside distracts both men
kicking bird is leading the wedding party
stands with a fist by his side
she glows with the special beauty of a bride
many people are standing about quietly more like simple observers than participants
the whole village is as peaceful as we will ever see it
kicking bird steps forward his wife and stands with a fist following in his footsteps
this is a good day for me
and for me
stands with a fist
if you want this man take his hand in yours
shyly she holds out a slender graceful hand
dances with wolves meets it with one of his own
the medicine man looks dances with wolves in the eyes for several seconds
dances with wolves also begins to speak
at first the volume of his voice and that of the medicine man are nearly equal but kicking birds voice quickly begins to fade
i had never been married before
i dont know if all grooms have the same experience
but as kicking bird began to speak about what was expected of a sioux husband my mind began to swim in a way that shut out everything but her
the tiny details of her costume
the contours of her shape
the light in her eyes
the smallness of her feet
i knew that the love between us would be served
the medicine mans voice cuts back in
hes had to say it twice
have you heard all that i have said
good then take her inside
she is your wife
the newlyweds disappear into their new home
the flap is dropped and there it stays
the light begins to change growing darker the wind comes up blowing leaves against the door
in the distance there is thunder
the lodge flap is still closed
but now it is covered in sunshine
smiles a lot worm and otter are just across the way bundled now against the chill of oncoming winter
theyre watching too
smiles a lot is standing next to worm otter is on his haunches
both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat as they talk nonchalantly
dances with wolves door is closed alot these days
theyre trying to make a baby
the two older boys look down at otter
i know that
you would think they could have made a baby by now
maybe theyre having a hard time
some people have a hard time
i dont think theyre having a hard time
a silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge
worm laughs to himself
maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed
then they would come out
the boys look at each other for the first time their eyes brightening
what a great idea
the two boys are stalking toward dances with wolves lodge when they see something that makes them peel off in another direction
its kicking bird coming to call
dances with wolves are you in there
in a moment the lodge flap opens and dances with wolves steps outside
hes fully dressed but a little disheveled
i am riding today to a far away place
it is a place i havent seen for a long time
a sacred place
i would like you to come with me
dances with wolves ponders this
kicking bird and dances with wolves are cantering side by side across the open prairie
they pull their horses to a walk and kicking bird glances dances with wolves direction
dances with wolves glances back and smiles
its good to be out
yes it must be
we are trying for a baby
the medicine man keeps looking at his protege
there is virtually no semblance of lieutenant dunbar left
i was just thinking that of all the trails in this life there is one that matters more than all the others
it is the trail of a true human being
i think you are on this trail and it is good to see
dances with wolves doesnt reply but he is blushing a little
dances with wolves and kicking bird gallop their horses to the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt
down below miles distant is the curving line of a river
but there is a section of river directly before them that cannot be seen
it is screened by a mammoth stand of trees some of them towering a hundred feet or more
he glances at dances with wolves but his companion doesnt see
hes staring in wonder at the great forest before him
it is said that all the animals were born here
that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people
even our enemies say this is a sacred place
they start toward the river at a walk
the two riders come out of the sunlight and onto a shaded path leading into the forest
theyve only gone a few yards when kicking bird pulls to a stop
the men sit on their horses in complete silence
dances with wolves is still fully entranced
but kicking bird does not acknowledge his companions words
he seems to be concentrating on the quiet
the quiet is wrong and kicking bird knows it
he moves forward slowly
following behind kicking bird dances with wolves attention is focused on the tree tops above him
a curious buzzing sound has started up and is growing louder by the moment
perhaps there are bees swarming in the branches overhead
now he is distracted by cisco coming to a stop
kicking bird too has stopped
just ahead the forest opens into an incredible cathedral like expanse
sunlight streams down onto the floor in beautiful pools
but still there is a deathly quiet and dances with wolves can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly desecrated
trees have been felled everywhere most of them left to rot for no explicable reason
at the same time he sees this destruction dances with wolves realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from overhead but from the forest floor
the insects are not bees
they are flies and they are swarming over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground
badgers skunks squirrels and other small animals nearly all of them killed merely for target practice
the men and their ponies move on
deer carcasses are everywhere many of them horribly mutilated
a choice flank portion is cut away here and there while ninety five percent of the bodies have been left to rot
heads and legs have been chopped off
dances with wolves passes by a spot where several deer heads have been placed nose to nose as if the heads were having a conversation
someones perverted idea of humor
the men ride through the carnage in a sad daze
now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they find a few crude leantos hewn from freshly cut wood
the people who stayed here had bigger plans for all the felled wood but lost ambition and settled for these ugly hovels
a great pile of wild turkeys perhaps twenty birds in all sit to one side
they havent even been plucked
just shot and left to rot
dances with wolves notices half a dozen liquor bottles in a heap of trash
he cannot bring himself to look at kicking bird
any man would be repulsed at these sights but in dances with wolves case there is a feeling of shame as well
we must wait for these people
kicking bird says nothing for a long time
no theyve been gone a week maybe more
we will water the horses and go home
he turns his pony away
kicking bird and dances with wolves are alone on a great sea of prairie
theres a little fire going
a sage hen is being roasted but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of the fire
each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts thoughts of the broken forest
you have asked me many times about the white people
you always ask how many more are coming
dances with wolves looks at his friend and mentor
there will be a lot my friend
more than can be counted
help me to know how many
like the stars
this is what kicking bird wanted to know
and it hits him like a rock
kicking bird bows his head in thought while dances with wolves raises his
he never wanted to say this he wishes it wasnt true
it makes me afraid for all the sioux
the old man puffs away at his trusty pipe
now he lays it down
kicking bird and dances with wolves are waiting patiently
its hard to know what to do
the old man gets up walks to his bedside reaches up into the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon sized rawhide bundle
he brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly
inside is a rusted hunk of metal the helmet of a spanish conquistador
the men who wore this came in the time of my grandfathers grandfather
eventually we drove them out
then the mexicans came
in my own time the whites came
they have been like all the others who find something they want in our country
they take it without asking
i have always been a peaceful man happy to be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people
nothing at all
but i think you are right
i think they will keep coming
when i think of that i look at this bundle
our country is all that we want
we will fight to keep it
he picks up his pipe and puffs deeply
tomorrow morning we will strike the village and go to the winter camp
the whole camp is being struck
there is activity everywhere
stands with a fist is packing and so is dances with wolves
he is putting away the shield that stone calf once worked on
she pauses to stroke her husbands leg tenderly
you have everything from the soldier fort
no there is nothing for me there
stands with a fist laughs as she starts out of the lodge
but as he tightens the leather thongs on the shield case dances with wolves face begins to cloud
dances with wolves bolts out of the lodge and snatches up ciscos reins
he calls urgently to stands with a fist
stands with a fist
the village is about ready to move just a few last minute flurries of activity
the words in the book are like a trail for people to follow
it tells everything about my life here
i must get it
we cannot wait for you
i will catch up
dances with wolves and cisco are cantering quickly over the open prairie
old fort sedgewick is just beyond the next rise
dances with wolves eases cisco into a full run
they fly so quickly over the rise that dances with wolves has no time to react
there must be forty or fifty of them talking walking working and playing
old fort sedgewick is crawling with them
blue coated soldiers
just in front of him is a deep bedded wagon carrying a cargo of soldiers
theyve been out cutting wood
but now the men in the wagon are scrambling for their rifles and screaming out the alarm
dances with wolves puts everything he has into pulling cisco up
the soldiers in the wagon a collection of pimply faced teen agers and middle aged rabble are aiming their rifles
cisco rears high in the air as the volley is fired from the wagon
dances with wolves is pitched off to one side landing hard on the ground
when he gets his senses back the first thing he sees is cisco
the buckskin is lying very still
oblivious to the shouts of the soldiers racing toward him dances with wolves runs crab like to his horses side
ciscos been shot several times one bullet taking him in the heart
dances with wolves whirls to face the soldiers
you killed him
thats the last thing he says
a rifle stock slams into the side of his face and as soldiers swarm over him everything goes black
ten bears village is on the trail
kicking bird is riding down the line
he notices stands with a fist
she is terribly distraught
kicking bird glances at the sun
the day is more than half over
he kicks his pony back up the line next to wind in his hair
something has happened
dances with wolves is not coming
he must have trouble
pick two good men with fast ponies and send them back to the soldier fort
dances with wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined supply house
one side of his face is grotesquely swollen from the blow he took
blood still seeps from a long split of the skin along his cheek
voice are playing about his ears the voices of white men
he opens his eyes
a bearish bearded sergeant bauer is squatting directly in front of him
behind the sergeant peering over the crumbled walls like visitors at a zoo are a crowd of ordinary soldiers
a pitiful looking man spivey who is a soldier by name only answers up
tell the major hes wakin up
and move your worthless ass
the sergeants smallish eyes are fixed on dances with wolves
with some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting position against the back wall
got yourself a helluva shiner didnt ya
dances with wolves only blinks at him
his cheek is crushed and so is his spirit
someone calls attention and two officers walk into the roofless supply house
one is a major one is a young lieutenant lieutenant elgin the officer dances with wolves bumped into at fort hays
neither one recognizes the other
does he speak english
dont know sir
you speak english
kicking at one of dances with wolves boots talk
i speak english
everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words
who are you
this is my post
why are you dressed like this
i came out from fort hays last april
but there was no one here
the major and the lieutenant exchange whispers
you have proof of that
my journal is on the bunk in my quarters
my orders are in the journal
it will tell you everything
spivey you and edwards were here first
did you find anything
spivey shifts uncomfortably
we didnt see nothin sir
but he didnt see nothin either
elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom of this and walks out the door the major follows
dances with wolves lets his head slump forward
the men gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves commenting on the prisoner
they cant take their eyes off him
neither can sergeant bauer
he watches the prisoner from a distance
then he walks across the floor squats in front of him and whispers coarsely in his face
you turned injun dincha
dances with wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant
the major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear
what is your name
you say you are an officer
did you read my orders
it was in my journal
there are no orders and there is no journal
there is a silence as dances with wolves takes this in
elgin tries again
why are you out of uniform
dances with wolves takes a long time to answer
i have to relieve myself
surrounded by guards dances with wolves is being walked toward a clump of bushes
he glances out at the prairie
ciscos body lies where it fell
black birds are pecking it
a rifle butt bangs him hard between the shoulder blades and dances with wolves attacks
before anyone else can move he has taken the offending soldier to the ground and is strangling him
another rifle butt crashes against his skull and again everything goes black
water drips from dances with wolves head and he comes to again
as he moves he hears a jangling and discovers that his hands and feet are in chains
everyone has assembled
why are you out of uniform
what is the army doing out here
sergeant bauer shoves dances with wolves with his gun
lieutenants askin the questions here
elgin quickly steps in
we are charged with apprehending hostiles recovering stolen property and retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings
there are no hostiles
we will ascertain that for ourselves
now if you guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter your conduct will be reevaluated
your status as a traitor might improve should you choose to cooperate with the united states army
quietly there is nothing for you to do out here
elgin can see that the majors attitude and inexperience has killed any chance of communication
he makes one last try on his own
are you willing to cooperate or not
well speak up
lowly in sioux i am dances with wolves
loudly in sioux i am dances with wolves
i have nothing to say to you
you are not worth talking to
the major is surprised
elgin is not
the major turns on his heel and walks out
lieutenant elgin stares at dances with wolves
have a detail take him down to the river
let him clean up his face
dances with wolves kneels by the river splashing water lightly on his battered face
half a dozen soldiers are lounging around watching him
trooper spivey is crapping in the bushes
another soldier crapper is crapping not far away
spivey can see dances with wolves in the distance still splashing water on his face
now he slips something out of his tunic
its the journal
he opens it and starts to tear out a page trying hard not to make noise
you got paper over there spivey
whats it to you
well gimme some shitbird
can you read
naw i cant read
what the hell do you care
you cant either
spivey looks down at the stolen journal thinking
hold your horses
two sioux scouts watch from the brow of a slope above the fort
having spotted dances with wolves they withdraw
we see dances with wolves at a distance being marched back to his cell by the detail of soldiers
hes moving awkwardly in his chains
dances with wolves is half dozing against the wall when spivey walks in with a plate of army gruel
hes followed by sergeant bauer
spivey sets the plate in front of the prisoner
he admires the breastplate and like a crow eyeing something shiny he thinks to grab for it
suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists
dances with wolves face is inches away from spiveys
terrified spivey pulls away kicking over the plate of food as he scrambles to safety across the room
lap it up injun
dances with wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate and flips it over
most of it hits spivey a little splashes on bauer
spivey moves to kick the prisoner but bauer intercedes with his rifle
go on ahead injun
youll just get hungrier is all
but mebbe that dont matter
word is theyre gonna ship you back to hays
and theyll hang you once you get there
bauer and spivey leave him and dances with wolves kicks out viciously at the spilled plate
theres a tremendous upheaval
ten bears band has halted its march
six painted warriors all heavily armed are jumping onto their ponies and being handed the lines to spare mounts
wind in his hair is their leader
the whole village is up to see them off
smiles a lot painted and carrying a bow and quiver rides into the midst of the group
wind in his hair studies the resolute boy
you will hold our horses
smiles a lot nods
with a great whooping from the villagers the rescue party roars out of camp
the wagon is pulling out with an escort of seven soldiers
dances with wolves spirits are very low as he sits in the bed of the jolting wagon
spivey is guarding him
elgin is leading the detail
dances with wolves watches a ridge in the distance for any sign of riders
i dont see nobody
elgin and one of the escort soldiers are scouting far out on the prairie
the lieutenant pauses and looks back at the wagon
it is far behind in the distance but still coming
dances with wolves is dozing as the wagon jolts across the ground
suddenly a shot rings out
dances with wolves opens his eyes
the wagon driver is aiming his rifle out at something on the prairie
he fires again
dances with wolves looks over the wagon bed and sees two socks
hes standing still fifty yards away
staring in his old inquisitive way at the wagon
lookit the stupid bastard
he aint even runnin
two shots ring out in rapid succession
dont shoot i seen em first
its my shot
sergeant bauer fires his own round
everyone has missed
bauer is jamming another cartridge into the chamber
its my shot goddamit
now spivey decides to get into the act
he rises up with his rifle aiming
you dumb sons a bitches
before he can fire theres a rattling of chains
and the next moment spiveys feet are being pulled out from under him by dances with wolves
his rifle fires harmlessly into space
bauer turns from the wagon seat and slams the back of the prisoners head with the gunstock
dances with wolves falls back letting go of the shaken spivey
bauer smiles at spivey contemptuously
he mighta killed you
in the next instant spivey gives dances with wolves a resounding crack in the sternum with the butt of his rifle and he goes down on his back
more shots are fired
dazedly dances with wolves looks out and sees two socks still running parallel to the wagon
theres another shot and then shouting
i got him
the hell you did
i got him
dead shot boys
spivey is still poking dances with wolves
you want more
elgin has ridden alongside the wagon
i see you bash the prisoner once more and ill put those shackles on you
elgins men are headed up towards two socks when shots ring out
get back to your places
the camera continues over the hill to two socks body but it is no where in sight
instead the indian war party of six is waiting silently in ambush
frustrated they will try again
the wagon is making its way steadily down toward the river
dances with wolves watches the line of growth along the river get closer his eyes and ears and nose full alert
if they come this will be the place to do it
dances with wolves will make the most of this hope
the wagon moves down a narrow pathway not much more than a game trail
the lieutenant raises his hand and the wagon halts at the rivers edge
a soldier rides back and forth in the water on the other side of the river
hes checking for any signs of ambush
the soldier starts back to them
all clear lieutenant
elgin starts into the water followed by the wagon
the all clear sign means nothing to dances with wolves
hes all keyed up
elgin and a soldier are leading the way
theyre only a few yards from the opposite bank when the lieutenant is taken
elgin is completely surprised to find an arrow buried in his chest
the outrider is about to pull up his gun when an arrow hits him square in the gut
he brings his head up to see the full force of wind in his hair stringing up another arrow and taking aim
just as the outrider is struggling to raise his gun wind in his hair fires off another arrow deep into the mans heart
the impact sends him flying out of the saddle dead
wind in his hair comes on leading five sioux warriors
dances with wolves has looped the shackles around spiveys neck in a death grip when he sees bauer leveling his rifle at the approaching riders
dances with wolves aims a vicious kick at bauer sending the rifle flying and bauer over the edge of the wagon
bauer flounders in the water fumbling for his pistol
he sends off a round taking one of the on rushing warriors in the shoulder
the sioux looses his seat and tumbles off the pony into the water wounded
dances with wolves snaps the loop around spiveys neck as hard as he can and bone breaks
dances with wolves is beating spivey furiously with his chains
he keeps whacking until the blood is spreading on the surface of the water
the frantic driver is about to make a run for it when he is impaled with a sioux lance
the two soldiers in the back of the wagon have turned tail and are splashing back across the river
as they scramble up the bank two sioux warriors meet them and cut them down with hatchets
in the midst of the smoke and confusion of the battle bauer has made his way to the cover of the weeds along the river bank
crashing through the thicket he comes to a clearing and there in the shallows comes face to face with smiles a lot
the boy is standing in the shallows holding the extra horses
the boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this white soldier that he doesnt move
bauer sticks his revolver into smiles a lots face and pulls the trigger
but the hammer only clicks
the gun is empty
bauer pistol whips the boy knocking him to the ground and grabs for the closest of the horses
but the ponies are all stirred up now and starting to run down the river
bauer succeeds in grabbing a hunk of mane but the horse hes gotten hold of is moving too fast for him to get on
but now bauer hears a bone chilling whoop
wind in his hair is coming
his pony plows through the water at full speed
a skullcracker dangles from one hand
the warrior begins to whirl it around
terrified bauer turns to run
before he can take a step a hatchet buries itself to the hilt
smiles a lot is at the other end
but bauer is not through
his hands are around the boys neck choking him with his last seconds of life
a larger than life wind in his hair draws even and swings his club
bauers head explodes covering smiles a lot in blood the sergeants hands cannot be seen
still in chains dances with wolves and wind in his hair are dragging elgins body onto shore
dances with wolves rifles through the dead mans pockets
he finds a set of keys and plops down to unlock his shackles
the wounded indian warrior is being tended to
smiles a lot is downstream washing bauers blood off
a warrior is stripping down spivey
he holds up the dead mans tunic but doesnt notice that something plops out
its the journal
it floats off into the current well out of dances with wolves field of vision
it is lost forever
the journal continues its downstream journey
suddenly a small hand reaches down and scoops it out of the water
smiles a lot holds the book close to his face amazed at the sight of words
the party is mounting
smiles a lot rides up next to dances with wolves
dances with wolves
he offers the book
dances with wolves takes it regarding the journal
the rescue party is cantering across the prairie
to wind in his hair we go south
we will ride south for two days
then turn east
no one must follow
this doesnt seem to bother wind in his hair
but it sets dances with wolves to thinking
the sound of a single drum calls attention to eight silhouettes on horseback making their way down the ridge
the entire village begins to rumble with excitement as the news spreads
the rescue party is walking down the trail single file
dances with wolves is a few slots back
all the village is racing up the canyon to greet them
stands with a fist leads them all
she runs to dances with wolves
she jumps all over her husband and finally he lifts her up on his pony
the couple we have come to know are sitting on their bed
dances with wolves is combing stands with a fists hair
its something he is doing with care and affection
she is loving it as much as he
they are together as two people can be and yet it is a hard time
you have nothing to say
what can i tell you
what ever is on your mind
we have decided
you are my husband
i am your wife
that is all i know
dances with wolves lays his forehead on her back
then he pulls away slips a robe around his shoulders and walks out of the lodge
sadly she watches him go
we follow a pair of boots walking in the snow
pan up to find an orderly bringing coffee to a major
he is surrounded by other officers and in front of him a large column of men is moving toward the snow covered mountains
the major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he prepares to mount
we pan up with the smoke and the steam
its cold in the sioux camp
a warm column of smoke is spiraling out of ten bears lodge
several men are gathered around ten bears fire including kicking bird wind in his hair and dances with wolves
all the men are draped with blankets
the wind is howling outside
the men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes around the circle
the pipe comes around to dances with wolves and the man next to him must nudge him to attention
dances with wolves takes the pipe and begins to smoke
ten bears watches him closely
to dances with wolves dances with wolves is quiet these days
he does not reply
he smokes a little more and passes the pipe
is his heart bad
dances with wolves glances at the men around the fire
killing the soldiers at the river was a good thing
it made me free and my heart was big to see my friends coming to help me
i did not mind killing those men
i was glad to do it
he searches for the right words
but the soldiers hate me now like they hate no other
i am more than an enemy to them i am a traitor
they will hunt for me
they will not give up
and when they find me they find you and that cannot happen
objections break out all around the fire
wind in his hair jumps to his feet and even kicking bird is protesting
sit down wind in his hair
you are hurting an old mans ears with your loud talk
the column of soldiers can be heard but not seen
they are moving forward singing the battle hymn of the republic
stands with a fist is building up the fire in their cozy home
dances with wolves works on a long stemmed pipe which is in the last stages of completion
dances with wolves
dances with wolves gets up opens the flap and admits the old chief
a few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair
he goes straight to the fire and sits
this is a nice fire
at my age a good fire is better than anything
stands with a fist brings two small bowls of food places them next to the men and busies herself with something else
though neither one is much interested they begin to eat
i wondered how your bad heart was doing and though i would come by and see for myself
this place doesnt look so bad hearted
dances with wolves smiles
no we are happy
but you are leaving anyway
i have talked with stands with a fist and we will go together
have you told this to kicking bird or to wind in his hair
its anguish for dances with wolves to think about his friends
he shakes his head no
ten bears thinks again in silence
you are the only white man i have ever known
i have thought about you alot
more than you know
that does not surprise me
you have always spoken with your heart
and like all of us you are a free man and can do anything you like
when i look across this fire i do not see a white soldier
i see only a sioux named dances with wolves
and there is nothing they hate so much as a sioux
ten bears words always have purpose and as always he makes his point
he pauses for a moment and notices dances with wolves nearly finished pipe
you are making a pipe
ten bears holds out a hand and dances with wolves hands the pipe to him
ten bears inspects it briefly
this might be a pretty good pipe
how does it smoke
i dont know i havent tried it yet
lets smoke it awhile
it is good to pass the time this way
from a little distance wind in his hair is watching dances with wolves lodge
his face is full of uncertainty and a kind of pain we have never seen before
he is in agony
he starts forward but after a few yards he stops to think
he turns back but has only gone a few steps when he stops and turns to face dances with wolves lodge once more
he starts for the tipi again but he cant go thru with it
the proud warrior turns away and walks quickly out of sight
the column is moving at a leisurely walk when the horses start to bunch up
everyone waits while far up ahead a group of ten or twelve men examine the ground
white officers sits atop their horses while their scouts scour the ground
theyve found a significant trail
the scouts are indian and by their distinctive dress we recognize them
they are pawnee
the pawnee scouts come racing up
their horses are wet and have come a good distance
the scouts are very excited
the men have dismounted
they prepare for battle removing any equipment that might rattle tin cups plates etc
tossing the discards into a growing pile
black shawl watches as kicking bird slips a magnificent pipe into its buckskin case
now he looks at her
the medicine man too is in a kind of pain we have not seen before
carrying the pipe he made dances with wolves walks through the village
suddenly he stops
kicking bird is standing in the middle of the empty avenue
like gunfighters the two men approach each other at a slow and deliberate walk
gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting gift
kicking bird tries to cover with a casual question but its all fake
youve finished your pipe
how does it smoke
im told it smokes well
dances with wolves moves to make the exchange
kicking bird does the same
from one hand to the other
men couldnt be closer
it doesnt seem possible that we could come this far
you were the first man i ever wanted to be like
i will not forget you
neither can speak
there is only goodbye
the column of soldiers is not in a rush but theyre trotting now to make better time
stands with a fist sits on a pony outside the lodge
two pack horses are loaded with their things
dances with wolves swings onto his ponys back and we follow as they start out of the village
no one is standing in rose to watch them leave
no one is crying
in fact people are making the motions of going about their regular work
but its all fake too
the whole village is sad and the most obvious sign is that there is no sound
in the awful quiet most people avert their eyes as the two pass by
dances with wolves and stands with a fist have reached the head of the trail leading out of the winter camp
they have just begun to ascend when a voice calling from afar brings them to a halt
the sound echoes through the canyons through the village
calling dances with wolves
his pony is jacked up and as always wind in his hair looks the perfect warrior
but now his face is full of stress as he screams out the message he could not deliver in person
i am wind in his hair
everyone in the camp has stopped to listen
can you not see that i am your friend
dances with wolves looks ready to crack
can you not see that you will always be my friend
dances with wolves lets the unhappy echo of these words fade away before he starts his pony again
we follow for a few yards
then the call comes a second time
if anything more urgent than before
dances with wolves
dances with wolves stops
he drops his head painfully as the sound of his own name booms through his head
troops are moving through the trees quietly sabers drawn
the rest of the troops have moved to the edge
they too are quiet
down below the pawnee scouts are milling about looking for sign
the soldiers from the canyon floor are silently arriving on the scene
the pawnee look to the lead scout on the canyon rim
they have no answer and the lead scout has none to give the general at his side
ten bears village is gone
wind in his hair and several other warriors are just drawing back from unseen vantage points on the canyon rim
wind in his hair glances back and hesitates as though waiting for someone
a great yellow full moon has just appeared above the opposite rim of the canyon
the yellow is brilliant a great spotlight of golden color
a wolf steps into the light on the opposite rim
hes walking in the backdrop of the moon
the wolf suddenly arches his back sticks his muzzle in the air and produces a spine tingling howl
the sound bounces all over the canyon
dances with wolves is at the canyons rim
he listens a long time fully entranced by the wolfs howl
he is still listening when it is gone
a whisper floats out of the night behind him
dances with wolves
dances with wolves shrinks back from the canyons rim turns and trots off into the darkness following his friends
