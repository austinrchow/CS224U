written by matthew vaughn jane goldman peter straughan a strange roaring sound
light begins to spill on her from the right revealing her face lost in thought
this is rachel singer pretty painfully young looking
a surgical dressing covers half her face
as we pull back a little we see that two young men sit either side of her
they are stephan gold thirties thick set capable and david peretz late twenties dark haired and pale faced
the three faces in the darkness each looking straight ahead something from a caravaggio painting
the roaring which we realise is the sound of engines gradually runs down into silence
the light from the bay door which is opening off screen begins to flood the scene with harsh daylight revealing the inside of a cargo plane
stephan turns to look at the growing light
then he turns to rachel
rachel turns to look at david but he is standing too his face a mask
rachel gathers herself then stands and turns to follow the other two walking towards the light
as the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door we hear a womans voice we should never forget how young they were
as they walk across the tarmac first stephan
my father stephan gold was the youngest unit commander in mossad
david is next
david peretz had his twenty ninth birthday while on the mission
my mother was even younger
only twenty five
silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting military and mossad dignitaries
their hands are raised in applause
despite their youth theyd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil
the three walk towards their welcoming party
rachel blinks against the sunlight takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on
handsome impeccably groomed
a long crooked scar runs down one side of her face
a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine the surgeon of birkenau
shes wearing tinted glasses staring at us listening to sarah speak
rachels daughter sarah stands at a podium reading the dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the launch of her first book
shes and clearly her mothers daughter
the cover image from the book is projected on a screen behind sarah a black and white photograph of a young rachel david and stephan
above their faces the title in our hands
their mission had been to return him to israel to stand trial
instead it ended with his death on the streets of east berlin
as she waits behind david and stephan face bleached out by the sunlight
she stares at the ground
but this was not what was celebrated
it was their youth itself that became a symbol
here were the children who had faced israels greatest nightmare her greatest pain
david and stephan have moved out of shot and rachel reaches the dignitaries
still looking down she manages a smile a bob of her head reaches out to shake the first hand
lost in the memory
and in the simple act of facing the monster had helped to vanquish it
sarah has finished reading and looks for her mother in the audience
this book is dedicated to my inspiration
my mother rachel singer
people around rachel begin to applaud the sound almost startling her
automatically she gives the same bob of the head acknowledging the applause
sarah cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and emotion hasnt finished yet
she locks eyes with her mother
mother im so very proud to be your daughter
rachel manages to smile
the room is now alive with the excited chatter of the guests
rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed social smile murmuring thanks to well wishers trying to get out trying not to look like shes trying to
she emerges onto the empty patio slides the glass door shut behind her muffling the chatter from the room beyond
she lights a cigarette inhales greedily trying to calm down
she stares at the sun blazing over the mediterranean ahead of her
her glasses darken against the reflected glare
as if sensing something she turns to see a small boy her grandson watching her from behind the glass of the patio door something unnerving in his direct gaze
rachel stares back at him in silence
sarah appears behind the boy her son and scoops him up into a hug
still the boy stares at his grandmother who gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea
another guest walks up to sarah and she nods smiling at what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her mother standing on the other side
of the glass
a shabby dimly lit stairwell in a run down section of the city
a young mossad agent knocks at one of the apartment doors
after a moment it is answered by older david now
you were expecting me
david looks at this young version of himself
i was expecting you
would you come with me sir
david stares at him then walks back into the apartment
the door almost swings shut and the agent catches it considering walking in after him
but before he can david re emerges carrying his jacket
we track with david close on his face as the two men begin the long walk down the staircase
he doesnt say anything to his companion doesnt look around him and we hold on that face as his mind tries to catch up tries to work something out to
the apartment block stands on stilts
abandoned furniture is piled around the columns supporting the building
still on david as the two men walk out from the darkness into the street that services the run down estate
david follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road
they cross a busy carriageway and wait for a moment on the central reservation for a break in the traffic
parked on the far side of the road two identical cars their windows tinted
the agent moves to the leading car opens the drivers door and gets in
david stops in the road opens the rear passenger door and throws his jacket inside
he pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second car
a man sits in the back of the car silhouetted against the brightness outside
this is older stephan now
he watches as david straightens up hands on hips squinting up at the sun
the agent turns
beat i i think i
he stands like that for a moment and then suddenly steps out into the road in front of an on coming truck
the impact sweeps him out of the frame
the shocked agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other cars screech to a halt in front of davids lifeless body
a celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress publishers journalists local dignitaries
rachel is re joining the table taking her place beside her daughter amidst the dinner party chatter
sarah watches her
when are you going to stop
i hope so
do it for your grandson
are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow
its all arranged im afraid
but well have breakfast before you go
i thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach
trying to sound casual id like you to see more of him
a waiter leans over with wine for rachel
she covers her glass
to sarah ill at ease well ill be back
maybe in the holidays or
miriam a publisher appears at her shoulder with a copy of sarahs book
ive marked the place
i thought perhaps from chapter eleven
yes thank you
rachel nods absently flicking through the pages of the book
sarah realizes with a small stab of pain that she has no idea what that means
if youd rather read something else mother
no thats fine
rachel is barely listening
she is staring at a black and white photograph in the book
we see that the photograph is of a young man in nazi uniform
its titled dieter vogel the surgeon of birkenau
you must be very proud
rachel looks up at her realizes what miriam is talking about
a little automatic its a wonderful achievement
im very proud of her
and im sure you were invaluable in the research
keeping it light actually my mother withstood all interrogation
my father was the talker
trying a joke im the only journalist in israel she wont speak to
miriam laughs obligingly but sarah instantly regrets the remark
there is a sudden excited murmur from the table
the women look over to where stephan approaches the table
he is in a motorised wheelchair
the mossad agent attends discreetly in the background
rachels face hardens
i thought he couldnt come
standing up surprised so did i
several of the local politicos have stood up to greet stephan who is all smiles and handshakes
to the politicos please sit sit
my god it must be election season
theres good natured laughter from the table
sarah joins her father kissing his cheek
so youre the famous author ive heard so much about
rachel watches as he takes a place at the table picks up a copy of the book and examines the cover photograph holding his glasses a little from his eyes
without looking rachel
to sarah now youre the expert maybe you could tell me something
pointing to himself whos this handsome devil on the cover
more polite laughter from the table
it went well
she was wonderful
thats very good
rachel takes a sip of water and notices stephens hands crumbling some bread theyre shaking
she looks up at his face reads the hidden strain there
he senses her gaze and meets it and for a second his smile falters and something like panic flickers in his eyes
rachel stares back at him disturbed
miriam stands tapping her glass with her fork
i just want thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the launch of this wonderful book
im sure were all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table
and even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us
she gestures to rachel who stands still looking at stephan
the table quietens down
rachel opens the book at the marked place and hesitates only now realising what she is about to read
reading on the evening of the st of december it began to rain more heavily
so isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that rachel remembered it was new years eve
young rachel stands in the small kitchen
rain lashes on the window
she stares out at some fireworks exploding nearby then turns away and begins to gather three metal saucepans from the shelves
we track with her as she walks into the
and begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the rainwater which is dripping through various points in the ceiling
as she positions the last pot we revolve around her to get our first view of the far wall
and there tied to a radiator is dieter vogel now
hes bound his mouth taped apparently asleep
rachel doesnt of course react to this sight
instead she begins to clear away some pieces of broken glass bowl from the floor
we track with her as she walks back down the short hallway into the kitchen drops the pieces of bowl into the bin
from the living room comes the three distinct pings of rainwater dripping in the pots
she stops suddenly puzzled
its a moment before she works out what shes noticed something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door
there are only two drips instead of three
she walks back towards the living room
v through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned
rachel slows to a stop
a sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but
its too late
vogel steps out of the alcove hes been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a shard of glass
instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face
vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass
her training kicking in rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist vogels forearm breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until with a yell of
pain vogel drops the shard
he swings wildly at her but rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face
vogel stumbles back surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow
rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes
as she wipes her eyes clear vogel grabs a lamp from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face
vogel begins to run but driven by adrenaline and desperation rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the
vogel stumbles manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on rachel who lets go with a moan
he stamps again steps free and kicks her hard in the head
rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest losing consciousness
v low angle fluttering in and out of darkness vogels feet as he stands beside us breathing hard
then he turns and hurries to the front door
vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off down the spiral staircase of the apartment building
rachel lies motionless
then a cough
and finally she rolls over holding her gaping cheek with one hand and drags herself towards the chest of drawers
vogel runs down the spiral staircase
with difficulty rachel pulls out a gun fitted with a silencer
and pulls herself towards the door
vogels dwindling figure as he nears the bottom of the stairs
streaming blood from her face rachel heaves herself out of the apartment towards the railings guarding the walkway
we hear the clatter of vogels feet on the stairs below
she raises the gun to the railings to take aim
bursting from the stairwell vogel starts to run across the courtyard towards the street
rachels aim follows vogels lunge for the gateway
there is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see vogel lit about to make it to the gate and disappear forever
a single shot
and improbably incredibly the tiny figure of vogel drops
rachel hangs over the banisters far above us gun in hand staring at us with disbelief
rachel finishes reading and puts the book down
the air of bonhomie has been replaced by an uneasy silence
not knowing what else to do one of the guests begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in
rachel doesnt acknowledge the applause
stephan is staring at her with a strange intensity
stephan and rachel sit in the back of the car
behind a screen the young mossad agent we saw earlier sits in the front next to the driver
tel aviv races by in neon smears
the air is charged with tension
of the driver hes driving too fast
stephan ignores her
she turns to the window watches as they streak past another car
this is ridiculous
whats so important
tell me where were going
were going to davids apartment
rachel turns to him startled
i keep track of people rachel
its my job
beat i know he came to see you yesterday
contemptuous whats this
the jealous ex husband or the intelligence officer
a little of both
what did he want
what did he tell you
something about his intensity unnerves her
he didnt tell me anything
off his look he didnt
he told me where hed been travelling that hed been teaching
we spoke for a few minutes and then i had to go
stephan is still staring at her reading her
bristling if you dont believe me ask him yourself
and then he cant keep it from his face and she knows
something terrible has happened
stephan sits in the middle of the squalid living room lost in thought
rachel walks slowly though the room taking it all in the little islands of occupation the places where david sat read slept
piles of newspapers
a mound of laundry
on rachel as she looks about her looking for something some sign from the man she knew
but theres nothing personal here
these are the rooms of a man who had no real home
rachel walks in and switches on the light
she stares around the dirty bathroom
turning to face us the beautiful smile
as she begins to cry
stephan sits listening to her breaking down
rachel sits on the couch
why did he do it
stephan looks at her considering
he takes out a sheet of printed paper hands it to her
she reads some of the first page then looks up at him
and now we see it on her face too
the mossad agent sits on the stairs smoking
as the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches rachel sweep past him down the stairs without giving him a glance
rachel is packing folding clothes neatly precisely silently all the time a terrible tension in her movements
she tries to close a drawer but it sticks she keeps trying then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room
she stands breathing hard
the next day
tables under umbrellas are ranged along the terrace
sarah and her husband are on the beach below playing with their son laughing
as if feeling our gaze she looks up at us shielding her eyes against the sun
rachel sits at a table with stephan watching her daughter
stephan takes out an envelope and passes it to her
she opens it and examines the contents an air plane ticket and two passports
stephan takes out a small black case and slides it across the table towards her
she turns to look at it with disgust knowing what it is
then she takes it and puts it in her handbag
my cars waiting outside
it can take you to the airport
rachel turns back to stare at her daughter
sarah playing with her son glances up once more at her mother on the patio
rachel stands an elegant woman at breakfast her dark glasses her suit
she raises a hand and waves
puzzled sarah waves back then watches as her mother begins to walk away from her
as she walks from the bright light of the patio into the relative darkness of the hotel lobby suitcase in hand face set steely
we track with her as she emerges from the shadow of the hotel back into the bright sunshine of the street and starts to walk along the sidewalk
after a moment a car purrs alongside
she ignores it for a moment keeps on walking the car cruising beside her
finally almost angrily she stops and gets in
the young agent sits in the back seat next to her
the car pulls smoothly away
rachel climbs from the car and walks towards the building pulling her wheeled suitcase
the young agent has climbed out and moves swiftly ahead of her waiting as she passes into the departure building
rachel looks down at her passport
we see her photograph and name rachel singer
she hardly reacts as the agent ushers her to the front of the queue
an officer takes her passport and as he checks it we see
the passport again
were now looking at the black and white image of young rachel
the name beneath it is elsa the passport is slid back across the counter and we find ourselves in
rachel takes her passport back from the border guard and walks forward past the barrier into east germany
a crowd of people are waiting beyond the check point for their loved ones
theyre all looking eagerly at us
only one young man has his back to us turning away to light a cigarette
then he turns young david a fine sensitive face darkly shadowed eyes
this is the shot we saw earlier
a moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part right
then he smiles his beautiful smile
supered titles read east berlin
rachel walks up to him and after a fractional hesitation they embrace
in german how was your trip
everyone sends their love
youve cut your hair
david takes her suitcase and they begin to walk away hand in hand along the berlin wall
rachel nods embarrassed
they have turned into another quieter street
david lets go of her hand and they walk on
a figure leans over the railing on the crumbling balcony at the top of the building smoking a cigarette watching
this is young stephan
david and rachel are coming through the iron gate into the run down looking courtyard
a middle aged woman the buildings only other occupant watches the couple as the pass david murmuring a greeting
a brief glimpse of the couple climbing the winding stairs a view we have seen before
the place looks like a squat
young stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright piano a cigarette in his mouth
he looks up as david and rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway looking every inch the young married couple
stephan looks at them for a beat then starts to play the first few bars of mendelssohns wedding march
the other two blush furiously not amused
rachel takes her case from david
where do i sleep
youre in my room
he waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction
im moving in with him
beat youre at the end there
she nods and walks off
stephan is smoking
david sits at the table
he is using a file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of sprung steel
both men can hear the bath running in the bathroom both very aware of this new female presence in the house theyve been sharing together for the last month
what do you think of your new wife
david frowns at the steel strip seeming preoccupied
stephan watches him amused
you didnt notice
he begins to sort his possessions out
you know what ive noticed
you dont notice women
ive noticed that
how long have i known you
examining the steel i dont know
all the places weve been to
you dont look at women
before i get into that bed is there anything you have to tell me
david sighs blows on the steel strip and holds it up for stephan to examine
we hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse of rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door heading for her room
the two men watch her pass
stephan turns and catches davids expression
i think he just noticed
rachel sits on her bed drying her hair
she stops listening to the indistinct murmur of the mens voices from the room next door
rachel leans towards the wall trying to hear more but the voices fall silent
david holding a kitchen knife moves to stab stephan
stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him
the knife clatters to the floor as he twists davids arm behind his back
theres an element of showing off and stephan uses a little more force than is necessary
david winces but doesnt say anything
stephan turns to rachel who has been watching
rachel nods and they change places
david picks up the knife and repeats the attack move on her
she disarms him easily
now an attack from behind
david takes his position grabbing rachel from behind but hes so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative
stephan talks as rachel practises breaking free from the hold
where have you come from
what were you doing there
my husband is an industrial chemist
stephan glances at david amused
he does look like a chemist
david grabs rachel again once more holding back a little
shes not going to fucking break david
he takes davids place
what were you doing before this
before argentina we lived in hungary where my husband studied
stephan is smiling
she realizes hes talking about mossad
and what did you do in liaison
stephan looks even more amused
so first time in the field
rachel feels herself blush a little angrily
stephan grabs her from behind and rachel executes a perfect break twisting stephens arm
stephan winces surprised
david gives the slightest of smiles
welcome to metsada
rachel lies in bed restlessly playing with a locket around her neck
giving up on trying to sleep rachel rises from the bed throws on a robe and pads out of the room
and into the living room
she sits down at the table stares at a file before her
she hesitates then opens it forces herself to look at the terrible photographs inside a pile of severed legs bodies covered in mustard gas wounds phosphorus burns a naked woman
barely a skeleton held up by two nazi nurses a row of dead babies rulers laid beside them to indicate dimensions
rachel stares at this last image overwhelmed
david stands watching her through the half open door
he makes a small move perhaps to go to her then stops himself and slips back into the darkness
a tram trundles down the wide berlin street
rachel and david are walking to vogels surgery holding hands
shes pale very frightened
david walks trying and failing to think of anything to say to her
he suddenly notices an odd sound
its rachel humming tunelessly to herself very low
something about this pierces him
he gives her hand a squeeze
the two stand in the doorway at the foot of the stairs leading into the clinic their husband and wife routine
in german ill be waiting for you
she nods trying to smile
her throat is tight i wont
she turns to go looking so young and lost
david hesitates staring after her then walks quickly away
rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance
a large notice board covered with photographs of grateful smiling mothers holding their newborn babies row upon row of new life
rachel sits staring at the board
she turns her attention to the frosted glass door to the doctors surgery
indistinct shadows move on the other side
she turns to look at the other two women sitting looking through magazines then back to the door
a shadow darkens as it approaches the glass then the door opens and a nurse leans out
all dialogue at the clinic is in german subtitled
with a smile the nurse gestures for rachel to enter
rachel stands behind a screen trying to control her nerves
all we can hear is the sound of running water and rachels tense breathing
finally she takes off her skirt and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers
she puts on the gown and slips out of her underpants stumbling as she steps out of them
we track with her as she walks out from behind the screen into the large brightly lit room
she walks towards the gynaecological chair at the centre of the room
on the far wall behind a screen someone stands washing their hands at a basin
as she walks rachel passes a tray of medical instruments her glance lingering on it
she reaches the chair and climbs onto it
a pause and then tentatively she lifts her feet into the stirrups tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can
she tries to steady her breathing focussing on the ceiling
a bright light shines down on her
we hear footsteps approach
rachel closes her eyes
good morning frau roget
im doctor bernhardt
rachel opens her eyes
vogel is sitting on a small stool taking a speculum from the tray of instruments his back to us
good morning doctor
he turns and smiles at us and he has a wonderful warm smile the air of a gruff but kindly uncle
alright now just relax
were going to do a little examination
if you feel at all uncomfortable you just say
she manages to nod
alright this is my hand
and this is the speculum
its going to feel cold
rachel reacts as vogel pushes the speculum into place opens it and begins the examination
she stares up into the light
can i ask how old you are
and how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby
nearly two years
well the ovaries look fine
alright lets see
your cervix is slightly retroverted
rachel raises her hand to her locket necklace and begins to fiddle with it
the angle from which we next see vogel and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white tells us clearly that this locket conceals a camera
but that generally shouldnt affect fertility
you have a slight accent frau roget
where are you from
we just moved here
a few months ago
whereabouts in argentina
he looks up at her and rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket
she finds herself nodding
vogel looks away again
rachel bites down on a wave of panic
oh buenos aires
i went once when i was young
we went to the opera house i remember
whats it called again
rachel stares at the light
he turns back to her holding a swab the warm smile
this might sting a little dear
now theres a couple of tests we need to run make sure there are no problems
is that alright
he pats her hand
rachel walks out and finds david waiting smoking
he takes her hand and they walk off without speaking
the two turn the corner out of sight of the clinic
david glances at her
she looks pale shaken
he feels a wave of sudden tenderness for her opens his mouth to say something then catches himself
close on their hands
after a moment david lets go
they walk on
stephan sits at a table
rachel and david appear beside him and join him
there is an awkward silence for a moment
stephan sips his coffee
in german so
in german abruptly next appointment is on wednesday
she looks at david but he is staring at the table
like stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what rachel has been through
she takes his hand
he looks up surprised searches her face
but then rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets
david looks down at the silver locket lying in his palm
stephan walks down the street
a smartly dressed man walks towards him absently jingling his car keys in his hand
as he nears stephan the man fumbles the keys and they drop
stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back to the man with a smile
the two continue on their way and we follow the smartly dressed man closing in on his hand in which he now holds his keys and the locket
we see him tuck it into his jacket pocket as he walks on
the footbridge which crosses over a closed railway station below
on either side of the bridge runs a barbed wire topped fence
a few pedestrians cross the bridge in the early evening gloom intent on getting home
david and stephan appear walking over the bridge towards us
davids eyes flick to the tracks ahead and below as a train begins to thunder by
stephan begins to count softly to himself as the train runs below his feet
one two three four five six
its a ghost station
a hand drawn plan of a railway station is on the table
david indicates the tracks on the plan
west berlin trains pass through east berlin on this track but dont stop
he raises a lighter to the cigarette in his mouth
as the train disappears into the gloom and stephan slows to light his cigarette
beside him davids eyes flick to the station platform in between the tracks below eerily lit in the gathering dusk
v several border guards patrol the abandoned platform
the stations guarded at all times
were tracking past the entrance to stairs leading down from the bridge onto the platform below
we see its been sealed off with a locked gate
another border guard stands on the stairs below staring up at us as we pass
david indicates the point on the plan
and the stairs to the platform are sealed off
the two men have walked on past the mid point of the bridge
david glances at the far track
v the track runs along the far side of the platform
on the other side of the track is a barbed wire topped wire fence
our train driver makes an unscheduled stop on the near track
the last two carriages will be around
stephan indicates a point on the track
and they will be empty
once that train has stopped the guards wont be able to see this fence
and on the other side of the fence is
the two men are at the top of the stairs on the other side of the bridge now
stephan glances to his right
v tracking as we descend the stairs
we can see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a car park and a long low building
a postal depot
we see that car park is lined with the yellow vans of deutsche post
several female postal workers in dark skirts and white blouses stand around the car park on their breaks smoking and chatting
as we watch one of the vans trundles out of the open factory gate
the vans come and go all day long
david rolls up the plan
were just one more parcel
once were in west berlin therell be transport to templehof airbase and a private charter
stephan stubs out his cigarette
thats the wrapping
now all we need is the present
rachel realises both men are looking at her
rachel runs the hem of a partially made white garment through a sewing machine
she finishes and takes it over to where stephan stands waiting
its unfinished but a fairly good approximation of a medics white coat
try this on
stephan puts it on
she tugs at the coat straightens the unfinished collar runs her hands down the front to smooth it out
re the coat how does it feel
rachel ignores this begins to pin the cuff of one of the sleeves
here you are mossad agent all those years of training the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah first big mission
rachel resists a smile brandishes the pin
black belt in dressmaking
he holds up his hands in surrender
i never argue with an armed woman
rachel and stephan sit as david serves the dinner
rachel examines her dish
politely what is it
beat it doesnt have a name
stephan tastes his
david lifts his spoon blows on it
solemn now it does
they laugh a little settle into eating
david stares at his bowl deciding whether or not to say something
its my birthday
they look up at him in surprise
tinny music plays
the place is almost empty
in the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer just young people laughing a little drunk
they could be students
rachel is reciting something from memory
uh at ten study the mishnah at fifteen study the talmud
by eighteen stand under the wedding canopy
were too late for all of those
in your twenties you are to pursue your lifes goals
flirtatious what are you pursuing rachel
rachel thinks about it shrugs
i dont know
im waiting to find out
smiles to himself youth
what about you grandfather
have you got a goal
smiling oh yes
we believe in goals in my family
were very driven men
my father was director of collections by the time he was fifty
so whats your goal
director of collections by forty
to david what about you david
what life goal are you pursuing
david smiles stares at his drink
this is it
rachel laughs looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings
this is it
this is all you want
he would obviously rather change the subject but rachel is a little drunk a little curious
seriously what do you want out of life
beat shrugs i want this
i want to get vogel
i want him to be put on trial and i want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did
i want them all to know the truth
he looks up at their faces embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere
i want another drink
he gets up and walks off to the bar
rachel stares after him
stephan watches her
forget about it
forget about what
ive spent two years with him and i dont know him
nobody knows him
rachel thinks this over
what about family
stephan stares at her
she realises what this means
all of them
all of them
he looks over at david standing at the bar
maybe its not always a blessing to survive
a tram passes revealing stephan walking across the scrubby desolate park jingling car keys in his hand
suddenly he drops them
hes about to pick them up when a man dips down and hands them back to him
we recognize the moment
stephan walks on
in his hand he is now holding a small from rachels pov we are watching vogel as he prepares his instruments
she has come for her second examination
this is my hand
this is the speculum
rachel flinches as she feels the speculum
how did you find me
who told you about me
were you referred by a doctor or
trying to conceal her relief oh doctor eisenberg
how is the old jew
vogel busies himself for a moment
any history of infertility in your family frau roget
are your periods irregular
rachel stares up at the light
i think weve found the problem
rachel stares at him she didnt know there was a problem
its very common
your ovarian follicles
well inside youre still immature
we need to help you with this
theres something we can use a little injection
do you want to proceed
rachel nods dumbly
vogel nods turns back to his tray of instruments begins preparing an injection
vogel turns back to her with the hypodermic needle
instinctively rachel stiffens
he injects her
as he works how many brothers and sisters do you have
an only child
vogel smiles not unkindly
and yet you say theres no family history of fertility problems
beat i lost my mother in the war
vogel stares at her
then to her dismay he takes her hand and pats it with such a sad sympathetic look that she feels her eyes prick with tears
then he lets go and turns back to the examination
rachel comes out to find david waiting for her again
once more he takes her hand and they walk off
as they turn into the quiet street david lets go of her hand
she looks shaken
david watches her
are you alright
suddenly rachel takes his hand again
david stares straight ahead but he doesnt pull free and they walk on like that
rachel and david walk into the room and find stephan waiting for them
identity is confirmed
we have a green light
rachel and david stare at him
we are looking at a yellow deutsche post van
stephan and david are walking towards it
stephan stops by the van shielding david as he drops the length of thin steel we saw him working on earlier from his sleeve an improvised slim jim
with professional ease he slips the jim between the window and the weather shield
in seconds he has the door open and the two climb in
rachel comes out of the bathroom in her nightclothes with her hair wet around her
she looks into the kitchen
david is sitting smoking
rachel pauses in the doorway and then walks in
a small two bar electric fire provides the only light in the room
rachel kneels down in front of it to dry her hair
david looks at her as rachel spreads her hair around her shoulders
she looks very beautiful
she starts to comb her hair
on impulse rachel holds out the comb to david
david takes it
he starts to comb pulling it slowly through her hair
the atmosphere is suddenly charged
its a brave thing youre doing
im not brave
but youre doing it anyway
because you know how important it is
another stroke and then he stops again stares at the comb in his hand
youre very brave
rachel turns round and stares at him overcome with longing
she leans in to kiss him
for a moment david hesitates but then its as if something inside him closes and he pulls back from rachel his face cold
without a word he gets up and walks out
rachel sits crushed
rachel sits at the piano in her robe picking out notes
shes been crying
stephan stands watching her from the doorway holding a drink something slightly predatory about him
he crosses to her sits down beside her and starts to match her notes
they work out a nonsense tune between them
david listens as they play
rachel picks up stephens drink and takes a sip
defiantly rachel drains the glass grimaces a little
stephan watches her
he continues to play moving the melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers then covering hers
rachel brushes him away
he puts his hand back and starts to caress her wrist
youre so beautiful
he begins to kiss her neck
rachel stares ahead pretending it isnt happening
then she gives in turning to him
rachel stands at the mirror dressing in a dark skirt and white blouse trying to control all the emotions she is feeling
behind her stephan lies in the bed watching her
rachel and david cross the courtyard to the gate
david holds it open for rachel
as they turn into the street david takes her hand
both stare fixedly ahead only too aware of what happened the night before
rachel is in the chair for what she knows will whatever happens be the last time
alright this is my hand
and this is the speculum
vogel begins the exam
from beneath her gown rachel slips a you had intercourse last night
youre at the most fertile stage of your cycle
this is very good timing
he turns to his tray of implements
i think we are going to see results
all you have to do is have faith
ask any of my patients
what about your patients in birkenau
vogel looks up in shock
rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to one side
with her other hand she jams the needle into the side of his neck and begins to depress the syringe
vogel gives a grunt of surprise opens his mouth to speak but no sound comes
he grabs vaguely for rachels throat with one hand struggles with the needle with his other eyes dull with fury fighting the drug racing through him
rachel fights to hold him bucking on the chair pinned beneath his weight struggling for breath
weakening vogel manages to pull the needle free and it drops to the floor
which we see still contains some fluid
a rope of spittle drools from vogels contorted mouth onto her face
then his eyelids flutter and close and he collapses onto her
rachel pulls his hand from her throat gasps for air
finally she pushes him to the ground
she leaps up and deliberately knocks the tray of medical instruments to the floor
the nurse runs in reacts at the sight of the prone vogel
overlapping i dont know
i dont know
he just clutched his chest and collapsed
the nurse grabs for the phone and dials
into the phone i need an ambulance
karl gustav strasse
my husband has had a heart attack
rachel reacts to this revelation
over phone your name please
its frau bernhardt please please hurry
stephan kneels in a recess of the building by the open network junction box of the clinic
hes wearing headphones alligator clipped to two cables in the box
over phones the ambulance is already on the way madam
stephan un clips the phones and pockets them
he straightens up closes the junction box and walks calmly away through a gate in the wall into the next courtyard
as stephan races up some steps along a balcony and into the building
with stephan through the hallway out of the door and onto the street
an ambulance sirens wailing starts out of the dispatch and swings onto the street
stephan rounds the corner of the street and walks towards the clinic
he checks his watch as he turns into an alley opposite the entrance
rachel finishing dressing looks anxiously at the nurse as she crouches by her unconscious husband monitoring his breathing
the ambulance speeds on
stephan pulls back some rusty doors
parked in the small courtyard beyond is the van we saw before now decorated with ambulance decals and lights
david drives the car forward as stephan climbs into the passenger side
rachel paces outside the door looking down the corridor
the nurse wipes away a tear tense and frightened
to no one in particular oh god
come on come on
a siren approaches and rachel moves to the door
stay with him
ill go and get them
the nurse nods gratefully
a vehicle pulling up
whether its the real ambulance or the fake one were not sure
rachel runs past the concerned patients in the waiting area to see
david and stephan coming up the stairs holding a stretcher
rachel leads them in
stephan crouches down beside vogel and takes his pulse
we need to take him to the hospital
he and david open up the stretcher and transfer vogel to it with some efficiency
hes going to be alright
rachel and the nurse follow david and stephan as they carry the stretcher out through the waiting room
we hear the siren of the real ambulance starting up not so very far away down the street as david and stephan push the stretcher towards the doors
the nurse follows but david stops her
im sorry madam but youll need to meet us at the hospital
i want to travel with him
not possible im afraid
we begin to register that the siren is growing louder with every second
as stephan and david carry the stretcher down the stairs rachel takes the nurses hand to detain her
dont worry hes in good hands now
hes going to be fine
you should get your things go to the hospital to meet him
the nurse nods tearfully starts to back towards her office watching as they disappear
david closes the rear door of the van and the two jump in and drive off as rachel comes out of the building
she begins to walk briskly away
behind her the real ambulance is pulling up at the clinic
she doesnt turn back
the deutsche post van that david and stephan stole earlier pulls out into the street
behind it we catch a glimpse of the now abandoned ambulance
david quickly closes the gate and climbs in
stephan draws up alongside rachel and she climbs in as the door is opened for her
the winter evening is gathering outside
david and rachel are in the back of the van
david has taken off the white coat
david checks his watch
tense i know i know
rachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling
she looks down at the stretcher vogel lies unconscious
one of his hands jolts free and drops onto her foot
gingerly she steps free
the depot car park is dark rows of postal vans parked up
an eerie silence
through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the tracks and dimly lit station platform beyond guards patrolling in the little pools of light
as we watch a postal worker comes out of the depot and walks through the carpark and out of the gate his shift finished
were watching the worker walk in front of us and leave the car park
in the dark of the back of the van rachel crouches watching him leave
she turns back to where stephan and david wait by the van doors bolt cutters in their hands
on the floor of the van lies vogels unconscious form
they wait in absolute silence listening to the fading footsteps of the worker
david checks his watch holds up a single finger to stephan
moments later we hear the sound of an approaching stephan raises a hand and counts them down five four three two one
the two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the base of the foot bridge stanchion as the train roars from the darkness and begins to
pass them screening the two men from the guards on the platform
rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches down by a junction box screened
from the platform standing watch
she looks over to stephen and david in the shadows of the bridge stanchion
again silence falls
then faintly we hear another engine approach
moments later another train begins to roar past
instantly the two men rise from the shadows and begin to cut through the wire fence working with fierce concentration
softly one two three four five six
rachel checks the car park behind for workers
the train is almost past
the two men work feverishly snipping through the remaining links working their way towards each other forming a four foot long split in the fence
they sprint for the stanchion again
as he runs twenty twenty one twenty two
as they dive for cover the last carriages of the train pass
a guard on the platform glances over but sees nothing but darkness and the vague outline of the postal vans beyond the fence
he continues walking down the platform
rachel holds her breath but nothing disturbs the new silence
along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched in the shadows
stephan raises his hand in an ok signalling theyre ready
rachel suddenly hears footsteps echoing in the car park
through the window of a van she can see a postal worker emerging from the depot and crossing the car park
as she watches he takes out a cigarette starts to light it but then stops
he is staring over at the footbridge as if he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base
he takes a few steps forward puzzled
a little closer and he might really see something
rachel looks to the platform the two guards visible there are talking to each other looking the other way
she takes her chance moves up behind the parked vans
as he takes a few steps closer to where stephan and david are crouched
calling do you have a light
the man turns and takes in this pretty postal worker who has emerged behind him
he smiles and walks back towards her
he lights her cigarette studies her face
the girls said it was okay to come out for a smoke
david and stephan lie listening to the murmured conversation
yeah its okay
are you working until midnight
after the late shift most of us go to the vetter
do you know it
david checks his watch again nods at stephan
we hear another approaching train
smiling pretending to be listening to the worker
its just on the corner
you should come along
she glances through the fence and down the track to where the trains light can be seen approaching in the gloom
this is it
the inert body of vogel lying on the floor
his hands bound at the wrist suddenly twitch involuntarily
pov the border guards on the platform
the driver begins to brake
the border guards watch in surprise as the train slows
as it passes them the train screens stephan and david from the platform
the two men rise and swiftly begin to cut the remaining section of fence
as the train comes to a halt the last carriages stop directly opposite them empty and dark
theyre almost there
in the distance at the head of the train the driver can be seen stepping down and gesturing to the guards pointing up ahead
theres something on the tracks up here
the guards peer doubtfully into the gloom ahead
one sets off to investigate
getting rid of the worker
well maybe ill see you there
i finish in half an hour
why dont you go and get me a drink ready
the worker cant believe his luck
half an hour then
he starts to move towards the gate
suddenly the van horn blares shattering the silence of the car park
stephan and david turn back to the van
she turns shocked
the worker too turns back in surprise
vogel hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats and is pressing frantically on the horn
he claws at the tape over his mouth manages to pull it free
stephan leaps into the van and is upon him in seconds
vogel manages to give a hoarse yell then stephan uses a krav magah move to silence him
the remaining border guard is staring over at the darkened car park trying to work out what he just heard
what was that
david watches in dismay as a guard comes into view at the far end of the platform entering a guard hut
he lifts a telephone inside
he heads for the van at a crouching run
rachel indicates the vans closest to them
i think it came from over here
no it was one of those
he steps past her peering at the shadowy vans ahead
rachel stares at him wondering if she can take him down silently
stay where you are
she turns to see two border guards approaching the side gate of the car park
as the border guard comes back from checking the lines ahead
theres nothing there
get moving now
his part of the mission completed the driver climbs back into his cab
as one of the guards approaches her pistol drawn
the second guard fans past walking slowly towards the bridge
the first guard shines a torch into rachels face
what are you doing here
i work here
im on a break
show me your papers both of you
the worker nervously fumbles for his papers passes them to the guard who inspects them
david watches rachel offer her papers to the guard as the train starts to rumble back into life
he moves back towards the van
hissing we have to go
david stares over at rachel
stephan grabs vogel
we can make it
help me with him
handing them back you can go
the worker gratefully hurries away
rachel is watching tensely as the second guard closes on the van
stephan watches the train pulling away their last chance
he has pulled vogels body to the door
hissing were going
david shakes his head
not without her
he moves up the blind side of the van
the second guard takes a few more steps and stops in surprise the opening in the fence visible now
david appears behind him and downs him fast
a guard on the platform has turned to see the opening in the fence and yells out
as the guard beside her turns his attention to his comrade rachel grabs the guards gun hand sweeping it away from her at the same time stepping in close and
punching the guards throat with her other hand
as he staggers back choking she twists the gun free
another guard hits an alarm
a siren begins to sound
about to head back to the van
a shot rings out and a bullet suddenly strikes the ground beside her
she looks up to see a guard has appeared up on the bridge rifle aimed at her
other guards open fire jumping down onto the tracks and advancing towards the cut fence
acting on instinct rachel returns fire with the pistol and takes cover behind the wall
stephan has jumped into the drivers seat and starts the engine
david scrambles into the back barely making it before stephan is peeling out the back door hanging open
as more guards appear at the side gate behind her shes caught between them now
she watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit
suddenly it brakes
stephan throws the gear into reverse
and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards rachel
the guards at the side gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them bullets pocking the rear doors
the side door is flung open and rachel dives in just as stephan roars forward again
the guard from the bridge has run down the stairs and is now between us and the exit
as we watch he raises his rifle
the three duck as the guard fires punching a neat hole in the windscreen
seconds later the van thuds into him sending him flying
as it roars out of the depot gates bullets flying past it
on the road ahead a border guard jeep appears driving directly towards them
stephan has no choice he floors it
at the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall
stephan fights to keep the van under control screeches into a turn and off down the road
is he dead
beat is he dead
the one who saw your face
is he dead
stephens grim silence says everything
he glances back at the unconscious vogel lying between the other two
how did he come round
how the fuck did he come round
you gave him the full injection
did you give him the
i dont know
i thought i
stephan cant believe its all fallen apart so quickly
we could have gone
its not over
we could have fucking
we still have him
stephan glares at david but doesnt say anything
the van roars on
rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room staring at something
three pots have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room
we hear the three distinct notes of the water drops
rachel stares dully at the water dripping feeling exhausted and numb
a key scrapes and rachel turns to the door as stephan and david walk in hair soaked from the rain
standing up what did he say
stephan stalks past ignoring her
you made contact
david looks after stephan whos walked on into the living room in grim silence
what did he say
its going to take time
they need to open up a new route they need to find political help
maybe the americans
rachel reacts with dismay
rachel moves after david towards the living room
the camera continues after her
we work four shifts guarding him
we feed him at the end of each shift
we never leave him alone
turns to rachel hard and youre compromised
you dont leave the fucking house
we can do this
we just need to stay focussed
the three turn to stare at something off screen
the camera continues into the room to find vogels body slumped on the floor bound to the radiator mouth taped slumped unconscious
we continue towards him
closing on his face
then his eyes open and he looks at us
rachels eyes open and she lies in bed listening to the muffled sound of vogel cursing and yelling in german next door a breakfast ritual that has been going on
in german fucking assholes
fucking pig shit food
david and stephan are wrestling with an enraged vogel trying to feed him
a bowl clatters to the floor
vogels shouts are muffled as his mouth is taped again
he continues to swear at his captors as best he can through his gag
rachel tries to block out the sound with her blanket
rachel walks in and finds a flushed david wiping oatmeal off his trousers the empty bowl on the bench beside him
off her look at this rate hes going to starve himself to death before we can get him back
rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift watching vogel who is slumped asleep
he looks dishevelled the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin
she cant delay the moment anymore
she takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside her and walks towards vogel stirring the bowl with an unsteady hand
she kneels down in front of him
in the silence we hear rain falling heavily outside
vogel wakes stays slumped staring at her with dull eyes
she takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes the food from his chin
finally she removes the tape from his mouth
vogel watches her without moving
she offers him a spoon of oatmeal waiting for the sudden yelling and abuse
he says nothing just opens his mouth obediently
rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal
he speaks to rachel in german subtitled
rachel ignores him feeds him another spoonful
is she hurt
another spoonful and another
is she alright
an alarm clock on the table rings the end of her shift
she wipes his mouth tears some tape from the roll
vogel closes his eyes a look of such genuine suffering it stops rachel
tell me shes alright
rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands
david walks in and takes his place in the armchair facing vogel
rachel begins to leave
she looks back at vogel who is staring after her eyes pleading
she hesitates then gives a small nod and turns to walk out of the room passing stephan who has been standing in the doorway watching her
rachel starts to wash the oatmeal bowl
stephan follows her in
you cant talk to him
i didnt say anything
you cant listen to him
overlapping im not angry he rubs her back
rachel stiffens a little
im just telling you we dont talk to him
we dont listen to him
he isnt there
he isnt a human being
he stops himself
we have a date
ten days time
the americans are going to help
rachel looks at him relieved
he smiles stares at her moves a little closer but rachel has already side stepped him and walked away
stephan sits on the armchair in front of vogel taking the gun apart cleaning it
vogel thrashes around on the floor as best he can david holding him down
stephan tries to force oatmeal into him
he spits it back out
rachel is cleaning trying to keep busy trying to keep the encroaching decay of the kitchen at bay scrubbing and scrubbing
an exhausted david finishing his shift walks out of the living room as stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his place
rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom for a moment the three criss crossing each others paths
rachels bedroom door closes
both men avoid looking at each other as they pass it
stephan and david are carrying a struggling cursing vogel towards the bathroom
before they can get there vogel pisses himself the urine puddling on the floor at their feet
stephan drops vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way
vogel lies in the pool staring up at him eyes triumphant
vogel leans against the wall staring blankly at the window sunk into a profound depression
he looks filthy jaw dark with beard growth
rachel watches him from the doorway
rachel is washing vogels face with a towel
he pays no attention continuing to stare out of the window
rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream strips the tape off vogels mouth and begins to brush the cream over his face
she produces a razor and carefully begins to shave his cheeks
she stops suddenly a tear is running down vogels cheek cutting a line through the soap
he turns his eyes to her
why dont you just kill me now
rachel pauses for a moment
how can you keep me waiting to die like this
rachel keeps on shaving
i know what you want
you want to hand me over to the others let there be some fucking sham of a trial
then when they kill me you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands
rachel switches to the other cheek
vogels getting more animated tears in his eyes a kind of bizarre indignation
but that isnt true
there will be blood on your hands
you will be my murderer
you fucking hypocrite
rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his throat
he falls silent tenses waiting
you want to do it
rachel finishes with a trembling hand
vogel slumps back against the wall the tension in his body easing away
he gives her a long calculating look
and as we watch some change seems to come over him some new fire beginning to kindle in him a sense of cold contempt for rachel and with it perhaps
a fresh determination to survive this
you jews never knew how to kill
only how to die
rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel slaps fresh tape onto vogels mouth and gets up
rachel is cleaning the kitchen again clearing some of the mess of dishes into the sink
she moves a dirty pan which has been left overnight and stops staring at the cockroach which is crawling inside
a sudden wave of nausea hits her
rachel crouches at the toilet vomiting
she finishes rinses her mouth looks at her pale reflection
she opens the door and steps out
vogel stands directly in front of her
rachel stands frozen a split second of total panic
then stephan steps into sight behind vogel gun in hand the morning bathroom visit
rachel flattens herself against the hall wall quickly wiping her mouth dry as stephan pushes vogel past her towards the bathroom
stephan is walking back home
a police car siren wails somewhere nearby and stephan hurriedly cuts into an alley waiting in the shadows until the siren has faded away
then he hurries on his way
rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels down beside a sleeping vogel
she removes the tape
vogel wakes breathes out watches her
after a moment
i was dreaming about my wife
she feeds him some more
one of the great regrets of my life is that we were unable to have children
my wife would have made a wonderful mother
vogel watches her then suddenly speaks in english
its a great blessing
rachel stares at him
you should try lemons
for the morning sickness
rachel cant move
they say it helps
rachel struggles to hold it together feeds him another spoonful
whats your name
beat you jews stay close to your roots dont you
its a good thing
rachel spoons in another mouthful
i loved the bible as a child
rachel shovels in another mouthful
he chews it thoughtfully examines her face
i understand you perfectly
beat you werent lying at the clinic when you told me about your mother were you
about her death
rachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal determined not to show any emotion
im very sorry for your loss
it almost takes her breath away
she tears the tape and puts it over his mouth gets up and walks away determined not to show him any emotion
vogel watches her go
rachel makes it out into the hallway before she feels the tears running down her face
she gives in to them turns and finds david behind her
whats the matter
she cant speak at first
she wipes her face
he can understand us
he can understand every word were saying
he just spoke to me
her face contorts as she tries to compose herself
david reaches out to hold her
its nearly over
he pulls her close holds her rests his forehead against hers
they stand like that eyes closed
the moment hangs
suddenly why didnt you go
at the station
you could have got away
why didnt you
she looks up at him
he stares into her eyes
then suddenly he kisses her
its what shes waited so long for and shes stunned for a moment then puts her arms around his neck returning the kiss hungrily
they are helpless with desire for one another
there is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and instinctively the two break apart
stephan enters hair wet from the rain
he stops seeing them sensing the atmosphere
they stare back at him
rachel steps away a little wiping her face
what did they say
stephan stares at them in silence
he unbuttons his coat
its not happening
they stare at him aghast this is the last thing they wanted to hear
what the fuck does that mean
the americans have pulled out
to rachel has he been fed
so what does that mean
did you feed him
what does that mean
whats the plan now
rising panic we just need to get him to the airfield there must be some other way some
stephan starts down the hallway towards her angry
i said has he
david instinctively steps in front of rachel raises a hand
overlapping im asking you
overlapping im talking to her
supposedly its her shift now but instead of doing what shes supposed to be doing shes out here with you
to rachel now answer the fucking question did you feed him
i fed him
stephan stands glaring at her then turns abruptly away
beat theres no plan
theres no fucking plan
they said the operation is being re evaluated
he turns to david
you know what that means
theyre going to cut us loose
they stare at him shocked
its a fucking mess and theyre backing away from it quickly as they can
i can feel it
they cant just leave us
yes they can
because we fucked it all up
we fucked it all up and now were on our own
suddenly we hear someone knocking on the front door
the three freeze staring at each other
were you followed
stephan stares at the door thrown
could you have been
there is another knock at the door
stephan turns to the chest of drawers and takes out the gun
stephan is hurriedly screwing the silencer onto the gun
theres another knock at the door
stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at vogel
vogel instinctively squirms away falling to one side wriggling back as far as he can
what are you doing
if its them he dies
vogel lies breathing hard through his nose eyes on the gun aimed at him
david suddenly steps in between the two the gun now pointing at his chest
youre not doing this
hes not getting away from me
this isnt the mission
i decide what the mission is
if i say he dies he dies
were finishing this mission
were taking him back
get out of the way
there is another knock at the door
david and stephan stare at each other the tension building
abruptly rachel turns and walks down the hallway towards the door
stephan calls after her
from the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened the murmur of conversation
the two men stand frozen listening
vogel lies breathing hard through his nose
we hear the door close
the three listen as footsteps approach down the hall
rachel walks back in
a long beat
dully it was the lady from the bottom apartment
she invited us to her new years eve party
she turns and walks back out
the others stay where they are frozen
we hear a piano playing as we
as the piano music plays we see david and stephan practise krav magah moves careful controlled but under it all an edge of real tension between them
vogel is tied in his usual place
stephan sits in a dangerous mood
hes playing the piano
a lyrical rendering of deutschland uber alles
vogel is watching him
as the music continues the two mens workout grows more intense the punches and blocks build in speed faster and faster both men breathing hard with the exertion neither willing
to stop a real violence simmering under the surface
stephan knows hes watched and avoids vogels gaze until he can stand it no longer and looks
david is the first to break through the blocks his fist stopping inches from stephens face
the two men freeze staring at each other breathing hard
the music crashes to a halt
stephan is staring at vogel
he begins to play the anthem more discordantly hitting the keys more violently as if the music is possessing him
then suddenly he stops stands up and walks away from the keyboard
stares at vogel
vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere a sense of impending violence
stephan doesnt move
the moment hangs
david is taking over the shift from stephan
they pass each other in the doorway without a word
david stops staring
vogel lies in his usual place
a sack has been placed over his head hooding him
the effect is deeply sinister
stephan sits eating with rachel
david walks in and throws the sack on the table
stephan glances at it continues eating
what are you doing
its your shift
to rachel did you know about this
to stephan his mouths taped
you want him to suffocate
i was sick of seeing his face
go back in
dont do that again
stephan gets up and walks calmly towards david as if shooing him back out the room
you dont give orders david
its your shift now so you can go back in there
he has his hands on davids chest gently pushing him back
david takes his hold of the hands pulling them free and suddenly theres a flurry of violent movement as stephan yanks his arms free of david and the two men
shove at each other
they stop breathing hard
were not animals
just remember what we are
remember what were not
he walks back out
stephan sits back at the table starts eating again
he glances at rachel but she wont look at him
after a moment she gets up and walks out
david looks up from his chair to see in the hallway
something purposeful in her manner alerts him
david appears in time to see rachel is putting on her overcoat
what are you doing
rachel doesnt look at him
i have to get out
rachel tries to unbolt the door
david bars her
rachel tries to talk calmly but shes fighting panic
get out of my way please
im just going to go out for a few minutes
thats all i want to do
stephan walks out of the kitchen taking in the scene
she wants to go out
appealing no one will see me
tell him david
i just want to walk
i just want to get some
stephan shakes his head
rachel tries to unlock the door but david has hold of it
she struggles against him
dont be stupid
he takes her arm
rachel jerks free
then she slumps against the door her back to them
shes crying brokenly
a beat as the two men stand over her not attempting to comfort her any further
stephan turns and walks away
david leans his head against the door waiting for her to stop
its raining heavily outside and water is dripping through the cracks in the ceiling
david kneels next to vogel with a bowl of oatmeal and strips the tape from his mouth
david doesnt react
vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls watching david his mood strange
david and stephan and rachel
he gives a soft laugh finding something amusing in the sound of the names
if i had a choice id prefer rachel to feed me
in another life the makings of a nurse i think
in another life
david continues to feed careful to appear immune to vogel
how is she today
you should let her get more rest
its a dangerous time the first month or two of the pregnancy
david stares at him unable to hide his shock
beat you didnt know
vogel absorbs this thoughtfully
youre not the father then
beat i thought it would be you
i dont know
the way you look at her
the way she looks at you
david stirs the oatmeal trying to think about what hes just discovered
vogel doesnt take his eyes off him
women can be like that they like to make you dance first i remember
as though to himself so she chose the other one
he shakes his head shrugs
that must be hard watching them together right in front of you
and you not saying a word
like the poet says great souls suffer in silence
i wouldnt have taken stephan as a family man
too ambitious too
david i see you with children
quietly shut up
vogel stares at him
this is the first time someone has spoken to him in weeks
hes quick to hide his sense of triumph
i am expressing my sympathy
for your suffering
what does a monster like you know about suffering
im a doctor david
david stares at him
beat you blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes
you inject people with petrol
you replace peoples hands and legs and you watch as they
he stops himself
this isnt medicine
this is disease
this is sickness
vogel seems to consider this
so we were all insane
is that the answer
beat theres no answer
im not looking for an answer
im not looking for
he forces himself to be silent tries to regain control of himself
he offers vogel another spoonful but his hand trembles a little with the violence of his emotions
david pushes the spoon into vogels mouth starts to load another spoonful
here i am the victim kidnapped bound soon to be murdered but i think you are the one that is afraid david
beat afraid of the monster
he leans closer to david
they stare at each other eye to eye
vogel senses a new brittleness in david
his tone becomes more assured
do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people
i saw it
every day i saw it
every one of them thinking only of how to avoid being flogged or kicked or killed
only thinking of themselves
david looks up at him with a strange crooked smile eyes glittering
why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers
because not one out of thousands had the courage to resist the courage to be the first to fall
not one would sacrifice himself
even when we took their children from them
i knew then that you people had no right to live no right to
he may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from david but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather than triumph we see only a
moment of startled fear in his eyes as david suddenly swings the bowl violently at his head shattering it on the pipe to which he is tied
he grabs vogel by the collar and begins to punch him hard again and again
vogel slides sideways limp
and still david punches him in a murderous rage possessed wanting to break his skull open to kill him
rachel and stephan run in with rachel reaching him first
she throws her arms around him trying to stop him but instinctively he throws a punch behind him
it connects splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground
stephan runs at him knocking him to the floor and remains lying on him the two of them breathing hard the assault finally over
vogel slumps forward held up only by the rope at his wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall
stephan is still struggling with david whos panting adrenalised staring wildly at vogels slumped body
were going out
he begins to drag him out
stephan nods in the direction of to rachel are you going to be alright
as she hears the door close she turns to stare at vogel
hes barely conscious his face smeared with blood
rachel drenches a cloth under the tap
rachel cleans the blood from vogels face
he has his eyes closed
mumbling in german thank you
she tears off a new strip of tape and places it over vogels mouth gently
she notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and walks off towards the kitchen
we hold on vogel apparently sleeping
then his tied hand reaches out straining and manages to reach one of the shards of broken bowl
rachel gathers three metal saucepans
she stops for a moment looking at fireworks flashing in the sky
she remembers its new years eve
we track with her as she walks into the living room and begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the rainwater which is dripping through various points
in the ceiling
as he uses the shard to saw through his ropes
as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of shattered bowl scattered around vogel
she kneels down in front of him and collects up the pieces
she glances up at vogel checking him
he is still slumped eyes closed
we track with her as she walks back into the kitchen
from the living room comes the three distinct pings of rainwater dripping in the pots
she drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops puzzled
its a moment before she works out what shes noticed something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door
there only two drips instead of three
she walks back towards the living room
v through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned
rachel slows to a stop
a sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but
its too late
vogel steps out of the alcove hes been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a shard of glass
instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face
vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass
her training kicking in rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist vogels forearm breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until with a yell of
pain vogel drops the shard
he swings wildly at her but rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face
vogel stumbles back surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow
rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes
as she wipes her eyes clear vogel grabs a lamp from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face
vogel begins to run but driven by adrenaline and desperation rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the
vogel stumbles manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on rachel who lets go with a moan
he stamps again steps free and kicks her hard in the head
rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest losing consciousness
v low angle fluttering in and out of darkness vogels feet as he stands beside us breathing hard
then he turns and hurries to the front door
vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off down the spiral staircase of the apartment building
rachel lies motionless
we wait for her to cough as we saw her do before
but she doesnt
she just continues to lie still
below us vogel clatters on down the stairs flight after flight
no movement from rachel
vogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard
there is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see vogel lit as he passes the point where earlier we saw him drop to the
he reaches the gate and goes through his shadow disappearing on the pavement
rachel holds a blood soaked tea towel to her cheek trying to staunch the flow
david sits staring ahead in shock
stephan bursts in out of breath
not a trace
nothing at all
he hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun puts it into his waistband
he might go to the house might try and get a message to the wife
without looking up hes not going back to the house
fifteen years it took them to find him
and hes gone
and no ones going to find him again
so we what
are you going to make the phone call
are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl
but dont try and take me down with you
ive done nothing wrong
stephan kicks at the chair at the drawers
muttering tensely this cant happen
this is never going to go away
i take responsibility
it was my shift
quietly this happened because of me
i let him go
and no ones ever going to find him again
he closes his eyes struggling with the enormity of his guilt
stephan drops the gun onto the table sits down
outside we hear more fireworks
no ones ever going to find him again
something in his voice causes rachel to look up at him
beat what if he didnt escape
what are you talking about
only four people know what happened in this room
us and him
and hes not talking
no one will ever hear from him again
realizing what he means no
nobody needs to know what happened here
thats the truth
but that doesnt have to be the truth we take home
the truth can be anything we want it to be
the truth is vogel tried to escape you struggled with him and got hurt
the truth is seconds before he got away rachel got the gun and shot him
the truth is we got rid of him
got rid of the body
got rid of every trace of the surgeon of birkenau
we cant lie about this
no you know what
we have to
we have to
this isnt about us
this is about israel
this is a national humiliation
we cant be seen to fail
and in the end vogel rots away his life in some jungle looking over his shoulder waiting for the bullet
whos to say
he looks at them both trying to convince them trying to convince himself
maybe thats a worse fate
the important thing is justice
justice is seen to be done
rachel turns to david waiting expecting him to say something
but david looks like hes been barely listening lost in his own thoughts
he notices rachel staring at him
what does it matter
beat hes gone
stephan seizes on this sensing hes close to convincing them
seizing hes right
it makes no difference
all we have to agree is that we never talk about this
no matter what happens we never tell anyone
the truth stays in this room
rachel looks at david again wanting some kind of sign
to rachel agreed
silence i need to hear you say it
shes still staring at david
hes still avoiding her gaze
to rachel say it
rachel closes her eyes
instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment
its an oath
we close on rachel
the moment that will change her life forever
from outside comes the sound of some revellers on the street cheering more fireworks
we hear some people chanting a countdown to the new year
from outside vier drei zwei ein
but just before the expected barrage of fireworks we
the young mossad agent stands smoking outside davids door
this is the scene we saw earlier
from within we can hear indistinct shouting
rachel is holding the printed sheet the point at which we left this scene earlier
crying out how could this happen
you said he would never speak
you said hed never
we dont know its him
if you read it
hes in the ukraine
what else is there to read
this is a little internet story
grabbing the paper reading
a psychiatric patient claiming to be the surgeon of birkenau
some crazy old man
no one is paying this any attention
as if her mind was elsewhere how did you find it
david comes back after all this time i want to know why
i had his apartment searched
this was on his computer
rachel stares at him
he didnt say anything to you last night
rachel doesnt answer
quietly why would he do this
because he couldnt handle it
i told him we had to deal with it and he couldnt handle it
he thought it was all going to come out and he panicked
he trails off thinking about what happened down on the road
rachel stares at him
his previous words have just sunk in
suddenly deal with it
beat what does that mean
deal with it
stephan stares at her
what did you tell him to do
simply i told him to find vogel
i told him to finish it
rachel stares at him
she stands up starts to walk away comes back slaps him hard across the face
quiet rage did you know hed been ill
you knew didnt you
you killed him
you killed him
you knew he wasnt strong enough
overlapping fuck david
i dont want to hear about david
david took the cowards way out
you could have left it alone
its an old man in a hospital
you said nobody will believe it
no one will notice
theres a journalist
this stops her
hes heard about it and hes going to interview vogel
beat then it all comes apart
beat we dont have the name of the hospital
you have to find out where he is
rachel stares at him
what are you talking about
davids taken himself out of the equation
indicating his chair i cant do it
youre the only one left
are you insane
look at me
im not capable of
this is insane
i cant do this
simply you have to rachel
because for thirty years youve been taking the credit for it
beat carefully and theres sarah
its as if hes struck her
i wont do this
she walks out
and into the stairwell
as before the mossad agent stands to let her pass and watches as she sweeps down the stairs
the scene we saw earlier
rachel is packing folding clothes neatly precisely silently but all the time theres a terrible tension about her movements
she tries to close a drawer but it sticks she keeps trying then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room
she stands breathing hard
then something we didnt see her gaze settles on a photograph beside her table sarah holding her son smiling at us
rachel stares at the photograph her breathing slowing
stephan sits amongst the remains of a meal
sarah and her husband are on the beach below playing with their son
stephan watches them
he senses a presence and turns to find rachel behind him
she sits down stares down at the beach through her dark glasses
stephan watches almost holding his breath working through lightning calculations of how to handle her
but rachel is the first to speak
beat i always knew this would happen
i knew wed be punished
i knew wed have to pay
quietly i thought id already been punished
god doesnt plant car bombs
i wasnt referring to the wheelchair
they look at each other
if i could go back rachel id change it all
if i could give you back a chance to be happy to be
she is staring back at him coldly unmoved
he shrugs letting that go
but theres one thing i would never change
she looks over to where sarah is playing with her son laughing
instantly she isnt going to find out
she shakes her head as if the idea itself were impossible
she can never find out
stephan stares at her knowing that he has her that its already decided
he takes out the envelope and slides it across the table towards her
she examines the ticket and passports inside
then he slides her the black case
weve seen this part of the scene before
she stares at it with disgust knowing what it is
then she takes it and puts it in her handbag
my cars waiting outside
it can take you to the airport
she stands up an elegant woman at lunch her dark glasses her suit
she looks down to sarah raises a hand in farewell
sarah not understanding waves a hand in response calls something which is lost under the sound of the sea
go down to her
say goodbye to her
rachel stands stock still staring down at her daughter
how can i
how can i
she turns and walks away
sarah stands shading her eyes watching the small figure of her mother walking away from her
a tram wipes through the frame to reveal rachel walking across a busy street towards the stark facade of an imposing s building
a title reads kiev ukraine the public area of the building a main reception desk a little cafe a sweeping staircase leading up to the floor above
rachel is at the reception desk
rachel crosses to a tabac kiosk glancing back to some glass doors behind her
a sign indicates the offices of the ukrainian evening news
we can see a receptionist at her desk
a young man walks through the entrance and she throws a knowing glance up at him as he passes
rachel takes in the alarm pad beside the receptionist
turning to the kiosk owner cigarettes please
rachel sits silhouetted against the large window
rachel opens her pack and lights a cigarette
a waiter approaches
in russian what can i get you
just a coffee
she stares out at the stream of people passing in and out of the building
young rachel stephan and david are giving a talk to a group of young israeli soldiers
this is a well rehearsed routine something they have probably done many times
at that moment i dont think i was thinking about myself at all
i was thinking about my mother
i was thinking about how she had suffered in europe
the faces of the soldiers moved by this
one raises a hand
the same question to mr
the others look at david waiting for him to make his usual response
but david doesnt move
stephan looks along the row
david sits staring straight ahead
the silence grows
and we realize hes not going to answer
the house is cold white aggressively modern
rachel sits in her underwear drunk a bottle and glass of wine on her dressing table
stephan is dressing behind her
calmly fuck him
he examines his reflection in the mirror
a doorbell rings downstairs
he walks out to answer it taking the wine bottle from her as he goes
rachel finishes her glass starts to apply some eye makeup
she senses something and turns to find young sarah four watching her from the doorway
she stares back at her dully
go to bed sarah
a cocktail party in progress stephan is mingling with the guests mossad high fliers military politicians
she watches him handle them just the right mix of deference and charm
rachel stands against a wall drunk watching him as he laughs sycophantically at something one of the politicians has said
he crosses over to an attractive blonde woman and greets her
as rachel watches he runs a hand down the womans back an unmistakably intimate gesture
rachel watches depressed by how little this makes her feel
she begins to mix herself another drink sees someone across the room and her face changes
hes standing alone drinking nervous
rachel appears beside him
my own party and youre the only friend i have
she turns leans against the wall scans the party watches stephan working the room
all stephens friends
she turns to see what davids reaction to this is but he continues to watch stephan
and what kind of a friend are you
i call you last night and
i thought the silence was for the audience i didnt know youd really lost your voice
david suddenly takes her hand and pulls her round the corner
he turns to her his face alive with an energy that we havent seen before fear or excitement
why do you call me
you call me at night when youre drunk
why do you call me
what are you
do you want us to fuck around behind his back
like he fucks around behind yours
is that what you want
rachel stares at him upset and angry
i want a friend i dont want to be your friend
beat im leaving
i dont know why you bothered coming if your just going to
interrupting come with me
she realises he isnt talking about the party
whare are you going
it doesnt matter
away from israel away from this
i cant stand what it is doing to us
come with me
well go to spain
we can save ourselves
this is such a beautiful photograph rachel
you look like a pair of angels
a young israeli and his wife are admiring a photograph the wife has picked up from the table a portrait of rachel and sarah
mouth dry thank you
showing it to david isnt it lovely
david doesnt answer is still staring at rachel
the husband senses a scene takes the photograph
smoothly you know you have to excuse us to his wife
we must catch michael
his wife is confused
leading her away before he leaves you remember
rachel is staring at david shaking her head eyes glittering with tears
you cant do this to me now
we had our chance
we said we would live with it
this is me living with it
david takes her hands
im in love with you rachel
i want my life back so i can live it with you
come with me
you can start again
you dont have a child
you dont have anyone
i thought i did
beat why cant we be happy
after a beat quietly because we did a terrible thing
he nods finally and lets go of her hand
then he turns and walks away from her through the crowd to the door and is gone
she moves to follow him then stops
rachel turns and finds stephan standing against the wall waiting
they stare at each other
flat there you are
he leads her back towards the party
rachel sits still smoking though its dark outside now
there is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up to see journalists spilling out from the offices above coming down the stairs towards her
rachel eases a photocopied sheet from her bag and examines it
a photocopy of a journalists by line a long rather mournful face the name yuri titov
she checks the face slips the sheet back in the bag looks up studying the men descending towards her
moments later she has found him chatting to a colleague
he reaches the ground floor and walking past her goes to the bar for a coffee
rachel finds herself staring at him the man who could yuri seems to sense someone watching him and looks to where rachel was sitting
but theres no one there
the pretty receptionist stands chatting to her boyfriend a young journalist
he is holding her coat for
she starts to put it on and the boyfriend gives a brief bark and play bites at her neck
she laughs pushing him away
rachel hurries in
russian am i late
can i place an advertisement
gathering her things grivna for twenty words
grivna a word after that
rachel proffers an envelope
the girl takes it
rachel fishes in her bag and hands over a grivna note
this should cover it
the girl drops the envelope onto her desk and slips the money into a small desktop drawer unit as rachel leaves
rachel pauses outside the doors zipping her bag watching the receptionist tap a code into the alarm key pad before letting herself and the boyfriend out
she locks the door after them and the two walk past rachel who smiles a goodbye
she watches them go
the place is dark now eerily lit by the street lights outside
an elderly security guard trudges past whistling softly
were looking through the glass doors to the shadowy mezzanine level beyond
a dark figure stands silhouetted at the door
we hear the scrape of tools working on the lock
there is a click the doors open and rachel slips inside
the alarm begins to beep
rachel takes out a torch
a quick twist and the beam becomes ultraviolet
as rachel moves swiftly towards the alarm box the beam from the torch sweeps across the girls desk and we see rachels envelope glowing a deep purple
we may also notice that the desktop drawer unit where the girl placed the money is smudged with purple fingerprints
rachel opens the alarm box and shines her beam onto the keypad
we see four purple fingerprints one deeply pigmented the other three progressively less so
rachel takes a deep breath and punches the four marked keys in what she hopes is the correct order
the alarm falls silent
she moves quickly out of the lobby down the corridor
and into the main press room
using her torch on its regular setting rachel scours the desks for information
on one desk is a photograph of the journalist we just met yuri holding a large fish in triumph
rachel dives into the desks filing unit and begins to rifle through the files
presently she finds an old picture of vogel
he wears ss uniform the same shot we have seen before
behind it a stack of scribbled notes
she begins to scan them
the receptionist and her drunk boyfriend stand at the doors to the newspaper office trying to open them
it takes them a moment as unaware that it was unlocked the girl has accidentally locked it
her boyfriend tussles with her playfully keen for her to let him try instead but she swats him away turns the key again and finally theyre in
rachel unaware is still reading through the notes
she takes out paper and pen and copies down the information she needs
the receptionist stands by the alarm box drunk and confused as the boyfriend impatient and equally drunk comes up close behind her and reaches round to clumsily unbutton her coat
whispering thats weird
the coat undone the boyfriend reaches round and snakes his hands up inside her sweater
she ignores him
i set the alarm
the alarms not on
who gives a shit
he moves his hands from her breasts to grab her around the waist and pull her away from the alarm box
rachel is still at the desk reading
suddenly the main lights are switched on and the receptionist and the boyfriend stagger into sight
rachel stands frozen completely visible
the girl and boyfriend stand kissing too engrossed in each other to see the woman standing only ten feet from them
the receptionist pulls free laughing makes it back to the entrance and switches the lights off plunging the room into darkness
rachel moves behind a column
laughing softly the boyfriend leads the girl over to a desk
he opens a drawer searches through it triumphantly produces a petty cash tin
he starts to take some cash from the box
laughing you cant
ill put in an i o u
he scribbles on a piece of paper
andrei borrowed money to take katia to club oxygen
he drops the note in the tin
youre going to get fired
he kisses her
youre worth it
youre going to get me fired
kissing her im worth it
they kiss again slowly backing up against the desk rachel was searching
the two struggle with their clothes
rachel has no way of reaching the door
she closes her eyes as the young couple begin to have sex on the desk
then she opens her eyes and notices something
v close on her torch which is still on the desk
the boyfriend seems to be staring right at it
rachel watches holding her breath
as we realise he is staring straight through the torch lost in the moment
next moment the couple change positions and some books and the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor
the torch rolls across the carpet to the shadowy entrance of the cubicle
rachel stares at the torch wondering if she can reach it before they can see her
but at the moment the desktop tryst reaches its noisy conclusion
the boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat
the receptionist adjusts her dress
she notices the fallen items and begins to pick them up following the trail to the torch
rachel stands frozen as the receptionist stoops down directly in front of her and picks up the torch
the boyfriend notices
what are you doing
im tidying up
are you working
are you at work now
laughing no im not working
so leave them
she drops the objects and follows her boyfriend out
shaking rachel picks up her torch and replaces the items she is still holding from yuris file into the filing cabinet
from os we hear the beep beep beep of the alarm being reset
rachels heart sinks
os we hear office doors close and the key turning in the lock
rachels eyes alight on a motion sensor blinking in the corner of the room
and eventually no choice she runs for the door
the motion sensor lights up and the alarm strikes up loudly with a warning beep beep beep
frantic rachel dashes to the alarm box the insistent beep beep beep even louder here
rachel runs for the door yanks it open and bolts out
moments later the alarm clangs into action
rachel bursts out of a fire exit the siren blaring and disappears into the night
rachels car drives off down the road
rachel has pulled over and is on her cell phone to stephan
hes at the babenko hospital
stephan is alone working at his computer
he taps in the name searches clicks on the link to a map
its outside vinnycja
about a hundred and fifty miles south west of you
what name is he going under
rachel checks her notes
hes the right age
when is he supposed to interview him
theres silence from the other end
both know what this means
this will be over soon
and when it is
rachel hangs up
a car drives through the wintry landscape
a forest of fir trees pass as she drives
rachels mind is elsewhere
the car drifts to the wrong side then swerves as she corrects
what were you thinking at that moment
the night before davids suicide
rachel is being interviewed by a female faculty member
projected on a screen behind is an image of the young rachel stephan and david
the audience consists of mainly female students hands raised
did you think you were going to die
rachel seems to consider this carefully although we know by now that this is a question shes been asked thousands of times and has a carefully rehearsed answer to
ill tell you something
at that moment when i was on the floor i wasnt thinking about myself at all
i was thinking about my mother
and what she had suffered in europe
i think that was what gave me the strength to get up again
the audience listen moved
rachel looks out and then freezes older david sits near the back of the room
well im sure youll all join me in thanking ms singer
as the audience applaud enthusiastically rachel smiles trying to regain her composure but her eyes are drawn back to david standing in the shadows watching her intently
the place is empty now only david and rachel sitting in the seats
david looks like a man whos been up on speed for too long eyes strangely bright in his exhausted face
neither of them seems to be able to bridge the divide you look well
rachel ignores this
shes waiting for an explanation
does stephan know youre here
i expect so
beat i read about him
how is he
shrugs the same
resigned to life at a desk
he likes to play the tragic hero
she stops herself ashamed
very bad between us
we try to stay civil for sarah
have you met anyone else
rachel stares at him
how can he even ask this
thank you for asking
there was someone
but he left
and i never heard from him again
beat hard what are you doing here david
i wrote you letters
pity you didnt send any of them rachel
overlapping what is it
shes suddenly so angry she starts to gather her things to go
i wanted to see you
overlapping all that time
not a single word
i was ill for a while rachel
a beat i spent some time in
in a kind of hospital where
mexico what were you doing in mexico
whatever i could get
i travelled a lot
most of south america
i kept moving beat looking for him who
he doesnt answer and she looks up suddenly realising who he means
she feels a sudden instinctive rush of fear
beat what would you have done if you had found him
hes watching her intently i would have told the truth
i would have gone to the newspaper and said this is the surgeon of birkenau
i could have finally seen him face trial
rachel listens to this mesmerised
and what would have happened to us
wed be free
whatever happened to us it seemed to me wed be free
rachel stares at him without answering dont you agree
arent you tired of lying
isnt that what you would have done if youd found him
but it isnt just us
beat its sarah
something changes in davids face something fading away
he sits slowly back she hasnt done anything wrong
if the truth had come out she would be destroyed
no i wouldnt have told the truth
a long beat but you never found him she looks at him waiting for him to contradict this
no i never did
the lecturer appears at the doors to the auditorium
she stands up again the spell is broken
theres a car for me
putting on her coat did you hear about sarahs book
after a moment david nods
the launch is tomorrow
perhaps you could come
i dont know if stephan will be there or not but
suddenly if we could go back
if id waited for you
if youd come
would it have been different
we cant go back
well talk then
david gives a smile that might be an assent
or might not
rachel nods walks quickly out of the auditorium
david sits as the light banks above switch off one at a time watches the line of shadow moving towards him
a car roars past and is gone revealing rachel standing amongst the trees beside her car a cigarette forgotten in her hand absorbing what it was david was asking her
finally she drops the cigarette and climbs back into her car
driving lost in thought
she drives into some grounds
the babenko hospital a huge imposing building stands in wintry grounds
a long drive leads up to the car park and the entrance
rachel stares up at the building as she drives towards it
the large lobby area vast pillars
a few stairs lead up from this to a waiting area separated from the corridors beyond by bars and locked gates
rachel approaches a young male registrar at reception
russian good morning
im here to visit mr
the man squints at her checks his register an squints at her again
youre from the newspaper
because i have a mans name here
oh no no
im mr schevchuks niece
ive been before do you remember
a moments scrutiny then a shrug
well our visiting hours havent changed im afraid
eleven till one
he points to a plaque that reads visiting hours am am pm pm sarah glances at her watch
take a seat
he points to a waiting area
rachel walks up the few stairs past a large pillar and takes a seat trying to think of her next step
she glances to her left through the bars and sees an old woman in a patients gown staring blankly at her from the far end of the corridor
a doctor appears and leads the old woman away still staring
rachel looks away unnerved
someone has just walked in and is talking to the receptionist
rachels view is obscured by the pillar and she leans slightly to see who it is
v yuri stands showing his press card to the registrar
the registrar passes the press card back
schevchuk is in room
visiting time starts at eleven oclock
you can take a seat over there
yuri walks across the lobby towards where rachel is waiting but as he clears the pillar we see her seat is rachel waits for yuri to pass and then slips
back out of the lobby
rachel emerges panicking
time is almost up
what can she do
rachels car is speeding down a narrow road that runs behind the hospital
two stone arches frame the road where the building meets the hillside
v high fences the forbidding facade of the hospital rows of barred windows
rachel is scanning the building looking for some way in
suddenly we pass a central arched entrance
a man is opening large double metal doors for a laundry van to leave the hospital
it takes rachel a few moments to register it
then she the laundry van is driving through the doors
it stops engine idling and the driver begins to climb down to close the doors after him
before he clears the side of the truck rachel slips into the darkness
the driver oblivious reaches the doors and begins to swing them shut
rachel runs up the staircase from the service area of the hospital
long and bleak with rows of barred doors
rachel runs on
yuri is writing in a notebook
the clock says
rachel reaches a junction the vast white corridors stretching away from her in different directions like a nightmarish maze
she stares about her picks a corridor and begins to run again
rachel reaches a map on the wall and scans it frantically trying to locate the room she needs
she hurries on to an ancient looking elevator and gets in jabs at the fourth floor button
with a groan of its motor the elevator begins to rise
v tracking past rows of numbered doors
finally we reach it room
rachel stares at the door
rachel sits in a cubicle
she takes the black case from her handbag and opens it
inside is a pen
she lifts this and the false bottom of the case away to reveal a hypodermic needle and an ampule of a clear liquid
with trembling hands she begins to prepare the injection
she cant quite believe what she is about to do
rachel enters the room
the curtains are drawn and rachel hesitates for a moment her eyes adjusting to the gloom
a man sits in a chair angled towards the window his back to us
an iv drip hangs on a stand its tube running into a cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the chair
the only sound is the faint rasping breath of the man
rachel moves a little closer
on the bottom of the bed hangs a medical chart
the name reads ivan schevchuk
rachel moves closer carefully taking the hypodermic needle from her pocket
a nurse is unlocking the gate at the waiting area for yuri
he walks through them and over to the elevator
rachel stands by the iv drip and tube
she can inject directly into the tube and it will be over
she holds the tube rests the tip of the needle against it
she struggles with herself
just one tiny push
she cant do it
she stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the needle
beside her the steady breathing alters
the man stirs and a cadaverous face half turns towards us
rachel and schevchuk stare at each other
the face is ancient lined
but it isnt the face of vogel
weakly are you the journalist
beat do you know who i am
beat meaning it no
no i dont
my name is dieter vogel
i am the surgeon of birkenau
beat have you heard of me
ive heard of you
schevchuk looks at his withered hands
simply i have killed thousands
you can take my photograph
the last photograph of the surgeon of birkenau
he struggles to raise his arm in the nazi salute a pathetic sick man
rachel sits down at schevchuks desk feeling suddenly exhausted
yuri stands in the elevator waiting for the doors to close
hold the doors please
yuri holds the doors as the nurse approaches escorting an elderly woman with a walker the two moving at a snails pace
yuri watches amused
we close on rachel lost in thought
beside her schevchuk rambles on
it comes down to blood
we werent afraid of power
it was our destiny
the slave races had bred with apes
but we aryans are descendants of the theozoa who come from another planet
we were born to rule and to
he dissolves into a fit of weak coughing
rachel stares at a notepad and pen on the desk beside her
yuri walks towards schevchuks room
he pays no attention to rachel as he passes her sitting on a bench dialling her cell phone
she listens to the other end ring
stephan is talking to a couple of officials
his cell phone rings
beat it isnt him
stephan nods a fixed smile on his face covers the mouthpiece
gesturing to officials a family matter
would you give me a moment
the two officials leave the office closing the door behind them
stephan takes a a beat to calm his breathing
into phone youre sure
it isnt him
this is wonderful
and youre okay
youre alright yes
rachel stares at the wall
you were wrong
well thank god i was but
you were wrong about him
smiling and gesturing one minute to the two officials on the other side of the glass partition
he didnt kill himself because he was afraid the story would come out
this gets stephans attention
when he came to see me he was asking me for something
and i didnt give it
i wouldnt let him tell the truth and he was tired of living with the lie
he can sense something
truth is a luxury rachel
some people have to put other things first their country their people
struggling not to cry
sarahs so proud of you rachel
you have to think about her
crying i want her to be proud of me
stephan is desperate to talk her down from the ledge
soothing of course you do
i want to do something to make her proud of me
people have to know the truth stephan
david was right
listen to me
rachel listen to me
she hangs up
listening to the dial tone panic overwhelming him
theres a knock at the door and an assistant appears
stephan doesnt move
she sits for a moment then stands up
from the other end of the corridor as the small figure of rachel steps away from the bench
she straightens her scarf and wipes her eyes then begins to walk towards us
as she walks towards the end of the corridor
as she moves down another corridor
she reaches an opening on her left which reveals a staircase winding around a central lift shaft caged in frosted glass panels
she glances through it as she passes
and just for a second we see an elderly man walking down the stairs
rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers and she stops she walks back to the opening
the figure seems to have retraced their steps because they are now walking further up the staircase on the other side of the lift shaft a shadowy figure through the
frosted glass which quickly disappears from sight
rachel stares after him frozen
what did she just see
she begins to climb the stairs
rachel comes through double doors and finds herself in a long rec room patients and some staff grouped around the room
rachel begins to walk through the room elderly men all around her playing cards reading some sitting staring vacantly
she walks through them staring at faces
is he here
is he amongst this ordinary world
she feels her pace quicken as shes drawn on through the room
its as if shes back at that terrible night
vogels ahead of her somewhere escaping all over again
she flashes through double doors into a junction area a long empty corridor leading away from her on the right ahead another set of double doors
she bursts through these doors and finds herself in
a long white tiled corridor of a room
a row of windows down the right under which sit washbasins
theres a row of lockers and doors along the left
rachel walks on feeling increasingly as if shes in a dream
shes deep into the room before she realises its a dead end theres no exit ahead of her
a dull rasp why did you come
she turns and freezes
vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left
now hes between her and the doors on the far side of the room
why did you have to come
you didnt have to follow me
he begins to advance slowly towards her
was it schevchuk
did he talk
rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer
he reaches out a hand as if to reassure her a ghastly attempt at reasonableness
i can stop him
i wont tell him anymore
almost pleading nobody needs to know
as if the spell has broken rachel makes a sudden dart for the doors
but before she can pass him vogel has moved with surprising speed and almost before rachel has seen the scissors in his other hand he has stabbed them into her
she reels over against the opposite wall dislodging a glass shelf which shatters into a washbasin behind her
vogel goes after her pinning her against the basin one hand on her throat the other hand trying to stab her again
rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two struggle frantically
the scissors inch closer to her face to her eye
her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a piece of the broken glass shelf which she whips across vogels face
he gives a horrible shriek and lets her go clutching at his cheek
rachel collapses gasping to the floor
moaning vogel stumbles to a basin blood dripping down onto the white porcelain from his slashed face
he suddenly notices rachel has made it to her knees and is trying to crawl towards the door he walks after her pulls back her head gets ready to stab
the scissors into her throat
you jews never knew how to kill
only how to die
then he gives a gasp of pain eyes closed his whole body doubling with the pain hands weakly scrabbling at the piece of glass rachel has stabbed into his thigh
he falls almost on top of rachel and she finds herself pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits in agony
his hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors
rachel grapples with him almost embracing him apparently trying to prevent him for reaching it
his searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open in triumph staring straight into rachels
he raises the scissors above his head
then he stabs rachel in the stomach
rachel jack knifes as if shes been punched
both lie still
the only sound is vogels rasping breathing
slowly vogel gathers himself drops the scissors gets onto his knees the victor
he climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door
as he walks down the corridor breathing hard trying to make it back to his room back to safety
suddenly he staggers against the wall
somethings wrong something in his back
he twists around trying to locate the source of the strange sensation
and there it is the hypodermic needle rachel has stuck between his shoulders
he touches it with his fingertips eyes wide with horror feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood
he twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs are already giving way and he collapses to the floor
moments later hes dead
rachel manages to turn over starts to drag herself up
as the music continues we see yuri putting his coat on
hes evidently finished his fruitless interview with schevchuk who is sitting slumped by the window
yuri turns about to leave when he suddenly notices a note upon the desk addressed to him
surprised he picks up the note and begins to read it
we see the first line my name is rachel singer
the road at the back of the hospital
the music continues as we track with rachel staring steadily ahead walking slowly down the long road her coat pulled around her
in the distance framed between the arches her abandoned car
blood begins to spot the ground behind her
we are in darkness
then a door opens ahead of us and slides to one side revealing an oval of brilliant white light
slowly we track forward towards the harsh light
walking on towards her car
were at the top of an airplane stairway which leads down to the runway below and two lines of waiting dignitaries applauding
walking on a small lone figure against the white of the snow
the three young people begin their descent down the stairs towards the welcome party
tiny framed within the two arches
still moving towards the car
we close on young rachel as she blinks against the harsh sunlight takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on
then she steps forward to accept her reward
