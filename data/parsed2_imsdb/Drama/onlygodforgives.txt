written by nicolas winding refn second draft script with the support of the media programme of the european union the sound of muay thai boxing
the art of eight limbs
thrust and move
feet shuffling across the ring
close on a pair of hands from various angles
the sounds of the fighting grow louder
punches kicks elbows
the hands tense into fists
theyre strong hands
zoom out to reveal julian mid thirties staring at his hands
even though hes kept in shape he hasnt fought for a long time
the sound of the boxing match gets louder still as julian continues staring at his hands its almost as if hes meditating
suddenly he breaths in
behind him sits a young kid dressed in thai boxing clothes this is liang barely sixteen
he looks nervous occasionally glancing at julians reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall
julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist
the sounds of the boxing match reach fever pitch as we track with julian and liang making their way towards the ring
two young thai boxers beat the crap out of each other
the crowd is wild with excitement people placing bets on which way the fight will turn
one of the thai boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands
the ring is cleared and liang jumps in as julian pushes his way though the crowd nodding at people as he passes
they know him here
again bets are placed
pick out a face in the crowd
julians older brother late thirties
julian sits down next to billy whos delighted to see him throwing his arm around him pulling him in close
i love violence
billy offers julian a hit from his bottle of mehkong whiskey
hes more interested in the fight
back to the ring where the fight has just started
liang is immediately on the ropes
julian watches concerned
billy takes a phone call but he cant hear
he nods to julian and takes it outside
back to the fight where liang pulls an amazing move
turns the tables
takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs swings and backfists
as julian applauds liangs success billy slinks off out of the auditorium
liang wins the fight with a knock out
the crowd go wild with adulation
julian watches transfixed
liang is lit up by a beatific white light
as he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring the crowd start to gather round him
julian continues to stare at whats taking place before him
which is almost like a religious ceremony
the audience bow down before liang as he stares out into the light
a look of calm washing over his face
a sense of stillness and peace
enlightenment through victory and violence
billy stalks the streets of the city of vice
a man on a mission
liang is sitting on a bench his constantly smiling mother beside him as julian peels off fifty bhat notes
we get the sense that julians proud of him that liang is something of a protege of his and that liang is incredibly pleased to have gained his approval
two fifty three hundred
liang takes the money
julian pulls off two more notes
you did well out there
youve got something liang
dont spend it all in once place
billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door
after a moment the door opens
the doorman recognises him and lets him enter
we track with billy as he makes his way through the small subterranean nightclub
a thai man known as the lizard sits by a table with a few locals gambling
he spots billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to gamble
billy moves across to a small private corner
where he meets various men and women all smoking methamphetamine
billy joins in but an argument quickly starts up between him and another thai man
the musics too loud to hear what theyre arguing about but it suddenly gets out of control
billy starts viciously hitting the thai man and quickly the room explodes in a frenzy of violence
a fan does what it can to cool julian down as he counts out money at his desk
sitting opposite him feet on the table is gordon julians lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend hes got
julians phone rings
he interrupts his counting
picks up and listens
hold on hold on
what did he say
beat as julian listens
he glances over at gordon who looks up concerned
no tell him to stay there
tell them both to stay there
im coming over
the lizard sits outside the nightclub somehow managing to smoke a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from his nose with a handkerchief
julian and gordon arrive
he still in there
julian glances at gordon
you told him i was coming
julian stares at him
well maybe you didnt try hard enough
the lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose
shows the bloodstain to julian
when was the last time you slept
the lizard smiles but stares at julian with hatred in his eyes
just cause i aint slept for three days dont mean i dont know right from wrong
and your brother has become a real problem
again julian stares at him clenching his fist
the lizard notices this but gazes up into julians face blankly
youre not going to cause another ruckus in my club now are you
a long pause as julian considers it
good cause billy ripped me off and then he broke my face
julian turns to gordon
like i always said
one day hes going to meet the devil
you know where he is now
the lizard stares at julian
bangkok has millions of people my friend
you and your brother youre lost to my world
the lizard gets up puts out his cigarette and looks at julian
so what you going to do
you wanna come in
very good amphetamine in here
julian looks over to gordon
sees hes keen
im gonna look around
see if i can find him
he turns back to the lizard
which wayd he go
the lizard nods his head towards the busy street
julian turns and heads off
gordon steps up to the entrance to the club
the lizard sticks out an arm blocking his way
his brother didnt pay
thats his problem
now its your problem
im with you mate
billys fucked you dont pay his debt you dont enter
gordon thinks for beat
takes out his money
and the lizard smiles for the first time
julian is talking to ma long fifties the mother figure to a group of girls who stand in the background
you seen billy
not this evening
a particularly pretty prostitute catches juilans eye
he stares at her stone faced
well if he comes in tell him im looking for him yeah
hes not coming in
i tell him to stay away
he hurt one of my girls julian
pulls out his wad of notes again
hands a few to ma long
if you see him tell him im looking for him
ma long nods as she takes the money
julian is about to leave
he looks at the pretty prostitute again
stares at her for a moment
then walks out
billys so wasted hes bumping into people
he starts window shopping the various brothels that line the street groups of girls smiling at him
anything for a price
pick out one particularly young looking girl
she makes eye contact with billy
pulls out a roll of notes
julian out in the middle of the road
girls on the pavement girls in the windows
a steady line of punters cruising past
he stands alone
an island in a sea of neon
it feels ominous
like something really bads about to happen
close on chang mid forties a man who looks like hes carved out of stone
the neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly unending flow as hes driven towards his destination
police cars are parked up outside
chang gets out of his taxi
pays the driver
makes his way inside
chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a group of policemen are gathered
their circle opens up as chang approaches and they bow as he joins them like hes a god
one of the group kim han ho gestures towards the door of room where two cops stand guard
chang gives a nod and the door is opened
chang stands silhouetted in the doorway
stepping into the room he moves into the light in close up
his face is a mask
the bed is drenched in blood
the fifteen year old prostitute lies naked on her back
shes dead her body having been savagely beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong
billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants his eyes glazed staring at mtv a bottle of mehkong whiskey in his hand a crack pipe on the floor
chang stares at him giving nothing away
the hotel owner serves tea to chang who sits in silence with lieutenant kim
the door is open and we can see into room across the corridor where billy is still sat staring at the television
a young cop daeng who has been watching chang summons up courage to whisper to his superior officer phaiban
who is that guy
phaiban says nothing
is he a cop
before daeng can ask another questions two more cops lead an older thai man choi yan lee s overweight dragged straight from his bed down the corridor towards the crime
as choi yan lee is delivered to the doorway chang gets up and goes over to him
a moment of uncertainty in choi yan lees face
he doesnt know why hes been brought here
he looks for some comfort from chang
chang gives him nothing
chang leads choi yan lee to the doorway
slowly choi yan lee realises what hes looking at
every fathers worst nightmare
is this your daughter
how could you
but choi yan lee just stares at his daughter
how could you let this happen
i didnt do anything
well nows your chance
a long moment between them as choi yan lee fails to understand what chang is suggesting
chang stands back
do what thou will
choi yan lee nods
chang leaves the room closing the door behind him
chang sits drinking tea in silence with lieutenant kim
the guards in the corridor stare at the closed door of room from where we hear the cries of billy being beaten to death
angle on daeng whos starting to look scared
phaiban puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder
as the beating reaches its climax with choi yan lee screaming out thai obscenities we hear the sickening sound of billys neck snapping
and then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down on his body
chang opens the door and looks through
choi yan lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood
in his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair
billy lies dead his head completely smashed in
a police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town
the bloodied choi yan lee sits in the back chang on one side kim on the other
as the police car turns onto a more major road choi yan lee starts to get nervous
you missed my turning
i live that way
chang says nothing
phaiban is driving daeng in the passenger seat
daeng looks back at them through the rearview mirror
well get you there
the police car heads over the mega bridge and continues its way out of town
the bright white headlights of the stationary police car blind choi yan lee whos caught in their glare rigid with fear
im so sorry
please dont hurt me
im so sorry
what are you sorry for
you were there
he killed my daughter
i thought you were letting me
answer the question
what are you sorry for
choi yan lee is wrongfooted
i killed the westerner
and why did you do that
he killed my daughter
and why did he do that
choi yan lee cant answer
how old was she
you knew what she was doing and you did nothing
how else can we make money
what else could i do
daeng watches as kim opens the boot and pulls something out
he walks towards chang and hands it to him
daeng sees that its an axe
what did you expect me to do
you have to have pity on me
my daughters just been murdered
this isnt about her
this is about your other three daughters and making sure you dont forget them
chang nods to kim and phaiban who grab hold of choi yan lee
kim slips a plastic strap around choi yan lees arm using it as a tourniquet
they wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out
i wont forget
chang approaches with the axe
he stops for a moment
looks down at him
ill be a better man
chang slams down the axe severing choi yan lees arm at the elbow
choi yan lee screams in agony
the anonymity of a hotel room
julian opens the curtains and we see the sky line of bangkok he looks out
he lies back on the bed surfing through two hundred tv channels
settles on a boxing match
starts drifting off
as he drifts we hear the sound of singing
a karaoke rendition of i hung my head by johnny cash
i set off running to wake from the dream my brothers rifle went into the sheen i kept on running into the south lands thats where they found me my
head in my hands reveal that the voice is that of chang and hes not half bad either deeper than youd have though and with it comes a stage presence a sort of john wayne swagger
the sheriff he asked me why i had run and then it came to me just what i had done and all for no reason just one piece of lead
i hung my head i hung my head
the policemen still dressed in their uniforms watch in respectful silence
daeng sits with them
he too watches in awe
chang travels home across the city
chang opens the door as quietly as he can
he slips off his shoes and walks gingerly into the apartment
on the kitchen table chang sees a picture
a badly drawn house with a man a woman and a child
across the bottom love you chang stares at it and smiles picks it up and pins it to the fridge with a magnet
chang and kanita his eight year old daughter are playing with her dolls who have captured a soft toy
so now that theyve caught him
what are they going to do
kanita thinks for a moment
put him in jail
they havent got a jail big enough
look at the size of him
again kanita thinks
keep him as a pet
but he blew down all their houses
would you want to keep a pet that could do that
kanita shakes her head
what if they just let him go
how could they be sure he wouldnt do it again
they could ask him
chang picks up the soft toy
peels off a sticker from a sheet and places it between its eyes
satisfied with his work he puts the soft toy back in the middle of the game
and so the king and the fairies that lived in the village said to the creature this is your mark which will stay with you forever
if you ever try and blow down our village again it will heat up until it boils your brains for it has magical properties
go in peace
kanita nods happy with the judgement
she picks the soft toy up and walks it away from the village of the dolls
chang walks into his bedroom where his wife nadee is just waking up
he kisses her good morning
as he starts to undress she starts to get dressed
they share a smile about this
finally chang lies down on the bed and closes his eyes
nadee kisses him good night
nadee starts making breakfast as kanita watches cartoons
as chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light of the day but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside as it goes about
its frenetic everyday business
the camera moves through the apartment briefly settling on the sleeping chang then roaming through the various rooms picking out different objects
we see that chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters photographs and other bits of movie memorabilia
amongst the many family photos we also pick out several pictures of chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like a very successful career as
a thai boxer
at the end of the tour were back with chang
we zoom in to a tight close shot
we see a hotel room door and hear a knock julian enters frame and opens to reveal
two thai girls one being mai standing in the hallway
julian lets them enter
mai embraces julian kissing him on the mouth as julian closes the door
they turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress
she smiles compliantly eager to please
julian turns back to mai and kisses her again
as the kiss becomes more passionate the other girl joins them and the three of them begin to have sex
chang is sitting eating alone at the dinning table watching an old western on tv
chang walks down the streets towards a school
standing at the gate kanita is waiting for him
he hugs her and they hold hands as they continue down the crowded street
chang waits patiently at the counter as kanita sorts through various dolls trying to choose which one to buy
chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where pedestrians stream past
suddenly chang has a strange vision all the women disappear
in the street there are only men
we cut to a close up of chang and then back to his vision again now all the men have gone and he can see only women
back to the close up of chang who continues staring out of the where everything is back to normal
men and women walking up and down the sidewalk
the remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along with the trappings of a heavy session empty bottles of alcohol drug paraphernalia etc
julian lies sleeping entwined in the limbs of the girl
there is a knock on the door
julian and the girl ignore it
a pause and then julians mobile phone starts ringing
he doesnt answer
the knocking starts up again this time louder
finally julians not here mate
beat then we hear a voice from behind the door
still they ignore him
either too wasted or too tired to do anything else
i need to talk with you
finally julian answers with zero energy
what is it
its about billy
i cant deal with my brother right now
julian opens his eyes confused still out of his head on drugs
finally julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door
gordon stands in the hallway behind him two thai men from julians crew
they found his body in a hotel room
julian doesnt know what to say
neither does gordon
look get dressed and ill see you downstairs
julian nods and closes the door
he stands still glances out the window seeing the sun setting and the night coming in
he glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed
he goes into the bathroom where mai is dressed and putting on make up
julian looks at her
someone killed billy
the camera zooms in on mai
a mortuary attendant pulls a sheet back to reveal billy
his body completely mutilated
julian stares at his brothers corpse intensely not betraying any emotion
he turns to gordon whos standing behind him
what do we do
julian glances back at the body
julian stares up at the night sky his mobile phone gripped tightly in his hand
he puts the phone down
he looks out across the city again then back to the phone
its like hes scared
he picks it up quickly and dials
a moment as it rings then its answered
the camera tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging to an elegant woman in her fifties who looks like shes in her forties and could actually
pass for late thirties
she strides towards reception a porter struggling to keep up with her
this is jenna hopkins
head of a notorious london crime family
mother of both julian and billy
newly appointed lady macbeth of bangkok
she hands her passport over to the concierge
id like to check in now please
the concierge checks the computer
im afraid the room wont be ready until four oclock
jenna just stares at him
its policy id like to speak to your manager
yes of course
the concierge retreats
jenna lights a cigarette
good afternoon madam what seems to be the problem
listen to me
ive just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and i havent slept for thirty hours and he says i cant go to my
the manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her force
im sorry madam
it simply isnt possible
jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes
peels off a couple of hundred dollar bills
fuck off you cunt just hand me the fucking key
she lays the money on the desk
the manager looks around
well i might be able to arrange something
the manager turns to the concierge
dont leave the money there
some cuntll nick it
put it in your pocket
the manager hesitates
put it in your pocket
theres really no need put it in your fucking pocket
the manager takes the money
places the key on the desk
the lift doors open and jenna walks out the porter struggling to keep up with her as she swishes down the corridor
the struggling porter opens the door and lets jenna in
she walks into the suite and gives it the once over
the porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her clothes desperate to try and get out in one piece
as soon as hes finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room
jenna points to the duty free bag then starts running a bath beginning to undress
i need a drink
the porter is stunned
well dont just stand there
the porter fumbles taking the gin out of the duty free bag spilling the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail
jenna returns in a dressing gown takes the drink off him and takes a huge slug
the porter is terrified stunned
rooted to the spot
jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window
just as the porter thinks its safe to try edging out of the room again she starts talking to him
i loved him so much you know
the porter doesnt know what the fuck shes talking about
everyone loves their children dont they
well not everyone but
she looks over at him
the porter smiles at her
do you want to see a picture
the porter nods uncertain
jenna gets up goes over to her purse
opens it up
a picture of billy
she hands it to the porter who takes it and just looks at it not knowing what to do
jenna starts to cry
for a long time
i have to return to my station
jenna snaps out of it in an instant
what yeah thanks
she pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse
she hands the money to the porter who leaves as quickly as he dares
we hear dave berry singing mama
the elevator doors open
julian steps out into the empty hallway
everything is normal
but everything is also not normal
the camera tracks from behind as julian walks looking at the doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one he knocks but there is no answer
realizing the door isnt locked he pushes it open and steps in
the room is exactly the same as the one jennas staying in
however instead of her julian sees a man sitting on the bed his back to him
his features are obscured
julian slowly begins to walk towards him but before he can reach out the figure turns to face him
but there is blood smeared all over his face
julian stares at him in horror
slowly he looks down at his hands only to discover that theyre dripping in blood
we zoom in on his hands
julian wakes from his nightmare covered in sweat
he is alone
he sits up
looks at his hands still very shaken by his nightmare
we hear the traffic of bangkok
julian gets up and walks to the table
light up and begins to smoke morphine
he walks to the window and looks out over bangkok
his phone rings julian answers
where are you
im in bangkok
julian looks at his watch
i thought you didnt get in til midnight
i needed to be by myself
so what dyou want to do
julian turns his back to the window
jenna looks immaculate
she stubs out her cigarette when she spots julian making his way towards her
she gets up and they embrace
she holds on to him
a little too long
finally she pulls away
she looks at him for a long time
could it be have been one of the gangs
take your pick
billy wasnt popular
what do you mean
you know billy
he was eccentric
jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and julian even smiles
both sit in silence for a moment
but youre going to find out who did it right
ill make sure it gets done
no it needs to be you that does it
we need to show them
do you understand what im saying
yeah okay ill do it
hold on julian as we bring up the sound of johnny cashs ring of fire
love is a burning thing and it makes a firey ring bound by wild desire i fell into a ring of fire chang is singing again
i fell into a burning ring of fire i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of
fire and the cops are all there daeng included watching him
changs singing continues as we see an assortment of tough looking thai men listening to gordon mute
i fell into a burning ring of fire i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of
fire gordon explains the situation what information theyre after how much theyll get paid for good leads
all the while julian watches from the background
a montage of julians crew spreading out shaking down their various contacts doormen pimps dirty cops stall holders barmen
the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet i fell for you like a child oh but the fire went wild
one of the crew the rat faced charlie ling starts talking to the hotel owner who was there the night of the murder
a couple of hundred bhat notes and he starts talking
chang reaches the climax of the song
i fell into a burning ring of fire i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of
fire the cops watch with total devotion
a tuck tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by one of choi yan lees three daughters
in the back sits choi yan lee his stump of an arm in a sling a daughter either side of him
his arms only just been bandaged up and hes clearly still in a lot of pain his face going into spasm with every bump in the road
julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink
behind him gordon his phone glued to his face
on the other side of the road is choi yan lees kiosk big enough to double as his home currently manned by his long suffering wife kim yan lee
she serves a chilled coconut to a man
as he turns round we reveal
hes a particularly murderous looking member of julians crew ko sam
we pick out charlie ling a little further down the road whos looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some street kids selling
theyre all counting down the minutes
biding their time
waiting for choi yan lee to turn up
finally the sound of the tuck tuck approaching
ko sam drinks his coconut down in one slurping as he hits the bottom
letting the empty shell fall to the floor
charlie ling stands up
feels the gun under his jacket
the tuck tuck pulls up and choi yan lees daughters help him into the kiosk that doubles as their home
julian and his men close in
as choi yan lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss of him the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly slammed they all turn round in panic
but before they can do anything about it the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk followed by ko sam charlie ling gordon and julian
choi yan lee snivels in the corner waving his bandaged arm in the air
you cant kill me
im a cripple
who are you
what do you think youre doing
get out or well call the police
ko sam shakes his head at her
not a good idea
julian turns to charlie ling
ask him if hes choi yan lee
at the mention of his name the colour drains from choi yan lees face
his eyes lock with julians
is your name choi yan lee
choi yan lee nods his head
ask him why he killed my brother
you killed his brother
big mistake fat man
whyd you do it
choi yan lee knows hes been caught
he murdered my daughter
he says he killed his daughter
julian considers him for a moment
slowly he pulls out a gun
aims it at choi yan lees face
please dont kill me
ill give you anything
anything you want
ive paid for what i did
look at me
in his desperation choi yan lee suddenly lurches forward brandishing his wounded arm at julian
he pulls the bandages off exposing the bloody stump
ive paid for what i did
dont you see
julian turns to charlie ling
whats he saying
he says hes paid for what hes done
that hes been punished already
choi yan lee nods his head enthusiastically
he told me to do it
then he took my hand
again he thrusts his stump at julian who glances at him
who did that to him
choi yan lee looks at the various faces that surround him then stares directly at julian
the angel of vengeance
charlie ling looks at him surprised
yet theres a sense that deep down he knows what hes talking about
its a lie he doesnt exist
im telling the truth
it was the angel of vengeance
whats he saying
its a story old women tell their grand children
the angel of vengeance is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living
restore karma to the world
but julian listens with great interest
how does he do that
leads people to their destiny
thats the myth anyway
ko sam smiles
finally ask him who cut his hand off
charlie lings reluctant to question him further
who turned you into a cripple and no bullshit this time
choi yan lee continues babbling hysterically
im telling you the truth
the angel of vengeance is real
he made me do it
youve got to believe me
ive already been judged
he says it was the angel of vengeance
choi yan lee starts to giggle uncontrollably
the angel of vengeance
you dont find the angel of vengeance
he finds you
whats he saying
pull yourself together fat man
if you dont talk sense ill cut off your cock and shove it down your throat
im telling you the truth
hell find you
choi yan lee retreats to the corner of the room
what did he say
charlie ling considers choi yan lee
realizes hes not going to get a better answer out of him
he said you dont find the angel of vengeance
he finds you
julian considers this for a long time
he realises hes not pointing his gun anymore
puts it away
are we going to kill him or what
the room suddenly feels stuffy
the atmosphere oppressive
julians got to get out
what are you doing
but julians already stumbling out of the kiosk
were not going to do anything
just leave him
leave them all
julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air
disoriented he careers into a stall selling various religious artefacts sending candles incense and statues of buddha flying
he falls to the ground
when he gets to his feet everything around him seems intense and incredibly vibrant
the dogs fighting on the street the buddha that lies in pieces on the ground the children that stand watching him his crew as they come out of the kiosk
hiding their guns
julian takes a long moment to get his bearings
finally he stands up but as he does he feels different
as if the axis of his world has shifted
the camera tracks from the side as we see jenna walk through the boxing gym
all around her people are fighting and sparring
she spots julian and gordon through the large windows of the office
they see her and stand up
we linger outside in the training area as jenna goes through the boxers train in the background
jenna julian and gordon sit in silence
finally did you kill him
a shared look between gordon and julian
its a little bit more complicated than that mum
he killed my son
whats so fucking complicated about that
mum calm down
dont tell me to calm down
i want him dead
julian does not know how to explain the situation
jenna stares at him
we dont forgive
only god does
i know you always say that but this is different
julian doesnt know how to answer
jenna watches him carefully
maybe billy had it coming
what are you talking about
because of what he did
jenna thinks it over for a moment
i dont care
just dont some thai cunt murdered your brother and were not going to let him get away with it
what if it was the angel of vengeance
jenna stares at her son like hes finally lost the plot
the angel of fucking what
it or he restores karma and order in the world
who said anything about restoring things
he loves all humans
i dont know what kind of spiritual journey youre on but you will kill im not im just
julian cant get the words out
he gets up
ive got to go
and julian leaves letting the door to the office stay open
we pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly zoom in on jenna
she turns to gordon
its alright yeah
well what with billy not being around its tricky to be honest
what dyou mean
well were supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week
but billys not here is he
jenna clocks it
whats gotten into him
is he high or something
i dont know
earlier today we had the guy
the guy that killed billy
had a gun against his face
but then nothing
julian let him go
now theres all this stuff about angels
i dont know what the fucks wrong with him

gordon smiles at her uncertainly
i know how to do what needs to be done
she stares at him long enough to make him uncomfortable
so tell me
what did he mean when he said it was complicated
theres this other guy
might have been involved
so we kill them both
we dont know who the other guy is yet
well how about we start with the guy we do know
a girl sings another womans man by dolly parton
julians sitting alone at a table nursing a drink
mai enters looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her in the hotel
she sits next to julian and gives him a kiss on the cheek
sorry im late
he drinks his drink
mai looks around the bar
its half empty some girls and men spread out
the waitress comes over and mai orders a drink
they sit in silence listening to the song
see anyone you want us to take home tonight
julian glances round but shakes his head
looks at mai
whats with you

i want you to meet my mum
a pause mai slightly taken about

dyou want me to
mai studies him
why dyou want me to meet her

julian stares at her for a long time
cant quite say it out loud but the answers yes
choi yan lee oversees his daughters serving hot food to customers
focus on liang the young kick boxer watching him from across the street
liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light of the street lamps
he heads over to the shack
liang asks choi yan lee a question
choi yan lee leans over to hear him better
liang grabs hold of his hair and pulls him over the counter slitting his throat with the knife
choi yan lees wife and daughters look on as blood floods from his neck over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground below
life slips away from choi yan lee in a matter of seconds
liang holds onto him until hes dead and then lets go of his head and runs off into the night
gordon is waiting on a street corner smoking cigarettes
liang comes up to him breathless
gordon pulls out several hundred dollars
never come back you understand me
liang takes the money
a proper pay out
youre a fighter kid
no doubt about it
good luck with that
julians talking to liangs mother and sister who are sitting in front of him both upset
gordon hovers in the background
when did you last see him
he went out
did he have any enemies
someone called him
someone called his mobile
she doesnt know
they spoke in english
liangs mother pulls out a mobile phone
passes it to julian
this his phone
liangs sister nods
julian scrolls through the numbers
all have thai names against them except one
julian considers the number then redials
then the sound of a phone ringing in the same room
gordon looks round
realises hes busted
takes his phone out
julian stares at him
before he gets a chance to say anything there is a knock on the door
what is it
theres some cops here to see you
what do they want
probably just money
you want me to find out how much
julian thinks it over
no ill talk to them
julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him
he walks over strangely on edge
as he gets closer he sees chang standing on the other side of the room by the boxing ring his back to him watching the sparring fighters
julian stares at him
turns back to the cops
good morning officers
how can i help you
slowly chang turns to face him
julian stares at him as if hes in a trance
were investigating the murder of choi yan lee
turns to kim and shrugs
never heard of him
his arm was cut off
julian manages to cover his reaction
i run a boxing club
not much call for one armed men
mexican stand off
whats this got to do with me
he was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother
then i guess you boys have got a lot of work to do so have i so if youll excuse me
thats why were here mr hopkins
if you could just answer our questions
what do you want to know
julian looks over to chang who continues staring at the boxers
the way the ring is lit hes almost silhouetted
where were you last night
with my mum
some of the boxers come over to chang
they know him
with the effect of the lighting it seems to julian like theyre bowing down before a god
you want to speak to her
that wont be necessary at the moment
am i suspect
chang turns round to face julian
his presence is magnetic
julian stares back at him realizing that this must be the angel of vengeance
chang walks over to them
studies julian for a long moment and then turns to kim
this is not the man
and as soon as hes said it he turns on his heel and leaves
the cops back off and away
zoom in on julian
deflated and strangely disappointed
he turns to gordon whos standing behind him
i want you to find out who that guy is
the sound of nadee singing lonely coming down by dolly parton
chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife sing on stage
julian enters sees chang but can only see the back of his face
he walks over to the bar orders a drink
julian starts to watch nadee
when he turns back to the bar he sees chang reflected in the optics somehow standing right next to him staring at him
julian turns to face him
why are you here
the one who killed my brother
chang says nothing for a long time
i love all living things
i restore karma
is that why you came
i came here to kill you
whats stopping you
i dont know
would you like me to tell you
you want the angel of vengeance
cause all my life
i dont know
yes you do
my mother wants me to kill you
chang stares back at him
and what do you want
i love violence
you want to fight me
three cops sit eating noodles
what about his brain
its a risk
one hit in the wrong place and hell be straight back in hospital
and maybe he wont be so lucky as last time
then whys he going to fight the westerner
the question hangs in the air
its what theyre all wondering
he used to be a great boxer
he has to do it
since he came out of the coma thats what hes done
whatevers been asked of him hes done it
he cant help it
its all a mystery
a mutual pause
and if he loses
he cant lose
hes the angel of vengeance
nadee is standing behind chang
theyre playing a game in which they speak in english
she points out the window
she points at the table
do you like the table
i like the table
nadee detects the change in him
what is it
chang takes her in his arms
he starts kissing her neck
i need to speak to you in thai
what is it
i love you
she stares at him for a long moment
its odd for him to have confessed his feelings in such a way
not bad just odd
and then she starts to kiss him back
julian is anxiously waiting outside
he looks up as mai comes out of her appartment in a red dress
julians face drops
what is it
you cant wear that
very particular about colours
she hates red
come on well get you something else
mai stares at him reluctant to give in
this is insane
look im telling you
its easier this way
mai gives in
takes his hand
chang picks out a dress for mai
she takes it finding it hard to believe that hes making her do this
three people sit around a table awkwardly
julian jenna and mai dressed very conservatively all eating soup
a long silence
may isnt it
its mai mum
how long have you two known each other then
mais about to answer but juilan gets there first
a year and a half isnt it
beat as mai quickly counts in her head
that sounds about right
well its always a rare treat to meet one of julians lady friends
so where did you two meet
i saw her walking down the street
jenna raises an eyebrow
and i thought this is the most beautiful girl ive ever seen so i just walked up to her and started talking
i hear that happens a lot in this part of the world
tell me whats your line of work mai
i work in the service industry
i bet you do
but tell me mai before you started serving my son how many cocks were you serving
was it over a thousand
mai stares at jenna in disbelief
i know girls like you
just because you might be pulling the wool over my sons eyes dont think its going to work with me
mum stop it for fucks sake
im sorry julian but i wont stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isnt so diseased that
she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth
leave her alone mum
youve got her wrong
shes a good girl
what do you know about whats good
julian says nothing
hes good to me
well thats nice isnt it im really happy for you mum
the cops came by my club today
she stares at him
theyre investigating a murder
the guy that killed billy turned up dead this morning
jenna looks bored
lights a cigarette
oh really shame that still live by the sword die by the sword
i know it was you mum
i did what had to be done
he was there
he was with them
the angel of vengeance
dyou kill him
cause he as good as killed billy
what i want to know is what are you going to do about it
im not going to kill him
yes you are
youre going to do it for me and youre going to do it for your brother
this isnt about billy
this is about me
all my life ive been running
thats right you cunt cause you always run away whenever theres a problem
just like youre running away from killing this fucking angel of whatever his name is chang chang
mai stands up
i should be going now
sit down you cunt
mum dont talk to her like that
mai sits down
so what am i left with
julian stares at her
jenna calms down
she looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar
we zoom in on the mirror their faces refracted by the glass
we stick together
but billy was family too
billy was a fuck up
he deserved everything he got
you know it and i know it
im not listening to this
i dont ever want to hear you mention his name again
do you hear me
yeah we were brothers but we were never close
and he was only in bangkok cause you couldnt control him
so you sent him to me so you sent him to me and what could i do
you could have protected him
i did what i could
and thats more than you ever did
i wouldve done anything for him
okay he wasnt born with as many advantages as you were
he struggled with things
but i always stood by him
and what did that get him
ill tell you what a one way ticket to this fucking place just like me
dont you dare blame me for what happened back then
im only here cause of you
if you didnt exist i wouldnt be here
i couldve been someone mum
i was on my way
jenna stares at him this is a conversation she does not like having
you wouldve been a great fighter
you couldve gone pro
dont you think i know that
and look at me now
im a front for a drugs smuggling
he turns to mai
the whole things a front
every day i see kids coming in with great potential
and every day i see kilos of heroin going out
and its all because of you ma
you and the money and the drugs
jenna silently seethes waiting for julian to shut the fuck up
he quietens down
at least youre not behind bars and thats more important to me
julian turns to her he has been waiting all his life to say this
thats right mum
thats whats more important to you
but what about me
sometimes i think you only got me out of there so the cops couldnt trace it back to you
jenna stares at him
her face a mask
thats right mum
think about it
with me gone you were safe
and it turned out to be good for business as well
all very convenient
silence between them
jenna lights another cigarette her hands now shaking
is that what happened with billy
did billy become a problem like i did
wouldnt surprise me he was a big fucking problem when he was here
still at least you didnt have him killed
jenna slaps him hard on the face
looks up at her
im not going to kill him for you mum
doesnt matter what you say
and do you want to know why
cause im going to fight him
in the ring
me versus him
well that seems sensible
and what do you hope thats going to achieve
i dont expect you to understand
cause you dont understand anything that isnt about you
and when you lose whats going to happen then
i dont know
but maybe this time ill win
like you say only god forgives
maybe this time hell forgive me
jenna turns to mai
do you understand what hes talking about
cause i havent got a fucking a clue
you never did mum
julians touched a nerve
i hope you find what youre looking for
cause if you dont its going to find you and im not always going to be there to look after you
jenna composes herself
a different person
nice to meet you mai
hope to see you again soon
jenna shakes her hand
mais too shocked to resist
and then as if nothing had happened jenna leaves
julian covers his face with his napkin
are you alright
but he doesnt want anyone to see
ill be fine
in a minute
julian wipes his face clean
pulls himself together
sorry about that
jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception a look of steely determination in her eyes
the concierge and the manager see jenna coming towards them and brace themselves
however to their relief she diverts to the palm court area where gordon is waiting for her
just catching up you know
jenna sits down
lights a cigarette
youre a piece of work arent you
jenna blows out her match
no fucking hanging about with you is there
well i dont know about that
just been out here a while
know how to get things done
i bet you do
but things are going to shit
since billy died julians all over the place
well have to something about that the wont we
but first things first what about chang
my sons guardian angel
hes just a retired cop
good then he wont be to hard to kill will he
its not that simple
is there somewhere we can go thats a little more private
she raises her eyebrows
what did you have in mind
moves closer conspiratorial
you cant just going round killing cops here anymore
its not that easy
i didnt say it was easy
but then youre a resourceful man arent you
i looked into it
changs a hard man to get to
none of the thaisll go near him
well then youre going to have to find someone whos not a fucking thai then arent you
there might be a way
but julian cant find out
jenna looks at gordon smiles and crosses her legs
dont you worry about that
there are certain things that a mother and son shouldnt and dont discuss
gordon thinks he does but isnt a hundred per cent sure
julian sits on a chair holding his hand over a flame
mai finishes applying make up comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress
she watches him for a moment
what are you doing
seeing when it hurts
mai watches him
he doesnt flinch
im going to go
julian takes his hand off the flame
sees shes left the clothes he bought her behind
didnt you like what i got you
its fine but you know
its not my style
what do you mean
maybe you should give it to your mother
dont to be so hard on her
her life hasnt been easy
come on julian
shes a fucking bitch
dont say that okay
you dont know what youre talking about
shed do anything for me
the way she talks to you dont go there
dont talk about my mother
come on julian
julian stands up angry
why dont you fuck her instead of me
julian grabs hold her neck
throws her hard against the wall
you dont get to judge her
you think shes bad
you shouldve met my dad
but hes not around anymore and do you know why
cause she loved me too much
he lets go of her neck
mai rubs her neck
he pulls money out of his pocket
how much do i owe you
he forces a roll of notes into her hand forcing her to take it
she opens the door sets fire to the money and walks out of the room
as she walks down the hotel corridor julian slams his fists into the wall
a mixed clientele
asian and european
but theres an edge to the atmosphere
the musics that bit too loud that bit too aggressive
and the people inside dont look like theyre having a good time
it seems evil
jenna introduces herself to yuri karkov a well dressed and charismatic russian in his forties who is surrounded by thai girls and fellow russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard dimitri
as the camera tracks closer to them we start to hear what theyre saying
so why do you want to kill a policeman
policemen are good
they mind their own business and keep the streets safe
stop people stealing my cars
you really want to know
it may effect the price
he killed my son
this is bangkok
nothings that expensive
most things are cheap in bangkok
well take care of this business for you
but it wont be easy and it wont be cheap
chang and his crew eat dinner together
a crappy van pulls up outside
out get three cambodian men
very poor badly clothed
they look like farmers
only they pull out semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant
chang has just finished a meal with the cops including kim daeng and phaiban
chang is just settling the bill when the three gunmen walk in
he looks up just as they open fire
an insane storm of led rains down on the room shattering all the mirrors on the back wall taking out two waitresses and covering the room with broken glass
chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover
changs men are completely pinned down
phaibans been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood
chang keeps edging towards where his jackets hanging on a chair
in it his pistol
the gunmen keep firing
as soon as a clip is finished they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting
a stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair changs jackets on
it falls to the ground
with it his pistol
he grabs it and returns fire letting off four rounds
he takes gunman one
head shot right between the eyes
gunman two sees this and sprays at chang but chang manages to dive to cover
he rolls and fires again shooting gunman two in the chest three times
changs out of ammo and needs to reload
gunman threes weapon jams
he drops his weapon and runs
before hes finished reloading his pistol changs after him
he sees phaiban
daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest
chang keeps running determined not to lose his man
the driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat as he waits
as soon as he sees gunman three panic stricken running in fear he puts the van in gear revs the engine and starts to pull away
gunman three runs after him crying out for him to slow down
the driver slows
gunman three struggles to jump into the open doors
chang bursts out of the restaurant
aims and fires off two rounds
blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen
the driver falls forward dead
the back door of the van slams shut
gunman three thinks hes made it
the van isnt going anywhere
chang approaches the back door of the van ready to fire
do you want to die
do you want me to kill you
for what youve done
a long pause
dont kill me
tell me why not
tell me why i shouldnt shoot you as soon as you come out of that door
not good enough
its my first time
ive never done anything like this before
i know that
youre wearing sandals
hitmen dont wear sandals
the door opens
sandaled feet step out of the van
gunman three comes out with his hands up falling to his knees
chang continues to point his weapon at the unarmed man
give me a reason
the cops appear behind him in the doorway
chang holds his ground
his finger twitches
it looks like hes going to pull the trigger
im begging you
please you showed no mercy in there
why should mercy be shown to you
i dont know
yes you do
a long beat
i dont know his name
but you know where he is
gunman three looks up
flanked by the cops chang frog marches gunman three through the crowds passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you could ever want for your tv computer or hi
gunman three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the warren like market
finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop
chang enters followed by the others
gunman three is incredibly relieved to have found it
li po stands behind the counter beside him sits pan a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped
as soon as li po sees chang and his crew arrive with gunman three next to them he knows the games up
he cant run
his kids sitting there
he approaches them with a heavy sigh
you know why were here
he set it up
he knows who ordered the hit
hell tell you
dont talk unless i ask you to
chang turns to li po
do you have anything to say for yourself
im a salesman
some of the things i sell arent exactly legal
but ill give you the man that hired the hit
chang stares at him
li po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile phone
proffers it to chang
as for myself im not scared of paying for what ive done
just dont hurt my son
chang looks down at pan who is just staring at them not understanding the situation
chang takes the phone from li po
hes got the details
i told you he would
and i told you not to talk unless i asked you
chang aims his gun at gunman three
you said if i took you to him youd let me live
chang shakes his head
i never said that
gunman threes brains spatter across the tv screens on the far side of the wall
pan begins to cry and li po hugs him and tells him how much he loves him
thinking theyre next
chang studies the mobile phone
li po nods scared
where do i find him
skylight bar at the jupiter
chang studies li po making sure he speaks the truth
im taking your phone
chang turns to leave
what about me
looks at pan whos staring at chang in fear
looks back at li po
i forgive you
a people carrier pulls up outside the hotel
the doormen open the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and bloodstained policemen get out led by chang
pick out dimitri and the group of russian criminals
yuri karkov is in the centre of them a girl on either arm
chang leads the cops into the bar
he fires two shots into the ceiling
that shuts everyone up and gets the russian criminals up and ready for a confrontation
half the bars emptied by the time chang reaches yuri karkov
you better have a fucking good reason for doing this
dont you know who youre fucking with
chang looks at him
you live in my country
cant speak my language
too bad the one guy on my team that could speak english got murdered today
yuri looks round for help
he cant understand a word
can someone tell me what the fuck this guys trying to say
chang calls over to the barman
can you turn the music off
it wont be long i promise
the musics killed
thank you very much
chang pulls out li pos distinctive mobile phone
dimitri currently flanking yuri turns white
chang calls a number
then a phone starts ringing in dimitris jacket pocket with a really cheesy ringtone
chang shakes his head
yuri pulls a gun
kim shoots him dead
chang moves his gun across to dimitri
holds his mobile phone up to his ear
chang speaks through the phone
youre under arrest
we track in on dimitri as he stares at chang a rabbit in the headlights
chang slowly sits down next to him
talks to him in english
i need information
phaiban spins a spotlight onto dimitri
and youre going to help me
suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts
its as if dimitri and chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance
whether you like it or not
dimitris body starts to shake in fear
it was an english woman she wanted you dead
not what chang expected
murdered her son
who was she
i dont know
how did she know me
dimitri shakes his head
he really doesnt know
she asked for you by name
and whats my name
chang starts to circle him
doesnt know what the fuck hes on about
suddenly hes grabbed from behind by phaiban
chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind dimitri
i see the way you look at my people
the way you abuse them with your eyes
for this i take your sight
he pushes the broken bottle into dimitris eyes
gauges them out
dimitri screams hysterically calling out for his mother in russian
you live in my country but you fail to learn our language
you dont even try
for this i take your tongue
phaibun grabs dimitris head from behind
chang presses down on his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth grabs hold of his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off
dimitris screams become more like the howls of a dying animal
chang looks at him and his men release dimitri who stumbles around the room like a chicken without a head
you had opportunities
you could have chosen other paths
but you wouldnt listen
for this i give you silence
chang grabs dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear
first one side then the other
we cant hear dimitris screaming
we cant hear anything at all
painful and beautiful but also tacky
the opening bars to one of dolly partons classics
if i should stay i would only be in your way
so ill go but i know ill think of you every step of the way
and chang with his crew just stare at the tortured russian as he screams until his lungs are ready to burst
nadee and chang on stage
singing their hearts out
and i will always love you
i will always love you
you my darling you
his crew watch emotion etched on their faces
gordon is sitting on a chair in jennas hotel room a whiskey in his hand the bangkok skyline behind him
bittersweet memories that is all im taking with me
please dont cry jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and walks over to him a commanding presence
he makes to get up but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard on the mouth
we both know that im not what you you need
nadee and chang continue singing a spotlight beaming down on them singling them out in the shadowy bar
and i will always love you
i will always love you
jenna and gordon are still kissing as the guitar solo of the instrumental section kicks in
as chang waits for the instrumental section to end he starts to cry letting the tears flow without embarrassment
nadee puts her arm around him to comfort him
the rest of the crew start crying as well daeng in particular
i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all youve dreamed of
and i wish you joy and happiness
but above all this i wish you love
and i will always love you
julian trains alone in the night
i will always love you
i will always love you
nadee and chang holding hands
i will always love you
i will always love you
i i will always love you
julian stares at his reflection
you darling i love you
ooh ill always ill always love you
julian lifts his fists up
the same fighting pose we saw him in at the very beginning
ready as hell ever be
two figures kneel on either side of the ring
julian and chang
both wearing mongkol
the ceremonial music begins
slowly julian and chang start to perform ram muay the ancient traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried out before a fight takes place
it is both strange and spiritual julian and chang move their arms rhythmically in time to the music their hands describing shapes and outlining fighting positions
as the dance develops so their positions become more combative now crouching now standing hinting at the kicks and punches that theyre about to perform
but all carried out with an almost beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about to follow
the music ends
a moment of stillness and then slowly we bring up the sound of the baying crowd
ready for the fight theyve all been waiting for
the crowd is packed
in one corner julian
charlie ling beside him along with ko sam
he looks focussed
in the other corner chang
kim next to him along with a couple of his crew
he looks incredibly calm
the first bell sounds
five second warning
chang looks over into the crowd
kanita with nadee
kanita offers him a thumbs up
julian looks over
sees mai take a seat
she holds his gaze
the second bell sounds
the first of five rounds
julian and chang walk up to the centre of the ring
the referee stands between them
brings them together
a quick look down to the three judges
then a look between the two fighters
julian eyes chang
steely determination in his eyes
chang looks back at him without emotion
julian and chang circle each other
julian moves in to attack first
he throws a straight left first to changs face and steps his left foot forward at the same time
chang bends his right leg dodging the attack
he then pounces on the upper part of julians arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his left hand
he tries to turn julians front wrist up but julians too strong
this is a surprise for chang
he breaks and steps back
julian moves in to attack again raising both elbows to make an attack on changs head
chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut connecting hard with julians chin
julian moves back dazed
takes a moment to get his bearings back
chang doesnt take the opportunity to attack
he hangs back
waiting for julian to come at him again
this pisses julian off
he moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot
chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack
he moves too slow
the right footed attack was a feint
julian slams his right foot down on the floor and uses it to swivel unleashing a kick with his left which connects with changs jaw and sends him flying back
julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards
he bounds over to the disoriented chang and hits him with a series of jabs and punches to his upper body and face
changs almost on the ropes
julian comes in hard with kicks to the shins with his right foot
chang bends his body to pass under julians right foot
julian misses the target
chang manages to place his right foot on julians left knee joint which makes him fall down
julians in a vulnerable position but chang doesnt move to make the killer blow
he steps back to let him recover
again this enrages julian
he gets up and moves forward towards chang
he comes in with a high right kick
again chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of julians left knee
julian swivels punches air and gets a trio of punches in his gut
his guards down
but again no killer punch
shrugs at julian
you come on
julian moves towards him but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations the bell goes
end of round one
julian stalks back to his corner
he turns to look at chang a look of intense anger and frustration
julian moves towards the middle where chang is already waiting
julian waits for chang this time
chang is reluctant to attack
a waiting game
who will strike first
julian moves to kick chang in the ribs keeping both his hands down as he moves in
chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own kick as it comes in
chang steps back but again julian swivels using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot
chang goes flying backwards
pick out the look of concern etched on the faces of nadee and kanita
chang recovers but julian moves in fast with a series of punches and elbows
changs on the ropes now and getting badly beaten
he clings on to julian to limit the damage
the two fighters step back from each other
changs face is damaged
juilans about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds
end of the second round
round three julian slamming punches into chang
nadee comforting kanita
telling her itll be okay
chang responding with kicks and elbows
defensive blocks and counter attacks
mai willing julian on
jenna watching with gordon
end of round julian feeling more confident
again his eyes scan the crowd
this time he sees what hes looking for jenna
chang eyeballs julian from the other corner
sees him staring into the crowd
tries to see what hes looking at but cant make it out
pov from chang as he sees jenna make her way toward julian
when she gets to him we see her saying something to julian about the fight urging him to hit harder
jenna then walks back to gordon
deep in thought
he gets up early
walks around the ring
looking into the crowd
jenna sees him
stares at him
everything slows down as chang clocks her again
the colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red
hes seen her and she knows shes been seen
and he knows
and she knows that he knows
the bell goes off
back to reality
chang turns round
he gets a massive blow to his head
he goes down hard
the referee starts counting
nadee and kanita watch on fearful
jenna holds her breath
hopeful that he might be down and out
kim watches on concerned
please get up
after a long terrible pause
chang gets up
he looks over into the crowd
makes eye contact with his wife
she shakes her head
she cant bear it
tears running down her face
back on his feet chang suddenly drops his guard
julian hesitates confused
chang leans in close to him
it wasnt you was it
julian shrugs puts his guard up
what are you talking about
its not your fault
chang raises his arms again
ready to fight
julian gets ready to attack but somethings changed
the fires gone out of him
he looks over to his mother to mai changs words echoing in his mind
its not his fault
then chang comes in with a flurry of punches
left right left right
julian just takes them
chang pauses in the onslaught
julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring
chang runs at him flings his right foot swivels pulling out a roundhouse left kick which makes contact with julians draw
slow motion as julians head takes the impact
hes out cold before he hits the floor
jenna hurries down the corridor
she reaches the dressing room door
shes about to knock but she stops
she opens the door silently and lets herself in
julians sitting on the treatment table his face covered in cuts and bruises
jenna watches him in silence from the shadows steadies her breathing and then slips back out of the room
jenna comes out of the changing rooms as mai approaches
jenna shakes her head
he doesnt want to see anyone
mai is disappointed
doesnt know what to say
just give him time
tell him i came
jenna hugs mai close
well get him through this together
julian turns when he hears a knock at the door
jenna enters and closes the door behind her
she stands there for a moment as if considering what to say
you deserved to win
you shouldve give it a break mum
give it as rest
he steps into the light
she reaches out to touch him
ill never get use to seeing you get hurt even when you win
yeah well i lost
and did it make a difference
julian says nothing
i want to know
did it make a difference
slowly he shakes his head
it didnt make a difference
no difference at all
and how do you feel now
i dont feel anything at all
dont you see thats how i felt when billy died
julian studies his mother
what do you want mum
what dyou think i want
i want it to be like it used to be
i dont want to lose you
jenna starts crying
could be real could be an act hard to tell shes so good
whats wrong mum
she shakes her head
cant say it
he knows it was me
jenna says nothing
what did you do mum
what did you do
jenna makes her hand into a pistol
pretends to fire it into her skull
she tried to have chang killed
hes going to come after me
and after hes come after me hes going to come after you
julian stares at his mother fragile terrified alone
im scared julian
julian stares at his mother
what are we going to do
julian begins to realize what he has to do
and he looks at his hands
well be okay ill do it ill take him out
not just him
weve got to take them all out
julian stares at her the power she has over him
kill them all
the final solution
chang nadee and kanita are having a nice dinner happy that chang won and enjoying each others company in silence
chang tucks in his daughter
nadee watches from the doorway
kanita still has some dolls on her bed
he starts taking them off
notices one of them is broken
what happened to the princess head
the monsters were angry
they bit it off
i thought the king banished them all from his kingdom
these were new monsters
the woods are full of them
chang holds the broken princess body
a sudden wave of fear washes over him
a sense of doom
whats wrong dad
go to sleep
chang speaks on the phone
theyre going to come after me
he ends the call
stares at his reflection in the window
chang gets into bed next to his wife
switches off the light
the two of them are bathed in moonlight
he holds his wifes hand
its still early the sun is only just starting to rise over he city
charlie lings driving ko sam beside him
julians in the back street
his face is a mask his eyes hidden by his sunglasses
next to him is a silver shining motorcycle helmet
chang is eating breakfast as he watches a western on tv
nadee and kanita walk through the various stalls buying groceries
chang is dressed finishing putting on his tie ready for the day
he walks into his sitting room as he hears his mobile ring
she is in her room
you sure its her
see you very soon
and chang hangs up
the angel of vengeance getting ready to strike again
chang steps out of his apartment into the hallway where a uniformed policeman sits on guard reading a manga comic
whats your name
listen li hom
you see anyone you dont like
you call me okay
li hom nods
and by the way
everyone in the stations talking about it
the cars parked outside gordons apartment block
gordons not shown
julians calling him
sorry mate somethings come up
cant believe it
i need you here
i know but
what im doing its important
im sorry mate
julians incredibly frustrated but hasnt got time to argue
julian kills his phone
hes still for a moment then lets make a move
chang and the cops walk into the hotel
chang heads for the elevators while kim approaches reception
chang calls the lift and waits
kim comes back
they wont disturb us
the elevator door opens
chang and the cops are standing in the elevator waiting to get off
elevator music plays
julian is walking around changs apartment
looking at all family pictures
getting a sense of how they live
he opens drawers and closets and studies all the photos of chang as a boxer and soldier
on a wall is a framed article in thai that charlie ling is reading
whats it say
charlie starts reading the article out boxing cop hero back from grave
one of bangkoks finest blah blah blah came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year waking up as if nothing had happened
wife was really happy blah blah blah
its hard to describe chang said but i do feel different
charlie starts to sneer as he reads
julian is listening intently
i experienced something metaphysical impossible to explain
i travelled to many places and saw many things
and when i woke up i was no longer the man i once was
the angel of vengeance
nadee and kanita come out of the elevator and nadee quickly sees that police guard from before has been replaced by someone else ko sam
ko sam smiles
im the new guard
please go on in
nadee looks at him suspiciously but enters the apartment with kanita
ko sam pretends to go back to reading his manga comic
jenna sips tea from a china cup
she puts it back down on to her saucer
kim is sitting opposite her
chang stands in the background
i came here to collect my sons body
now its released my business in bangkok is completed
when are you leaving
and your other son is he going with you
ive had no real contact with julian since he ran away
you watched him fight
jenna looks over to chang
i watched him lose
and he deserved to
you were the better fighter
my only sadness is that billy got caught up in what hes doing out here
and paid for it with his life
kim and the rest of the crew take this in
ill never testify against my own flesh and blood officer chang
but hes a killer
chang senses something
starts to become agitated
it pains me to say it but my own son is a killer
he killed a cop back in england ten years ago
hes been on the run ever since
i say son
but he hasnt been a son to me
chang stares at the door to the bedroom
feels the presence of someone the other side of the door
not for a long time
not since he killed that cop back home
that was ten years ago
hes been running ever since
and hell never stop until hes caught
until you catch him
chang starts to push the door open
behind him jenna stands up
before chang fully opens the door his mobile phone rings
it sounds incredibly loud
he takes it out and looks at the display with a feeling of dread
did you change the guard
nadee is in the kitchen putting away the groceries as she is speaking with chang
someone else is out there now
chang begins to panic
his eyes fall upon jenna
get out of the apartment
nadee hears kanita call for her from the living room
chang screams down the phone but nadee is holding the phone against her chest and cant hear chang as she walks into the living room
where julian is sitting on the couch wearing the motorcycle helmet a shotgun on his lap
kanita is standing in the middle of the room staring at julian
charlie ling leans against the opposite wall a pistol in his hand
nadee remains silent trying to think fast
chang listens to the phone knowing somethings wrong
jenna stares at him defiant
their eyes lock briefly
but chang hasnt got time for this
he barges past her and out of the room
the camera tracks with chang as he runs down the corridor in total desperation
the camera zooms towards the main door
close on nadee who stares at the main door then slowly turns back to julian
she knows theyre trapped
kanita go to your room
but kanita stands still fear in her eyes
go to your room now
and slowly kanita walks towards her room as charlie ling watches her
kanita closes the door
julian stands up and walks toward nadee raises his shotgun and blows her head off
blood spatters onto the wall bits of brain and skull everywhere as her body falls to the ground
chang stops in his tracks
its as if he can feel the shotgun blast in his heart
he knows whats just happened
he stands still
he closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it all go away
he opens them again to see
the street is completely deserted
chang stands alone in the middle of a ghost town
julian takes off his helmet thats covered in blood throws it onto the floor and walks toward the front door
julian turns back
charlie ling nods towards kanitas room
julian shakes his head
charlie ling nods
what kind of a mother says that
if youve got a problem talk to her
were not doing it
you dont have to
charlie ling kicks open the door
julian realises he cant let him do it
and as charlie ling sees kanita
julian shoots him in the back
charlie ling slumps to the floor
julian approaches the doorway
he looks in
sees kanita sitting on her bed
she stares at julian charlie lings dead body at his feet
they hold each others gaze
and then julian slowly bows his head and leaves
julian walks out of the apartment with the shotgun raised expecting to shoot ko sam
but the hallway is empty
julian stumbles out of the apartment desperately catching his breath
he ends up leaning on a stall similar to the one he knocked over outside choi yan lees kiosk
candles and incense
buddhas smiling back at him
julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and incredibly vibrant
a group of school children all of whom are downs syndrome are crossing the road
smiles plastered across their faces
julian stares at them
their presence seems to have a calming effect on him as if theyre giving him new energy to do what hes starting to realize he has to do next
chang stares at the body of his dead wife
his crew in the background
julian walks across towards the lift the shotgun hidden inside his shirt
julian stands perfectly still in the lift as it goes up
just like chang did before
as julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out holds it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon
he reaches the door to his mothers room and pauses
julian stares at the door as if it was heavens gate
he loads the shotgun with two fresh cartridges
only god forgives
and now mother you will die
he rings the bell raising the shotgun ready to shoot
the door but its gordon who opens it dressed in a bathrobe
confused julian continues to level the weapon at his head
gordon backs away into the room
julian says nothing
edges into the room
the gun still pointed at gordons head
julian says nothing
kicks the door closed with his foot
wheres is she
picked up billys body
shes gone home
finally julian lowers the shotgun
didnt she tell you
julian sits down
you alright mate
dyou want something
julian mumbles to himself
then turns to gordon
realisation dawning on him im so fucked
kanita sits in a chair her father standing behind her
kim is showing her various head shots of criminals
kanita shakes her head until chang puts down a picture of julian
she looks up at her father nods
jenna gazes out of the window
she takes out her compact and adjusts her make up
jennas taxi heads over the mega bridge taking her away towards the airport
gordon and julian walk towards gordons car the sounds of their footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls
reaching the car gordon stands by the drivers door as julian heads for the passengers side
gordon pauses before unlocking the door
looks over to julian talking across the roof of the car
were good mates arent we
julians instantly suspicious
im sorry about this julian
i wish there was another way
gordon levels a pistol at julians head
what did she say
what did she promise you
dont make this harder gunshot
a bullet rips through julians shoulder
he falls back on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms
gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow
youve become a liability
you can see that cant you
julian looks at the wound
its deep but hes not totally incapacitated
he pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt
it clatters to the floor
and now she wants me to take over
she wants me to be the favoured son
what am i supposed to say
julian sinks to his knees leaning over to pick up the shotgun
hes got seconds
i didnt want it to end like this
first i fuck your mother
then i gordon turns the corner but julians in position
two shots in quick succession
both barrels fired at gordons chest
the force of the explosion flings gordons body against the far wall of the car park
julian pulls himself up and stands there the smoking shotgun acting as a makeshift crutch
he gazes at gordons steaming corpse appalled by the turn of events
julian falls out into a side street
hes badly wounded but hes going to make it
julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth
he pours the spirit over his wound
it stings like hell and julian screams in agony
julian walks out into the night the neon glow turning the streets into a modern day hades
although the wound isnt life threatening julians face is pale from the loss of blood
he looks like a ghost
he sees two cops chatting on a street corner
they dont see him theyre not even looking for him but they remind him
its just a matter of time
julian keeps walking
wipes sweat from his face
looking for a place to hide
a hole in the ground
then suddenly it comes to him
a single idea
a possible way of escape
a series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing pile
the work is being carried out by mai who has a lowly position in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen
not the sort of life she planed on having
a co worker calls out to her
some guys out there asking for you
mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile
she walks towards the exit passing her co worker
dont forget its supposed to be my break next
mai comes from round a corner and sees julian leaning against the wall
she checks that theyre alone knowing instinctively that hes in trouble
what happened to you
julian almost smiles
ive got to get out of bangkok
didnt want to leave
without saying goodbye
who did this to you
she made me what i am
and now ive got nothing
and theyre after me
mai stares at him
come with me
julian looks at her
to cambodia we can hide there
youll be safe there
mai and julian smile at each other
i got about twelve grand at the club
should be enough to get us there
set ourselves up
mai looks around theyre alone
julian watches as mai comes into the restaurant from the kitchen and walks over to the bar area
making sure no ones watching mai starts to pull money out of the til
julian looks over at the shop front next to him
a travel agency
pictures of holidays and beaches
it all seems in his grasp
mai comes up to him
mai and julian are in the taxi
he puts his arm around her
theyre on their way
the taxi pulls up outside juilans club
julian gets out of the taxi
if im not out in five minutes
julian nods and slams the door shut
mai watches juilan disappear into the building
we pan through julians empty club
its silent and empty like a tomb
we pick up julian as he hurries through towards his office
back where we first met him
julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads of money into a canvas hold all
hes about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows behind him
slowly out of the darkness a series of figures appear like vampires
chang and the cops
impossible to say how long theyve been standing there
chang and julian stare at each other
we track in to a close shot on julian
its almost as if this moment was inevitable
chang brings julian out of the club
a police car is waiting outside
mai sits in the back seat
the police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town
daeng is driving
kim sits next to him
daeng looks into the rearview mirror to see julian and mai sitting next to chang
mai looks scared
julian more accepting of his fate
the police car heads over the mega bridge and continues its way out of town
they all sit in the car in silence
the police car pulls up
chang leads juilan across the field
the cops follow a few steps behind with mai
suddenly and completely unexpectedly chang punches julian in the gut
julian falls to the floor and chang starts to viciously attack him punching and kicking him
finally julian unable to defend himself is lying on the ground immobile
julian rolls over
slowly he starts to get up onto his knees
they continue chang forcing julian to crawl as they make their way further into the field
then chang stops
julian struggles to get up to his feet but before he does chang kicks him hard in the chest sending him back down to the floor
do you have anything to say
dont hurt her
he kicks him in the stomach
do you have anything to say
chang kicks him again like you would kick a dog
chang squats down next to him
what do you expect me to do
i dont know
chang gets up and walks on
he stops and turns round
julian stumbles to his feet
the party continue
we see that one of the crew is carrying an axe
a couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point
chang looks down at julian who is lying on the ground
the crew stand in the background with mai
chang sits next to julian
when you were born whats the first thing you remember seeing
a beat as julian struggles to understand changs question
chang stares at him
what do you remember
chang looks at him in a strange way like this answer has some meaning for him
and do you ever see light
julian shakes hes head
chang considers this answer for a long moment
he gets up and returns to mai stares at her
i am the angel of vengeance
i restore order and karma
i love all living things
mai just stares at him too frightened to move
i want you to walk away from here now
do you understand
chang smiles at her
go with god
mai turns and leaves
chang watches her disappear into the field
chang takes the axe off phaiban and turns back to julian
mai walks through the field alone
chang leans down next to julian and whispers something into julians ear so softly that we cannot hear it
whatever it says it instantly has an effect on julian
he visibly relaxes
he doesnt make a sound as hes held down
a plastic strap is tied around his arm as a tourniquet
his arm is pulled out
chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then his right
julian grits his teeth throughout
chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs
the dogs tear into the meat fighting over their prize
chang and his men walk back towards the car
music kicks in once again
the karaoke version of john denvers country and western ballad
almost heaven west virginia blue ridge mountains shenandoah river life is old there older than the trees younger than the mountains growin like the breeze
we see various scenes of every day life in bangkok
country roads take me home to the place i belong west virginia mountain momma take me home country roads we see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to
pick them up
kanita spots chang runs towards him and they embrace
all my memories gathered round her miners lady stranger to blue water dark and dusty painted on the sky misty taste of moonshine teardrops in my eye
chang and kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen
chang is in his element
singing like a cowboy
country roads take me home to the place i belong west virginia mountain momma take me home country roads
the cops sit and watch him
julian is lying in hospital
bandages covering the terrible wounds where his hands once were
mai is sitting beside him
spoon feeding him food
i hear my voice in the mornin hour she calls me the radio reminds me of my home far away and drivin down the road i get a feelin that
i should have been home yesterday an aeroplane lands
country roads take me home to the place i belong jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities
west virginia mountain momma take me home country roads as one of the customs officers puts on a rubber glove jenna starts to scream out obscenities at them
mask off a real monster underneath flailing around for all to see
chang keeps singing
country roads take me home to the place i belong west virginia mountain momma take me home country roads take me home country roads take me home country roads and
we end close on chang
with the sense that the country roads have kind of taken both of them home
