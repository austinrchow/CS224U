dead poets society final script a young boy dressed in a school uniform and cap fidgets as his mother adjusts his tie
now remember keep your shoulders back
a student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes
the young boy and his brother line up for a photograph okay put your arm around your brother
and breathe in
the young boy blinks as the flash goes off
okay one more
an old man lights a single candle
a teacher goes over the old mans duties
now just to review youre going to follow along the procession until you get to the headmaster
at that point he will indicate to you to light the candles of the boys
all right boys lets settle down
the various boys including neil knox and cameron line up holding banners
ahead of them is the old man followed by the boy with the bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front
the boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly
the small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a church
the pews are filled with students and parents while the teachers all dressed in robes are seated at the front of the church behind the headmaster
the boys break off to either side at the front of the church
the bagpipes cease and the headmaster mr
nolan walks over to the old man carrying the candle
ladies and gentlemen boys the light of knowledge
an organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands to the young boys in the front pew
each boy is holding a candle and he bends over to light the first one
each boy in turn lights the candle of the boy next to him
one hundred years ago in boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that greets you at the start of each semester
gentlemen what are the four pillars
all throughout the pews uniformed boys rise to their feet
todd who is not wearing a uniform is urged by his father to stand with them
tradition honor discipline excellence
the boys quickly return to their seats
in her first year welton academy graduated five students
last year we graduated fifty one
and more than seventy five percent of those went on to the ivy league
this this kind of accomplishment is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here
this is why you parents have been sending us your sons
this is why we are the best preparatory school in the united states
nolan soaks up the applause from the audience
as you know our beloved mr
portius of the english department retired last term
you will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement mr
john keating himself a graduate of this school
and who for the past several years has been teaching at the highly regarded chester school in london
the crowd applauds once again
the school lawn is a filled with luggage students and parents mulling about in every direction
mr nolan stands by the entrance speaking with each family as they leave
glad you could come by
thrilling ceremony as usual dr
youve been away too long
good to have you back
this is our youngest todd
you have some big shoes to fill young man
your brother was one of our finest
todd and his parents leave while others file past mr
so glad you liked it
mr perry approaches with his son neil
he shakes mr
gale tom good to see you again
we expect great things from you this year
thank you sir
well he wont disappoint us
ill do my best sir
a bell tolls
parents begin wishing their boys farewell
hey come on son
no tears now
another boy hugs his mother
i dont want to go here

neil emerges from a building and sees todd
hey i hear were gonna be roommates
he shakes todds hand
im neil perry
whyd you leave balincrest
my brother went here
oh so youre that anderson
hager is standing in his room doorway while spaz and his father are going over some last minute precautions over the boys allergies
spazs father hands hager various bottles
this is for sinuses
oh and if he cant swallow you give him one of these
and if he had trouble breathing you can give him some of those
all right fine
hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room shutting the door
to son did you remember your vaporizer
yes i put it in my room
spazs father tries to say something else to dr
hager but realizes he has already gone
neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys carrying two suitcases
as he enters his room knox quickly passes by
hey hows it going neil
cameron comes by and leans against the doorway
neil study group tonight
business as usual huh
hey i hear you got the new kid
looks like a stiff
he begins laughing when he notices todd coming into the room
cameron quickly leaves
neil tries to keep from laughing as todd enters the room and sets his luggage down on his bed
listen dont mind cameron
he was born with his foot in his mouth
you know what i mean
he pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks todd across the back with it
charlie comes to the door with a smug expression on his face
knox and meeks are close behind him
he points at neil rumor has it you did summer school
my father thought i should get ahead
how was your summer slick
the boys enter the room
charlie turns around and looks at meeks who is just entering
gentlemen what are the four pillars
charlie makes himself comfortable on neils bed and lights up a cigarette
meanwhile todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage
okay study group
meeks aced latin
i didnt quite flunk english
so if you want weve got our study group
cameron asked me too
anyone mind including him
hmm whats his specialty boot licking
come on hes your roommate
thats not my fault
meeks seems to notice todd for the first time
oh im sorry my name is steven meeks
neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window
oh this is todd anderson
todd turns around and shakes hands with meeks
nice to meet you
nice to meet you
charlie continues to lay on the bed looking smug
knox extends a hand
todds brother was jeffrey anderson
oh yeah sure
national merit scholar
oh well welcome to hell ton
its every bit as tough as they say unless youre a genius like meeks
he flatters me
thats why i help him with latin
and english and trig
charlie begins coughing
there is a knock at the door
charlie quickly stamps out his cigarette on the floor and neil tries to wave the smoke from the air
the door opens and mr
perry walks into the room
neil quickly rises from the window
father i thought youd gone
the other boys stand up when he enters
keep your seats fellows keep your seats
neil ive just spoken to mr
i think that youre taking too many extra curricular activities this semester and ive decided that you should drop the school annual
but im the assistant editor this year
well im sorry neil
but father i cant
it wouldnt be fair
fellas would you excuse us for a moment
perry walks towards the door and neil hesitantly follows
perry pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys
the smile has gone from mr
he grabs a hold of neils arm
dont you ever dispute me in public
do you understand
father i wasnt disputing after youve finished medical school and youre on your own then you can do as you damn well please
but until then you do as i tell you
is that clear
you know how much this means to your mother dont you
you know me always taking on too much
well thats my boy
now listen you need anything you let us know huh
perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves
neil leans his head back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room
why doesnt he let you do what you want
yeah neil tell him off
it couldnt get any worse
oh thats rich
like you guys tell your parents off mr
future lawyer and mr
okay so i dont like it any more than you do
well just dont tell me how to talk to my father
you guys are the same way
all right all right jesus
so what are you going to do
what i have to do
drop the annual
well i wouldnt lose much sleep over it
its just a bunch of jerks trying to impress nolan
i dont care
i dont give a damn about any of it
well uh latin eight o clock in my room
todd youre welcome to join us
yeah come along pal
todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock
a clock bell chimes five oclock
enormous flocks of birds apparently disturbed by the noise take to the sky
the sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they descend the stairs in a long spiralling line
mcallister tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream
slow down boys slow down you horrible phalanx of pubescense
a teacher walks up and down the aisles handing out books
pick three laboratory experiments from the project list and report on them every five weeks
the first twenty questions at the end of chapter one are due tomorrow
the students let out a collective groan
mcallister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets the students to repeat everything he says
students repeat after each word
hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back
your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision
anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will be penalized one point off their final grade
let me urge you now not to test me on this point
students enter keatings classroom talking and acting up
keating glances out from his room off to one side
hey spaz spaz
spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper while cameron smacks him on the shoulder
the students quickly quiet down as keating emerges from the other room whistling the overture
he walks up the length of the classroom and out the door without a word
the students look around at one another uncertain of what to do
keating pokes his head back in the doorway
well come on
he gestures them to follow and the students after some hesitation grab their books and follow keating out into the main entranceway
keating stands before the schools trophy cabinets and waits until all the boys arrive
oh captain my captain who knows where that comes from
todd looks up as if he knows the answer but says nothing
spaz blows his nose a little too close to meeks for his liking
not a clue
its from a poem by walt whitman about mr
now in this class you can call me mr
or if youre slightly more daring oh captain my captain
the students laugh slightly
now let me dispel a few rumors so they dont fester into facts
yes i too attended hell ton and survived
and no at that time i was not the mental giant you see before you
i was the intellectual equivalent of a ninety eight pound weakling
i would go to the beach and people would kick copies of byron in my face
the boys laugh once again while cameron obviously trying to write all this down looks around confusedly
keating looks down at papers in his hand
thats a rather unfortunate name
pitts where are you
pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers
pitts would you open your hymnal to page and read the first stanza of the poem you find there
to the virgins to make much of time
yes thats the one
somewhat appropriate isnt it
gather ye rosebuds while ye may old time is still a flying and this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying
thank you mr
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
the latin term for that sentiment is carpe diem
now who knows what that means
meeks immediately puts his hand up
thats seize the day
very good mr
another unusual name
seize the day
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
why does the writer use these lines
because hes in a hurry
keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer
thank you for playing anyway
because we are food for worms lads
because believe it or not each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing turn cold and die
keating turns towards the trophy cases filled with trophies footballs and team pictures
now i would like you to step forward over here and peruse some of the faces from the past
youve walked past them many times
i dont think youve really looked at them
the students slowly gather round the cases and keating moves behind them
theyre not that different from you are they
full of hormones just like you
invincible just like you feel
the world is their oyster
they believe theyre destined for great things just like many of you
their eyes are full of hope just like you
did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable
because you see gentlmen these boys are now fertilizing daffodils
but if you listen real close you can hear them whisper their legacy to you
go on lean in
the boys lean in and keating hovers over camerons shoulder
whispering in a gruff voice carpe
cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face
whispering again carpe
seize the day boys make your lives extraordinary
the boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence
the boys emerge from the school loaded down with numerous books
that was weird
spooky if you ask me
think hell test us on that stuff
come on cameron dont you get anything
a coach sticks his head around the corner into the room
lets go boys hustle up in here
that means you dalton
meeks emerges from the showers drying himself off
okay whos up for a trig study group tonight guys
still annoyed by what the coach said what
i cant make it guys
i have to have dinner at the danburrys house
who are the danburrys
howd you swing that
friends of my dads
theyre probably in their nineties or something
anythings better than hell ton hash
ill second that
yeah well see
neil approaches todd whos been sitting by the window staring down at the floor
neil snaps his fingers to get todds attention
hey you coming to the study group tonight
uh no no i uh ive got some history i wanna do
todd is seated at his desk
he scrawls carpe diem across a blank page of his notebook
he looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up and opening up his chemistry book
hager comes down the stairs
knox is looking at one of the old class photos on the walls
knox reluctantly follows after dr
ready to go sir
the car leaves welton and drives towards the danburrys house
the doorbell rings
chet can you get that
i cant mom
ill get it
the door opens and knox is awe struck by the beautiful girl chris who has answered the door
can i help you
knox manages to break out of his daze
this is the danburrys right
are you here to see chet
chris begins to laugh as mrs
danburry arrives behind her
thank you chris
you must be knox
hager back by nine
to knox please come in
chris come on what are you doing
chet im coming
knox enters the house his mind still hung up on chris as mr danburry comes out of the living room to meet him
how are you
nice to meet you sir
well hes the spitting image of his father isnt he
how is he
come on in
he just did a big case for gm
i know where youre headed like father like son huh
several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging from the bulletin board
various students are studying and playing games
meeks and pitts are sitting at one table working on their hi fi system
meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck
pitts points out to him that he forgot to plug it in
neil cameron and charlie are working on their trig homework
just replace these numbers here with x for x and y
of course so whats the problem
charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him leaning up against it heavily
how was dinner
how was dinner
he leaves the door and sits down with the other boys
tonight i met the most beautiful girl in my entire life
are you crazy
whats wrong with that
shes practically engaged
to chet danburry
that guy could eat a football
thats too bad
its worse than too bad pitsie its a tragedy
a girl this beautiful in love with such a jerk
all the good ones go for jerks you know that
ahh forget her
open your trig book and try and figure out problem five
i cant just forget her cameron
and i cant think about trig
the radio meeks and pitts were working on begins letting out a high pitched hum
we got it
hager walks into the room
all right gentlemen five minutes
the students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave
pitts tries to hide the radio in his lap
charlie leans in close to knox
did you see her naked
very funny dalton
that wouldnt be a radio in your lap would it mr
science experiment radar
meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it
keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one of his books
gentlemen open your text to page twenty one of the introduction
perry will you read the opening paragraph of the preface entitled understanding poetry
understanding poetry by dr
evans pritchard ph
to fully understand poetry we must first be fluent with its meter rhyme and figures of speech
then ask two questions one how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and two how important is that objective
question one rates the poems perfection question two rates its importance
and once these questions have been answered determining a poems greatest becomes a relatively simple matter
keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board
if the poems score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph and its importance is plotted on the vertical then calculating the total area of the poem
yields the measure of its greatness
keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students dutifully copy it down
a sonnet by byron may score high on the vertical but only average on the horizontal
a shakespearean sonnet on the other hand would score high both horizontally and vertically yielding a massive total area thereby revealing the poem to be truly great
as you proceed through the poetry in this book practice this rating method
as your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows so will so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry
neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses
the student sitting across from him is discretely trying to eat
keating turns away from the chalkboard with a smile
thats what i think of mr
were not laying pipe were talking about poetry
cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly scribbles it out
i mean how can you describe poetry like american bandstand
i like byron i give him a but i cant dance to it
charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class
now i want you to rip out that page
the students look at keating as if he has just gone mad
go on rip out the entire page
you heard me rip it out
rip it out
charlie looks around at the others
he then looks down at his own notes which consists of drawing breasts
go on rip it out
charlie rips the page out and holds it up
thank you mr
gentlemen tell you what dont just tear out that page tear out the entire introduction
i want it gone history
leave nothing of it
rip it out
evans pritchard ph
rip shred tear
rip it out
i want to hear nothing but ripping of mr
meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages
well perforate it put it on a roll
keating sees cameron still hesitating
its not the bible youre not going to go to hell for this
go on make a clean tear i want nothing left of it
keating goes over to his room
cameron turns around to neil
we shouldnt be doing this
rip rip rip
neil makes cameron turn back around
rip it out rip
from outside the classroom mr
mcallister hears all the noise and sees all the students ripping out the pages
he bursts into the room
what the hell is going on here
the boys all turn around in shock
charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his mouth
keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket
i dont hear enough rips
im sorry i i didnt know you were here
ahh so you are
mcallister slowly backs out of the classroom
keep ripping gentlemen
this is a battle a war
and the casualties could be your hearts and souls
keating holds out the basket to charlie who spits out a wad of paper
thank you mr
armies of academics going forward measuring poetry
no we will not have that here
no more of mr
now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again
you will learn to savor words and language
no matter what anybody tells you words and ideas can change the world
i see that look in mr
pitts eye like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school
hopkins you may agree with him thinking yes we should simply study our mr
pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions
i have a little secret for ya
the boys get up from their seats and gather around keating in the center of the class
we dont read and write poetry because its cute
we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race
and the human race is filled with passion
medicine law business engineering these are all noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life
but poetry beauty romance love these are what we stay alive for
to quote from whitman o me o life of the questions of these recurring of the endless trains of the faithless of cities filled with the foolish
what good amid these o me o life
answer that you are here
that life exists and identity
that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse
that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse
keating looks up at todd
keating what will your verse be
the cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace
for what we are about to receive may the lord make us truly grateful
keating and mr
mcallister are seated next to one another at the table
quite an interesting class you gave today mr
im sorry if i shocked you mr
oh theres no need to apologize
it was very fascinating misguided though it was
you think so
you take a big risk by encouraging them to be artists john
when they realize theyre not rembrandts shakespeares or mozarts theyll hate you for it
were not talking artists george were talking free thinkers
free thinkers at seventeen
funny i never pegged you as a cynic
taken aback by the comment not a cynic a realist
show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams and ill show you a happy man
but only in their dreams can man be truly free
twas always thus and always thus will be
keating winks and mr
mcallister cant help but laugh
neil joins the others at the table
he pulls out a yearbook
hey i found his senior annual in the library
he hands the annual over to cameron who laughs at the younger picture of keating
listen to this captain of the soccer team editor of the school annual cambridge bound thigh man and the dead poets society
reading from the annual man most likely to do anything
k was a hell raiser
whats the dead poets society
i dont know
is there a picture in the annual
no other mention of it
that boy there see me after lunch
cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal
keating is walking down towards the lake whistling the same tune as before
the boys emerge from the building and chase after him
oh captain my captain
keating immediately turns around
we were just looking in your old annual
he hands keating the annual and keating looks at his old photograph
oh my god
no thats not me
stanley the tool wilson keating crouches down and continues looking through the book
neil crouches down next to keating
what was the dead poets society
i doubt the present administration would look too favorably upon that
what was it
gentlemen can you keep a secret
the other boys crouch down around keating
the dead poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life
thats a phrase from thoreau that wed invoke at the beginning of each meeting
you see wed gather at the old indian cave and take turns reading from thoreau whitman shelley the biggies
even some of our own verse
and in the enchantment of the moment wed let poetry work its magic
you mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry
overstreet it wasnt just guys we werent a greek organization we were romantics
we didnt just read poetry we let it drip from our tongues like honey
spirits soared women swooned and gods were created gentlemen not a bad way to spend an evening eh
thank you mr
perry for this trip down amnesia lane
burn that especially my picture
keating hands the annual back and walks away whistling once again
neil remains crouched
dead poets society
the school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school
neil stands up
i say we go tonight
wait a minute
wheres this cave hes talking about
its beyond the stream
i know where it is
sounds boring to me
you know how many de merits were talking dalton so dont come please

the boys run into the building

charlie laughs and runs inside
knox chases after him
but why do they swoon
charlie tell me why they swoon
the boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out on it
whispering okay follow the stream to the waterfall
its right there
its got to be on the banks
i dont know its starting to sound dangerous
well why dont you stay home
for gods sake stop chattering and sit down
the boys take their seats once again and neil goes over and sits next to todd who is sitting by himself
todd are you coming tonight
god you were there
you heard keating
dont you want to do something about it
yes but but
keating said that everybody took turns reading and i dont want to do that
gosh you really have a problem with that dont you

what if you didnt have to read
what if you just came and listened
thats not how it works
forget how it works
what if what if they said it was okay
what are you gonna do go up and ask them
ill be right back
neil gets up and rejoins the others
mcallister hears the boys whispering again
oh shut up will you
various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed
someone is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake
thats my thats for my asthma okay
could you give that back please
could you give that back
whats the matter
dont you like snakes
neil enters and taps todd on the shoulder
get away from me okay
spaz why dont you check your pocket huh
come on spaz i have to brush my teeth get a get off hager walks past the bathroom and into his room
cut out that racket in there
the kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping
hager glares at them for a moment
neil stands in his doorway
he looks across the hall to the other room where cameron and charlie are standing
cameron gives a thumbs up
neil closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight
setting the flashlight down on the desk he notices a worn book five centuries of verse sitting there
opening it up he sees john keatings name at the top followed by dead poets
below the title of the book is written to be read at the opening of d
along with several lines from thoreau beginning with i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately
the shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened halls
hager hears a dog barking
someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dogs feet
he stops barking and immediately begins gobbling them down
hager looks out into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing
the boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the fields towards the woods
the boys search about the trees trying to find the cave
meeks is searching around when charlie leaps up behind meeks in the dark shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs meeks by the shoulder
arrr im a dead poet
laughing guys over here
youre real funny
the boys are trying to start a fire
the cave is quickly filling up with smoke
its too wet
god are you trying to smoke us out of here
no no the smokes going right up this opening
pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling
he lets out a yell while the others laugh
all right all right forget the fire
lets go gentlemen
neil stands before the others with the book in hand and takes a drag on a cigarette
i hereby reconvene the dead poets society
the boys cheer
the meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present
todd anderson because he prefers not to read will keep minutes of the meetings
ill now read the traditional opening message by society member henry david thoreau
i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately
i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life
ill second that
to put to rout all that was not life and not when i had come to die discover that i had not lived
several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem
and keatings marked a bunch of other pages
neil begins flipping through the book
all right intermission
dig deep right here
right here lay it down on the mud
were gonna put our food on the mud
meeks put your coat down
yes sir use meeks coat
dont keep anything back either
you guys are always bumming my smokes
meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it
amongst the pile are chocolate chip cookies a box of raisins a few apples an orange and half a roll
wait a minute who gave us half a roll
talking with his mouth full im eating the other half
you want me to put it back
neil lit up by a flashlight begins to tell everyone a story
it was a dark and rainy night and this old lady who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles sat by herself in her house at her table to complete a
new jigsaw puzzle
but as she pieced the puzzle together she realized to her astonishment that the image that was formed was her very own room
and the figure in the center of the puzzle as she completed it was herself
and with trembling hands she placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of a demented madman at the window
the last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass
this is true this is true
ive got one thats even better than that
theres a young married couple and theyre driving through the forest at night on a long trip
and they run out of gas and theres a madman on the the thing with the hand all the boys react recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car
i love that story
i told you that one
you did not
i got that in camp in sixth grade
when were you in six last year
as everyones voices begin to calm down pitts begins reading from the book
in a mean abode in the shanking road lived a man named william bloat
now he had a wife the plague of his life who continually got his goat
and one day at dawn with her nightshift on he slit her bloody throat
the boys laugh
oh and it gets worse
you want to hear a real poem
meeks hands charlie the book but he shoves it away
no i dont need it
you take it
what did you bring one
you memorized a poem
i didnt memorize a poem
neil moves to the side as charlie stands and takes his spot
an original piece by charlie dalton
an original piece
take center stage
you know this is history
this is history
charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and slowly unfolds it revealing a playboy centerfold elaine reynolds miss october oh wow
where did you get that
teach me to love
go teach thyself more wit
i chief professor am of it
neil gets up and looks over charlies shoulder to see what he is reading
the god of love if such a thing there be may learn to love from me
charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer
did you write that
charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down the poem
okay whos next
neil sits reading from the book by flashlight
alfred lord tennyson
come my friends tis not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset
and though we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven that which we are we are one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak
by time and fate but strong in will
to strive to seek to find and not to yield
meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is performing a chant
then i had religion then i had a vision
i could not turn from their revel in derision
then i saw the congo creeping through the black cutting through the forest with a golden track
then i saw the congo creeping through the black meeks meeks
cutting through the forest with a golden track
then i saw the congo creeping through the black cutting through the forest with a golden track
knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum
the other boys stand and begin going in a circle making music with sticks of wood combs etc
then i saw the congo creeping through the black cutting through the forest with a golden track
then i saw the congo creeping through the black cutting through the forest with a golden track
then i saw the congo creeping through the black cutting through the forest with
the boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the cave
the clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm
keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students
a man is not very tire he is exhausted
and dont use very sad use he points to the back of the classroom
come on mr
overstreet you twerp morose
now language was developed for one endeavor and that is
are you a man or an amoeba
keating stands before todds desk
todd looks up nervously but says nothing
keating paused for a moment before looking away
uh to communicate
to woo women
today were going to be talking about william shakespeare
the class lets out a collective sigh
a lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work
were gonna talk about shakespeare as someone who writes something very interesting
now many of you have seen shakespeare done very much like this keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to speak in an exaggerated british accent
o titus bring your friend hither
but if any of you have seen mr
marlon brando you know shakespeare can be different
friend romans countrymen lend me your ears
you can also imagine maybe john wayne as macbeth going well is this a dagger i see before me
the students are all seated together near the front of the room as keating reads from a book
oh not just now
i do enjoy a good dog once in a while sir
you can have yourself a three course meal from one dog
start with your canine crudites go to your fido flambe for main course and for dessert a pekingese parfait
and you can pick your teeth with a little paw
the students are all back in their normal seats and keating leaps up onto his desk
why do i stand up here
to feel taller
keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot thank you for playing mr
i stand upon my desk to remind yourself that we must constantly look at things in a different way
keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk
you see the world looks very different from up here
you dont believe me
come see for yourself
charlie and neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front of the classroom
the rest of the class follows them
while keating continues speaking neil and charlie join him on the desk and then keating jumps down
just when you think you know something you have to look at it in another way
even though it may seem silly or wrong you must try
now when you read dont just consider what the author thinks
consider what you think
boys you must strive to find your own voice
because the longer you wait to begin the less likely you are to find it at all
thoreau said most men lead lives of quiet desperation
dont be resigned to that
keating notices spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately
dont just walk off the edge like lemmings
look around you
the school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk
keating begins to gather up his stuff
the clock begins to toll as keating walks to the back of the class
there you go mr
dare to strike out and find new ground
now in addition to your essays i would like you to compose a poem of your own an original work
the students begin to groan
keating begins flickering the lights off and on while chanting ominously
you have to deliver it aloud in front of the class on monday
bonne chance gentlemen
keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again
todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off
dont think that i dont know that this assignment scares the hell out of you you mole
keating flicks the light off leaving todd to jump down in the darkness as the students laugh
cameron charlie and several other boys are rowing while mr
nolan shouts orders from a bullhorn
take a power train in two
keep your eyes in the boat
noisy static is replaced by music as pitts climbs down form the peak to join meeks at their makeshift radio
we got it pittsie
we got it
radio free america
several students are fencing on a grassy slope
meeks and pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music
todd is on his bed trying to write a poem
the door opens and todd turns his writing pad over
neil enters the room laughing
he crouches down next to todds bed and plunks a sheet of paper in todds lap
i found it
you found what
what i wanna do right now
whats really really inside me
a midsummer nights dream
this is it
what is this
its a play dummy
i know that
i wh wh what does it have to do with you
theyre putting it on at henley hall
neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed wearing it like a cloak
so im gonna act
im gonna be an actor
ever since i can remember ive wanted to try this
i even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year but of course my father wouldnt let me
for the first time in my whole life i know what i wanna do
neil grabs a handful of papers off todds bed and tosses them into the air
and for the first time im gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not
neil neil hold on a minute
how are you gonna be in a play if your father wont let you
first i gotta get the part then i can worry about that
yeah but wont he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didnt even tell him
no no no no
as far as im concerned he wont have to know about any of this
well thats impossible
well why dont you just call him and ask him
and m maybe hell say yes
thats a laugh
neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed
if i dont ask him at least i wont be disobeying him
yeah but if he said shouting angrily jesus todd
whose side are you on
todd says nothing
neil looks at him for a moment and then takes the flyer back from todd
he walks over to the window his excitement gone
i mean i havent even gotten the part yet
cant i even enjoy the idea for a little while
once again todd says nothing
after a moment neil sits on the heater and todd returns to his poem
youre coming to the meeting this afternoon
i dont know
keating has to say means shit to you does it todd
w what is that supposed to mean
youre in the club
being in the club means being stirred up by things
you look about as stirred up as a cesspool
neil gets up from the window and stands over todd
so you want me out
i want you in but being in means you gotta do something
not just say youre in
well listen neil
i i appreciate this concern but i im not like you
you you you say thing and people listen
im im not like that
dont you think you could be
i i i dont know but thats not the point
the the the point is that theres nothing you can do about it so you can just butt out
i can take care of myself just fine
what do you mean no
a smile comes to neils face
neil grabs todds notebook of poetry and runs across the room with it
todd leaps up after him
give me neil
neil give that back
the two begin racing in circles around the room jumping from bed to bed as todd tries to grab his poem back
we are dreaming of a poetry
im being chased by walt whitman
neil drops the notebook
cameron walks into the room
what are you guys doing
im sure you see this chemistry cameron tries to hold up his book and neil snatches it from his hands and suddenly all three of them are racing around the
hey give me neil give me dont be immature
i need my charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands
give it to me
give it to me
neil tosses camerons book to charlie
let me have my book i need my the four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters tossing camerons book back and forth
neil picks up a recorder and begins blowing erratic notes on it while charlie starts pounding on a set of bongo drums
outside the room a crowd of boys watch
knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance
seeing no one nearby he races through the open gates and down the road
he comes to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass shouting as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air
a number of vehicles drive up filled with students dressed in bright red cosyumes playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass
knox watches the growing crowd of students
they are all converging on a bus
a football player wearing a horned helmet dances on the roof of the bus
a band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising
knox spots chris amongst the cheerleaders
he watches her until chet comes along and she grabs hold of his hand
knox looks away in disgust
okay everybody on the bus
lets go boys
come on lets go
on the bus boys
chris jumps into chets arms as everyone begins to board the buses
knox turns his bike around and leaves
keating walks across the field followed by his students
he kicks a ball ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over his shoulder
now devotees may argue that one sport or game is inherently better than another
for me sport is actually a chance for us to have other human beings push us to excel
i want you all to come over here and take a slip of paper and line up single file
keating reaches the stands
he tosses the balls aside and pulls sets his briefcase down
as the boys line up he begins ripping off slips of paper from a notepad and handing them out
meeks time to inherit the earth
pitts rise above your name
he hands the notepad to another student
i want you to hand these out to the boys one apiece
the students are all lined up in single file each holding a slip of paper
keating blows his whistle
you know what to do pitts
oh to struggle against great odds
to meet enemies undaunted
sounds to me like youre daunted
say it again like youre undaunted
oh to struggle against great odds
to meet enemies undaunted
now go on
pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick
one of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances
to be a sailor of the world bound for all ports
oh i live to be the ruler of life not a slave
keating walks away and starts up a record player
to mount the scaffolds
to advance to the muzzle of guns with perfect nonchalance
classical music begins playing on the phonograph
meeks goes to read next but is confused by the music
come on meeks
listen to the music
to dance clap hands exalt shout skip roll on float on
without energy oh to have life henceforth the poem of new joys
hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer ball with his foot
keating puts a look of disgust on his face
come on charlie let it fill your soul
charlie raises his hands over his head
to indeed be a god
neil is racing down the hallway all excited
charlie i got the part
im gonna play puck
im gonna play puck
he pounds on charlies door
what did he say
thats the main part
charlie i got it
good for you neil
good for you
neil enters his room with todd and sits down at his typewriter
okay okay okay okay
neil how are you gonna do this
they need a letter of permission from my father and mr
youre not gonna write it
oh yes i am
neil youre crazy
neil begins typing
i am writing to you on behalf of my son neil perry
neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down
this is great
a lone bagpiper plays out on the dock
todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem
his pacing slows and then he tears the poem up
knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand
quietly to chris
charlie looks up from his desk with a grin
i see a sweetness in her smile
blight light shines from her eyes
but life is complete contentment is mine just knowing that
several students begin to snicker
just knowing that shes alive
knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk
its not stupid
its a good effort
it touched on one of the major themes love
a major theme not only in poetry but life
hopkins you were laughing
hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds his piece of paper
the cat sat on the mat
yours is the first poem to ever have a negative score on the pritchard scale
were not laughing at you were laughing near you
i dont mind that your poem had a simple theme
sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat or a flower or rain
you see poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it
just dont let your poems be ordinary
now whos next
keating approaches todds desk
anderson i see you sitting there in agony
come on todd step up
lets put you out of your misery
i i didnt do it
i didnt write a poem
anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing
isnt that right todd
isnt that your worst fear
well i think youre wrong
i think you have something inside of you that is worth a great deal
keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write
i sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world
uncle walt again
now for those of you who dont know a yawp is a loud cry or yell
now todd i would like you to give us a demonstration of a barbaric yawp
you cant yawp sitting down
todd reluctantly stands and follows keating to the front
you gotta get in yawping stance
no not just a yawp
a barbaric yawp
come on louder
no thats a mouse
oh good god boy
yell like a man
there it is
you see you have a barbarian in you after all
todd goes to return to his seat but keating stops him
now you dont get away that easy
keating turns todd around and points out a picture on the wall
the picture of uncle walt up there
what does he remind you of
keating begins to circle around todd
a m m madman
what kind of madman
dont think about it
just answer again
a c crazy madman
no you can do better than that
free up your mind
use your imagination
say the first thing that pops into your head even if its total gibberish
go on go on
uh uh a sweaty toothed madman
good god boy theres a poet in you after all
there close your eyes
close your eyes
now describe what you see
keating puts his hands over todds eyes and they begin to slowly spin around
uh i i close my eyes
uh and this image floats beside me
a sweaty toothed madman
a sweaty toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain
oh thats excellent
now give him action
make him do something
h his hands reach out and choke me
keating removes his hands from todd but todd keeps his eyes closed
and and all the time hes mumbling
whats he mumbling
m mumbling truth
truth is like like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold
the students begin to laugh and todd opens his eyes
keating quickly gestures for him to close them again
forget them forget them
stay with the blanket
tell me about that blanket
y y y you push it stretch it itll never be enough
you kick at it beat it itll never cover any of us
from the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream
todd opens his eyes
the class is silent
then they begin to clap and cheer
whispering to todd dont you forget this
keatings students are playing a soccer game
after they score the winning goal they hoist keating onto their shoulders and carry him away
the boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes
attaboy pittsie inhale deeply
my dad collects a lot of pipes
mines got thirty
your parents collect pipes
oh thats really interesting
come on knox
yeah knox were from the government
were here to help man
heres a picture of chris for you
pitts holds up a centerfold
put that in your pipe and smoke it
thats not funny
knock it off
smoke your pipes
neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand
friend scholar welton men
what is that neil
its a lamp meeks
neil removes the shade from the lamp revealing the shape of a man as the base of the lamp
this is the god of the cave
the god of the cave
charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone
charlie what are you doing
what do you say we start this meeting
y yeah just i need a light
i just gotta got my earplugs
charlie stands up and clears his throat
gentlemen poetrusic by charles dalton
charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone
laughing crying tumbling mumbling
gotta do more
gotta be more
charlie plays more erratic sounds
chaos screaming chaos dreaming
gotta do more
gotta be more
charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone
that was nice
that was great
where did you learn to play like that
my parents made me take the clarinet for years
i love the clarinet
i hated it
the saxophone is more sonorous
knox jumps up
i cant take it anymore
if i dont have chris im gonna kill myself
knoxious youve gotta calm down
thats just my problem
ive been calm all my life
ill do something about that
where are you going
what are you gonna do
im gonna call her
knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave
the others quickly grab their coats to follow him
charlie goes back to playing noise on his saxophone again
knox is making a call from the payphone
knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are all gathered around him
shes gonna hate me
the danburrys will hate me
my parents will kill me
all right goddamn it
even if it kills me
knox puts in another coin and calls again
this is knox overstreet
glad you called
shes glad i called
listen chets parents are going out of town this weekend so hes having a party
would you like to come
would i like to come to a party
um well sure
i ill be there chris
friday night at the danburrys
ill see you
can you believe it
she was gonna call me
she invited me to a party with her
at chet danburrys house
so you dont really think she means youre going with her
well of course not charlie
but thats not the point
thats not the point at all
what is the point
the point charlie is uh yeah
that she was thinking about me
ive only met her once and already shes thinking about me
its gonna happen guys
i feel it
she is going to be mine
knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away and climbs the stairs
the students are standing in a line while cameron pitts and knox are walking in a circle
keating watches as they go around
no grades at stake gentlemen
just take a stroll
after a few moments the three boys begin to march to the same beat
there it is
the other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps
i dont know but ive been told i dont know but ive been told doing poetry is old doing poetry is old mr
nolan looks out at them from his office as keating joins the boys and begins marching with them
left left left right left
left left left right left
the boys come to a halt
thank you gentlemen
if you noticed everyone started off with their own stride their own pace
keating begins walking very slowly
pitts taking his time
he knew hell get there one day
cameron you could see him thinking is this right
it might be right
it might be right
i know that
i dont know
keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward
overstreet driven by deeper force
we know that
now i didnt bring them up here to ridicule them
i brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others
now those of you i see the look in your eyes like i wouldve walked differently
well ask yourselves why you were clapping
now we all have a great need for acceptance
but you must trust that your beliefs are unique your own even though others may think them odd or unpopular even though the herd may go thats baaaaad
robert frost said two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
now i want you to find your own walk right now
your own way of striding pacing
anything you want
whether its proud whether its silly anything
gentlemen the courtyard is yours
the students begin walking about some walking casually others making up silly walks
keating notices that charlie is still leaning up against one of the pillars
you dont have to perform
just make it for yourself
you be joining us
exercising the right not to walk
thank you mr
you just illustrated the point
swim against the stream
nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them
neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices todd sitting off by himself on one of the walkways
whats going on
todays my birthday
is today your birthday
whats you get
my parents gave me this
neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to todd still in its wrappings
isnt this the same desk set yeah yeah
they gave me the same thing as last year
laughing maybe they thought you needed another one
maybe they werent thinking about anything at all
uh the funny thing is about this is i i didnt even like it the first time
todd i think youre underestimating the value of this desk set
neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely
i mean who would want a football or a baseball or or a car
or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one
i mean if if i were ever going to buy a a desk set twice i would probably buy this one both times
in fact its its shape is its rather aerodynamic isnt it
i can feel it
this desk set wants to fly
neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air
todd stands up and neil hands him the desk set
the worlds first unmanned flying desk set
todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it falls to pieces down below
well i wouldnt worry
youll get another one next year
all the boys but knox and charlie are gathered in the cave
to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life
to put to rout all that was not life the boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside
oh my god
is this it
yeah this is it
go ahead go on in
its my cave
watch your step
were not gonna slip are we
gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt
the lights from the boys flashlights play conspicously over glorias chest
tina enters right behind her
meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling
hi you guys

the boys move aside to let the girls in
excuse excuse me

from now on call me nuwanda
tina takes out a tube of red lipstick
charlie takes it from her and puts red marks on each of his cheeks
knox enters the house and looks anxiously about
knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror
chris comes running out from one of the rooms
you made it
chris grabs knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks toward the stairs
ginny danburrys here
i have to go find chet
why dont you go downstairs where everybody is
chris runs up the stairs as knox stares after her
make yourself at home
but i knox stares at a couple kissing passionately
across the room he sees chet and chris dancing
he walks away
knox enters the kitchen walking between several football players to fill up a mug of beer from a keg
hey you mutt sanders brother
bubba this guy look like mutt sanders to you or what
bubba spits ice cubes into the sink
youre his brother
never heard of him
obviously drunk wheres your manners steve
mutt sanders brother we dont even offer him a drink
go have some whiskey pal
bubba hands knox a glass and fills it up
whoa i uh i dont really drink to mutt
the two guys raise their glasses in a toast and knox reluctantly joins them
they each take a big drink
knox rolls his eyes and gasps loosening his tie to try and breathe
now how the hell is old mutt anyway
whats ol mutter been up to huh
i dont really know mutt
to mighty mutt
to mighty mutt
to mighty mutt
they raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest of their glasses
well listen i gotta go find patsy

bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away
hell of a guy your brother mutt
we gonna have a meeting or what
if you guys dont have a meeting how do we know if we wanna join
charlie leans over to tina
shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
thats so sweet
i made that up just for you
the boys laugh and cameron shakes his head
charlie moves over to sit next to gloria
ill write one for you too gloria
she walks in beauty like the night
she walks in beauty like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies
all thats best dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes
theres plenty more where that came from
the room is whirling as knox belches and staggers across the room
he passes chet and several of his friends
he steps over several couples kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch only to be crowded in by another couple who seem oblivious to him
he is about to get up again when he notices chris sleeping next to him on the couch
god help me
knox looks about and then looks back down at chris
knox takes a last swig of his drink and then begins to softly run his fingers over chris hair
he then leans over and kisses her forehead
across the room bubba looks over and sees whats going on
its mutt sanders brother
chris rises up from the couch and looks at knox in surprise
knox what and hes feeling up your girl
what are you doing
chet gets up from his chair
what the hell are you doing
now chet i know this looks bad but youve gotta chet throws himself at knox hurling them both to the floor
he then straddles knox and begins to punch at him as knox simply tries to protect himself
youll hurt him
leave him alone
chet stop it
chris manages to haul chet away from knox
knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody nose
chris tries to help him up
knox are you all right
chris get the hell away from him
chet you hurt him
im so sorry
it its okay
chet hauls chris away from knox and then points at him
next time i see you you die
tina passes a bottle of alcohol to neil
go ahead pass it around
cameron motions for neil not to take it but neil takes a swig anyway
there is a moment of awkward silence
me and pitts are working on a hi fi system
it shouldnt be that hard to uh to put together
uh i might be going to yale
uh uh but i i might not
dont you guys miss having girls around here
thats part of what this club is about
in fact id like to announce i published an article in the school paper in the name of the dead poets
demanding girls be admitted to welton
whispering to meeks so we can all stop beating off
how did you do that
im one of the proofers
i slipped the article in
look uh its its over now
nobody knows who we are
well dont you think theyre gonna figure out who wrote it
theyre gonna come to you and ask to know what the dead poets society is
charlie you had no right to do something like that
its nuwanda cameron
are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say
for all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other
what the hell are we doing
all right but you still shouldnt have done it charlie
this could mean trouble
you dont speak for the club
hey would you not worry about your precious little neck
if they catch me ill tell them i made it up
the professors hurry down the steps lead by an obviously agitated mr
several are carrying newspapers in their hands
the students all rise as they enter
after all the professors have taken their places mr
nolan addresses the students
the students all sit
in this week of weltons honor there appeared a profane and unauthorized article
rather than spend my valuable time ferreting out the guilty persons and let me assure you i will find them im asking any and all students who knows anything about
this article to make themselves known here and now
whoever the guilty persons are this is your only chance to avoid expulsion from this school
the sound of a phone ringing can be heard
the professors look about for its source
charlie picks up a telephone receiver
yes he is
just a moment
charlie stands up holding a phone and bell in his hands
nolan its for you
he says we should have girls at welton
most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake their heads in disbelief
charlie stands with his back to the door as mr
nolan shuts it
nolan then walks around to face charlie
wipe that smirk off your face
if you think mr
dalton that youre the first to try to get thrown out of this school think again
others have had similar notions and have failed just as surely as you will fail
assume the position
charlie sighs and bends over resting his hands on the desk
nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands
count aloud mr
nolan begins to strike charlie with the paddle
what is this dead poets society
i want names
a crowd of students is gathered about as charlie stiffly walks back to his room
you kicked out
so what happened
im to turn everybody in apologize to the school and all will be forgiven
so what are you gonna do
damn it neil
the name is nuwanda
charlie smiles and then shuts his door
keating and mcallister are enjoying tea in the small room off the classroom
nolan knocks on the door and enters
may we have a word mr
keating fixes his tie and follows mr
nolan into the classroom
this was my first classroom john
did you know that
my first desk
didnt know you taught mr
oh long before your time
it was hard giving it up i can tell you
im hearing rumors john about some unorthodox teaching methods in your classroom
im not saying theyve anything to do with the dalton boys outburst
but i dont think i have to warn you boys his age are very impressionable
well your reprimand made quite an impression im sure
what was going on in the courtyard the other day
boys marching clapping in unison
that was an exercise to prove a point
dangers of conformity
well john the curriculum here is set
its proven it works
if you question whats to prevent them from doing the same
i always thought the idea of educating was to learn to think for yourself
at these boys ages
not on your life
prepare them for college and the rest will take care of itself
charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded around him
he hits the bongoes as he mimes nolans footsteps
he started walking around towards my left
assume the position mr
the door opens and keating walks in
many of the boys get up from their seats
its all right gentlemen
that was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today
youre siding with mr
what about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that
sucking the marrow out of life doesnt mean choking on the bone
sure theres a time for daring and theres a time for caution and a wise man understands which is called for
but i thought youd like that
you being expelled from school is not daring to me
its stupid cause youll miss some golden opportunities
like if nothing else the opportunity to attend my classes
got it ace
aye aye captain
keep your head about you
that goes for the lot of you
phone call from god
if it had been collect it wouldnt been daring
keating leaves and the boys gather around charlie once again
neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls
neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various actors rehearsing on stage
a smile fills his face
were trying to rehearse okay
a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
i dont hear any excitement about this play
and take her hand
bring her down the stage and stop
and there gentle hermia
the bell rings and students rush down the hall
whats for dinner
spaghetti and meatballs
neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria
save some for me
but room fairy
here comes oberon
neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk
wait a minute
before you say anything please let me ex mr
perry rises from the desk
dont you dare talk back to me
its bad enough that youve wasted your time with this this absurd acting business
but you deliberately deceived me
how how how did you expect to get away with this
who put you up to it
was it this new man
this uh mr
nobody i thought id surprise you
ive gotten all as in every class
did you think i wasnt going to find out
oh my niece is in a play with your son says mrs
no no no i say you must be mistaken
my sons not in a play
you made me a liar of me neil
now tomorrow you go to them and you tell them that youre quitting
no i cant
i have the main part
the performance is tomorrow night
i dont care if the world comes to an end tomorrow night
you are through with that play
is that clear
is that clear
perry goes to leave and then turns around
i made a great many sacrifices to get you here neil and you will not let me down
keating is seated at his desk
he is writing a letter and occasionally looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello
there is a knock at the door
neil enters and closes the door behind him
he appears to be nervous
neil whats up
can i speak to you a minute
neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books
neil picks them up and keating gets up from his seat to help him
get you some tea
keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups
like some milk or sugar in that
gosh they dont give you much room around here
no its part of the monastic oath
they dont want worldly things distracting me from my teaching
keating gives neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats
neil looks at the photo on the desk
shes also in london
makes it a little difficult
how can you stand it
you can go anywhere
you can do anything
how can you stand being here
cause i love teaching
i dont wanna be anywhere else
i just talked to my father
hes making me quit the play at henley hall
actings everything to me
i but he doesnt know
he i can see his point
were not a rich family like charlies and we but hes planning the rest of my life for me and i h hes never asked me what i want
have you ever told your father what you just told me
about your passion for acting
you ever show him that
i cant talk to him this way
then youre acting for him too
youre playing the part of the dutiful son
i know this sounds impossible but you have to talk to him
you have to show him who you are what your heart is
i know what hell say
hell tell me that actings a whim and i should forget it
that how theyre counting on me
hell just tell me to put it out of my mind for my own good
you are not an indentured servant
if its not a whim for you you prove it to him by your conviction and your passion
you show him that and if he still doesnt believe you well by then youll be out of school and you can do anything you want
a tear falls down neils cheek and he wipes it away
what about the play
the shows tomorrow night
well you have to talk to him before tomorrow night
isnt there an easier way
no youre not
knox exits one of the doors
the ground is covered with a thick layer of snow
he looks around to see if anyone is about and then hurries over to the bike rack
grabbing one of the bikes he hurries off
a crowd of students come in from the cold
knox pushes his way through them carrying a handful of wildflowers
he begins searching for chris
he approaches a girl with hair similar to chris and turns her around only to realize that its not her
do you know where she is
um i think shes in room
the girl points down the hallway and knox sets off in that direction
chris is at her locker talking to a friend
she just closes her locker as she notices knox coming towards her
she turns away
knox what are you doing here
i came to apologize for the other night
i brought you these and a poem i wrote for you
chris pulls him aside out of the main hallway
knox dont you know that if chet finds you here hell kill you
i cant care
i love you chris
knox youre crazy
look i acted like a jerk and i know it
please accept these
no i i cant
chris walks away
the school bell rings and she enters her classroom closing the door behind her
undaunted knox follows opening the door and standing before her desk
knox i dont believe this
all im asking you to do is listen
as knox begins to read his poem the classroom grows quiet as everyone stops to listen
the heavens made a girl named chris with hair and skin of gold
to touch her would be paradise
chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment
knox sneaks in through a side door
he snatches a slice of toast from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret
he then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away
the school bell rings and knox pushes his way up the stairs past the slower students
at the top he joins the other boys where they are grabbing their books
get out of here
cameron you fool
charlie notices knox and grabs his jacket
hey howd it go
did you read it to her
the boys begin to get all excited but charlie shushes them
whatd she say
what do you mean nothing
but i did it
knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him
what did she say
i know she had to say something
come here knox
seize the day
keating walks from the front of the classroom to neils desk
neil is the only student remaining in the class
did you talk to your father
uh he didnt like it one bit but at least hes letting me stay in the play
he wont be able to make make it
hes in chicago
but uh i think hes gonna let me stay with acting
you told him what you told me
he wasnt happy
but hell be gone at least four days
i dont think hell make the show but i think hell let me stay with it

neil picks up his books and leaves
the boys are grooming themselves in front of the mirrors
henley hall here i come

cameron runs a comb through his hair and todd tries to mess it up
come on todd
im trying to fix this
come on nuwanda
youre gonna miss neils entrance
he said something about getting red before we left
what does that mean
i uh well you know charlie
one of the stalls opens and charlies hand emerges holding a small brush and a bottle of red paint
so charlie whats this getting red bit
charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt painted down his chest
w what is that
its an indian warrior symbol for virility
makes me feel potent like it can drive girls crazy
charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave
oh come on charlie
the girls are waiting
the boys are walking down the hall to leave
cameron stops and stares
the other boys notice and stop as well
charlie softly whistles at chris standing by the door
knox stares at her in surprise chris
knox leaves the other boys to join her
what are you doing here
gentlemen lets go
go ahead guys

yeah come on guys
charlie hustles the boys away
meeks remains staring at her
charlie returns to drag him away
chris you cant be in here
i if they catch you were both gonna be in big trouble
oh but its fine knox shushes her and leads her out the door
snow is lightly falling as chris and knox walk outside
its fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me
i didnt mean to make a fool out of you
well you did
chet found out
and it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you
knox you have got to stop this stuff
i cant chris

knox you say that over and over

keating calls out from a nearby car
will you be joining us mr

and then if you dont want to see me again i swear ill bow out
you know what would happen if chet found out
he wont know anything
well sit in the back and sneak away as soon as its over
and i suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it
dead poets honor
what is that
chris walks away from him and then turns to face him
you are so infuriating
chris gestures for knox to follow her
charlie does a little twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her
they walk away
the audience is packed
the stage is set up to resemble a forest and lights dance about it
from behind a bush neil emerges wearing a crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands
in the audience charlie emerges from his seat all excited
hey there he is
cameron shoves him back into his seat
on stage neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges similarly clad but with flowers in her hair
neil sneaks over to the girl
either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite calld robin goodfellow thou speakst aright in the audience chris and knox enter
and are shown to seats
i am that merry wanderer of the night
i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs
neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossips bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i
bob and on her witherd dewlap pour the ale
the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale in the audience charlie leans over towards keating
whispering hes good
hes really good
keating gives a thumbs up
sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold
their hips and laugh and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there
but room fairy
here comes oberon
and here my mistress
would that he were gone
the two actors hide behind the trees lifting their twig covered hands to hide themselves
two other actors are onstage
then by your side no bed room me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride if
hermia meant to say lysander lied
but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid and good night
sweet friend thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end
neil is watching the actors from the wing
he glances out at the audience and sees his father enter the back of the theater
neil backs away into the shadows
amen amen to that fair prayer say i the director breaks neil out of his thoughts
thats your cue neil
come on neil
heres your crown
neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her
on stage neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while fairies dance about
in the audience knox takes chris hand in his
the stage is dark
a spotlight comes on to reveal neil with his back to the audience
he slowly turns around to face the audience and his father
if we shadows have offended neil directs his eyes at his father who stills stands at the back of the theater
think but this and all is mended that you have but slumberd here while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend and as i am an honest puck if
we have unearned luck now to scape the serpents tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call so good night unto you all
give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends
neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to applaud enthusiastically
behind the curtain numerous people congratulate neil as they line up for the curtain call
the curtains open
charlie and the other boys rise to their feet followed quickly by the rest of the audience
the actors bow to continued applause
the actors push neil forward and he takes a second bow
the curtain closes again and neil turns around letting out an excited sigh
various actors continue to congratulate him
neil lets out a yell as he walks offstage
in the audience while others are leaving mr
perry approaches a woman
excuse me im neils father
i need to see him
backstage the woman approaches neil
neil your father
hes neil nods in agreement
what did you think
really i thought you were all just wonderful
neil emerges from the curtains carrying his costume
the theater is nearly empty now except for mr
perry standing at the back
neil smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears
perry pushes his way through the crowd of people with neil close behind
the boys notice neil and try to dtop him to talk
neil neil you were great
i cant guys
outside of the crowd keating manages to catch up to neil
he takes hold of neils coat
you have the gift
what a performance you left even me speechless
you have to stay with mr
perry returns from his car and shoves neil aside
get in the car
keating you stay away from my son
perry come on
dont make it any worse than it is
neil and mr
perry get into their car and drive away
keating stares after them
is it okay if we walk back
charlie motions todd to follow
the boys leave and keating continues to stare after the car wiping the falling snow from his face
a photo of neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray
perry watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down
perry walks in with neil close behind him
neil sits down beside the desk while mr
perry remains standing
were trying very hard to understand why it is that you insist on defying us
whatever the reason were not gonna let you ruin your life
tomorrow im withdrawing you from welton and enrolling you in braden military school
youre going to harvard and youre gonna be a doctor
but thats ten more years
father thats a lifetime
oh stop it
dont be so dramatic
you make it sound like a prison term
you dont understand neil
you have opportunities that i never even dreamt of and i am not going to let you waste them
neil rises to his feet
ive got to tell you what i feel
perry stands up
weve been so worried about what
tell me what you feel
what is it
neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says nothing
is it more of this this acting business
because you can forget that
neil sits back down dejectedly
well then lets go to bed
perry pauses on her way out and kneels behind neil
i was good
i was really good
perry nods slightly
go on get some sleep
perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her husband
perry removes his robe and slippers before getting in to bed
perry begins to cry as he turns out the light
its all right
its going to be all right
neils pyjamas bathrobe towel and shaving kit are all neatly laid out on his bed
neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then removes his coat and shirt
he walks over to the windows and opens them taking several deep breaths
he places the crown of twigs on his head and then closes his eyes slowly letting his head fall to his chest
a door opens and neil emerges slowly walking down the stairs as if in a trance
neil holds a key in his hands
he unlocks a drawer in his fathers desk and pulls out a pistol wrapped in cloth
perry jerks up out of bed startled and breathing fast
what was that
perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed putting on his robe and slippers
what is it
perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on neils door
he opens the door and goes inside
perry notices the open window
tom what is it
perry continues to look through the house continuing downstairs
perry notices the door to his study is ajar
ill look outside
perry flicks the light on but sees nothing
then he smells something
looking closer he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from behind his desk
as he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the floor and neils outstretched hand
perry crouches down by his son
oh my god
perry enters the room and sees her son
oh my son
hes all right
my poor son
crying hysterically hes all right
hes all right
hes all right
hes all right
hes all right
hes all right
perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her
todd is sleeping
charlie reaches across to wake him
tears are running down his face
todd still half asleep tries to shrug him off
todd opens his eyes and sees charlies face what is it
todd looks over to see pitts meeks and knox by the door
it is a snowy overcast morning
todd walks through the snow
he has his coat on over his pyjamas
the other boys follow closely behind him as he walks down towards the water
he stops and stares out at the snow covered surroundings
its so beautiful
todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees vomiting into the snow
the other boys huddle around him hugging him
its okay todd
its all right todd
todd its okay
its okay todd
its all right
charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes todds mouth with it
he wouldnt he wouldnt have done it
you cant explain it todd
it was his father
he wouldnt have left us
its because he he wouldnt have
his dad was his his father did it
his father killed him
he made him do it
you cant explain it todd
todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill slipping and falling in the snow
leave him be
the boys watch as todd runs down towards the dock by the river yelling and crying
he finally seems to regain control of himself and walks in silence out onto the dock
keating sits by himself at his desk
after a moment he gets up and walks over to neils desk
opening it he finds his copy of five centuries of verse and flips through the first few pages
sitting down at the desk he returns to the opening page reading the opening verse written there
keating begins to sob then closes the book
a church service is going on
the boys have joined in the other students in a hymn
charlie is the only one not singing
he stares off into nothingness
singing all my life thy light shall surely follow me and in gods house forevermore my dwelling place shall be amen
nolan stands at the pulpit with the rest of the professors seated behind him
the death of neil perry is a tragedy
he was a fine student
one of weltons best
and he will be missed
weve contacted each of your parents to explain the situation
naturally theyre all quite concerned
at the request of neils family i intend to conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter
your complete cooperation is expected
the boys except cameron are sitting about the cluttered room waiting
charlie lights a cigarette
you told him about this meeting
thats it guys

how do you mean
camerons a fink
hes in nolans office right now finking
the club pittsie
think about it
the board of directors the trustees and mr
do you think for one moment theyre gonna let this thing just blow over
schools go down because of things like this
they need a scapegoat
the door opens
all the boys except charlie hurry to put their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away
a light comes on and cameron enters
whats going on guys
you finked didnt you cameron
charlie gets up and approaches cameron tossing his cigarette away
i didnt know what the hell youre talking about
you told nolan everything about the club is what im talking about
look in case you hadnt heard dalton theres something called an honor code at this school all right
if a teacher asks you a question you tell the truth or youre expelled
you little charlie lunges at cameron but knox and meeks hold him back
hes a rat
hes in it up to his eyes so he rattled to save himself
dont touch him charlie
you do and youre out
im out anyway
you dont know that not yet
hes right there charlie
and if you guys are smart you will do exactly what i did and cooperate
theyre not after us

keating of course
the captain himself
i mean you guys didnt really think he could avoid responsibility did you
keating responsible for neil
is that what theyre saying
well who else do you think dumb ass
keating put us up to all this crap didnt he
if he wasnt for mr
keating neil would be cozied up in his room right now studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor
that is not true cameron
you know that
he didnt put us to anything
neil loved acting
believe what you want but i say let keating fry
i mean why ruin our lives
charlie lunges at cameron again and punches him in the face
cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull charlie away
cameron lifts a hand to his bloody nose
you just signed your expulsion papers nuwanda
cameron rises to his feet
and if the rest of you are smart youll do exactly what i did
they know everything anyway
you cant save keating but you can save yourselves
cameron walks away closing the door behind him
todd looks out the window and watches as hager escorts meeks back to the dorm
inside the room neils bed has been stripped of all its bedding
meeks walks slowly to his room
hager remains standing at the end of the hallway
knox emerges from his room and goes to joing hager
he gives a thumbs up to todd as he passes his door
once he leaves with hager todd goes over to meeks door
i have to study
what happened to nuwanda
whatd you tell em
nothing they didnt already know
todd is lead up the steps to mr
nolans office by hager
todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite mr
the door closes behind todd
he remains standing not knowing what to do
have a seat mr
todd sits down next to his parents
anderson i think weve pretty well put together whats happened here
you do admit to being a part of this dead poets society
todd says nothing
answer him todd
nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him before removing his glasses once more
i have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings
it describes how your teacher mr
keating encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self indulgent behavior
it describes how mr
keating both in and out of the classroom encouraged neil perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of neils
it was mr
keatings blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to neil perrys death
nolan motions to todds father who passes along a sheet of paper to todd
read that document carefully todd
todd looks at the paper which already contains the signatures of the other four boys
if youve nothing to add or amend sign it
whats gonna happen to mr
ive had enough
sign the paper todd
nolan holds out a pen for todd to take
mcallister leads his students textbooks in hand through the snow outside the classrooms
mcallister grass is gramen or herba
lapis is stone
the entire building is aedificium
keating looks out from his office window
mcallister pauses and looks up at keating giving him a brief wave
keating waves back
keating laughs slightly as he watches mcallister from the window
inside all his belongings have been packed up
the students are all seated at their desks in silence
everyone looks as the door opens
they quickly stand as mr
nolan enters the room
the students sit once again as mr
nolan walks to the front of the room
ill be teaching this class through exams
well find a permanent english teacher during the break
who will tell me where you are in the pritchard textbook
uh in the in the pr i cant hear you mr
in the in the in the pritchard
kindly inform me mr
we skipped around a lot sir
we covered the romantics and some of the chapters on post civil war literature
what about the realists
i believe we skipped most of that sir
all right then well start over
what is poetry
there is a knock at the classroom door
the students look back as the door opens
they quickly turn away when hey see it is keating
i came for my personals
should i come back after class
get them now mr
gentlemen turn to page of the introduction
cameron read aloud the excellent essay by dr
pritchard on understanding poetry
todd slowly closes his book
keating opens the door to the tiny room off the classroom
that page has been ripped out sir
well borrow somebody elses book
theyre all ripped out sir
what do you mean theyre all ripped out
sir we uh never mind
nolan takes his own book over to camerons desk and then slaps the open page
as cameron begins to read keating looks out at todd as he puts his scarf on
todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away
understanding poetry by dr
j evans pritchard ph
to fully understand poetry we must first be fluent with its meter rhyme and figures of speech then ask two questions how artfully has the objective of the poem been
the door squeaks as keating shuts it behind him
how important is that objective
question rates the poems perfection question rates its importance
and once these questions have been answered determining the poems greatness becomes a relatively simple matter
if the poems score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph keating passes by todd and the others and gets to the back of the classroom before
todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him
they made everybody sign it
nolan gets up from his desk and approaches todd
you gotta believe me
i do believe you todd
but it wasnt his fault
sit down mr
todd reluctantly returns to his seat
one more outburst from you or anyone else and youre out of this school
keating hesitates at the back of the classroom
i said leave mr
keating slowly turns and heads to the door
as he opens it todd stands upon his desk and turns to keating
sit down mr
keating pauses at the door and looks back at todd on his desk
do you hear me
this is your final warning anderson
how dare you
do you hear me
after a moment of indecision knox climbs up onto his desk
overstreet i warn you
pitts climbs up onto his desk followed by several others including meeks
all of you
i want you seated
more students stand on their desks until half the class is standing
all of you down
i want you seated
do you hear me
keating stands in the doorway staring up at the boys in wonder
a smile comes to his face
thank you boys
