written by william monahan based on infernal affairs i dont want to be a product of my environment
i want my environment to be a product
costellos profile passes in a dark room
years ago we had the church
that was only a way of saying we had each other
the knights of columbus were head breakers
they took over their piece of the city
we wont be here long
this isnt where costello ends up
its where he began
liquor stores with shamrocked signs
men fishing near castle island
catholic schoolkids playing in an asphalted schoolyard
twenty years after an irishman couldnt get a job we had the presidency
thats what the niggers dont realize
if i got one thing against the black chaps its this
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
costello comes in
the shop is one that sells papers sundries fountain drinks
and fronts a bookie operation
leaning over cluttered counter dont make me have to come down here again
wont happen again mr
the frightened proprietor hands over money
fifty bucks a hundred doesnt matter
costello is never the threatener
his demeanor is gentle philosophical
almost a shrinks probing bedside manner
he has great interest in the world as he moves through it
as if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis
young colin looks up
close on his eyes
he is fourteen or fifteen but small for his age
costello eyes the proprietors teenage daughter working behind the counter
he takes a propane lighter and strangely pays for it the proprietor startled and waits for change
he lights a more cigarette with the lighter
carmens developing into a fine young lady
you should be proud
you get your period yet carmen
the proprietor is uneasy
costello turns to young colin about staring at the local hero
costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes
you johnny sullivans kid
you live with your grandmother
costello tells the proprietor to takes three loaves of bread and some soup off the shelves and puts them in colins bag
get him three loaves of bread
and a couple of half gallons of milk
and some soup
he goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag
costello turns to colin
do you like comic books
he adds a couple of comic books
when the proprietor looks at him he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half
you do good in school
young colin nods holding the big bag of loot
i did good in school
they call that a paradox
he gives some money to carmen
buy yourself some makeup
keep the change
looks intently at colin to see if he gets it
you ever want to earn a little extra money you come by l street
you know where i am on l street
colin nods everybody does
he pushes out with the bags of groceries
the proprietor can do shit about it
young costello watches young colin go off down a slummy street
young colin the good boy the very good boy is serving at a funeral mass
various views of the church
stained glass light
the altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense
to you o lord we commend the soul of alphonsus your servant in the sight of this world he is now dead in your sight may he live forever
forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting peace
close on colins face
may the angels lead you into paradise may the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the holy city the new and eternal jerusalem
a liturgical bell tings
costello is talking informally we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk the shadowy pacing
useful young men
young colin three years older is among them
church wants you in your place
what sort of man wants to be kept in his place
do this dont do that kneel stand kneel stand
i mean if you go for that sort of thing
young colin the recent altar boy visibly doesnt go for that sort of thing
i dont know what to do for you
a man makes his own way
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
a beat non serviam
him and lucifer
to the room guineas from the north end and down providence tried to tell me what to do
and something maybe happened to them
rose colored dawn
young costello with a pistol executes a man kneeling in the surf
she falls on the body of a man who has just been executed
jeez she fell funny
french moves forward with an axe in his hand
frank you gotta see somebody
they go about their business
young costello walking talking
not continuous with the above
we see that only young colin is present
you decide to be something you can be it
thats what they dont tell you the church
mister french is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass
when i was your age they would say we become cops or criminals
today what im saying to you is this when you are facing a loaded gun
very close on costello holding colins shoulder
whats the difference
ecu colins eyes swerve up
we are now on mature colins eyes eyes
this is how the character transits the age leap
on the unchanging eyes
pull back to reveal police trainees
including barrigan who is included in all colins trainee scenes
colin is in the class wearing a trainees uniform
he has a notebook a pen
the slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole
blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole
the bullet which may expand fragment or tumble then passes through the brain
police trainees on a firing range
as we go along the line we see colin firing dry and then speed changing a clip in a beretta f
he is a perfect trainee
state police trainees standing in a pissing rain a di yelling at them os
colin is staring forward
rain streaming down his face
his opinion on the experience is not decipherable
ad libs sir yes sir
guys we recognize from the previous shots at the state police academy wearing statie t shirts including colin and barrigan are playing rugby against some firefighters
very rough game
the game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger
firefighters are moving away triumphantly
fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire
colin sits on a bench looking at the gold dome of beacon hill
the terraces of fine townhouses
aqueous golden light behind
misty golden beauty
what are you looking at
your father was a janitor and his sons only a cop
not vainglorious but innocently stretching for the idea youre in trouble if youre only anything
dont tell me im looking at the first dickhead american president of the united states
colin doesnt have a great sense of humor but he knows how to pretend that he does
bagpipes and bullshit
line after line of paramilitary looking graduates among them colin
the massachusetts state police has a long tradition of excellence
your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation
as the governor of the commonwealth of massachusetts i am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction honor and integrity
camera swirls around colin as he moves a lone person through the breaking up crowd
other graduates are hugged by family
colin alone comes to the gates of the yard
you are dismissed
the bagpipe band plays minstrel boy
costello and mister french standing by the car
colin walks over to the car
costello gives colin a box
colin flips open the top and then quickly closes it
note the box could contain an eyeball money drugs a picture of colin fucking his school teacher
we will never know
you earned it
yeah no more teachers no more books
a test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents
billy takes up a number two pencil
he is in a room full of trainees far enough along in their traineeship that their hair has grown in
a clock ticks sweep hand coming around
billys eyes on it
billy takes the test marking multiple choice answers swiftly while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying to read the questions
billy wearing a state police sweatshirt is running alongside brown a black trainee with specs
she tells me you never finish anything
puff puff you finish the police course you get taken care of again baby
puff puff so after graduation puff puff i get a blowjob again
your mom must be a wonderful woman
look at it this way youre a black guy in boston
you dont need any help from me to be completely fucked
ways to get ahead though man ways to get ahead
exasperated by this to where
yeah brown is left thinking about this
billy with other trainees is being braced by a di
this is not the regular police
this is the state police
your training will illustrate the difference
whats the difference
sotto voce to brown rage issues and lower median iq
you say something
sir i was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police sir
were not superior were the best
sir yes sir
billy in glasses and ear protectors waiting for the target
go from the gun to
colin four years a veteran of the gang unit is on the job on a raid clearing rooms part of a team working with massive aggression
he moves through a door
a sad sack of shit is throwing drugs out a window
calling to other cops douchebag
cops enter past colin and pigpile the man
colin is chewing gum all testosterone and aggression glad to be a cop
the smartest guy in the room
billy fires and changes clips
a black windowed modern police building beetling over a plaza
older boston reflected in the featureless glass
the boston of this film is almost futuristic
colin looks up at the building with great intensity
he puts on his sunglasses and walks towards the door
colin in civvies a very good suit stands at suave attention before captain queenan a mild and scholarly man who might as well be a jesuit history teacher
congratulations on passing the detective exam and welcome to the special investigation unit
tonelessly whoop di fuckin do
we wont be working directly together youll be working for captain ellerby but i like to see everybody
contemplating him youre a worker you rise fast
like a twelve year olds dick
alt like a turd in the pool
thank you sergeant
to queenan thank you sir
he turns to go
as colin leaves the office looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine its not as if he isnt pleased by recognition and its not as if he wont get
revenge on dignam he barely glances and does not actually see the trainee sitting off to one side
he sees polished brogues and walks on
whispering joyful in love with colin congratulations
as colin leaves she moderates her expression and coldly you can go in there now
billy looks up
he has not seen colin and colin has not seen him
he has his interview on his mind
billy stands at attention
the picture of a spit and polish trainee
you can sit
billy has no idea why he is in this room with the brass
dignam is staring at him aggressively with contempt stirring his coffee
dignam is more intelligent than he seems
do you know what we do here
billy doesnt want to answer unless he can answer correctly
sir yes sir i have an idea
whoa lets say you have no idea and leave it there
if you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do
we would be cunts
are you calling us cunts
billy wouldnt normally take crap from this guy but he does
hes openly intrigued by the situation
dignam is staring at him
billy looks evenly at queenan
not looking up from papers staff sergeant dignam has a style of his own
im afraid we all have to deal with it
getting to business hard you have family connections down in southie
through your father
tell us about your uncle jackie
uncle jackie was a carpet layer for jordan marsh
uncle jackie was a small time bookie who tended bar at the vets in somerville
he got popped by nicastro in
they found his body out by the airport
billy says slowly thats right
tightly i remember his funeral
cruelly closed casket
you tell anybody at deerfield that is before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair you had an uncle met his demise like
billy says nothing
i got a question
how fucked up are you
colin in his good suit moves along the hall
he owns the building
he looks into offices
he is looking at his future
from one room barrigan still working in uniform gives him the thumbs up
colin gets a coffee
he looks at a secretarys ass
caught at it he smiles beautifully
she smiles back
what you got
with admiration and envy staff sergeant
in four years youre a sergeant
what a country
after a beat perfect
meaning to some extent perfect for a dick like you
this is how friends come apart
barrigan is unable to continue his pose of congratulation
colin close on colin is on to him
i dont mind going it alone
if you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself
this isnt somewhere
i know youre a worker
i might be able to do something for you
you got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like youre gonna invade poland
billy is still at attention
dignam going with wet thumb through papers
lets look at the rest of the family tree
your maggot uncle tommy costigan hes another goof got busted selling guns to federal officers
among many many many other departures from ah normative behavior
queenan is inspecting billy watching his reactions
specs catching light
whats this got to do with me
why are you pretending to be a cop
colin is eyeing a woman cop across the table
she smiles at him and lowers her eyes
at the end of the table this unit is new and you are the newest members of it
you have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude
this is an elite unit
our job is to smash or at least marginally disrupt he gets the laugh he expected organized crime in this city by our own efforts and by enhanced cooperation with
the fbi represented here by agent frank lazio show the deeply unreliable dandy lazio and we will do it
and by organized crime in this city
you know who we mean
surveillance photos come up
costello in sunglasses standing in front of the autobody shop
costello standing with uncle clicking the button thats jackie costigan
thats an old picture
jackie met his demise
last known photograph
more recent photos
fitzy delahunt french all photographed with costello
coming out of buildings talking on the street getting into cars
costello uses three key guys
off the boat psycho
lives in brockton with his mother who looks like shes straight out of going my way
theres delahunt muscle and heres french
the number one
but of course the rock star is
you know who a picture of costello comes up
colin looks at it
in the mug shot costello is serene untouchable legally untouchable at the heart
hes like a hilarious devil
weve done a briefing book
i want to have any and all ideas so i can pass them off as my own
laughter a long beat do your jobs and you will rise fast
youre in the best position in the department
lets go to work
the recruits disperse into a glittering modern office
colin in his flash suit gets a cup of coffee
he looks at the briefing book
he opens to a picture of costello
dignam still working billy
your old man was a hump from southie
baggage handler at the airport
familys all criminals except your old man
and one priest
since you seem to know everything
i aint sure about him either
alt last i heard he was happily married to a year old boy and living on a beach in thailand
familys dug into the southie projects like ticks
lifers down there
three decker men at best
you grew up however up the north shore
la di fuckin da
dignam leans over billy
you were kind of a double kid i bet right
one kid with your old man
one kid with your mother
upper middle class in the week and then dropping your rs and hanging in the southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends
i got that right
billy opened up expertly and crudely stares with contained hatred
you have different accents
you did didnt you
you little fuckin snake
you were different fuckin people
you a psychiatrist
if i was id ask you why youre a statie making thirty grand a year
and i think if i were sigmund fucking freud himself i wouldnt get an answer
so tell me whats a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the staties
families are always rising or falling in america
am i right
appreciative kindly looking up from his papers who said that
dignam although he knows perfectly well who hawthorne is makes a fart noise with his mouth
billy looks at him with an im going to kill you expression which is not without wit and which dignam seems to admire
whats the matter smartass
you dont know any fuckin shakespeare
we have a question
you want to be a cop or do you want to appear to be a cop
its an honest question
lot of guys want to appear to be cops
pretend theyre on tv
a lot of em just want to slam a niggers head through a plate glass window
im all set without your personal job application sergeant
after a we got a live one glance at queenan what the fuck did you say to me trainee
billy looks at him and then looks forward
sir with all due respect sir what is it you want from me
hey asshole he cant help you
i know what you are and what you arent
im the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth
im gonna help you understand something youre no fuckin cop
billy looks at queenan we deal in deceptions here
but what we dont deal with is self deception
in five years you might be anything else in the world but you wont be a massachusetts state trooper
you sure of that
im sure of that
looking up from his papers you dont have much family
deciding this on the spot i dont have any family
a trolley goes past
hospital hill above the trolley line is sinister quiet
hospital at the top like a malign fortress above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums
billy crosses from the trolley stop desperately an angry young man at his lifes turning point
billys mother lies as if floating in her bed
a bald head on a barely dented pillow
she is a cancer patient in a coma weighing possibly lbs
gasping for air
her airways are cleared with a suction tube
billy sits watching as the tube goes in
billy sits looking at her
billy is leaning against a wall
a maternal wasp uncle a not bright guy pretensions rather than status speaks briefly to a doctor further along the hall then approaches billy hands in the pocket of a
whats this i hear from stephanie about you becoming a policeman
you mean stephanie who was the only one who came to my fathers funeral
nothing much to it uncle edward
are you trying to prove something to the family
when you say family what do you mean
you always question everything dont you
yeah well maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time
am i an asshole
are my kids a mess
is my wife a money grubbing whore
those are questions
the uncle starts to leave have i been good to my dying sister or am i just pretending to be
hes stung the uncle too late now right
do you need some money for the funeral
the uncle moves away bends to get his overcoat
when my mother dies we dont have any connection
you got it
fly from the hospital to a realtor switches on lights
an empty flash apartment above the parisian rooftops of beacon hill
a view of the dome
more than youd think a cop could afford
we see as colin does beyond his reflection in the glass the state house this is it
youve got high ceilings parquet floors
theres a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues
not a very good one
uneasy so youre a policeman
like something he is used to reciting im a state police detective
wondering where he gets his money from state police detective
you a married state police detective
coming out of his reverie and coldly no
oh cuz its big and i wondered if a cop
i have a cosigner
you intend to have a housemate
give me the fuckin papers
billy sits on a bench looking out over the whole city
it is the best view of boston never seen in a film
hes smoking a cigarette making his decision
continuation of the interview
so what do i do
during the war churchill used river mines
hed float them down the rivers into germany
theyd either hit something or not
thats what well use you for
ill float you down the river
the rest will happen
or it wont
by the way this isnt police work for peanuts
theres money behind this operation
you wont be paid as a cop but there is a bonus involved
queenan writes on a slip of paper and hands it to billy
billy looks up from the paper impressed
luck of the irish
all that and youre still young enough to fuck undergraduates
we cant conceal that youve been a trainee
youll be convicted of a crime
were thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense
given your nature
youll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that its no set up
youll be on probation
the whole nine yards
i need you pal
youve already pretended to be a costigan from south boston
billy looks up with a glazed insolence
in one beat he is not a scared trainee but a smart criminal
do it again
billy throws down his cigarette
he has decided
priests cassock whipping in the wind
a few mourners shabby genteel ladies contemporaries of his mother but billy seems to have no real connection with any of them
billy is alone at the grave
he looks at the tags on wind blown wreaths
one gives him pause
under a picture of the virgin it reads heaven holds the faithful departed and is signed f
a cell door closes
looking like a real criminal
not a pretend one
frightened and resolute at once
billy is in a holding tank
colin in a bathrobe leans on the rail and looks at boston
the gold dome visible
colin drinks coffee
not satisfied worried
billy naked holds his clothes in a bundle
being processed out of jail
beside him another guy furtive gruff not trying to be friendly
youre bill costigan
who wants to know
i know a sean costigan
connected but not too bright billy looks at him with an only i can insult my cousin look no offense
billy gets his clothes
on the wall is a rogues gallery of costello and all his primary guys
mister french delahunt fitzy
colin and others sitting listening
colin reading a paper boston herald which may or may not have the headline case dropped against drugs cadet featuring a picture of billy looks up as sgt
dignam comes in
sorry im late
staff sergeant dignam is our liaison with the undercover section
their undercover work is extensive
hes here to give us his report
theyre out there my people
theyre like the fuckin indians
youre not gonna see them
youre not gonna hear about them except through me or captain queenan
you will not ever know the identity of undercover people
this shit hole unfortunately has more fuckin leaks than the iraqi navy
im tired from fucking your wife
hows your mother
shes tired from fucking my father
opens a file ok today girls what i got for you is microprocessors
lazio the fed comes in and sits down
with folders pencil
somebody as you may already know stole one hundred microprocessors from the mass processor corp out route
theyre the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet
thats what they do out there on americas technology highway
worth a hundred grand apiece
guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on tuesday has a ticket booked for florida on wednesday but on thursday he
gets found in a dumpster
you know where this dirt ball started his life
what was his name
the ah departed
got the job with a forged umass transcript
umass boston which incidentally happens to be in
who forged your transcript dickhead
i know that guy
his father runs the hibernian liquor mart
we are not here to solve the case of the dead scumbag
we are here to nail costello
colin stands down embarrassed
we got a guy says that he hears costello is moving the processors to china
that he set up the whole fuckin job and popped kennefick
lazio is writing lawyerish
you dont want to miss it if costello takes a dump
wed miss less if your informants were available to us and of course to the fbi bureau
without asking for details do you have anyone in with costello presently
maybe fuck yourself
my theory on feds is theyre like mushrooms
feed em shit and keep in the dark
you girls have a nice day
billy steps off a bus at a corner
he goes up to a house and knocks on the door
a southie hag answers
on an oxygen cylinder smoking
his aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely
billy takes it like the imposter he is
but he might well love his aunt
good to see you
good to see you
billy is eating soup
they said you were in the staties i couldnt believe it
i got kicked out about four months ago
it was in the papers
sean is a villain leaning in a doorway
bad tie he takes it off
he has been at a funeral

i brought your mother some pictures of my father
they are on the table
my mother had them
my mothers dead

sean opens the fridge opens a beer and hands it to billy
he opens one for himself

sean nods and nods
you know what we usually say at these moments

billy is waiting
sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car
billy puts the car in gear
fuckin ricans think they know everything
if they knew shit they wouldnt be puerto ricans
he has a paper bag full of money
he opens a beer
high as a kite double the money double the fun
confusing his tv jingles cinnamon toasty apple bun
r is for ricans
p is for pigs
they drive past a bpd cruiser
sean hides his beer
i cant stop drinkin
why would you even think of stopping drinking
he dont like it
he dont like drinkin
he dont like fightin
sean looks sad he says stay out of the bars
you know were not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin worcester
god says as far as youre concerned
sean beyond wasted is talking to some people including mister french
a table wet with spilled beer
not a cop
he got out of the joint three weeks ago
he talks like his shit dont stink but hes good people
i knew his father
i liked his uncle jackie better
uncle jackie was excellent
they solemnly toast uncle jackie and his fate among the fucking guineas
across the crowded room billy is ordering at the bar
a cranberry juice
its a natural diuretic
my girlfriend drinks it when she got her period
to billy you got your period
billy glances over at the table where mister french sits with sean and then smashes his glass into the face of the well dressed scumbag
he stands waiting for the scumbag to get up he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by mister french
popped into a pay phone hard
the pay phone comes off the hook
get your hands off me
do you know me
billy shakes his head no
im the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you dont
thats not quite a guy you cant hit but its almost a guy you cant hit so im fucking ruling on it right now that you dont hit him understand

the well dressed scumbag is bleeding incredulous
mister french takes him by the shoulder
sotto voce to well thats jackies nephew
french demolishes him with body blows
get the fuck out of here
colin and barrigan who colin has moved to plain clothes stand at the door talking or trying to talk with a fearful mrs kennefick
mrs kennefick looks like she starts drinking whiskey at in the morning
kennefick myles and i were in school together
myles was behind me in school but i knew him
i will get those responsible
dont you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him
if he was killed he probably did something wrong
you dont mean robbery do you mrs kennefick
thats not what you think he did wrong
kennefick notices costello driving by
costello and gwen are in the car
gwen is dressed like jackie o
wave to your girlfriend
i mean fuck yourself
she slams the door
as colin walks away from the door he notices the tail a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery van
you get that
allegedly or fuck yourself
welcome to the neighborhood
french pulls up to a light
costello blows a red light and leaves the tail including the surveillance van which we will see again behind him in a snarl of traffic
cut em here
french steps on it and blows through the light leaving the follow cars behind
colin boards with a bunch of other cops and workers
on board directly beside him is madolyn
colins age beautiful wearing a business suit
she has a thick stack of medical looking files
shes a psychiatrist on contract to the commonwealth of massachusetts
she does probation counselling work with violent offenders and also sees policemen
making a house call
have i seen you professionally
i know what you do
i know who you are
madolyn nods and then because this is a relatively sensitive subject ignores colin but she is visibly attracted by him
when guys have to use their service revolvers in the course of duty they get to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot
oh i know how it goes
youre a mental health professional
laughing i have an appointment on this floor
the door opens
theyre all fuckin crazy on that floor
points up im one floor up
oh fancy policeman

after she steps out he prevents the door from closing
yeah im also getting my law degree
they dont run harvard law at night last time i checked

before i went to fucking suffolk
i went to u mass
i wasnt insulting you
well i thought you were and for that you have to take me to dinner
maybe you could shoot someone and id have to see you professionally
whatever it takes
ill stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you
madolyn hands him a card
i dont need a card im a detective
he takes the card
im only joking
nice to meet you
the doors close
the elevator takes him up
he takes out his cellphone as if hes forgotten something
as the doors open the signal bars light up and the phone rings
walking voice low i didnt know about your tail until i saw it myself
i couldnt call i had the other guy with me
blue sedan and a white delivery van fucked up with graffiti on the side
the van is audio surveillance
ok have a nice day
the same shop in which young costello talked to young colin all those years ago
two italians are in the shop talking hard to the pakistani proprietor singh
these are hard guys but theyre not being threatening just persistent the guy does owe them money
billy is finishing his breakfast
he goes over
the two guineas are amazed
dialog on separate document
billy is finishing his breakfast
he goes over
you guys from providence
the guineas look at him
the younger one moves to intervene
billy smiles and destroys them both
the biggest beatdown in gangster movie history and obviously thats saying something
in the course of the beat down billy breaks his left hand a boxers fracture
billy stands over his victims breathing hard holding his broken hand
what have you done to my place
get out of here
billy unlit cigarette in his mouth is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor
in another life he might have dated her
not in this one
a romantic restaurant
the best boston has which isnt saying much but whatever
colin looking great a man on the rise
madolyn in pearls also looking great
but maybe the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south
you also do probation work right
i see violent offenders
thats one way to look at it
colin wonders if shes breaking his balls
a dessert arrives some towering japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy spines sitting in a pool of sauce
colin looks at it fork poised
madolyn looks at it
he looks up at her
that have this and they dont have duck lorange
madolyn smiles she likes him
even with the dinner long bitterness over the duck lorange
was your dinner ok
holding balloon of inappropriate wine oh the lobster was excellent
i just thought french restaurant
the look at the dessert
im waiting for you to make your move
i dont know what youre gonna do but if it moves im going to arrest it shoot it
colin sees his shot hes got her laughing
whats it like having people find themselves
all day long people finding themselves
does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room
why does that make you uncomfortable
colin stares at her
water glass nearly goes over
you know what freud said about the irish
yes i do
if you actually do ill see you again
who says i want to see you again
concerned perhaps unexpectedly dont you
yes course i do
a beat what freud said about the irish is were the only people impervious to psychoanalysis
madolyn is impressed
tough luck for you with a client list of mick cops isnt it
good luck to you
colin laughs but looks nervous about the concept of opening up
why do you do it
some people do get better
colin takes it seriously admires it
sometimes though i want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs
unsaid like i do
including the criminals
if they dont do their jobs you dont have one
id just arrest innocent people
ill arrest you right now
you dont know the half of it
a slow night
billy is at the bar bent over a glass of cranberry juice
the women available are two crones
dialog on separate document
stark contrast to colins evening
a bookmaker on the phone
billy by the glances of people looking at him has made his bones
hes treated with respect
his hand and wrist in a cast
out of nowhere though billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look around
costello sits down beside him at the bar
billy observes mister french sitting down at a far table
covering the room
costello is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender
no sound whatsoever in the bar
they say nothing look at each other
billy notices delahunt and fitzy entering
they stand by mister french
billy sits motionless
do you know who i am
billy does but shakes his head
you met my friend mister french the other night
is his real name mister french
a beat come with me
as billy hesitates im not the cops
im not askin you
billy stands up
mister french stands up
billy costello and mister french move towards the back room
as they walk to the back room of the bar we hear costello you know something they just do not stop having the mafia in providence and this can cause
problems for me
those guys you tuned up are connected down providence
what theyre going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you
which sure as youre born they will do unless i stop them
do you want me to stop them
is it something i cant do personally
costello appreciates the balls of this
he looks at mister french
then back at billy smiling
im going to have my associate search you
exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire
search me for what
mister french and costello look at each other
contra fucking band
take your fuckin shoes off
billy slips out of them
mister french inspects the shoes
costellos cold eyes are on billy
mister french searches billy
looks into his wallet
the wallet is emptied onto a table
i knew your father
how did he go
he didnt complain
that was his problem
who said he had a fuckin problem
i just said he had a fuckin problem
theres a man could have been anything
are you saying he was nothing
im saying he worked at the airport
costello turns to mister french
with amazing violence mister french smashes the cast on the corner of a table
billy drops to his knees in tears of pain
mister french sorts through the pieces of the cast
ad libs such a fuckin pussy
holding billy by the collar it makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood
and if i can slander my own formative environment it makes me sad this regressing
plus i dont know if its beyond some cop prick like fucking queenan to pull you out of the staties and send you after me
i just cant know
i dont know what they do in
that department anyway
he grabs billys broken right hand
are you still a cop
costello twists billys broken hand
you swear on your mothers grave that youre not a cop
i am not a cop
you stop doing coke deals with your jerk off cousin
costello lets go of billys hand
billy is weeping on the floor
costello straightens his suit
take it easy
get your hand taken care of
it was necessary
as for our problem with providence
lets not cry over spilled guineas
costello the visiting king points at a group of drinkers including a blond woman st gwen
whats this ira motherfucker doing in my bar
the ira motherfucker is terrified
slapping him on the back only kidding
hows your mother
ah shes on her way out
we all are
straightens suit and tie act accordingly
mister french is methodically shelling and eating peanuts
do you trust him
these days whos reliable
his uncle jackie was
the costigans are talented in general
you dont trust a guy behaves like hes got nothin to lose
and he is
well youre one in a million
what about your wife
i thought she was
silent flash of mister french strangling his wife with a wire in a s bathroom
she got reliable
gwen looks up dont you people ever shut the fuck up
another county heard from
one too many
seagulls squabble over unusual food
power plant in the distance the mta train going by
two bodies lie in a tidal ditch in the salt marsh
they are the italians who billy fought in the restaurant
hands taped together behind their backs
two in the head each
colin is with the lynn police and the state police forensics people
colin gets down and lifts a soaking lapel
revealed is the tag of a mens shop in providence
the principles of detection tell me that these men came from providence
id appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene
this is my crime scene but knock yourself out
colin gets up
he walks back across the marsh
opens his cell phone
walking i saw a dead guy
i think i have post traumatic stress
you available for lunch
see you then
at a pay phone he dials another number
one of costellos homes
whos the lead detective
good hes a moron
billy cannot hear what costello is saying
he has an aluminum brace taped on his wrist and hand
i want you to get the cops to look at jimmy pappas for the hit
of course he had nothing to do with it and will say so
you look in
the gun that did it
in the trunk or the glove box
colin deadpan appreciative hangs up the phone
barrigan walks in the middle distance giving the man his privacy
wanna see some dead guys
costello sits down in the breakfast area in his bathrobe
he has a bowl of cornflakes
have a seat billy
he looks up you know john lennon
mister french are nearby
yeah he was president before lincoln
smiles lennon said im an artist
you give me a fuckin tuba and ill get you something out of it
id like to squeeze some fuckin money out of it
costello and mister french look at each other
costello lifts a piece of plastic on the table revealing a severed human hand
billy tries to conceal his shock
queenan and staff sgt
dignam are listening to the live broadcast
queenan is benign
lights of equipment in his specs
costello takes the ring off the finger of the severed hand
partial exchange with mister french
the point with john lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it
for instance i look at you and i think what can i use you for
giving the hand to mister french get rid of this
back to billy maybe we can work something out
let me get dressed
he gets up
billy runs the water in the sink
he starts to leave the bathroom and then impulsively takes off his wire and chucks it out the window as far as he can
the wire falls into the water
queenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal
he removes his headphones
that was quick
he dead already
a greek guy jimmy pappas in chefs whites is cuffed and stuffed by tactical officers
he has no idea what is going on
colin and barrigan follow
this will get captain ellerby on the six oclock news
no wonder you get ahead
billy walking and talking on the phone
i wont do it if i have to wear a wire
ever ever you understand me
you dont know what this is like
listens micro what
queenan on the phone
well probably be at war with the chinese in twenty odd years and costello is selling them military technology
microprocessors chips computer parts
anybody says anything about anything like that you let us know
ellerby is before a thicket of microphones
did you have a tip from an informant
no it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator
colin is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers
brown last seen as billys friend and barrigan new plainclothes recruits to colins special squad sit across from him
ive been put in charge of this unit
it is a small surveillance sub unit but it is mine
and i didnt take this job in order to fuck it up or to let anyone else fuck it up whosoever they may be
i hand picked this group
you are my a team so i want you to conduct yourselves accordingly
through glass we see ellerby preening
ellerby gives the thumbs up
and our primary target is obviously frank costello
but we dont communicate with anyone else in this shop
queenan is compartmentalizing everything in siu
its the right thing to do personally i dont trust these fucking troopers either
we think we might have a problem
we think costellos got a rat in the state police
do we have direct access to queenans undercovers
not happy about this no
but im hoping to get things
dont disappoint me
brown and barrigan leave
colin leaves as well
to brown i know why im here
i made him feel guilty
why are you here
intelligence and aptitude
colin opens his cell phone
i have a new job
alt i got a promotion
mister french backhands a guy into a table of betting slips
wheres your fucking license
i dont see no fucking license
billy who is not wearing a cast anymore watches
theres no such thing as a license of course but you definitely have to have one
grabs the bookie by the ear if you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else which means you will have let undesirable elements into
a hard guy sitting reaches inside his coat
billy in a flash breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the sprawled hard guy with the gun
spitting teeth i was going for my fucking cigarettes
they fall from his fingers
hey thats jimmy bags
what the fuck you doin
what the fuck
i didnt know
theres no profit if i pay him two grand a week
im in the hole if i pay him two grand a week
then make more money or go out of business
this is america
if you dont make money youre a fucking douchebag
what are you going to do
make more money
thats the spirit
billy and mister french emerge
dont worry about it
guy didnt need need his teeth anyway
maybe if he was an eskimo
but in this country we eat a variety of items
they get into costellos car
billy in the front seat
mister french in the back
he knocked jimmy bags teeth out
costello does an edgar kennedy
reaching for his cigarettes
you gonna give me shit it wasnt no reason he put his hand in his coat
i dont know if hes a bookie or what the fuck hes doing
interrupting well you know what the fuck a bookie does
to costello pays you
anyway i like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason
he takes out a cell phone and hands it to billy
from now on call the bar and ask for mikey
you ask for mikey because theres no mikey
forty eight hours from the time this phone first rings you take the fucking chip out like so and you fucking destroy it
after three days a phone aint clean
if you use a phone which is not clean you will have a accident
you never call us
we call you
you got that
i got it
i cant fuckin hear you
i got it
a lobster bib kind of place
daytime drinkers micks in bad boat shoes hyper aware of
costello and billy in a back table
costello having finished his lunch is drawing
billy is unused to being the subject of so many stares
he has sort of a coked out nervousness dirty hair
theres a white van across the parking lot
we see it through the smeared glass the white van we always see
this time with a different magnetic business sign
lifting and looking at his sketch they dont have directional microphones
what do you got x ray vision
not taking his eyes off his sketch they dont have directional microphones
billy registers what seems to be inside information
costello looks over his half glasses at billys untouched food
costello is sizing billy up has been thinking about him
people looking at you make you self conscious
indicating yeah well who the fuck wouldnt be
i dont know
they cant tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal
anyone not a criminal is a minus
what are you soft
thats not what i said
eat something jesus christ we got a nice day by the water
suns shining gulls are up
nice smell of ozone
two priests and a nun are sitting two tables over
an older priest and a younger one
the nun gets up and leaves
you know if your father were alive and saw you sitting here with me lets say he would have a word with me about this in fact hed kill seven
guys just to cut my throat
and he could do it which is something you may not know about william costigan sr
he never ah i mean never
he kept his own counsel
he never wanted money
you cant do a thing with a man like that
your uncle jackie needed a lot of money
but even though he got his money from me he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you
and i think about this
so what are talking about here
fact is youre not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and i dont see you up the dog track as a general
look at it this way
its like a tuba
i want to see if i can get something out of it
costello smiles at this then looks at his sketch
you ever think of going back to school
with all due respect mr
costello schools out
well thats your problem
maybe someday youll wake the fuck up
he gets up and leaves the table leaving billy sitting there
costello stops to speak to the priests
good day fathers
terrified and simultaneously good morning day francis good morning
the older priest is very nervous looking around
the younger priest concerned for his elder but personally not implicated
costello leans over the older priest a pathetic man
you recall our chat
the older priest nods terrified i am as god made me was that what you said
may i remind you god dont run the bingo in this archdiocese
may i remind you mr
costello that pride comes before the fall
what comes before the fall is the summertime
costello notices that the nun is heading back to the table
how is sister mary theresa doing
we had a tasty relationship before she took her vows
enjoy your clams cocksuckers
fitzy beats up a guy with a pipe
billy watches from the background
fitzy and the costello gang blow up a car as billy watches
laughing they hop in their vehicles and drive off
office decorated with golf implements
ellerby has a hangover
eating baby aspirin by the small fistful
im not making enough progress with costello
progress is hard to define
i make progress every day
in fact im making progress now
there are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result
its like any american industry
nobody minds if you dont succeed as long as you dont fuck up
he has a bowl of ice water on his desk
objectives get lost sight of fair enough
who did the two guys from providence
and what happened to jimmy pappas
he had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at boston city hospital
i believe its been in the papers
ellerby stares at colin
are you happy with this result
its a result
yeah but cui bono
cui gives a shit
its got a bow on it
with true appreciation i think you are a cop my son
he drops his face into the bowl of ice water
a stripped hospital bed stands in a fall of light
this is the apartment where his mother became ill
billy has packed half of his mothers things into boxes and then stopped
billy doesnt use the bedroom
he sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures papers teacups wrapped in newspaper
billy is sitting on the couch
he reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards
scenes from his life
his former life
his family life his life as a child his romantic life
he sits and stares at the pictures
he rearranges the photographs in different ways
french and billy break in surprising the man brian seated at his dining room table
he throws a childs toy at them
french ducks out of the way and the toy hits billy in the cheek
french draws his pistol and approaches the table
brian rises and starts to flee
cut off he retreats the other way
brian stop it i aint gonna hurt you
he fires using a soda bottle as a silencer
brian drops to the floor
french approaches him assessing his victim
he turns to leave passing billy
he give him a slap
wake the fuck up
billy leans against the wall of a concession stand
his knuckles are cut
a cut over his eye
he is agitated
a car pulls up and queenan and dignam get out of it
in appearance if anybodys watching theyre bracing billy
lets go through the routine
you think you can pop someone
theres no special card to play
the guy whose jaw you broke was boston police department
im going fuckin nuts
i cant be someone else every day
most of the people in the world do it every day
whats the big deal
dignam is drinking coffee
im not them
you signed the paper
were the only people in the world who know that youre a cop
maybe well just erase your file
this is billys deepest fear
and zip youre a soldier for costello open to arrest for how many felonies
maybe well do that
maybe ill fucking kill you
he gets free of dignam and punches him
that was a joke billy
just because you play a fucking tough guy doesnt mean you are one you lace curtain fucking pussy
queenan grabs billy and holds him against the wall
gently like a man calming a wild animal be smart
if someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you
billy looks desperately inland
revere beach condominium buildings
a thousand empty terraces five thousand empty windows
billy is desperate
get in the car
keep your act together
its just a little while longer
billy nods out of it
dignam is looking at blood on his hands in disbelief
when are you going to take costello
whats wrong with taking em on any one of the million felonies youve seen him do
get him for pissing in the street
what are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor
that would stick
you shut up
were building a case
it takes time
you know that
theres something wrong
keep your ears opened
i want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the special investigation unit
billy looks at him you hear anything like that
billy shakes his head
are you serious
im afraid so
hang tight for me
just a little longer
were this close
billy nods reluctantly
thank you billy
colin walks into the office
brown and other team members are watching a closed circuit monitor
the monitor shows fitzy sitting in an interrogation room
colin is spooked
to brown what have you got
uniform clipped him on the pike for a suspended licence
however as hes the subject of an open investigation at least one
hes one of costellos crew
were entitled to get a warrant
we cant get an address off him
he paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasnt called back yet
whos the lawyer
he didnt know the name
he just had the number on a card
did he beep him
colin glances around and sees a briefcase lying on a desk
he picks it up
he takes off his id badge and tosses it on a desk
give me your phone
to barrigan turn the camera off
turn it off
he takes browns cellphone out of browns pocket goes into the interrogation room
give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off
whos is this
im gonna take this
he picks up a briefcase
barrigan touches two buttons and switches off the sound recorder and video feed
colin goes into the interrogation room
he cant do that can he
he just did
fitzy looks up at colin hopefully
colin says nothing
he sits down opens his case takes out a yellow pad
you my attorney
what do you think
did you make any statements or phone calls i need to be aware of
i beeped you
the card they gave me
dont you have to call your mother and tell her youre not gonna be home for supper
he looks up at the cctv camera
the cameras are off
gently puts phone on the table call your mother
theyre in there suiting up for a raid
i dont know where they are going but they do
and so do you
call your mum
colin puts a cellphone on the table
fitzy takes up the phone and punches in a number
it is answered
mum im not gonna make it for supper
i got held up
yeah talk to you later
billy looks up at mister french who is on the phone
other men are frozen holding bags of ex
fitzy closes the cellphone
he puts it into colins hand
the drugs are swept up instantly in sheets laid over the tables
mister french lights a cigarette with his zippo and then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as billy watches
colin takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket
who are you
when do i get out of here
i think you need another attorney after all mr
have a nice day
colin comes out and hands brown the cellphone
run the last number called
thatll be his house
whatever the location is ill swear i surveilled him at it
whyd you use my phone
because you didnt go in there
colin hung over sits at the breakfast table
madolyn looks at him
the lights nice here in the morning
colin doesnt respond
its all right
guys tend to make a big deal out of it
its actually quite common
i gotta go to work
colin simply gets up and walks away
a clock ticking
madolyn is looking across at
madolyn is very much a guarded shrink
but no ones more guarded than billy
its like confession
this sort of thing
people make things up in confession
you know that
i know they do
people are liars
they want to be stars of their little films
thats an interesting observation
do you lie
why do you
im asking if you lie
honesty isnt synonymous with truth
so is it to do some good to get somewhere personally or just for the fuck of it
i expect sometimes
do it to keep things
on an even keel
so you had a parent who was a drunk
madolyn looks up at him transpierced
tables turned on the psychiatrist
billy smiles at her
flustered did you
lets keep this with you
abruptly there was a cop leaving when i came in
how do you know he was a cop
bad haircut no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement
you see cops
thats part of what i do
although i dont normally see cadets who were kicked out of the academy
you should get a better job
do they all come in and cry
sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if theyve had to
use their weapons
let me tell you something
they signed up to use their fuckin weapons
most of them
but they watch enough tv so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons
no ones more full of shit than a cop
except a cop on tv
i looked through your file and i see you have a record of assault
what was it like for you in jail
you want to hear about the showers
did something happen to you
a beat you sit there with a mass murderer your heart rate jacked your hand
thats one thing i found out about myself in prison
my hand doesnt shake ever
what do you expect from coming here
i have to come here
i know its not elective
on your part
but now that youre here what do you want
you want the truth
a beat valium
if you lied youd have an easier time getting what you wanted
whats that say about what you do for a living
madolyn is taken aback
she closes her file
look i think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions
she closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her
im having panic attacks
you didnt even ask about that
last night i thought i was having a fucking heart attack
i puked in a trash barrel on the way in here i havent slept for weeks
is this true
i said something true
i want some fucking pills and you close my file
i thought i was supposed to tell the truth here
yes you are
if only fuckin here
she retrieves his folder
giving into stress guy comes in in pain against every instinct of
privacy of of self reliance
that he has and you dont help him
you send him off to score smack on the fucking street
is that what you do mrs
madolyn stares at him then lowers her eyes takes out a small packet of two pills
she hands it over to him
billy looks at it
billy reaches out and deliberately places the pills on the desk
why dont you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off
are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit
madolyn is taken aback guilty astonished
you can leave
what if that was a legitimate threat
madolyn stares after him
billy is walking
madolyn catches up to him
why is the hardest patient of the day always the last one
because youre bored and tired and dont give a shit
its not supernatural
look im not just
somebody you have to see or they put you in jail
if you are in distress i will help you
madolyn holds out a paper and a business card
and a prescription for twenty lorazepam
billy stands holding the prescription
is it enough to kill myself
she fixes him with a stare maybe it is
have i done my job up to your goddamned standards
because by my standards you fit the model of drug seeking behavior and fuck you if you dont like my initial clinical reaction
re prescription thank you
im transferring you to another counselor
she starts to go back inside
you wanna get a cup of coffee
its an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office building
cables and monitors and computers everywhere
its crawling with state cops as well as fbi lazio is present very nattily dressed
colin comes in with brown and barrigan
this operation is all new to colin
all right lets bring it in please
come in please
addressing room our target is a major transaction of microprocessors
i dont know what they are
you dont know what they are
who gives a fuck
cash will be handed over in a building which we have under av surveillance
staff sergeant sullivans team
he nods at colin will id the bad guys and listen in on the phones
to his guys did you guys know anything about this
to lazio how long have we been tapped on this building
our unit will not take action until a man captain queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction
this is who were after
taps picture of costello
weve been after this cocksucker for a long time and tonight were gonna get him
get to work
on colin as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks about the best way out of this
weve been after this son of a bitch for a long time and were getting him tonight
get to work
to team go find out what were doing and get on it
colin wanders off in the mill of officers
he is taking out his cell phone when ellerby comes up to him
sorry to get you at the last minute
but things leak
this lead came from queenans undercover guy
ellerby walks on to a coffee station a yard away
into cell dad
on phone yes
colin is completely normal on the phone
im not going to make dinner
something big has come up
costello is on the phone
your mother worked all goddamned day
well just have to sit down without you and your friends
colin turns away from the activity
oh my friends are still coming
colin sees queenan staring at him
well just say lunch tomorrow
all right bye
colin ends the call
queenan is there
the readiness is all
you know the players call the game
thank you captain
he gives him the clipboard colin goes to the work area
colin joins his team brown and barrigan who are seated in a u shaped work area
colin still stunned by the fact of this operations center swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well
he sits down and puts a headset on
a geek cop leans over and shakes his hand
piece of cake
ill operate the cameras
you id the guys and log them
queenan comes up
all cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy of our federal friends over there
colin looks sees lazio and two others
as if on coke and he probably is patriot act
colin using his left hand not looking opens his cellphone autodials and then taps an instant message into it pushes send
detail of im no phones all right
thats costello right there
costello mister french fitzy delahunt billy costigan the new guy
who are they meeting
leaning over screens i dont know
some chinamen from points unknown
theyre already inside
detail of colins phone
colin hits send sending the message no phones
the screen then reads erasing sent message
costello and the boys go into the building moving past two idling cars
we see costello look casually at his phone
costellos guys move through pillars and disappear
we have a blind spot
why do you have a blind spot
we had two hours notice
what the fuck you think this is nasa
it never crossed my mind
you get a camera in the back
ellerby blows his nose
he is on coke
colin sends another text message blind spot inside door
costello looks at his im screen and turns to his guys
turn off your cell phones
fitzy and some others mutter
check your weapons
fitzy has the chicken
everyone turns off their phones including billy but we know billy has two phones
billy looks around at the pillared distances
he sees a group of three men waiting and five other men spreading out through the pillars
to no one and maybe os maybe if we had some homeland security money like some other fucking douchebags i could mention
both brown and colin have their headsets on
they turned off their phones
colin looks utterly innocent
search randomly for calls made from the area
eight hundred seven phones are live in this area
narrow the area
what you see for coverage is what you get
like queenan an observer of ellerbys operation why the fuck did they turn off their phones
wait theres still one phone up
a single light on the screen
queenan looks at an im from billy on his phone
detail buyers here
the buyers are there
colin wonders how queenan knew this
the single light winks out on the screen
ellerby looks at queenan impressed
you know direct access to your fucking guys would have certain fuckin advantages
mildly not to my guy
ellerby stares at him
this is unbelievable
looking at screens fuck it who put the cameras in the fucking place
who the fuck are you
im the guy who does his job
you must be the other guy
hey hey hey
costellos boys spread out
across the open lumber strewn area chinese gang members are waiting
a local chinese american man acting as the interpreter and fixer stands waiting near a suitcase on the floor
with the chinese gangsters is a more official looking man in a bad suit terrified
fitzy carries a case containing the processors
to translator how you going robert
i want to tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns
costello takes it all in
the chinese gangster looks like a malay pirate
costellos gunmen are perched above automatic weapons trained on the triad
billy sneaks a message to queenan via text message to indicate buyers here
in cantonese not subtitled waiting waiting
we almost departed
this man is from the embassy
he will have to blow his brains out if he is captured
his entire family will be killed
hes a little upset
tell him light on the starch
billy is watching carefully
as insert onscreen in the operations room the last lights wink off
he removes his hand from his pocket having just switched off his phone
roughly translating hes fronting the chinese government and hes just scared shitless
loudly to chinese im concerned about chinamen who think its wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction
the chinese gangster interjects ngup ngup ngup
ngaw um ming
kay ngup mutt
yap yap yap
i dont understand
what is he saying
the chinese translator translates costellos statement about concern
several of the triad hearing a automatic weapon stupidly raise their machine guns
they dont aim them
for his own good tell bruce lee and the karate kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here in this country it dont add inches to your dick
you get a life sentence for it
we but no one else hear a double click as mister french cocks a pistol behind his back
in cantonese put away that machine gun
the machine gun is put away
if these chinks want to nuke taiwan any time in this century you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars
the chinese translator translates
what we generally do in this country is one guy shows up with the items and the other guy pays him
costello gestures and a box of processors is put on the floor
the chinese gangster gestures and a case of money is put on the floor
fitzy looks at it nods
nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon
make sure its real
its a million dollars
alternate also insult ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun
next time you make me wait im going to cut your dick off
in english thank you also
the deal is done
the expedition continues this way
to billys surprise both costellos men and the chinese head out through the back industrial windows onto a canal side pier
the cars of the chinese guys are driven away passing a van full of
startled tactical cops
two tactical units are hidden outside
ellerby is staring at the screens
dont tell me those cars were empty
please dont tell me those chinamens cars were empty
to camera tech cop do you have a camera in the back
an image comes up
can i talk to you a minute
as the camera technician gets up ellerby pounces on him
tied to the pier there are two boats a novi lobster boat and a boston whaler with a guys weve never seen at the wheel random getaway hires
the triad members get into the novi and chug away
fitzy carries the suitcases of money onto a boston whaler and it takes off
costello turns to billy
see no surveillance here
they didnt figure we had a navy
always figure an exit for your business partners
what with everything all dug up you cant trust a slant to find the mass pike and with or without staties out front frankly i dont approve of orientals driving
to begin with
what about us frank
whatre we gonna do
we didnt commit no illegalities
billy is stunned
except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin plastic
the chinese guys staring back chug away down the canal in the lobster boat
billy watches costello go admiringly and then follows him
a few blocks from the target building a police tactical unit stops the departing triad cars with a roadblock
as officers approach the cars they realize they are empty except for hired caucasian drivers
an officer reports this to the command center
colin is asleep on the couch in a bachelor disaster of chinese food boxes
something on tv audition
a key in the door he wakes as madolyn comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a box of effects
madolyn smiles at him also shy
i beat the movers
how was the last night in the ah old establishment
putting the box on the kitchen counter lonely
im glad to hear that
it sucked here too
madolyn takes in the apartment
im gonna thank your uncle alphonsus for the square footage
uncle alphonsus is in heaven
so am i
madolyn unpacks food
re box of stuff yeah
hey can i
he sorts through the box
its all madolyns key stuff a mug a few critical books
framed family pictures breakables
and comes up with a photograph of a young madolyn standing in front of a north east rust belt slum
well were not having this out
madolyn isnt prepared to be at cross purposes
but she is taken aback
she puts the photo quietly away
you dont see any pictures of where i came from
look i respect who you are but not in the living room
we might have company
colin looks at a diploma
why work for the state
not forever and you dont have to
youve got degrees
youre a hot shit
i mean what you do why make as much as a guidance counselor
deadpan over her coffee cup i believe in public service
colin stares at her
now youre just being ridiculous
kissing him and intently you like me living here
hands down her shorts yes i do
the phone landline with mobile handset rings
you live here
madolyn not confused by his seizing on the interruption gets the phone
mayor sullivans office
after a moment she holds the receiver out to colin
whispering im sorry
who is it
i think its a guy with a ah she touches her throat and whispers a cancer guy
colin reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone dead
a bad mistake in his situation
he crams the phone into a table charger beside the landline and takes the handset
colin exits the kitchen
to madolyn something for work
madolyn looks after him
she doesnt start eating again she watches colin
she is seen staring at him through the following scene
what the fuck is it with your phone
costello with his collar turned up is walking along the floats
wearing a headset
colin hunches closing the glass door and glancing in at madolyn
it doesnt have any power thats all
it just happened once
was that that shrink cunt answered the phone
as i said she was gonna move in so she moved in
you better get organized quick
last time i checked i tipped you off and youre not in jail
are you listening to me
are listening to me son
do you like little miss thing sucking your cock
colin looks in at madolyn
yes i do
colin is frustrated
so earn it
a beat im gettin the feeling we got a cop in my crew
i been gettin that same feeling
hes one of yours
have you seen anything
look i have no access to undercover files in queenans department
its locked up
queenan and dignam run the snitches
they dont give anybody a peep
im doing the best
interrupting your best
what do you think were in the fuckin haberdashery business
colin takes a breath tries to reason and mind his place
please frank if you dont relax i cant relax
lets start with this

interrupting colin get you

relenting a little collie calm down or youll shoot in your pants

costello hangs up and walks along and sees queenan and dignam step out
how are you francis
my mother called me francis
i know she did
and your father called you the tumor
costello not liking that oh what did your father call you charlie
oh yeah i forgot he wasnt around
where are the real microprocessors frank

you arrested some chinese government guy at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin
i cant wait to wipe that fuckin smirk off your face
to dignam wouldnt you rather wipe my ass for me
i will get you frank
if you couldve you wouldve but i guess you like to go at your own pace
from off stage we hear a young angelic girls choir begin to sing
excuse me ive got a date with some angels
as costello walks away sooner than you think francis
colin looking worried folding his phone away comes into the apartment
madolyn is staring at him
you have a boss that has a laryngectomy
no no no
that was a guy who works for me
youre lying to me
the charming colin there are certain things i will not be able to talk to you about
i cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation
or your own life
more seriously after a long beat there really are things connected to my job that you cant ask about
that you dont want to know about
after a beat okay then say that
colin looks at her steadily if shes serious shes pure gold
he kisses her
the doorbell rings
thats the movers
you still wanna stay
the doorbell safely ringing colin kisses madolyn
re doorbell all right
dignam is alone
we see queenans empty desk in a fall of light
we see dignams arm wrist phone an expensive heavy watch
im gonna get on a plane unless you put queenan on the phone
queenan had a funeral to go to
this is my shift
billy is talking on the phone in a fury
why shouldnt i get on a fucking plane
do you actually want me dead
theres a rat in your unit
thats a fact
you just dont know it
hes not here
they knew you had cameras in the building
you have a leak from the inside
smoke him out
and how do we do that mr
fucking genius who didnt even graduate the academy
let it slip to siu that youre getting a sealed wiretap warrant for costellos apartment
dont tell anyone in our department but tell siu
flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end
narrow it down
are you deaf
hes not here
call me when you get something real
billy is in a full on panic attack
he takes a pill leans back against a wall closes his eyes
the second phone rings
he stares at it opens it
madolyn and billy sit at a table
talking like friends now emphatically non clinical
billy is zoned out preoccupied nervous
im assuming you want to change things you know change the people you know change the people you meet change everything anything
too many choices can see like no choice at all
confucius say that
so you do
something radical huh
yeah you do
sometimes its just a matter of picking a thing and doing it
so how long you been with this guy
oh four months
about four months
you love this guy
its pretty serious yeah it is
a head case or anything
im just curious
no more than i am
then youre lucky
considering the odds right
he lifts his cup to drink
good give him a shot
this may not be exactly what madolyn wants to hear
but she nods
doctors arent supposed to have illusions
yeah thats because of vastly superior intelligence
smiles called on her shit
ok im in a serious newly serious relationship
ups and downs
everybody has doubts problems i mean doubts
she realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on problems
what would you do if he was standing right there and saw us
to keep things on an even keel
you know all about it
the bankrobber a junkie wakes up to a vision jesus indicating the sacred heart
billy smashes the glass and the frame over the guys head
mister french has lit a cherry bomb
he throws it
he hands out fireworks to kids
billy shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his head
you take off an armored car at the dedham mall and what do you do
do you pay guineas in providence
fucking now i do
what the fuck do you do
what i pay costello and wait for him to trade me to the fbi
cause thats what he does
what the fuck are you talking about
firecrackers off oh my god is that french out there
grabbing him by the shirt what the fuck did you just say about the fbi
forget what i said
im fucking high im high
firecrackers continue to go off outside
the bankrobber knows what this means
whatevers going through your very poor very limited brain
im not going to hurt you
just tell me what you just fucking said
forget it im high i must be high i would never say what you thought i said
as the firecracker sounds increase outside maybe frenchs do what you have to do billy no way out of what he has to do glances at the window shoots the
guy through the kneecap
blood sprays everywhere
the bankrobber screams
tell me what the fuck you said
covered with blood why do you think hes not arrested
costellos a protected fbi informant
hell trade you out
a beat i thought i was supposed to go into shock
im not in shock
it fucking hurts
it fucking hurts
billy gets out of the house
mister french is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs
on sound sextet from lucia di lammamoor
from behind costellos head which almost fills the frame we see a blur of beautiful color
on stage an opera is in progress lucia di lammamoor done with masks
cut to costello revealing costellos rapt face and pan to reveal on his left a beautiful white prostitute
pan back over costellos face to reveal a beautiful black prostitute
performers with masks sing on stage
as the music soars costello moves crinolines up the womens legs
and fucks weird
a street of three deckers
queenan gets out of his unmarked cruiser
as he does billy steps out into the light
the two men stare at each other each lit by their own streetlight
hey its me
what do you want
what are you doing here
queenan approaches him
costello is giving people up to the queenan stares
he gives information to the fbi
hes a protected informant
arent they trying to make it a federal case
and it never gets made
realizing he has to be very careful go around the back
go around the back
billy sits on a bench in a hallway exhausted staring
the sacred heart and jfk are on the walls
queenan comes along the hall
my wifes asleep
she left supper out
come and have something to eat
billy shakes his head
well talk in the kitchen
come and have something to eat
billy follows him towards the lighted kitchen door
colin is watching ellerby hit golf balls
havent seen a guy like you since me
youll be transferred to internal investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the special investigation unit
i dont get it
we are all convinced that costello has at least one mole in the special investigation unit
well thats just a dream job for a cop
we have considered all possible candidates
you have an immaculate record
some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record
a beat i have an immaculate record
ellerby hits a drive
thats a pity
pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships
a beat hows the wedding coming along
shes a doctor
marriage is an important part of getting ahead
you dont want anyone thinking youre a homo
married guy seems stable
people look at a wedding ring and think someone can stand the son of a bitch
ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works
oh its working
im glad to hear that
hits a drive
heavy equipment stands on the thrashed earth
billy crosses the road under what remains of the expressway and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door
of a dead bar
the door is unlocked by delahunt
its another of costellos locations
billy looks around
every man from the previous night is there but no costello
delahunt closes the door behind him and bars it
men are oddly enough filling out forms
these are not men used to pencil and paper
billy is nodded at
boss wants your real name your social your license number all your bank account numbers
i dont have a bank account
im a cash business myself
whats he doing setting up iras
you fill in the papers real name all your numbers no fucking around and then we all wait here
no i aint
mister french goes off into a separate room
billy takes a paper and sitting at the bar beside fitzy writes down his information
the other men are mostly finished and delahunt is collecting the papers
delahunt tosses the brown envelope on the bar
put the forms in there
i dont know if this is how you spell citizens
billy glances at what fitzy is crawling cittizins trust
no no no
he takes the brown envelope and writes on it citizens
what are you retarded
that aint right
billy gives up
both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope
billy gets up
billy he said to stay here
im not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot
im not staying
where you going
billy goes out
delahunt puts his coat on
he picks up the brown envelope on which citizens trust is written
billy is holding his bottle of tranqs
he traces with his finger the doctors name
his police phone vibrates and he takes it out
follow the envelope
billy deletes the im and dials queenan directly
why cant ellerbys guys
queenan closes his door
they are compromised
costello emerges in an overcoat
carrying the envelope
he gets into his oldsmobile
billy starts his car and follows
dark theater movie in progress
wobbly porno music
a thin audience of raincoat artists
the door opens and costello enters
he moves slowly down the aisle and sees colin sitting alone
he sits down in front of colin
costello is wearing the dildo
he watches the movie moaning
oh yeah be dirty
colin goes for his gun
costello gets up shows him the dildo
see anything you like
colin unnerved recognizing costello now
jesus christ frank i almost shot you
frank sits closer to colin
youre not indulging in self abuse are you
frank we got problems
i hope youre not turning into one of those sob sisters who wants to get caught
youre not crackin up are you
i dont crack up
pick a place where any cop could see you
why did you show up then
i own the place
why am i not fuckin surprised
youre gettin reassigned
how the fuck did you know that
whered they put you
i have to find myself
costello chuckles truly enjoying this
youre telling me sonny boy
i have to find the guy you have in the department
with everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself i put my money on nobody finding nothing
we see in colins face hurt and hatred for costello
his idol doesnt like him
frank for me youve got to lay low
laying low is not what i do
yeah big fuckin daddy frank
lookit frank what good am i to you if you dont listen to me
hes fuckin smart you know that
i will find this rat if you let me do it my way
if you let me do my job
gives him the envelope but colin i hope i wont have to remind you that if you dont find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can
give him a halo most likely it wont be me who pays for it
colin nods sweat on his lip
why would you need to remind me of that
i didnt know that would i be any good at what i do
trust me i know how to do this
it involves lying and im pretty fucking good at that right
looking at the screen maybe its because its always been so easy for me to get cunt that i never understood jerking off in a theatre
costello gets up to go
who knows whats easy
collie take care of business
the door opens again at the back of the theater and we see billy in a dark back seat
costello after hesitating as colin sweats shoves the brown envelope to colin and goes
billy receives a text message get visual id suspect
he slumps in his seat as costello marches up the aisle and out of the theater
he has barely recovered from this when the dark shape of colin is moving rapidly towards and through the emergency exit beside the screen
its open and gives on to what boston keeps trying to call the theater district and what keeps being the combat zone
colin vanishes around a corner
billy follows looks left and right then goes after colin who is walking along putting the envelope into his coat
billy is speeding up moving through pedestrians desperate to see colins face
colin will be caught up to within seconds
he turns down another street
billy starts into a half run
he turns the corner
another street painted with neon light quiet
colin is halfway down the street
billy is nearly up to colin on this quieter street and colin is aware of the tail when
billys cellphone rings
his phone has fucked up as they do
instead of turning around colin accelerates
the only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen
billy spins into a door opening and silences the ringer
colin takes a right at the end of the street into an alley
colin is waiting in a doorway of his own
he has a knife open in his hand
he waits listening to faltering footsteps a man face invisible in shadow turns the corner
colin pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife
as the body falls we see it isnt billy
its a chinese man
colin backs away in horror and hurries off down the street
colin sweating staggering hurries along
no sign of billy no sign of a follower
but he does notice cctv cameras at the intersection
he spins and gets out of there heading off through
colin holding his envelope walks sweating fast then faster past repeated ideograms in neon the ideograms say flash departed
billy has lost colin
he hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see blood running on the pavement
billy backs away gets out of there
colin is looking at cctv tapes
we see colin unrecognizable on cheap video
then we see a blurred image of billy
crossing the street in beats
no more use as id than the shroud of turin
through grated windows we can see madolyn finishing up her packing
billy knocks on the door which leads only into madolyns basement apartment
a long beat and she opens the door
the chain on
your names on the pill label
i thought you werent supposed to be in the book in case of obsessive patients
how obsessive are you
are you okay
why are you here
i really liked our conversations
regretting that we didnt continue
im glad you want to see me
its nice to see you
i enjoyed talking
i enjoyed having coffee with you very much
but i dont see people
i dont see people in my home
billy gets soaked
billy looks around and sees boxes transition
the furniture already gone
an air mattress on the floor
there are still tea things on the counter
a basic life is still possible here
madolyn has been making tea here sleeping here reading in bed
billy soaked a drowned rat is looking vulnerable and honest
if this is inappropriate
i can leave
madolyn takes a moment to react
no its its its not inappropriate
youre not a patient
you moving in or out
i still have three weeks on the lease
billy is looking at the picture to which colin objected
a young girl in front of a rust belt slum tilted in a box of effects
yeah i know
he hangs the picture on a nail
the kettle whistles os would you like a cup of tea
yeah i would
madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment
in the kitchen it appears that madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea
she perseveres comes out holding two cups
billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment
do you want some
she hands him the cup of tea
strung out he spills his tea slightly unobserved by madolyn
madolyn looks over at the bed the book the lamp the incontrovertible evidence that shes probably really in fact not that into colin
ive always needed my own place
hedging your bets
im not hedging my best
i told you when we had coffee
theres a choice
you have to make a
and stick by what
you have to
move in with your boyfriend
stick by what you
i have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now
is it real
yeah i think so
you dont have cats
i like that
colin is still studying the blurry image of billy
in the tiny kitchen billy is kissing madolyn and unbuttoning her shirt
her hands start to move to push him away
still studying the blurry image of billy colin tenses as someone comes into the office and switches off the tape
he glances at his coat
the envelope is visible folded into the breast pocket
he takes his coat and goes
wet empty streets
the gaslights are on
a costello business
the restaurant is closed for the night
one bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings
in a darker alcove of the bar costello sits alone at a broad table drinking brandy
on sound classical music
as a knocking is heard costello looks up
a bartender lets billy in
costello watches billy approach
we hear him sit down
you got a girlfriend
what does that matter
im sure you know by now theres an informer in my crew
staties or boston police department im not sure
he pours billy some brandy
then starts to draw a sketch
what about the fbi
the ex wife an old friend or stupid
thats what brings you down in this business
well that leaves me out
past days case like this
i killed everybody who works for me
better safe than sorry i suppose
on the other hand back then it was only five
but costello maybe is sorry
i look around at your guys
theyre all murderers right
i think could i do murder
and all i can answer myself is whats the difference
give em up to the almighty
yeah thats my point
you accuse me once i put up with it
you accuse me twice i quit
if you make me fear for my life i put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else
costello looks up
this is new but hes impassive
to billy you got something you want to say to me william
youre seventy fucking years old
one of these guys is going to pop you
as for running drugs what the fuck
you dont need the pain in the ass and theyre going to catch you
and you dont need the money
costello smiles and continues with the sketch
later he will light up the paper
i havent needed the money since i took archies milk money in the third grade
tell the truth i dont need pussy any more but i still like it
point im making
i got this rat
gnawing cheese eating fucking rat
questions come up
see bill youre the new guy
and the girlfriend
why dont you stay in the bar when i get the numbers
is there something you want to ask me frank
start with you agree there is a rat
you said there is one
i base most of what i do on the idea that youre pretty fucking good at what you do
sure sure all that aside
but you bill what would you do
how many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled
who needs more money than you pay them
you dont pay much you know
its almost a feudal fuckin enterprise
costello nods accepting this the question is who thinks that they would do what you do better than you
only one that can do what i do is me
you want to be me
billy stares over a precipice he knows this as well
i probably could be you
i know that much
but i dont want to be you
heavy lies the crown
sort of thing
french comes in from the kitchen
were out of here mister costello
youll have to set the alarm
eyes on billy thank you jimmy
see you tomorrow
on sound the door closes and locks
theres a boat coming in up in gloucester
french will give you all the details
costello is on the phone
mister french is sitting on a stool smoking
opera playing on sound
you heard nothing
nothing about drugs
nothing about new guys nothing about gloucester
no frank not a thing
and i promise you i would have heard about it
costello hangs up and turns to mister french
no other departments no codes like that
you can relax on this one
costello hangs up and turns to mr
emotionally it aint bill
no way he says
thank god for billy
everybody is busy in the office
its colins first day of internal investigations
colins moving through the bullpen
cops stare at him with resentment
he comes up to queenans door just as dignam comes out
dignam faces colin down
yeah i run rat fucks like you
i dont like them
the day you wouldnt take a promotion you let me know
and i wouldnt even have a job if you did yours
i need to know the identity of your undercovers
not literally theres no promotion in it for ya
he walks away
colin goes into queenans office
queenan puts the cig into a cup of water and throws it into the trash
look whos here
the queen of the prom
they are not happy with me
especially staff sergeant dignam
what do you expect
everybody knows youre assigned here to find costellos rat
they want to find the leak as much as you do
what they do not want is to be accused of being the rat
colin sits uneasily
well one of them has to be dirty we know that right
two days ago my undercover guy in costellos organization who is that
lots of luck
not a chance
you can go over my head high as you like
you still wont get an answer
as i said two days ago my guy nearly found out who costellos rat is
he lost him in the street
did he get a look at him
nothing that could help us
swallows too bad
costello cant do much business without coordinating with his source
gestures out window who is here
follow costello and youll find his rat
colin realizes just follow queenan and youll find his rat
turns away youre going to be looking at my people
going through their bank statements phone bills medical records
dont expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses
let me get you a coffee
colin is sitting in his office alone remembering what queenan has just told him follow costello and youll find his informer
in the fishbowl of his glass office colin is being stared at by pissed off cops
colin calms down
he opens the gray envelope
he takes out the forms that he was given by costello opens up police personnel database and starts searching
he types in ss numbers
one then another then another
the result is always person not found
he types in costigan william m hits return
it comes up person not found
colin keeps working
mugshots of all of costellos guys
he looks at them desperately
no one squares up with the blurred impossible images he saw on the cctv screen which he has printed out
colin closes the curtains on his fishbowl office not fast enough to avoid seeing dignam give him the finger locks his door
he picks up the phone
this is sullivan
i need constant surveillance on captain queenan starting right now
colin is lying in bed his back to madolyn
if i wasnt with the mass state police
if i did it full time law school id be through in a year
im thinking that
if i wasnt a trooper
whats going on
theres nothing going on
okay all right
thinking about it blows a breath and what about money
i got some money
im thinking that
another city doesnt seem unattractive to madolyn whos in her own cut and run crisis but maybe she cant believe that colin is thinking about it
she blows a breath
itd be a clean slate
colin is in hell
he looks at her intensely
i want you to know you dont gotta stay
if were not going to make it its got to be you that gets out
im not capable a beat im fuckin irish so ill deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life
not a bad idea another city
fitzy and delahunt are smoking on the sidewalk outside the restaurant
of course i know how to spot a cop
oh yeah hows that
if hes not paying attention to us hes a cop
a man across the street is looking into the window of an antique shop
see that guy over there hes a cop
hes not paying attention to us
hes a cop
lot of fucking cops
a woman walks by definitely ignoring both men dragging a lapdog
what kind of dog is that
shes a cop
shes probably the fucking police commissioner
too early to be opened for business
costello and new guys six hard customers come in through the fire door
at the bar billy is drinking coffee
he notices the new guys
off the boat dublin toughs
costello and french come in from the kitchen
french tells the new guys to move to the back
costello has blood on his sleeves
he comes over to the bar and looks at billy
you can get out of here
this is the crew for tonight
i thought i was on for that
i changed my mind
take the night off
to bartender jimmy get the mop
costello heads to the back of the restaurant
mister french grabs the bar knife from behind the bar
billy looks up at him
go out the back
some guys answer the questions right
mister french goes towards the back of the restaurant holding the big knife
billy closes his paper
billy steps out ignoring delahunt and fitzy
youre a cop
youre ignoring us
youre a cop
were guessing who cops are
most good looking women are cops
im going home
hes playing with his new boys
see you later
billy walks down the street and heads into an alley
around the corner he opens his phone
hes moving something with all new guys
a whole new crew
i dont want to tell you what or where
it might be disinformation
it probably is
just keep following him
i need to see you today
reacting to queenan billy continues no
a detective detective is leading the team to trail after queenan
a plug in his ear
two other detectives sit in a sedan nearby
these three detectives are new guys never seen before the i
surveillance team working for colin
can i ask a question sergeant
yes go ahead
why the fuck are we following captain queenan
to find out about the good catholic life
angrily i have to follow every lead however unlikely however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities
who says i have delicate sensibilities
i have reason to believe that queenan is costellos informer
follow him and dont get made
copy that sarge the detectives in the car get alert and start their car as queenan comes out of the building
we got him
sarge we got the target
detective trails captain queenan through the crowds of people heading towards work
queenan begins to light a cigarette and then gives it up
a train comes in and queenan boards
detective boards the next car
looking through smeared glass into the next car as the train begins to move detective sees queenan answer a cell call
queenan is on his cell
where are you now
look down the car
queenan looks up mildly as the car rocks
billy is slumped in a seat at the far end not looking towards queenan
any reason youd have a tail
of course not
on the verge of hyperventilating im watching a guy
i dont have a tail billy
through the glass we see detective watching queenan
get off at south station
you wait there for ten minutes
after i leave ill text message you the address where well meet
ill make sure you dont have a tail
wait ten minutes
as the train stops billy vaults off of it
on the platform he walks along texting
queenan mild in his specs chewing gum with his dentures comes out of the station and looks at the text message on his phone
a building under rehab covered with scaffolding but still functioning as a corporate building
queenan goes along to the entrance and in
detective comes along after him
we see the internal investigations car up the street
detective dials his cellphone
he went into a building on the waterfront
address is wash
detective looks at the elevator indicator and the building directory
he went to the top floor
colin listening playing with a coin
detective emerges from the building and joins other detectives in the car
i dont know what were doing here
colin after fumbling between cell phones dials the correct one
to costello i think ive got him
i think queenan is meeting with him right now
fitzy and delahunts phones ring simultaneously
get the van
get the boys
billy is waiting on the roof as queenan finally arrives
i assume these premises do not have an anti smoking ordinance

i told you hes got dope coming in i dont know where

youre out of there billy nods and nods
what about the fbi
theyre fucked just like this lighter
billys phone rings
delahunt is calling billy from a van crowded with costellos usual bad guys as it scorches through traffic
billy where the fuck are you
we been trying to reach you
we found the rat
top man says were gonna take care of him
the address is washington street
you got it
see you there
billy listens in horror staring at the oblivious queenan
you were fucking followed
one of the cops hes got inside tipped him
queenan realizes that his enemy might be
colin raises his eyes
fitzys van stops outside the building
costellos men get out of the van and head into the lobby
the detectives are watching
what the fuck is going on
holy fucking shit
looks like queenans meeting with all of them
billy and queenan are running downstairs when they hear footsteps coming up from below
they immediately go back up to the elevator lobby
pushing through plastic sheeting
billy is slamming elevator buttons
the indicator shows both elevators coming up
theyll be on the elevators too
take the back fire escape
whatll you do
ill be fine
if you get made i cant protect you
go down the fire escape
thats an order
ill be fine
watching the elevator indicator
queenan in his specs very mild takes out his gun and breaks the cylinder checking that it is loaded and putting a shell into the empty sixth chamber
billy climbs out onto the fire escape at the back of the building and starts dropping down fast
the elevator door opens revealing delahunt and boys
queenan looks right as the door to the staircase opens revealing fitzy and boys
can i help you gentlemen
i guess weve had enough of this shit
wheres your boy
queenan doesnt answer and never will
he draws his gun and is tackled
billy drops off the fire escape and runs down the alley
billy towards the front doors just as queenans body bounces off the scaffolding smashes into the pavement and explodes
blood splashes all over billy
detective screams into his headset
something came off the roof
what came off the roof
what do you mean something came off the roof
go again with that information
fitzy delahunt and boys come out
the crew has seen the unmarked cop car
fitzy grabs billy
youre fuckin late
where the fuck were you
get in the fuckin van
what the fuck happened
i came to meet you
they start piling into a van
detective is yelling both at his partner and into the mic
stay in the fucking car
stay in the fucking car
this is a surveillance unit
into mic to colin do i pursue
colin is sitting very calmly
stay where you are
i need some fucking information here
what came off the building
im not sure
detective gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing men gun drawn
fitzy turns on detective with a pistol drawn
detective fires and delahunt is hit in the stomach
fitzy shoots the detective he is wounded in the hand not killed
the van takes off
thirty two x to cp
thirty two x to cp
were being fired upon
officer down etc
colin has never felt more guilty in his life
we have an officer down
an officer has been shot
request immediate assistance
he switches off the light and sits in the dark as the afternoon gathers
fitzy billy and the boys are drinking
dirty paranoid guilty frightened smoking
delahunt has been shot is dying on a dirty couch
fitzy sits down and looks at billy
and where the fuck were you
boss told me to go home
maybe he did and maybe he didnt
at any rate you werent fuckin home
i was in a fucking grocery store with no signal
when i got a signal i got the call
what the fuck do you want
was i there or was i not there
fitzy walks away
billy billy goes over to him re his wounds jesus christ
two days ago the boss says to me its been ten years already and youve never done me wrong
he asked me if one of the other guys is a rat would i take him out
i told him i would but i dont know if i would
now i know i cant
ive done a lot of bad things but ive never been a murderer
billy realizes that delahunt is dying
hey billy i dont want no one to put me in a dumpster
just dont put me in a dumpster
when youre dead it makes no difference where they put you
billy lights him a cigarette
you know what i thought today
who didnt show up today is the rat
you never been late in your life
and when i called you
i made a mistake
i gave you the wrong address
but you showed up at the right one
delahunt grips his arm
billy is terrified
tell me why i didnt say anything
tell me why
he waits for delahunt to continue
but delahunt after an odd smile of complicity finally dies
billy the only one who knows that delahunt is dead stares down at him
drinking that cop was tough
we were excessive with the cop
billy walks past the table
im going home
billy leaves by the front door
all hands present
dignam is in a black silent rage
do you know why queenan went to that building
a better question is why your fuckers were following him
i told internal investigations to follow him
thats internal investigations business
dignam grabs colin by the neck and runs him into a wall
colin gets a palm under dignams chin and comes close to breaking his neck
the men at length are separated
colin straightens his good clothes
i have to investigate everybody and anybody
i dont have to justify anything
nor does anyone have to like it
i now have information
from a very good source
that queenan may have been killed by his own undercover
colin is trying this on
thats a fucking lie
captain queenan and staff sergeant dignam here have information on this undercover and other informants in a locked file
i need those files unlocked
i dont have the password
why dont you come down to the garage
thats a lie
dignam hits colin in the face
colin goes down hard into the crook of a file cabinet and the wall
blood from his mouth
no one calls me a liar
especially when im lying
everybody shut up
to brown work with the tech guys to unlock the files
you take a leave of absence
leave of what
that makes me your boss
ill hand in my papers first
hey world needs plenty of bartenders
two weeks with pay
i need those codes
no you want those codes
when she comes out billy is waiting
i tried to call you a few times
he leans close to her
she strokes his head
i cant be a friend to you
its okay okay i know
madolyn walks away
colin needs a shower and is gun shy as people move past the glass windows
he is still rinsing blood out of his mouth
costello is listening to lucia di lammamoor
gwen sits nearby in attractive lingerie reading a book
now when i hear lucia i cant stop thinking about the cocaine curtsy you did on that nigger broads face
the phone rings
costello answers what
into phone your shouldnt have killed queenan
one of us was going to have to die
with me it tends to be the other guy
agitated youre crazy frank
you killed the guy who has all the information
and dignams not in the office hes gone
i dont give a fuck about dignam
hes fucking gone
they took his papers in
hes not talking
i dont know where he is
dont get your balls in an uproar collie
that irish piss ant wont be a problem
hes so hot for me we give him a whiff of my ass hell crawl right in it
lets give him a whiff
ill take care of it
costello turns to the gwen
sweetheart youre giving me a hard on
he starts to dial the phone
are you sure its me or all that talk about whiffin and crawlin up asses
hey watch your fucking mouth
you watch it
she rises and as she crosses let me straighten you out
colin looks out into the bullpen
on a table he sees plastic bags which contains queenans bloodstained effects broken glasses smashed wristwatch and cellphone
he glances around and picks up the cellphone
blood gets on his fingers
he moves into the office and seen through the glass he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches up the last incoming number
billy is looking at a chipped santa mug from his childhood and is eating something sheer maintenance and drinking wine from the bottle
his phone rings
he looks at the id and is stunned
he picks up the call but remains silent
the caller is also doing the same
colin hears that the other side has hung up the phone
he sees ellerby looking at him through the glass
but ellerby hasnt seen the phone
billy is agitated
he paces and looks at the phone
he begins to pack assembling clothes money
finally like a man committing suicide its that intense he dials the number
you called this number on a dead guys phone
who are you
so it is you
thank god youre all right
we were very worried
who are you
youre talking to sergeant sullivan
im taking over queenans unit
let me talk to dignam to confirm it
taken a leave of absence
hes very upset
were all very upset
the best thing would be for your to come in
we need you to come in
billy listens to colin go on
then shuts off the phone
his other phone rings
colin dumps out the box of queenans belongings
in the diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects costello is fbi informant
billy listens to colin go on
then shuts off the phone
his other phone rings
costello is sitting with his key guys including french and fitzy
a tv station plays above the zinc bar
billy is drinking hitting it heavily
state police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is that of timothy delahunt an undercover policeman for the city of
this was the scene today
if you have any information about this murder you are urged to call the boston police
the tv shows delahunts body being loaded into an ambulance
a crime scene
costellos eyes have widened slightly
but he is strangely undisturbed
i cant believe it
dont believe what
how the fuck did they find him so fast
i spent all fuckin night out there dragged the poor bastard
i must have been there seven hours
in three feet of mud
what the fuck is a marsh
and who walks their dog in a fuckin marsh
in three feet of water
i dont believe it
i still dont believe hes a fuckin cop
the cops are saying hes a cop so i wont look for the cop
to fitzy are you soft
the next time i tell you to dump a body in the marshes put it in the fuckin marshes not where some guy from john hancock goes every thursday to
get a blowjob
he makes a move for the door
they get up to leave following him
two cars carrying costello and his men are speeding down the highway
behind them two siu cars are trailing
colin closes his door and punches in a number
in costellos car his cell phone rings
he answers it
youve got a tail
not very subtle
they wont be subtle from now on
thats what ive been trying to tell you
get rid of them
theres no need to go yourself frank
get rid of the fuckin tail
close on colin as what he has to do crystallizes
a cold look in his eye colin leaves his office and goes down the hall
costello remarks to french tails
this rat shit is wearing me thin
francis theyre all rats
women are rats
yeah were becoming a nation of rats
brown is there
pull these guys off
tell your team to stop following costello
we dont need to surveil him
colin stands in the door like a gunfighter
everyone looks at him
what the fuck are you talking about
i have it from an undercover costello knows hes being followed
let our uc take him in
he called me when he found out queenan was dead
im running him
everyone is impressed
you give him to me
but i can give you costellos destination
you know where hes going
and what hes about to do
call off the tail and get special ops
get them on standby
we meet him where hes going
were gonna take this prick tonight
to crew on the road all units fall back
everyone moves at once
costello is checking the rearview mirror
he sees the two siu cars exit the highway onto atlantic avenue
the cars exit the highway
the cars pass through a maze of industrial streets
billy riding in the back seat is trying desperately to see where they are
he sees a street sign and taps out a text message on his phone
colin in vest observed by brown reads the message
its the heavy equipment warehouse costello owns on sheffield
he must have a container or a truck in there
his big moment of decision go
it is an unfinished structure the lower parts used the upper parts accessible but still under construction
it is built on a pier the harbor lights beyond it
the command van and police cars pull up with lights off
a tactical van disgorges tactical officers who spread out through the dark
into mic theres an exit on the other side
well take him when he comes out
colin checks the load on his pistol
costello unlocks a container with a construction company logo on it opens the doors and steps back
billy looks into the container
its cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks
men stand around with mp s under their coats
billy trying to save costello
how do you know you dont have a tail
costello looks at him
were you in the fuckin car
what if they took one off and put another one on frank
the drugs having been loaded fast by the crew including fngs the container is hosed out
billy turns from fitzys car as everyone gets it
frank told me to check out the back
you guys go ahead
watch your ass
instead of getting into costellos car on the other side of the container he steps back into shadows as both cars leave
four cars with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as they come out of the garage
costello realizes that something has gone wrong
lights come on and policemen are everywhere guns in their hands
colin is not visible among them
police open fire at costellos car
the car reverses back into the garage
mister french the driver is shot in the arm and the car crashes into a wall
a gunfight opens up
fngs exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and are shot down expertly
costello limping gets out of the action fast
he runs into the parking garage
french drives away alternately is shot or commits suicide
costello shot through the stomach is moving through the dark
all thats stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig
plenty of places to hide
we hear gunfire in the distance
costello hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone
to his surprise the phone rings quite nearby
and keeps ringing
costello moves out into the open and sees at a near distance colin his shadow long on the concrete
he has a gun in his hand
costello moves out to face him
youre an fbi informant
costello comes out of the shadows
jesus colin grow up
course im talking to the fbi
do they know who i am
costello says nothing for a moment
i never gave up anybody who wasnt goin down anyway
colin instantly raises the pistol to shoot him
did you give me up
colins pistol wavers
nobody knows nothin
colin shakes his head and cocks the gun
frank frank do they know about me
i know you colin
you know id never give you up
is that what it is about all that murderin and fuckin and no sons
what are you shooting blanks
costello tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve
hes sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as colin shoots him
costello topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader
then from the bucket loader a post death tremor sets off one last shot from costellos gun
colin fires into the dead body again and again
he backs away
i got costello
i got costello here
colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of costello
dialog separate document
colin enters tired from a debriefing
applause from everyone in the office the full crew
colin is embarrassed by the attention
brown is leading the whole team to a standing ovation
colin looks past the heads of the crowd and sees dignam staring at him evenly
to crowd its not any reason for ah
queenans secretary brings him some wine
no thank you
he takes a glass of wine
then guiltily almost in tears he drinks
brown jerks a thumb towards colins office
hes waited a long time for you
colin looks up and sees howd you get him without the files
on queenans phone
you know that guy
yeah we were classmates together
im gonna go talk to him
colin goes off
in colins office billy sits with his ankle on his knee
he looks very tired dirty
wearing a visitor badge
good to see you trooper
we spoke on the phone
how long have you been undercover
long fuckin time
i cant begin to tell you what a debt we owe you
i want you to know ill be recommending you for the medal of merit
medal of merit
thats kinda like a gold star around here right
its the highest honor we got
i just want my identity back
you want to be a cop again
no being a cops not an identity
i want my identity back
colin takes it
youll have to excuse me
my only contact has been with a police shrink
throat clicks a police shrink
instead of asking the obvious was that
helpful for you
what are you gonna do about the rat in this building
im gonna find him
dont you worry about that
you got anything
did frank ah say anything
im all done being a cop
i just want to get my money and go home
youve given a lot
i can get you your file
i just need your password
the passwords my name william costigan jr
they gave it to me in case something happened to them and i had to explain myself to someone like you
he writes it
colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment
all right bill
just give me a minute
im gonna go in the other room
this computers gone blooey on me
colin accesses the personal database enters the password
billys confidential file opens up
every fact about the man
billy takes a drink from the bottle colin has put on the desk
as he puts the bottle down he sees sticking out of a box a brown envelope
on it is written citizens
billy picks up the envelope
and knows everything
colin is reviewing it billys file
outside the glass wall we see billy staring at colins back
and then moving on
colin enters holding a printout of billys personnel file
he looks around the empty room
he sees the brown envelope lying on the desk and understands everything
he sits down at his own computer which does in fact work and opens the personnel file
colin clicks delete
do you really want to delete
colin clicks yes and billys picture file life disappear
billy exits the police building and moves across the plaza
billy waits outside madolyns office
madolyn carrying work breakfast rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her
shes a little spooked opens her mouth to speak
im not here to
im not here for that
ive got something to
to give to you
something i need you to keep
what is it
stopping her from speaking i need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions
thats for you to hold
he gives her a manila envelope
open this if im dead or if i call you and tell you to open it
please do exactly what it says
exactly what it says please
madolyn is a friend
shes not going to ask questions
she accepts the envelope
im sorry to show up here like this
there was no one else i could give it to
there was no one else
he backs away and then turns to go
he turns ive its been so confused
i just want to say
he turns and looks at her
she doesnt speak cant
whatever you have to say really think about it and if you still want to tell me tell me in two weeks all right
she moves her head slightly watches him go
madolyn sits at her desk devastated looking at a fall of light
the envelope lies on her blotter
she sits on
then straightens up takes a marker and writes costigan on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer
we dissolve to a sonogram
a sonogram picture of a fetus
it looks to him at first like a cctv picture blown up
colin stares as if at something in a horror film
i was dreaming
i was dreaming i was dead
death is hard
life is much easier
referring to the envelope whats this
open it he does
its not a joke its a human being
colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her
colin is in the shower
madolyn moves into the kitchen and puts the kettle on
she checks the mail lying there on the counter
its tied with a string
she undoes the string and sorts through the mail
suddenly she freezes looking at an oversized envelope addressed to colin colin sullivan pickering street apt tk boston ma zip tk with a return address of wm
costigan conant st
madolyn stares at the envelope listening to the shower going
billy has written to her fiance
she starts to put the envelope down and then realizes
she has to hide it
she has to open it
inside the envelope is a jewel case exile on main street
and a note play me now
madolyn puts the cd into the machine
she puts on the headset and listens
colin comes out of the bathroom dressed in jeans and t shirt barefoot his hair wet
he looks at madolyn realizing that something is wrong
madolyn pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers
note this your guys shouldnt have done that
one of us was going to have to die
it tends to be the other guy
colin stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility
im now in charge of everything here
including queenans informers
i cant unlock the files until after the brass squeezes dignam
if the brass squeezes dignam
so dignams the only one with the keys to the kingdom
hes fucking resigning
he put his papers in
hes not talking
give me his location
colin and madolyn stare at each other
i thought i was the liar
i can explain
she goes into the bedroom
colins phone rings
he answers it
billy is walking on the phone happy and twisting the knife
costello recorded everything
he put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer
that was his insurance
his lawyer came to me
costello trusted me the most
imagine that you rat fuck
sound quality good enough
i was a little worried
colin closes a door to speak privately
what do you want
i want my identity you two faced rat prick
where are you
where queenan died
you keep your cell on
colin goes to the bedroom door and tries it
did we not talk about this
this is my job
he starts to punch the door and then does not
colin comes along and walks into the lobby
he is not looking for a tail
colin looks out through the door no gun drawn but very much a cop clearing his corners
he steps out and billy takes him from behind the door his only blind side and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of
get your hands up
put the fuckin gun down
billy turns colin around and puts the pistol to colins forehead hard enough to break the skin
he takes out colins belt gun and puts it in his pocket
billy screams hands
at colin every time he makes a move
i came here to talk some fucking sense to you
you get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin firearm and act professional and i can get you your money
turning him around what did you say
i can get you your
billy cracks him across the jaw with the gun
colin goes down
colin is drooling blood his bell rung one eye open
billy throws away colins ankle gun
spitting teeth fuck shit
going for colins cuffs you didnt come here to talk you fuckin maggot you came here to get arrested

whaling him in the beats but im still fucking arresting you
colin is hammered to his knees
head down blood in his hair drooling blood thinking impossibly about his next move
he seems to realize hes fucked
you are what you do
colin doesnt move
i said get the fuck up
billy grabs the back of colins collar and puts the gun to colins head
a crunch of gravel off
billy and colin both hear it
put down the weapon and step away from sergeant sullivan
billy drags colin to his feet and using colin as a shield aims the pistol at brown
brown is aiming his weapon
i called you
you know who i am
im not gonna shoot
i told you to meet me downstairs
billy realizes hes in a truly shitty situation appearances are everything
put the weapon on the deck and step away from sergeant sullivan
a mess bloody mouthed shoot the fuckin prick
desperqte wheres dignam
i told you to bring dignam
shoot the motherfucker
put the weapon on the ground and well discuss it
he was costellos rat
i got evidence
maybe you do but right now i need you to drop the weapon
i told you ive got the evidence cold linking this prick to costello
brown wavers you fuckin know who i am
im taking him downstairs now
brown weapon ready follows into the elevator lobby
billy moves colin into the elevator and as the doors close looks back at brown still in a mexican stand off
colin nose broken blood masking his face
i cant wait for you to try to explain this to a suffolk county grand jury
this is gonna be fun
the indicator ticks
down down down
just fucking kill me
i am killing you
the doors open and for a frozen moment billy holding the gun on colin stares out of the car
a loud bang
billy is shot through the head
blood sprays the walls and colin is hit by flying blood and matter
billy falls crumpled on his face half in and half out of the elevator
the doors try to close
colin covered with blood looks up
barrigan lowers his pistol
colin slumps covered with blood
barrigan uncuffs him
colin feels his wrists
barrigan picks up billys gun
the other elevator doors open and brown emerges
he looks into the bloody elevator and down at the dead man
holstering his gun shit
barrigan raises billys gun and shoots brown in the head
colin stares at him
did you think you were the only one he had
costello was going to sell us to the fbi
its you and me now
we have to take care of each other
give me that
barrigan casually hands colin billys gun
colin presses the gun against barrigans forehead and fires
police tape plenty of cars
three corpses being loaded onto ambulances
colin hands free is drinking coffee from a paper cup being checked out by a doctor
colin has been cleaned up a little by paramedics
hes maybe had his lip stitched but hes still wearing his bloody clothes
at that time trooper barrigan who i now understand to have been francis costellos informer in siu intercepted us in the lobby and shot trooper william costigan once in the
drinks water at that time barrigan retrieved trooper costigans undercover weapon and shot trooper brown as he was approaching our location
i attempted to subdue trooper barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the walther pistol
i was able to wrestle the weapon away at which time barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me
i was able to get off a single shot striking barrigan in the head
i then checked for vital signs of troopers brown and costigan and discovered that they had expired
colin looks up eyes clear perfectly believable
as we transition to the funeral
bagpipes coming up
id like to go on record that i am recommending trooper william costigan for the medal of merit
bagpipes something like cross of fire as we dissolve to billys gravesite
the same cemetery as his mother is buried in
uniformed policemen not only state but mdc the way they do it for brother officers saluting
madolyn is at the gravesite dry eyed though in distinctly apart from colin
he looks at her
she looks away from him apparently forever
colin squares off his job in the world is to get ahead
a salute is fired with rifles
colin and madolyn are walking through the graves
what about the baby
she moves away from him without answering
madolyn walks out through the cemetery gates
colin has a bag of expensive groceries and wine
living the beacon hill dream
he climbs the steps slowly
he nods to a neighbor an old lady coming down with her dog who incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor and colin briefly seems aware of this
dont be afraid to get a bit french here
he gets to his door and starts to cry and nearly crumples
but he gets the door open
he looks up and sees a gun
behind it stepping fast out of the shadows dignam
avenging a guy he didnt even like because its the right thing to do
colin looks down and sees that dignam has plastic hospital boots on his feet
accepting it sort of but only in a colin way dignam fires
flash groceries fall all over the floor
dignams feet step over colins body crushing one of a half dozen croissants and dignam goes down the expensive staircase leaving the door to the apartment open
the strangest thing happens a rat emerges and begins to eat the dead mans croissants
