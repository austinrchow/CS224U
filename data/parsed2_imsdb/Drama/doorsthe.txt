screenplay by randall jahnson and oliver stone the movie will begin in five moments the mindless voice announced all those unseated will await the next show we filed slowly languidly
into the hall the auditorium was fast and silent as we seated and were darkened the voice continued the program for this evening is not new youve seen this entertainment through and through youve seen your birth your life and death you might recall all the rest did you have a good world when you died
enough to base a movie on
a dark silence hovers along the deserted bunker like studio
mike stands and booms shadow a grand piano
the engineer waits in the booth lit alert man bored fiddling
hey jim its your birthday man whaddaya say we try this another night
camera moving tentatively along the shadows discovering the sidelight on a navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair moving to a candles orange flutter on pages written with verse
a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of irish bushmills whiskey
off kill the lights a little more will ya john
they might drop a bit more
camera crawling past the fingers weaving a new cigarette out of the marlboro pack
an ashtray full of butts
and an asthmatic horrid cough filled with phlegm
crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey with on it
stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot an american indian in full headdress
off hey man how come the doors arent in on this
camera revealing james douglas morrison poet buried in the shadows curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted sensuous eyes meditative lips scragged with beard and long greasy hair not a
pretty sight yet a man full and bold and struggling for survival through his words
beneath the bushmill moon he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently in our face no music no doors
is everybody in
is everybody in
is everybody in
the ceremony is about to begin
he shakes a tambourine at the mike and one of his sudden giant indian yells rock through the studio
music riffs from american prayer
audience sounds ghostly on the track
the engineer reeling backwards from the sudden shift in sound cursing silent
let me tell you about the heartache and the loss of god wandering wandering in hopeless night indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell
wind sounds the grin on jims face magnesium flares out to the blinding yellowness of the desert so barren so hot it stings to look at
an old chevrolet winds through the yellow orange landscape beneath a brooding blue sky crackling with electricity the storm coming in in the distance as the music writhes out at
us like a reptile from under a rock the beat of riders on the storm
riders on the storm into this house were born into this world were thrown like a dog without a bone an actor out on loan riders on the storm continues
over imagery me and my mother and father and grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn and a truckload of indian workers had either hit another car or just i dont know what happened
indians were scattered all over the highway bleeding to death
mom dad the youngest baby in the front seat pointing at the storm
grandma grandad in the back with jim about and his sister asleep
moms a beauty and dads an austere handsome military man in civilian clothes mouthing words look wake them up a desert storm
but we barely hear a lightning bolt shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound frightening dawn of creation
grandma nudging jim awake
his eyes open just as the car turns the bend revealing an overturned truck lying in the road dead and wounded indians everywhere
a cop car ambulance
a terrible accident
the first thing jim sees
an old indian face staring at him
the car pulling alongside dad rolling his window down
asking if he can help soundless a line of wailing indian moms scared face
but it was the first time i tasted fear
i musta been about four like a child is just like a flower his head is floating in the breeze
grandma trying to hide jims face but he looks back
the kid looking back through the rear window terrified his first view of death
the bodies the sense of doom overlaying the land a childs worst nightmare
its just a dream jimmy just a dream continues theres a killer on the road his brain is squirming like a toad take a long holiday let your children play
if you give this man a ride sweet family will die theres a killer on the road the boys eyes going back to the indian man looking at him
then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the asphalt
the dying mans face twisted moaning amazing eyes at the point of death they settle on jim its just a dream jimmy just a dream a strange sound occurs the
rattle of an ancient gourd shi chi chi shi chi chi
something flying through the air
a bull roarer a whirling leather thong announcing the appearance of a shaman
into jim his eyes staring out the back his receding point of view the indians the overturned truck
the reaction i get now looking back is the soul of the ghosts of those dead indians maybe one or two of them were just running around freaking out and
just leaped into my soul and theyre still there
wind music girl you gotta love your man take him by the hand make him understand the car pulling away across the giant s landscape panning up the black chino
pants to jim morrison now steel seamans suitcase in hand thumbing a ride the road sign behind him saying los angeles miles the world on you depends our life will never end girl you gotta love your man a large lizard in the dust cocks its head blinks as the boots walk by to the car pulling over
jim in the backseat packed with husband wife children dog mother in law
between boy and man eyes ancient and new
he wears his favorite color black torn black chinos paint spotted black t shirt a slouch his favorite pose but the eyes and smile can be warm and shy like
a little boy gentle surface storm in the brain
the husband now looking at jim a little nervously pushes up the perry como on the radio
as it cuts to a sudden news flash from the texas school book depository
president john f
kennedy was shot a few minutes ago in dallas
slow motion the husbands face distorting saying something on the track like what
but its subdued low
trying other stations
jim turns to look out his window as if he already knew
nd voice taken to parkland memorial hospital
theres no word on the presidents condition
the wifes and husbands voices seem lost in the background
oh god oh god
not the president for christs sake
oh god whos on jim staring out the window
riders on the storm on the desert
credits continue to their conclusion as we segue into the blueness of venice california the dawn of a new age
all was possible
individual shots of the boardwalk throbbing with a feast of hippies head shops artists drawing psychedelic murals pot smokers muscle builders tambourines accompanying the transister radios on the beach boys
and i got you babe dogs chasing frisbees bikini bodies on the beach lsd sold over the counter
set to the upbeat chords of hello i love hello i love you wont you tell me your name
hello i love you let me jump in your game shes walking down the street blind to every eye she meets do you think youll be the guy to make
the queen of the angels sigh
jim in torn black chinos no shirt walking real slow past it all carrying a notebook of his own and a paperback of baudelaire his eyes settling on
a young beauty and her yellow labrador a fashionable thin long red haired th century fox in jeans moving through the crowd
he thinks about it a fraction of eternity and hes off
she moves along its banks as if the universe moved to her rhythm turning once to look back
jim caught in her eyes
now hes the one seized by doubt
he slows pretends to take another interest
she holds her head so high like a statue in the sky her arms are wicked and her legs are long when she moves my brain screams out this song
as she turns into another street he resumes following her
she gets to a house goes in
theres a group of people partying
he stops watches
sidewalk crouches at her feet like a dog that begs for something sweet do you hope to make her see you fool
do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel
the two story house has a quaint run down charm
friends have dropped by people smoking joints beers
shes on the upstairs balcony talking with a young man professor type in his s who passes her a joint
jim lurks in the shadows of the trees hes been standing outside watching
the music shifts to the quieter love she lives on love street lingers long on love street she has a house and garden i would like to see what happens
the young man gestures and goes back inside the house
shes alone now on the balcony sitting on a kitchen table
its now or never
jim scales the tree alongside the house with the agility of a gymnast
she has robes and she has monkeys lazy diamond studded flunkies she has wisdom and knows what to do she has me and she has you the girls grinding up
pot in an old shoebox with a spoon and kitchen strainer
she looks up and sees his crotch three feet from her face balanced there effortlessly on the railing like a highwire act opens her mouth in surprise
jim drops softly to the balcony a smile of disarming gentleness
looking at the tree you have a problem with doors
waste of time
his head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder he drawls southern gentleman polite slow thoughtful as if he had all the time in the world as if the guy would
never come back
i followed you
from the beach
you followed me
youre the one
kisses her swiftly softly right on the lips
mesmerized awkward wow
looks back maybe you should meet my old man
you got a name
he looks into her face
classic american face freckles big round eyes soft as rain long sunset red hair
she feels his intense starving eyes
he kisses her a second time
the young man coming back with the rolling paper sees him
as he hops back on the railing swings out into the tree looks back once
she must decide
the young man within earshot
the ice broken in that instant
jim and pam pam and jim
the man abreast of pamela as if hes seen a vision
who the hell was that
everythings cool thats jim
my new friend
on the screen a mm black and white student film of a stunning blond in black bra panties garters dancing in black heels on top of a tv set
panning down to images of goose stepping nazis and a nuremberg rally on the set
sounds of lovemaking and an indian peyote ceremony from the track an indian holy man incanting
jims voice comes on the track as well
nietzche said all great things must first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity
listen children to the sound of the nuremberg night
students in the audience groan at the pretention of it
moving to jims eyes hidden in his parka hood peeking through at the screen
a closeup now of jim on screen looking straight into the lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe and winks
on screen have you ever seen god
a symmetrical angel
fucking the sun
your hand tasted
rare meat corn water and wine ad lib ssssssss
ego trip man cmon
ray manzarek a tall student with powerful voice and manner thick glasses long hair sweeping down over his eyes leans over to jim
hey man its great dont listen to em its non linear man its poetry man everything godard stands for
the lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker off
hissing and a big bronx cheer summarize the feelings of the odd students crammed into a bunker like theater
a youngish instructor stirs to the front row from a row of upset faculty
hands shooting up to criticize
this is pretty shocking stuff mr
and i might say indulgent
naziism and masturbation when used for shock value are not art
but to be constructive lets start with your intention
what was it
it was a bore
laughter trick bones and jack three friends sitting next to jim shoot their hands up
hey it was bettern a warhol picture
no it wasnt
it was worse
a guy sleeping for seven hours
is less pretentious
there was no political consciousness
hey hold on man
you guys are the facists
it takes genitalism to absurdity man just cause the squares here cant dig it cause the film schools still so square
oh cmon man give it a break
beatniks go home
take another mushroom
a cacophony of voices critics emotions blend out over jims quiet eyes
hold it down
morrison what are your feelings
walks out jim bones trick jack approaching the bar
music of gloria blasting from the door chicks popping in and out definitely college crowd circa
to jim hey man whatdya expect an oscar
you cant quit you gotta voice
people cant dig cause they dont understand yet
if youre an individual if youre too good they wanna cut your dick off
look what happened to orson wells

they didnt get it
so make your films and fuck what they think

he slows a dramatic young lion pose surveying the girls
yeah whadday you think
you really want to know what i think
the cronies wait anticipating something inescapably evil to escape his lips
yeah yeah whatddaya think
i think we gotta get really ripped
tall bespectacled ray manzarek is banging out gloria on the piano in bad jerry lee lewis style
i tell you bout my baby bout five foot four from head to toe she came to my room just bout midnight she makes me feel so good she makes
me feel alright camera moving to reveal john densmore wiry solid on the drums
moving on to robbie krieger wispy ethereal looking the youngest flamenco type moves on his early electric guitar
also a harmonica player and a base
they all seem slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback or rays warbling but the crowd couldnt care less a german beerhall they want noise and sex
jim and his gang beers in hand mouth back the words beers everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling everyone on their feet nuts with spring fever
jim eyeing the girl next to him
you know what id like to do to you
waiting intrigued no what
you really want to know what id like to do to you
the football team types edge over nearby one of them picking out jim with a glare
whispering wanna hear the scream of the butterfly
she looks puzzled by the suggestion
eluding the man can we have a couple of beers
youre not even an asshole man youre a semihole
he evades the football mans grasp elusive physicality
he hops over tables heading for the stage
other kids are up on the stage dancing but jim goes right up alongside ray shaking his hips like elvis
ray giving him the mike
singing she came to my room she came on my floor she came on my bed she came on my face ooooooh i want to wrap your legs around my
head baby baby and her name was gloria they love it
the place going wild
the girl with the football player wanting him
jim is insane on beers in the back seat reaching over the wheel to try to drive the car for ray who is flailing at him
jim pulling rays hair
barely comprehensible jammed into the sedan are trick bones robbie john
as he winds down the window and starts crawling out of the car
ray weaving to avoid another vehicle
his waist is out the window john and all grabbing for his heels
special effect jims head six inches from pavement moving at mph through heavy traffic
screaming laughing like a maniac
beeping horns all over the place
in the car madness raging chaos the four boys pulling him in
a figure moving
shake dreams from your hair my pretty child my sweet one choose the day and choose the sign of your day the days divinity the first thing you see jim
slides her upstairs door open crawls in next to her bed
shes asleep with her boyfriend
he touches her toe
she awakes startled
come on come out for a walk its a pretty night
jim and pamela moving along the byways
a clear starry california night
a vast radiant beach and a cool jewelled moon couples naked race down by its quiet side and we laugh like soft mad children theres a crash
they turn bristling
a coyote lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp pulling its head from an overstuffed garbage can looking back at them
fires on the boardwalk
hippies bums older people
jim and pam move through talking skipping touching like children
smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy the music and voices are all around us choose they croon the ancient ones the time has come again the two of
them race down by its side slowing to a walk
loved orphan voice
can i stay with you tonight
we could talk till dawn
i just dont want to be alone
just talk though
no funny stuff
ive been real upset
i lost my car on the freeway yesterday
i left it somewhere and i cant remember where and when i went back it was gone
i bet you never expected life could be this hard
strokes her hair affectionately and youre still so young
she breaks into sobs seeking his arms
he hugs her
i wonder where well be ten years from now
i really dont want to know come on
choose now they croon beneath the moon beside an ancient lake enter again the sweet forest enter the hot dream come with us everything is broken up and dances their
silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old structure overlooking the boardwalk
pam glancing through jims notebooks as they sit on his sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner overlooking moon ocean scudding clouds and a vast forest of television antennas
fires burn from the beach
in the notebooks at intervals during the conversation we see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic william blake mode with writing between
books are everywhere panning kerouac ginsberg nietzsche rimbaud mailer artaud mythological works shamanistic books a library of stolen ideas
reading looking these are like beautiful
i never read much poetry in school
i hated it
whats a shaman
mispronounces hes the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance
and he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them
its the same in all cultures greeks jesus
some indians say the first shaman invented sex
hes the one who makes you crazy
are you a shaman
uh pause no
i just write about it
what turns you on
i dont know
peyotes like love
when its given its blessed
when its sold its damned
i like peyote
i like acid its easier to get
i like the spiritual voyage
the first time i did acid i saw god
i had a friend who was christ
and he was judas too
i suddenly knew the secret of everything that were all one the universe is one
and that everything is beautiful
i dont know
i think youre alive by confronting death by experiencing pain
i think youre alive by recognizing beauty seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is
were all saying the same thing
its love me and ill love you
looks at her ironic its only thru death that you know life
jesus medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life
do you love death
i think life hurts a lot more than death
when you die the pain is over
pam shivers a strange thought
why do i look at you
and see my death
pause shrugs no thats ridiculous
i bet your dads a school teacher
how did you know
i dont know
what was your father
military i bet you moved around a lot
yeah about times
how many sisters and brothers
shes the pretty one
i love your neck
she gets in his lap he runs his fingers thru her hair kissing her gently
but one the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug thats beautiful
who did you write it for
i wrote it for you
the panties coming off
rousseau dangling from the venice moon
he moves a little over excited nervous more awkward than we might expect
take your time jim
theres no hurry im all you have to do tonight
well the clock says its time to close now i guess id better go now
as we depart the rooftop
your fingers weak with minarets speaking secret alphabets i light another cigarette learn to forget learn to forget learn to forget possibly we hear the soft backbeat of moonlight drive
ray manzarek is meditating in yoga posture longer hair as well in his post graduate phase sandals colorful hippie shirt
but the meditation is not going well
hes shaking his head at himself frowning
jim has approached closer amused looking down
hey ray try acid man its guaranteed
ray opening his eyes his pov jim slouched jacket over his shoulder sun behind him
last trip i thought i was going through hells digestive system
something painted by hieronymus bosch
i never had a bummer on acid
i like naturally high man

johnnys in the basement mixing up the medicine im on the pavement thinking about the government
but hes got the words man
thats what they want
suddenly sings lets swim to the moon un hunh lets climb thru the tide penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide jim has crouched digging his hand in
as the grains spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed
ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand
all of a sudden were in rays pov a mystical moment
jim singing no sound then pure song unadulterated by atmosphere
lets swim out tonight love its our turn to try parked beside the ocean on our moonlight drive jim stops shrugs
ray looks at him a long beat
intense eyes the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot be stopped
yknow man those are hot lyrics really hot
pleased could you write the music for that down if we went over to your place could you write that on your organ
are you kidding
i could fly

sides are being chosen
people wanna fight or fuck love or kill everythings gonna flame
the planets screaming for change morrison

jim laughs loves rays ardor as they move along the ocean side
there oughta be great orgies man
like when dionysus arrived in greece he made all the women mad leaving their homes and dancing off in the mountains
great golden copulations in the streets of la
looks at a passing girl hey do you know her
what do we call ourselves
i got a name
facial distaste thats the most ridiculous
then you mean the doors in your mind
like the huxley book
the doors of perception
yeah sure mescaline experiments reducing the sugar flow to the brain
its from william blake actually the line when the doors of perception are cleansed things will appear as they truly are
its great jim
so where do we start
how do we start
where are the girls
youre moving off the rooftop and in with me and dorothy
as they walk off the two of them along the edge of the pacific
a dog jumping for a frisbee
the music of moonlight drive now riffs over the real song now
lets swim to the moon lets climb thru the tide penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide
the first heavy strains of break on through driving over the dissolve
it sounds bad technically but its hot
random raw screams and shouting
pam is crosslegged on the floor clapping to the music number one fan
live the day destroys the night night divides the day tried to run tried to hide break on thru to the other side jim straining to make it work jumping
around violent still not in control
john cutting out
thats really square
lets hip it up
jump on your cues
tighten it up
stay with the beat jim
lets try it again come on

on floor i think its hot
strumming i still think the lyrics are weird man
frustrated i still think it sounds like the bottom of a fishbowl man
to robbie aggravated then you write one man
we need more songs anyway
we all gotta go back and write
theyre drained tired in a large rehersal living room feet high fronted by large glass windows looking out at the beach at marina
the room is filled with golden gorgeous setting sunlight
pamela goes to the kitchen with dorothy rays japanese fiancee
i been working on something goes like this
chords his guitar you know that it would be untrue you know that i would be a liar if i was to say to you girl we couldnt get much

i call it light my fire
i figger if im gonna compete with your stuff its gotta be about earth fire or snakes
dont underestimate death

clicking excited why not
a minor to b minor
that then is jazz
but it needs a hook
give me some space
i need some space
leave the room guys
the three excluded doors head out to the beach like obedient schoolboys while ray fools with his organ
as they go out jim hugging robbies head to his shoulder as they feel the excitement of a new song
irritated at ray guys obnoxious man always bossin people around
i thought we were equals
to robbie that was great robbie
whaddaya thinking about when you play

yelling from the house sieg heil
as they head back
tight on ray like a schoolmaster cueing them
okay here it is
bach and rock
count it off john clicking
crack it goes
the famous organ intro to light my fire blends over the room like magic carrying jim robbie john dorothy pamela along over a row of nightclubs glisten off the hoods
of passing traffic
marquees announce the byrds red rooster love the herd turtles captain beefheart
the clubs are pandoras box the headlights and neon intercut with documentary type shots of teenagers hippies longhairs running summer rampant banging tambourines
cops busting kids against cars on the street as parents go by rolling up their windows
the action was on the street
light my fire carries over the montage
you know that it would be untrue etc
last session the music was new black polished chrome and came over the summer like liquid night
the doors band from venice on the marquee
moving down to a motley crew of teenage girls underage trying to get past the bouncer
the sounds of break on through carry past when the doors open and close admitting a sailor
approaching to nd girl is that horny motherfucker in the black pants here tonight
cant get in without an oh please
i forgot my i
im on the list
i forgot my list
break on through blasting out at us from a sleazehole half full bikers sailors hookers a baseball game on the tv
a dance floor the size of a bed the doors on a tiny platform above the bar london newspapers on the wall
live we chased our pleasures here dug our treasures there can you still recall the time we cried break on through to the other side some groupies have formed a
small fan club at the base of the stage muscling past pam but most people ignore them drinking arguing dancing to their own fuckbeats
possibly this has something to do with the fact that jim sings with his back to all of them
john looking over furious at ray who mutters under the music
turn around jim
come on let em in
i found an island in your arms a country in your eyes arms that chained us eyes that lied jim jumps around violently to the front getting the attention of
rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand leaning against it not yet comfortable with the extrovert side of himself eyes closed but starting to enjoy it
he sings to pam
jerry the ex vice cop manager who runs the joint cant understand the appeal talking to jim and robbie who are packing and hauling their equipment out
dorothy is there
innocently so jerry

ignoring her what shit day destroys the night crawl back in your brain go insane

on the crowd
a few raise their hands smile
we iris in on the doors suddenly a strange sound reverse iris on jim feeling it now
jims pov pam irising out
this strange sound in his ears a rattle of an indian gourd similar to what we heard in the car in arizona when jim was a boy
now a distant indian drum beating
the beginning strains of the end dribble in
a dented red chevrolet fishtails on a dry mudflat whipping up dustdevils
theyre all laughing strange noise in a circle somewhere on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent rocks and cacti
a football huddle of faces ray john robbie jim the four doors
laughing with the first mad impulse of the peyote
pam is vomiting her brains out as dorothy tries to comfort her on the edge of a cliff
jim panthers up the dune
everybody having a good time
she throws up again
awright pretty good it gets better
jim holds his head
feels the ride
jump cuts jim and pam are touching each other
sand falls from pams hand
jim turns to hawk at a bird
then pam is dancing alone on the dune
abruptly jim is back in the circle with the doors in a sense torn between them and pam
extreme closeups of their faces their eyes the tensions of the trip tearing apart their teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part
when the serpent appears his head is ten feet long and five feet wide
he has one red eye and one green eye
hes deadly and hes seven miles long
as he moves on his scales is written all the history of the world all people all actions all of us our little pictures on the scales god its big
and its eating as it moves all the time devouring digesting consciousness power a monster of energy
john shutters as does robbie and ray
jim seems possessed
we must kiss the snake on the tongue if it senses our fear it will eat us instantly
but if we kiss it without fear the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate
to our freedom we must ride this snake
to the end of time
he has instilled a flux of fear in the group
i think im fucked up
im not thinking right
youre fucked up john
go with it confusion is the sound of creation
you should see your eyes right now youre death
look at your eyes youre crazy man you look crazy
you scare me
no no no john john
god is crazy too
god is part insane as well as sane
not in control all the time
dionysus was the god of the wine
he made ecstasy but he also made madness
madness is all right
thats what you want isnt it isnt it
wheres that joint
crying i get scared thinking of all the choices inside
i could go
i could stay
i can live anywhere
i could die now if i wanted
its limitless choice
and no one cares
what the fuck
wandering in i dont know what i am
im on the cusp of sagittarius and capricorn
sagittarius is wild and capricorn domestic and safe so i dont know which one to be
jim looking at her smiles
i love you
into the same lens oh my god the light its so beautiful ray
can you see it
its all one
ray has his head buried in his hands
im in pain man
i want something from the peyote
i feel the universe functioning perfectly but im still perfectly locked inside myself
instead of oneness i feel total isolation
jim all i feel is pain
pain makes me feel more alive ray
pain is meant to wake us up
people try to hide their pain but theyre wrong
i feel lust
i want to fuck everything i can and i know it will never be enough
whispers pam wants you
normal youre a good catholic john you want it so you can feel guilty about it
fuck death away john
i feel fear
so bad i just numb out all my feelings
im afraid of my father im afraid of yahweh
i wish i could play my guitar
maybe you should kill your father robbie
he tried to kill you
im so fucking scared
but youre alive
fear pain lust weve got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men
dont feel ashamed of yourselves dont let society destroy your reality
our freedoms the only thing worth dying for its the only thing worth living for
he takes ray and robbies hands his voice calming them reform the circle
not all will enter the gates at evening
cold sweats im not gonna make it man
im scared jim im still scared
blindness is coming on
then use us john use our strength its us four now a tribe of warriors everything we have comes from the same source the great creator of being
trust him trust us
ride the snake
i promise you i will be with you till the end of time
pulling john into the circle bonding their four heads sunk to the desert floor jim making wild indian sounds deep throated shoooh
now humming a song from the desert
my wild love went riding
she rode all the day
she ride to the devil
and ask for him to pay
shooo shoooo the others join in his chant the four rising and falling like a collective breath
ad lib she went to the desert she went to the sea joseph we did see
suddenly jim breaks and rises out of the circle
ray robbie john all looking at him
the same need
pamela the desperation of her eyes
to himself im lying to you
i am scared
he goes his boots in the sand
jim where are you going
looking back ill be back
i gotta go alone
pamela calling from another dune far away
come here dance
dont go away
his pov of her receding
she screams for him
hes in pain
cannot help her
a bird of prey in the sky
jim moving across a lunar landscape
special effect the sun is black like night or else white in a black sky
voices in the distance
jim where are you going
a mothers voice a fathers voice
can you picture what will be so limitless and free desperately in need of some strangers hand in a desperate land lost in a roman wilderness of pain and all
the children are insane waiting for the summer rain jim in the back of a car in the desert looking back
at the overturned truck the bodies in the road
at the older indian looking at him
finally at the dying indian
the child alone
on the living room floor
drawing his sketches in a book
moms feet moving past then dads feet
we may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents come in from the boys eyes which never leave the sketch he is drawing
an old woman is beckoning to him from an opening in the face of the mountain
then shes gone
jim bounds towards the crevice
he is in an isolated cathedral of rocks
the crone muttering leaving through another crevice
suddenly a mountain lion is visible stretched hugely across a rock
it growls ferociously upset and suddenly shoots out the back of the cave
jim thunderstruck gaping
a gallery of ancient indian petroglyphs surround him on all sides
curious oblong figures buffalo sacred deer and bear creatures of the hunt hunters and their weapons rain clouds masked deities proclaiming the answers to the mysteries the story of creation
camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities staring at him from the wall an eagles face
theres danger on the edge of town ride the kings highway weird scenes inside the gold mine ride the kings highway west baby the sound of a rattle shichishichi he
realizes hes being watched
he whips his eyes everywhere
a large lizard perches on a boulder assesses him calmly tatters of a former skin clinging to its throat spits a forked tongue and drills its black pearly eyes into
now the sound of the bull roarer whipping the air announcing the appearance of the shaman
jims struck with an overwhelming sense of
the lizard is looking at him
the ghost of the dead indian is also looking at him
we are looking at jim from its point of view a blur of light some headdress a sense of skins
music drops back no lyrics
the voice is old familiar possible spanish descent dialect or huararchi
you are a prince among white men yet you are a warrior among us
you are ready now
go out walk with the pain of the world travel to the end of the wind and change it for all men as you were born to do
the voice the pretense the glow too quickly fades leaving jim so alone not sure what he has heard yet he knows he has heard and he knows he has
seen and once you have seen it will never be the same again
jim exits the cave
extreme close on jims eyes as he continues with the end
ride the snake ride the snake to the lake the ancient lake the snake is long seven miles ride the snake hes old and his skin is cold camera pulling
out from his eyes
theres something different tonight
something in the air
his eyes are open hes facing outward gripping the mike for his life hair falling in his face dripping sweat we sense all his soul concentrated in what he has
cliques of groupies have staked claims at the foot of the stage eyes fucking him as he writhes spreading his legs
every twitch every moment he sucks out the tension on the musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his audience
nobody is moving in the club
the dancers are still the go go girls in their white plastic boots and dresses hang motionless in their gilded cages
even the waitresses have stopped frozen with their trays denying something is going to happen
jerry from the fog also the manager of this place watches from the balcony shaking his head doesnt understand
panning to two record types with him jac holzman distinguished six footer suit and paul rothchild funky pigtailed ex con early s
the west is best get here and well do the rest the blue bus is calling us driver where you taking us
the band has come together fully now
robbies fingers sliding across the trembling strings staring at the ceiling wandering around the darkened portions of stage left he feels jim echoes him back with his flamenco blues guitar
john on drums reading jims moods throws in the spontaneous and violent riffs that keep it savage
he literally tortures jims ears with his drums
and ray concentrated with his nodding head like a big flamingo over his keyboard mixing it up throwing curves yet also and more delicately torturing jim with the messianic organ
sounds that shriek in his ears
there is something of merlin in ray the alchemist knowing how to play jim
and jim that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the world to live out the words of the
the killer awoke before dawn he put his boots on he took a face from the ancient gallery and he walked on down the hall ray looks over up from
his board catches robby with a whats this
they go with it improvising
jim clutching the mike tighter seeking solace in its arms it all hangs in the air as if he doesnt have any idea what hes going to say next
he went to the room where his sister lived and he paid a visit to his brother and then he went on down the hall
pamela sensing something is coming
the go go dancers
and he came to a door and he looked inside father
i want to kill you
flash a fathers face any face older any man
i want to
flash a mothers face any face older a woman the screams primal pure jim indian savagery ripped from the depths of his soul of his pain bouncing off the walls
as the audience gasps shocked stunned
as the guitar hits a high horrid reverb jim in slightly slow motion suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted and shoots violently backwards hitting the floor like a puppet
cut from his string we sense jim himself has crossed a barrier now gone into yet another stage of his performance a stage from which he can never return
like the gunfighter who has killed his first man
ray sees it instantly where its going hits the organ
robbie and john follow
the instruments explode all at once trying to bury jim in his primal unmistakeable scream
the club in shock
tribal taboo broken in one instant
jerry exploding off the balcony toward the stage
pamela extremely moved and impressed and dorothy
the go go girls as jaded as they come are stunned tension
the groupies love it
jim has jumped up now dancing an indian war dance around the mike
come on baby take a chance with us and meet me in the back of the blue bus doona blue rog onna blue bus doona blue yeah
come on yeah
jim is being muscled out the door by jerry livid
youre outta here
you dont ever come back to play you dont ever come back to drink youre dead on the strip
ranting back at him kill the father fuck the mother kill the father fuck the mother thats what im into
thats what im into
jerry pinning jim to the wall you morrison
youre fucking filthy twisted perverse punk get back to your fucking sewer
calmly smiling you have the face of a pig man
lost in the melee ray and john springing jim back from likely death jerry jerry
he was talking about oedipus
pushing shoving scrambling
past a long haired journalist yelling into a payphone
as they rumble by him all yelling at once
into the street
the doors go sailing out followed by one of their drums john and robbie restraining jim from going back in
wanting to come after jim but restrained now by the record moguls holzman and rothchild
come on jerry cool it cool it
hes a kid its a song about dying changing
jac holzman pushing past to ray
pamela separating jim visually from jerry
to ray and robbie well never work again man
the mafia controls all these clubs
to ray and robbie quite a night
hi im jac holzman
i own elektra records
knows the name oh sure hi
holzman pauses a dramatic presence six foot two impeccably dressed he knows the weight of his words
i think if you could just put what you did in there on record we could really have something
and we could make a lot of money
it hangs there
john and robbie sharing looks
pointing to rothchild coming up yeah
and rothchild here was born to be your producer
recognizing paul hey the guy that did butterfield
bertold brecht cabaret and rock
give me a fucking break
you guys are amazing
lets go make a record
to ray pointing back at jerry hey is that asshole gonna pay us
amused why dont you go inside and ask him jim
strains of light my fire cross the cut
four track tape system is rolling
you know that it would be untrue you know that i would be a liar if i was to say to you girl we couldnt get much higher camera moving
fast thru the control room past the engineer bruce botnick taciturn s the producer paul rothchild in pig heaven and the owner jac holzman in his blue suit watching
hey bruce you feel it
im having big fun
to jac i got goosebumps jac
this is history going down here
an album of killer music in six days
camera moving fast past a smiling pam watching out to the doors on the floor jamming
on to jim in the vocal booth headphone to his ears
come on baby light my fiiirrrreeee
the song now fully orchestrated rolling on over the following montage after song pretty good
light my fire continues
documentary footage of the human be in the summer of love swarming flower children war protestors
a staged mm
grainy shot of jim and pamela ray and dorothy john robbie and their two new girlfriends wandering thru the crowd sharing the spirit
pam and jim fool around laughing tickling each other for the home movie camera shot by ray
pam is goofy makes funny faces teases him running a flower under his nose thru his hair then trips him
he chases her across the lawn
the crowd is beautiful candles incense sticks flowers vibes of peace and love
the instrumental of light my fire is playing but only three doors are on stage till jim comes swinging across on a rope like tarzan all the way across the
stage then drops down rebounds lithely and hits the mike
singing the time to hesitate is through no time to wallow in the mire
jim swandives into the stoned crowd with the mike at the instrumental section a colored spotlight flecking him girls kiss him
the guys want to be him the girls want him and he knows it teasing and tantalizing them
try now we can only lose and our love become a funeral pyre come on baby light my fire try to set the night on bodyguards running in to pull
him out as hes tossed like a limp god over the heads of the crowd rolling like a buoy on a rocking sea from hand to hand dionysus devoured limb from limb by the little girls
pamela watching from the side curtain
alabama song whisky bar now kicks in with its comic brechtian strain as we sequence omitted from original script
screaming fans chase the doors to a commercial airplane scribbling autographs
one of the girls smacking jim on the lips as he laughs her cameras clicking
pamela shooting a home movie of it pushed aside by the crowd rescued by robbie and the new young manager bill siddons
oh show me the way to the next whisky bar oh dont ask why oh dont ask why the city as seen by jims face pressed to the window pamela
next to him hugging each other
real close hugging her i dont mind dying in a plane crash a smile on my face
cutting his food as compared to what
i just dont want to go out slow brain tumor botulism
i want to feel what its like cause death is only going to happen to you once
i dont want to die ever what a weird thing to say
for if we dont find the next whisky bar i tell you we must die i tell you i tell you i tell you we must die a limousine pulling
up in front of the ed sullivan marquee
the sidewalk is mobbed with fans mostly young girls
oh moon of alabama we now must say goodbye weve lost our good ol mama we must have whiskey oh you know why jim looking out at the mob with
the other doors and pamela
the look on his face is ironic
his pov the young girls faces arms grasping at the windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra their faces deformed by silent screams we hear faint strangled shrieks below the
police and security pressing them back linking arms to clear a path for the doors
show me the way to the next little girl oh dont ask why oh dont ask why the girls crying hysterically as jim lazily leopardly moves across the crowd almost
like oswald waiting for the ruby bullet but with that sweet pleasant smile on his face dark glasses concealing
faint oh jimmmmm pleeeaaase look i looove youuuuu jimmmmmm pleeeeeaase jimmmmm here sign miiiine
take a picture jim
jim jim oh please look at me jim
their voices distorting
a girlchild squeezing thru the cordon with the fatal bullet
in slightly slow motion jim seeing her come
as she glues herself hip to hip lip to lip with jim her hands clawing at his leather pants
it takes two cops to peel her off
jim is gracious with everyone signs patiently talks kisses shakes hands with the boys lets them touch his hair his body poses for a picture seems to like it
for if we dont find the next little girl i tell you we must die i tell you i tell you i tell you we must die the nervous producer
herb leading mr
sullivan thru the corridor to the doors dressing room past several acts getting ready to go on
animals tumblers a soprano wailing
right this way mr
theyre called the doors
they got the number one single in the country light your fire
light your fire
is that sooo
they look pretty grungy but were
make up artists pancaking the faces of the doors the nightmare coming true
ray in a white suit with too many pinstripes
robbie a spearmint turtleneck beads long sideburns john in red velveteen head to foot with a tie dye splotch on the front of it
their hairs being violated enough by a nervous gay black hair designer to make them totally self conscious and nervous about their first live tv appearance all except jim who
remains in his signature black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles watching a portable tv
a girl leaving his side crossing pamela
eye contact between them speaks of pamelas jealousy
indignant youre gonna cut it
doing john no im going to worship it
what kind of shampoo are you using
the kind you get in hotels
pamper yourself sweetheart you dont want split ends youre a celebrity now
moving to ray you have very serious serious hair it needs to rebel
ill give it a tinge of something freaky
id rather stay the same color
what about me
a look honey we dont have enough time
television insert images of detroit burning summer of
here in detroit people dead more than injured
buildings burned people have just lost their homes as detroit joins more than cities torn by riots this hot summer
on jim as they pancake him reflective
no wonder light my fires number one
to jim what about you handsome
friendly the biggest mistakes in my life have been haircuts
dont wash it
dont set it
he likes it the way it is
backing off all right be mean
commotion from the doorway as the producer leads the lock jawed mr
sullivan in with everyone bowing and scraping to the pope
boys meet mr
sullivan waves from the doorway
hi boys heard your song light that fire herb corrects think youre great
good luck out there
ad lib oh thanks mr
moving alongside ray well the guys at network have told us they have a small problem with the lyrics girl we couldnt get much higher
you cant say higher on network so they asked if
you could say girl we cant get much better
can you dig that
a look from the guys
tension in the air
how bout girl you couldnt bite my wire
the producer puzzled a beat
it doesnt go down
i dont think standards and practices would
sullivan exiting waving at no one in particular like nixon would
look you boys dont forget to smile now
dont be so sullen out there
uh well were kind of a sullen group ed
siddons reassuring the producer
well work it out herb promise

not totally convinced exiting groovy
uh you boys should know mr

what are we the beatles now john
laughs its only a word man
the stones changed
hey ray why dont you change your name to sid or irving manzarek or something
its only a word yknow
its my words
i dont care lets just jam
rays seething tension
younger brother starting to get out of hand
sullivan stiffly introducing them
now here on our stage direct from los angeles california ladies and gentlemen the doors
the lights come up on the doors in their ultimate nightmare each door appearing consecutively in a lightspot as jim sings the ubiquitous light my fire trapped in this elvis
presley vegas act he looks like he couldnt care less
doors hang suspended everywhere on the set their name spelled out in big block standup letters
jim has a hard on in his pants barely concealed by his tight leathers
in control booth whats that
get off it
wheres he going
jim misses his marks deliberately the camera having a hard time following him
you know that it would be untrue you know that i would be a liar if i was to say to you girl we couldnt get much higher come on
baby light my fire the producers freaking out
hyperventilating he said it
he said it
on national tv you cant do that
you cant do that
you blew it you little shit
youll never play ed sullivan again
jim on the monitors singing through to his freedom falls on the floor flat the camera missing him completely
come on baby light my fire try to set the night on fiiiirrrrre
overhead angle jim lies there in a sweat
pamela pulls off him naked frustrated trying to rouse him
tender what can i do what do you want me to do
i dont know
i guess i should see a doctor or something
maybe i should go to someone of the straight jungian philosophy
it happens to other guys too
jim quietly pissed reaches for the whiskey bottle at the side of the bed
its so scary up there
to be adored
isnt that irony
teenage death girls want my dick a mere clown not my words
ill never wake up in a good mood again
lament for my cock a tongue of knowledge deep in the feathered night gives life soar and crucify i seek to know you
its not so complicated jim its just sex yknow
you should marry an insurance salesman
its the hours man the pressure everythings like your last performance youre setting yourself up
we werent built to last
arent you doing this for you because youre a poet not a rock star
ed sullivans not a place for you
you really know what i am pam
you know what poetry is
where is the feast they promised us
where is the wine the new wine dying on the vine
what are you saying
ysee i lied to you
i really love fame
here we go why are you doing this to me
drinks cause youre in the room
she tries to take the bottle away
it becomes a fight
and this is gonna help
its probably the cause
least put some soul in your success asshole
maybe youre the cause
i mean i dont have this problem with anybody else
getting the bottle give it to me
getting it back no
gives up tries to exit fuck you man im outta here
he grabs her
they lurch smashing the lamp
wild child song kicking in
excited now get mad
love my girl
yeah go fuck the other guys
how many white guys have you fucked pam
black guys what
you like chinese dicks
fighting how many dogs have you fucked
you dont say no to anybody
drugs dogs uglies youd fuck a doorknob with butter on it
how could i do that shouting top of her lungs youre the first one who couldnt make it with me anyway
youre the only limp dick in the lot
camera running at them from the end of the room
jim laughs manically as they roll off the bed into a wall
kicking hitting hard
wild child full of grace savior of the human race your cool face natural child terrible child not your mother or your fathers child your own child screaming wild a
voice across the wall joining in banging
by this time the fight has expired of its own volition
quietly you were saying
they giggle start to laugh
then they cuddle on the floor in the corner in this semi lit new york hotel room
low will you die for me pam a clown a despicable clown
a mere despicable clown
yes yes yes
i need a home
a place to hide
mumbling how could we make a home
where theres sanctuary
yes yes yes
hes hard now
shes guiding him inside her
were in africa were just animals
i wanna stay inside you all night baby
lets fuck death away now fuck death away
camera moving in past the buffet champagne flowers in the hotel suite overlooking central park
to the doors in armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a dozen journalists and press photographers
jim behind dark shades drinking long hawaiian fruit punches decked out in snakeskin
stiff times type what are your songs about mr
time dissolves over the questions and answers
a vaguely dreamy quality
uh love death travel
we all write the songs were interested in anything about disorder chaos especially activity which seems to have no meaning
i think when you make peace with authority you become authority
can you define that a little more
yeah you can call us erotic politicians i guess
do you really consider yourself a shaman mr
a scapegoat maybe i take on the audiences fantasies obeying their impulses
when the impulses are destructive im destructive
its kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake something like that
smiling like a medicine man or witch doctor
cuts in jim said to me once the history of rock and rolls like greek drama or caveman stories
the audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves
their souls in jeopardy
theyre not watching any longer theyre participating and everythings in play your life your death
glib is that why they scream so much
the journalists dont get it
panning their looks
the backbeat of crystal ship dreamy hazy warhol like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom cloud
more down to earth mr
morrison how do you feel about being called the ultimate barbie doll
on jim a beat
a sickly smile spreads
i guess when you say something like that its a shortcut to thinking
then do you think about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has gotten
holding up a copy of the lords and new creatures
softly i guess they didnt understand
having scored and its true you financed its publication
jim motions him over whispers something at siddons who goes to fetch a pair of scissors
angry have you bothered to read the poetry mam
you keep denying that anything good can come from l
i mean isnt that kind of a provincial attitude
that bob dylans the only poet cause hes from the east coast but you wont even look past jims goddamn looks at the words man
embarrassed hey cmon ray hate should be allowed
but what really are your songs about mr
you preach saving the planet making a new age but how does drinking taking drugs this boozy sort of apocalyptic stance at the world influence young people in a positive
i like that boozy apocalyptic youre a word man but how does your newspaper influence young people to think about vietnam
whos sending the soldiers over there to die
the establishment right
your newspaper right
that seems to me a lot more dangerous than the stuff we do
do you believe in drugs mr
siddons comes back in hands jim a pair of scissors
graciously disdainful did you know nietzsche said all good consciousness all evidence of truth comes only from the senses
hey you wanna arm wrestle
come on you look pretty tough today
cmon ill take you all on
ignoring his smile and alcohol
is that considered part of the shamans wisdom
part of the clowns wisdom its kinda the american way
you know we spend more on alcohol and tobacco than on education
double images on the dissolves
are you by any chance in a trance now mr
do you hurt
what hurts you the most
he cuts his hair with the scissors
what are you doing
got tired of the barbie doll look
are you serious
cutting hair blindly about
yknow when people are joking i find they are dead serious and when theyre dead serious i find them funny
the point is made however visibly
the anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained the cynosure of all eyes as always
eyes shooting back at journalist
journalist cuts in from the back of the room altering the mood
what do your parents think about what you are doing
pause actually i dont really remember being born
it musta happened during one of my blackouts
journalist with dark hair and demeanor gypsy like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing large glasses is probably a rock magazine writer but seems to like jim and
but they mustve expressed some feeling
pause well to be honest theyre not living anymore so i dont like to talk about that
flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment
could you at least tell us how they died
jim puts the scissors down going to a low mysterious voice
oh it was a
horrible car crash
in the desert in the fifties arizona
ran right into a truckload of indians
navajos they were lying out on the road all bleeding and i was with my grandma and grandad we were banged up and all
and i was looking at my dad and he was lying there
but his throat was severed and there was air coming out
he puts the room in a hush
he has mesmerized them and theyre not sure whether to believe it or not
i have the feeling im being put on
jim rises staggers slightly as he makes his way to the bar on the way out of the room smiles right at her ignoring everybody else in the room
yall believe what you want to believe you will anyway
but it does kinda show you what excites people
looking directly at her fear pity horror all those good things that count
its sorta i guess like being on the edge of an orgasm yknow
that mystery just before you come
will you die for me eat me this way the end
the room in silence embarrassed nervous titters looking at journalist who flushes deeply as we cut to rain rain rain
pelting the large windows as we glide to jim fucking journalist patricia kennealy madly in the twisted sheets
he gives up exhausted
the song crystal ship backbeats the scene
he wanders around her place
her place is crammed with books and intellectualabilia skulls candles globes of the world plants
she puts her glasses back on
you want to do some more cocaine
itll loosen you up
a new thing
as she goes to a bowl of cocaine laid alongside a bottle of champagne and a basketful of items all catered by jim
hes at her bookcase thumbing through an ancient manuscript
wow how old is this
insert the drawings in the book pertain to witchcraft
snorting th century
i practice the craft
im a witch smiles a white one
who wouldve guessed
ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and demeanor
she looks back at him challenging
the kennealys were celtic cheiftains and pre christian shamans when your druid ancestors the morrisons were a minor scottish clan founded by a bastard son of the king of norway
jim reappraising her
her eye contact is very direct
its a religion witchcraft
witches are the protectors of the seasons the harvests goddesses of the grain
and when crossed destroyers
something in the feeling of the room has shifted
the sound of her razor chopping coke
he snorts the first time
you ever try drinking blood
it works you know
you drink blood the right time of the moon
they used to dance in the forests naked
i think thats what offended the puritans and led to the burnings
they were a sexual threat to their male order like the bacchae five days a year for dionysus they used to wander the hills in ancient greece the first witches
clans of wild women fucking looting eating animals raw the wine in their blood running hot looking for dionysus
to tear him to pieces isnt that wild
jim is down on his knees crawling around her
she is crawling back
hooked where do you get the blood
patricia drawing blood from her arm wipes it on his mouth
some of it spills out tamping the white powder with red stains
jim watching enthralled coked out
she hands him the jewelled moroccan dagger
blood is the rose of mysterious union symbol of potency
i dont like
stern dont be such a child
if i do it you have to do it
he extends his arm
the look between them
he closes his eyes like a little boy
she makes the cut
before you slip into unconsciousness id like to have another kiss another flashing chance at bliss another kiss another kiss candles incense burn
as jim and patricia dance in the loft naked to music drinking champagne
jump cut he is chasing her with one of her goat horns between his legs
they wrestle yell lusty bacchanale
theyre fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft bathed in blood and white powder all over the place rain pelting the windows thunder orffs carmina burana cutting in
over the doors song
sexy come on rock god fuck me fuck me good
in slightly ape like slow motion hes wildly thrusting at her like a stallion then reaches down yanks out her diaphragm holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it
across the room into the fireplace
lips out of sync im gonna burn you down
incants him to climax with celtic words
jim is wild reaching for the moroccan dagger holding it to her face as he continues to pump

a weird dance ensuing between them teasing enticing
he runs away writhes along her wall being photographed inch by moving inch
he crawls to her
she gets down with him on the floor straddling him photographing
then he straddles her as she shoots him from her back
they kiss flirting
he growls like an animal
dives into her closet
tearing open the doors flinging away hanging clothes he finds her white fur coat and puts it on
jump cut him as he moves to her full length mirror contorting himself
she slides up behind him

the great jim morrison the shaman then pamela patricia gloria a series of women who face after face fill the ancient gallery interchangeable masks as people are strange climaxes and
jims face spins out optically to people are strange when youre a stranger faces look ugly when youre alone women seem wicked when youre unwanted streets are uneven when youre down jims face on a series of magazines twirling sixteen glamour rock magazines etc
flowering out into style vampires drink and grope and drug and dance under the staccato blips of strobe lights
artists and intellectuals groupies and debutantes everyone on display as contrived and replicated as one of the warhol prints of elvis or marilyn and mao on the walls
fisheye povs hearkening back to the acid trip as jim wanders through the dream drinking smoking swallowing pills
people look at him talk to him ad libs but drugs distort everything and their voices are foreign incoherent and they disappear
people are strange continuing when youre strange faces come out of the rain when youre strange no one remembers your name when youre strange when youre strange when youre strange
jim peering into a room somewhere one of warhols films is playing on a wall a man sleeping eating
a glimpse of vietnam war footage on a tv monitor b s dropping bombs

a moment strange
slightly slow motion
ray tapping jims shoulder goodbye
robbie and johns faces passing on
as if theyre parting in a symbolic way
jim blinking in the same slow motion looking
nico is gone but tom is there across the room waving
the indian shaman looks like hes standing there in a corner
jim ripped heads for him but the pr woman cuts him off
jim forgets he saw the indian
right here jim right here
you know what you have in common is uniqueness
past more faces
the music has subtly shifted to strange days somewhere along the way
strange days have found us strange days have tracked us down theyre going to destroy our casual joys we shall go on playing or find a new town past a
cache of queens in white leather ogling jim one of them coming over boldly chatting him up ad lib dimly heard them grabbing his crotch and kissing him
jim rearing back laughing but wary
past the rich ladies dripping with jewels and faces peeled from brazilian sleep tanks and swiss knives
past a young man dressed in jim morrison leather pants with his hair and eye make up a warped image of jim smiling back at him
looking for nico nico
a quieter room drugged out the pr guy cheerily leading jim stepping over sleeping bodies over fur coats strewn across the floor
to a man with white hair like a circus clown his back to us talking with some black tied european aristocrats looking so cool
well it was such a big opening we just had to go to philadelphia yknow you were supposed to mmm
butting in andy
andy turning at the interruption
he looks like a chic voodoo doll
holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear
slightly slow mo as warhols black empty eyes confront jim a pit of nothingness in them amnesia death
in jims slow motion reaction we read what he sees
andy going on with his story to the group that includes tom baker
but so many people showed up the paintings were getting crushed so they took them all down
um it really looked great yknow
long pause cutting in the walls
the blank walls
andy was the art
should do a show
today its really about people not what they do
its the astronaut that matters not the voyage the actor not the movie how do i say its the trip not arriving
andy is looking at jim
jim at andy
babbling on you know what andy says some day everybodys gonna be famous for seconds but it wont mean anything
thats too short
i need a coupla hours
andys eyes hidden face as white as styrofoam

andy shows his eyes gives jim the gold telephone hes carrying
edie gave this to me and said mmmmm i could talk to god with this

mmmm now you can talk to god
vanishes waving to somebody else
jim holding the phone
strange days have found us and through their strange hours we linger alone nico reappears waving at him to come quickly
snow on the streets
a group of druggies staggering in the snowbanks throwing snowballs stupid giggling wheezing puffs of cold air
jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on it
iris shots continue pamela laughing battily with tom baker whos putting the make on her
the count is on heroin
jim passing a vodka bottle back and forth with nico hitting a stash of ups
they fall in the snow mad russian winter
bodies confused memories misused as we run from the day to a strange night of stone black white iris shots continue imagistic disassociative
a long corridor couple staggering down the red carpets champagne bottles in hand
the count gets lost
pam laughing suddenly alone notices goes looking for jim
floating down this endless corridor with white doors and red carpet
a superb body
riding the floors
jim taking an amyl nitrate with her
nico with that crazed german laugh
pamela pushing the elevator buttons wildly
the elevator opening on her
from pamelas pov nico down on her knees her blonde head buried in jims leather pants
jim pinned against the back wall smiling dopically eyes barely registering pam
who screams loud and long hiding his eyes
not wanting to know
the images faster and more fragmented pam beating at jim wildly
the aristocrats in the hallway are laughing
the world is laughing with its madness
strange days have found us strange days have tracked us down an eager rowdy crowd chants doors
to a stage without the doors
techies are moving amplifiers running sound checks stalling time the manager siddons gauging the crowd nervous
rich girls and local honchos have backstage passes
cops crawling over the stage the promoter of the concert trying to get the crowds attention
at mike testing one two three
on mike look the fire marshalls not gonna let the show go on
either you go back to your seats you go to the aisle you dont do that no show
pushing towards stage no aisles turning to the sounds of the crowd pound thru the hallway
camera following jim reading a magazine article accompanied by patricia kennealy past the techies turning to look they go into empty shower room
the crowd noise still carries echoing
jim leads patricia to a quiet isolated stall where they can be alone
tapping the magazine sincerely moved by what he reads
you like the poems
i loved them
mad bad and dangerous to know
thats what they said about him
your poems should be taken as seriously
these are the kindest words ive ever heard in my life

did he make you cut your hair
did he hit you was he a bully
did he love you
jim describes a small space between thumb and forefinger
and your mother
jim makes a little larger space
pause i dont want to talk about it
hate is a very underestimated emotion
his look is right at her
patricia knows he wont talk
through the pause we hear the crowd chanting bigger and bigger morrison morrison morrison
shes excited wanting to make love here now
hes cooled out however
it doesnt matter anymore does it
listen to them
its you they want now
not the doors not your mother or your fathers child

suddenly hes scared inside

the noise pounding you have no choice jim
i see you up there like icarus
i see you flying closer and closer to the sun
and your wings are melting
i want to live patricia
i dont wanna die
jims ironic eyes to the ceiling
laden with a power to which he has married himself yet brave resisting as she pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him
shaking his head
a beefy cop stands there looking at them whatcha doing there
nuthin approaching suspicious okay outta there both of you

a black irish laugh
ray looking on patricia in the hallway
a beat senses what happened
why dont you leave him alone lady he doesnt need more shit in his life
what do you know what jim needs
a precise military drum beat hits as we launch into the unknown soldier
hup two three four
the doors on stage jim eyes masked facing death at a mock execution in full black leather armor
the famous drum roll tension building
sudden sound of guitar
jim crumples to the ground
blood shooting from his mouth
make a grave for the unknown soldier nestled in your hollow shoulder the unknown soldier practice as the news is read television children dead bullet strikes the helmets head its
all over the war is over
the audience is enrapt
jim suddenly jumps up looses the blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs into willie dixons back door man
the fans go wild to the farthest reaches of the arena as he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them
instamatics flashing rapidly as the kids press forward at jim fondling the mike stand sliding up and down its smooth shaft
well the men dont know but the little girls unnerstan
joints sail onto the stage at his feet ready to be smoked
a teenage boy girl make a break thru the cordon of cops at the front of the stage heading for jim
the cops chase them down mid stage and wrestle them back to the edge throwing them back into the audience
when all the good people are trying to sleep im out there making my midnight creep yeah cause im a backdoor man the men dont know but the little girls
danger fills the air electric
jim strutting indian like up to one of the cops whipping off his hat and flipping it to the crowd which roars with approval
a couple cops looking at jim sensing theyre being challenged but not sure how
they shuffle and look offstage for direction
their apparent impotence brings redoubled jeering from the kids
ray next to his stick of incense on the organ shares a look with john as they head into the instrumental break in the song
theres something different about jim more demonic more driven a spirit has taken him over
rays pov jim catching his look but no recognition in those eyes
theyre dark pools like warhols eyes
he turns away taking the mike and off the cuff rapping improvisationally with the backbeat keeping poetic meter
i wanna tell you bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in new haven
this is new haven isnt it
new haven connecticut united states of america
the crowd yells in acknowledgement one stoned teenager naked from the waist up and ripped on beer yelling out
hey morrison is the west really the best or are you just stoned on weeeeeedddddd
annoying light my fire

giggles we want mick jagger
take your clothes off jim

jim ignores it sits on the stage lights a cigarette
long pause tension building
their catcalls for light my fire die out as jim faces them down
not knowing what happens next
finally well i was with this girl backstage yknow
we got to talking and we wanted some privacy so we went into this shower stall
we werent doin anything yknow jes standing there and talking
the audience laughing the band continuing to play john adding emphasis to jims words with various shots and rolls
camera moving over the crowd picking out the kids sensing the anarchy dormant in their faces
and then this little man came in there this little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap
more cops turning to face jim from front stage getting the point now
ray sees it coming
redneck voice and he said whatcha doin there
i said nuthin and he said well you better get outta there or
or what i asked him
the audience has now grown deadly silent
nearly every cop is facing jim as he uses his dumb southerner voice
rays eyes warning jim
and he started pushing me and i pushed back and he didnt like that so he reached back there and got out his little can of mace
and sprayed it right in my eyes
and blinded me
cause i was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if he could ever get it up without a gun
the lights coming on suddenly the audience seething
shouts of fuck em
in the united states of america
land of the free
home of the brave man in god we trust right
turn crowd roars
a police lieutenant in his s grey hair beefy marches out onto the stage standing next to jim arms akimbo
a second cop joins him
ray rolling the music out into a silence as jim sticks the mike in the officers face defiantly
say your thing man
more cops come out snatch the microphone as jim flashes the audience a touchy arent they
young man youve gone too far
the shows over
youre under arrest
two more cops moving on jim pinning both his arms and dragging him off stage
scared theyre gonna beat the shit out of him man
ray moving to intercede with siddons and roadies
resisting ray and siddons are pushed aside by other cops
the crowd is going nuts
chairs are thrown
kids rushing onto the stage where the cops beat them back
anne is writing it all down on her notepad
a certain satisfaction and joy at the unfolding of this event
jim is dragged roughly down a flight of stairs
jim is wrestled across the lot pinned to the car and handcuffed punched and thrown into the car yelling
journalists try to intercede one is also arrested
jim is spreadeagled against the wall a dignified defiant look on his face
coming in hey whatcha got here
a boy or a girl
coming closer to jim what do you care

okay rock star lets see the backdoor you keep bawling about
stretching his ass cheeks wheres the roach powder

reaching for a can turn around rock star
as jim defiantly does so cop looses a big cloud of roach powder into his long hair
backing off stand clear who the hell knows whats living in there
all during this snickering laughter from the onlooking half dozen police officers gathered to watch
jim waits then with great claim in a quiet voice you finished
you sure youre finished
havent you forgotten something the consolation prize they gave ya for taking your cock and balls
why dont you use em you withered dicks
you shit eating red neck chickenshit bastards i hope this makes your worthless lives
as hes smacked by cop sending him sprawling into the wall
on the floor quiet you better kill me cause im gonna come back and fuck everyone of your daughters
a snowball smashes against the glass
cops coming out with sticks
a riot brewing
a hundred teenagers sallying back and forth on the sidewalk taunting the cops
a dozen of them have already been arrested
cops chase the kids with sticks
but just as it looks like its going to get out of hand jim appears at the doors of the station stepping out between ray and the doors and siddons
he signals his freedom arms in the air
jim waves does a small pained victory jig in front of the thwarted gestapo ribcage and spleen hurting
aside to robbie he could go all the way man
in five years he could be in the white house
robbies look tells us he thinks ray is as much caught up in his dreams as jim
flashbulbs hits us full frame as a reminder of the reality as the thud of a clanking gate shuts
morrisons profile disheveled hair he glares angrily
frontal shot slated police dept new haven conn
a sullen handsome portrait
an ugly cough
in this puffy wrack and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight of the boy amazed and amused by it all
we hear the ghostly crowd still cheering
i drink so i can talk to assholes
this includes me
lets just say i was testing the bounds of reality thats all i was curious
i kinda always preferred to be hated
like erich von stroheim in the movies
the man you loved to hate
its meant to be ironic courage wants to laugh
yknow its essentially a stupid situation
i go out on a stage and i howl for people
in me they see what they want to see some say the lizard king whatever that means or some black clad leather demon whatever that means
but really i think of myself as a sensitive intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial
pause a fake hero
a joke the gods played on me
its okay i accept the joke
death old friend death and my cock i can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom luxury romance
words got me the wound and will get me well
all join now in lament of my cock a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night
boys get crazy in the head and suffer
i sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence
the engineer looking at him puzzled
has jim lost it
mike his friend is there in the engineers booth with the doors secretary leticia and an elegant mystery woman
theyre smoking dope partying
hey jim how bout hitting a strip joint

the violent backbeat of the wasp now picking up
now listen to this ill tell you about texas radio and the big beat soft driven slow and mad like some new language reaching your head with the cold sudden
fury of a divine messenger let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god wandering wandering in hopeless night out here on the perimeter there are no stars out here we is stoned immaculate
but i tell you this no eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
jim walks the dawn streets

at the check out counter the food being tallied up jim spots his face plastered on the cover of something like the jim you got any cash
seeking in his pocket nothing but a credit card and a rumpled old dollar bill
the faces of the hippies looking at him
with one of the magic markers on the counter he draws in his beard on his cover shot
morning found us clearly unaware noon burned gold into our hair at night we swam the laughing sea when summers gone where will we be pam and jim and the

spawning like minnows what are you saying

elusively i think women basically have a comic approach to life i mean how can they not when they look up in the dark and see a dangling penis seeking
it looks like a face yknow little beard hi mom pam giggling now i wanna get inside you
humming do the funky chicken do dah dah funky chicken do da da love my girl shes cracking up now
as he takes the acid out holds it in front of her like a sacrament
lets go wild child lets get out there romeo and juliet marilyn monroe and vincent van gogh jim and pam rock and roll a poem all the poetry has wolves
in it but one pam the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug as she takes the tablet on her tongue swallows
romantic i like it when you sing to me cause im the poet and youre my muse strains of youre lost little girl drift in setting a more ominous tone
the food is laid out the duck cooking
but no one is there as we move across this tastefully decorated house to pamela in the living room rattled obsessively going through jims papers
people are knocking at the door
guests looking through the windows tapping
a giant poster of marilyn monroe frames pamela
what am i going to do about these papers
jim jim you really need someone to organize this stuff
your handwritings just like a little kid
jim is somewhere else pulling out the duck which is totally charred black

dorothy immediately seeing the duck runs to it

youre lost little girl youre lost little girl youre lost tell me who are you
people are introducing themselves coming in from all over like in a shoebox
now tom baker with mike and dog
now an aggressive chuck berry type black singer with johns girlfriend
then a timothy leary look alike appears
chatter blending everywhere as we build to a vast confusion at jim and pams party
lets go wild child lets get out there romeo and juliet marilyn monroe and vincent van gogh jim and pam rock and roll a poem clothed in sunlight restless in
wanting dying of fever changed shapes of an empire vast promissory notes of joy how it has changed you how slowly estranged you solely arranged you beg you for mercy as she takes the tablet on her tongue swallows

a moment of peace then pamela walks up to jim with a bowl of sweet potatoes in her arms an announcement

pam rushing now for the turkey to throw jim chasing her

hungarian gypsy folk music playing madly from the tape deck
john fiddling with it nervously
they struggle she goes for the carving knife dorothy and ray trying to restrain her
other guests keep talking as if things are quite normal
pam breaks through dorothy coming after jim he grabs her wrist just in time equally insane now a comic glow in his face
jekyll and hyde
you wanna do jumping in murder
wheres my camera
a ball of people wrestling across the kitchen floor upsetting the table and the remainder of the dishes a carving knife at stake in the air
jim finally wrestling the knife away and holding it over pam
forces the knife back into her hand kneels at her feet she explodes inward a bloodcurdling shriek
the knife clattering from her hand
jim laughing insanely
jumping up and down on the duck
ray grabbing him angry
explodes out of his grasp a silence
they start exiting
to ray yeah fuck off man
ray about to lose his temper with tom checks it
to johns girlfriend this partys gettin low rent
lets go babe
exiting with the other doors
dog picking the duck up from the floor
hey fuck him lets eat this thing
pamela is sobbing in a quiet bewildered voice repeating to herself
what the hells happened to us jim
what the hell is happening to us
theres some great poetry
youre lost little girl youre lost tell me who are you
the backbeat of not to touch the earth as a documentary film crew moves past us directed by mike and dog and tom shoot past us sun guns nagras rolling
a mad rush of hands and screams as shapes whip by under swinging light bulbs big black bodyguards six or seven of them bulling their way thru the grasping faces
as morrison appears
camera swinging wildly with him to reveal thousands of fans roaring doors
loudspeaker ladies and gentlemen from los angeles california the doors
in crush jim
your moms here with your brother
what do you want me to do with em
shakes his head madness
cops lining the edge of the stage looking worried
as jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone indian style one foot resurrecting the dead the power of the circle
the stage is bottom lit dantean in look
the doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions
dea agents in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage clipboards in hand
blocked by a row of cops it is impossible for jim to communicate with his audience
theres been a slaughter here dont stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground were getting out of town were going on the run
and youre the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run run run lets run lets run
siddons yelling at mike the roadie
vice squad says one more fuck or shit theyre gonna close us down man
stick my dick in their ear
jim ignoring all this one hand cupped to his ear listening for the sound of the earth gone into a shaman like state weird spiralling chords carrying over the following
montage of hallucinatory insanity
house upon the hill moon is lying still
a pov up at the house into which jim enters
the lights are on
sage at the door sniffing
shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze come on baby run with me run with me lets run
jims pov entering the bedroom pamela naked in bed with the count is snorting heroin
shadows of the trees and leaves blowing against the walls
their voices dim distant
ironic oh hi
i didnt realize you were entertaining
she sits up on the bed wobbly
the count more sophisticated in these things lights a cigarette from the bedside table revealing heroin paraphernalia
scusi jimmy i hope youre cool about this
very cool dont forget your smack on the way out
jims struggling to break through the barrier of cops
yelling the mansion is warm at the top of the hill rich are the rooms and the comforts there red are the arms of luxuriant chairs you wont know a
thing till you get inside the count is gone
jim icy cold grabs pam by the wrist
i told you about that shit
or are we talking about death choices here
im just doing my thing just like you said its my thing why cant i have a thing
youre hurting me
rising anger get up
you want to know hurt
let me introduce you to my good friend hurt
he is on her throws her from the bed
she runs and hides in the closet slamming the door behind her
screaming crazed ah sanctuary
a soft place to hide
inside from you you pig
as he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet door and the floor
ill give you a place to hide forever
we intercut with pam inside the closet yelling for mercy inside
he puts a candle to the drenched door floor
this is the best part of the trip honey
inside pam feels the first flames licking up smoke wafting in
jim leaves the house
pam kicking wildly at the doors trying to smash her way out as the fire crescendoes
she finally shatters the frail molding and bursts out
pam runs out into laurel canyon like a terrified doe running from a forest fire
song beat not to touch the earth continues
jim and mike driving drunk fucking two black chicks
mike in the back seat
jim drives the car up onto the grass of a police station and plows right into it
knowing whos inside sufficient be it to see the blue shelby mustang plow into a telephone pole on santa monica blvd
dead presidents corpse in the drivers car the engine runs on glue and tar cmon along were not going very far to the east to meet the czar
a high priestess assisted by a high priest conducts a wicca wedding amidst a setting of candles mixing a few drops of jim and annes blood into a consecrated cup
of wine from which they drink
they all wear long black robes the only light from the candles standing inside a circle in front of a table with altar incense chalice
dimly heard we worship the ancient forces of nature the triple goddess the great mother and the lord the horned one
when the vow is taken motorcycle escorts cops zoom past the limo windows on the la the priestess presses the two cut wrists together binding them with a red cord
it is a blending of souls on a karmi and cosmic plane that affects your future incarnations on this planet
death does not part only lack of love and the vow is forever in the goddess sight
building faster and faster run with me run with me run with me lets run some outlaws live by the side of a lake the ministers daughters in love with
a snake jim faints
jim mind totally gone into his trance spreading his arms like wings hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman around his microphone whirling yelling out great rewards
for the tribe
plentiful antelope healthy corn
the kids are going wild writhing like maenads in his intoxicating embrace
embers from an enormous bonfire drift past the stadium lights into the night
but the kids increasingly frustrated by a barrage of cops cannot see their leader and now push against the cops with the very result the authorities seek to repress
who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl
were almost home we shall see the gates by morning we shall be inside by evening sun sun sun burn burn burn moon moon moon
ray gone into his own trance happening to look up from his keyboard
his eyes widen
his pov an indian shaman hovers over the microphone
cloaked in hides his face obscured by a horned headdress with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders rattles in each fist the bonfire glowing
i will get you soon soooooooon
the cops cant hold
teenage shock troops hitting the stage clambering up
the stage becoming a riot
cops wading in with sticks
roadies and bodyguards yanking the musicians from their places
indifferent to himself i am the lizard king i can do anything as dog hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug smiling stoned immaculate
start slow close up on jim hes crying his head on a pillow silent haunted
pull out to see the room no explanations
a tv game show is on judy and her friend watching naked skinny
piles of murder magazines and books clothes and personal items trashed around the thread bare room he calls home
she looks over at him
man wow watsa matter jim

pams mascara is running from her eyes begging to get in
the black maid cleaning the adjacent room overheard unsurprised

pamela listening at the door
shes on the second story of a cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of la cienega

and the house is immaculate
sage is waiting

no answer she yells people in the parking lot looking up
a silence is her only response
she waits turns away from the closed door as touch me babe cuts in cmon cmon cmon cmon now touch me babe cant you see that i am not afraid
in the vocal booth jim is chugging on a brown paper bag with whiskey in it crooning with heart but the voice is warped weak
what was that promise you made why dont you tell me what she said what was that promise that she made im gonna love you till the heaven stops the
rain im gonna love you till the stars fall from the sky for you and i
various people are hanging around the studio listening a couple of hippie chicks a burn victim w bandages a charles manson type a siberian husky the tim leary type
paper bags burgers bottles california rose apple juice hard boiled eggs
in the engineering booth
rothchild the producer is displeased
to botnick the engineer fuckin neanderthal primadonna is too drunk to see
cuts the music to jim cut it
that was beautiful sweetheat we had a technical problem well take it again from the top babe whenever youre ready
on the floor the doors are depressed
densmore looking at morrison aimlessly nervously
krieger looking tired and beaten takes a discreet hit on a joint
ray scans an art book patient
whats his fucking problem
equally false paul babe
right here baby
why dont you suck a fart out of my asshole you slave driving facist motherfucker
as he stalks out of the booth
raging near incomprehensible
a small portable tv set is playing the dean martin show low on one end of the recording console
around the room the detritus of the time mailers armies of the night the stones beggars banquet janis cheap thrills traffic the band
exasperated i hear the booze i hear the smokes jim i dont hear the voice and babe i didnt hear the song
so what are we going to tonight paul
coming in with john alright lets try something else
i wanna sing blues
this stuffs getting too self conscious
offended cause its my song man
simultaneous incomprehensible lets sing rock is dead
youre all a buncha slaves
oh come all ye faithful
hot shut up jim
i dont understand
what are ya doing
i love you like a brother i do but why are you fucking this up
its a perfect radio song for chrissake
no one wants to hear the blues anymore
think like a singer youre the only baritone crooner we got left
sinatra elvis crosby youre as good as they are but why are you pause
jims face darkening
something he sees on the television
he stops frozen sickly
several bimbettes are dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of light my fire pop out
catchy you sold it to a commercial
ray siddons robbie john shuffling for a moment
how much did you get for it
you werent talking to us that week and we figgered you
what the fuck is this ray
its not like a big deal jim the songs already been commercialized the money was great
robbie wrote the lyrics and he didnt mind neither did i neither did john
we gotta get to tv
are you saying
are we the doors
one for all and all for one
do you know what youre saying to those millions of kids
just kidding not real
thats what youre saying
oh come on man you think just cause youre the lead man in the band you can run the whole show
building intensity you think i was kidding ray
turning to john hey john those are interesting shoes you like those shoes
pamela looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk into the studio
aggressive yeah i do
then do you want of those shoes
then what do you need more money for
turning to ray
im dying ray
i wasnt kidding
maybe you were
but ill tell you something its not about these desires you have man or money or these records its about breaking through wasnt it
you just lost something man
to all we all lost something boys
we lost something
i dont think so jim
theres a bigger picture here
there sure is
in your fucking face
a small smile flickers jims face as he picks up the small tv and like a quarterback hurls it spinning end over end from his corner of the control room
towards ray and rothchild and the doors
they dive for the floor as it smashes to bits into the wall behind the tape machines
quietly just kidding
turning to pam hi pam
just watchin some tv
he seems pleased to distract his anger into her
she doesnt seem to notice anything unusual going on
the doors silent feeling jims rage
pathetic i wanted you to find us jim
it meant nothing
you dont have to torture me jim
let me make it up to you please
the others all look away embarrassed
this is certainly a moment the ordinary partner might turn away from pamela her tears running but her pathacy her inability to deal with pain is precisely what moves jim
the most a side of himself in her an ultimate weakness she has he shares
as he goes to her puts his arms gently around her
its alright honey its gonna be alright
youre my girl and thats the way its always gonna stay
snuggles him zoned really
ironic to the others so lets keep that money machine rolling
come on guys
rothchild looking to botnick and to ray
but the real look the unforgiving one is from jim to ray who feels it
rothchild douses the lights in the studio
right on jimbo
overdubb of doors song soft parade jims voice booming thru the studio
reciting when i was back there in seminary school there was a person there who put forth the proposition that you can petition the lord with prayer petition the lord
with prayer petition the lord with prayer rothchild looking from his booth across at jim
his pov only jim is visible
where the hell did she go
in the control booth ray and robbie share a look
the lights have been dimmed in jims booth and hes weaving back and forth a bottle of ripple in his hand as they kick in with the music
camera closing now on jim in the tender section on the money
can you give me sanctuary i must find a place to hide a place for me to hide
in the darkened booth pam is on her knees his pants worked down around his ankles caressing him sucking him off
sotto voice sing to me jim sing to me
can you find me soft asylum i cant make it any more the man is at the door the doors sense it
rothchild knows it hushed
magics suddenly in the air once more as we jump stanzas to catacombs nursury bones winter women streets and shoes avenues leather riders selling shoes the monk bought lunch successful
hills are here to stay everything must be this way gentle street where people play welcome to the soft parade but jims voice has now gone off key floating carefree drifting drifting away
rothchild chuckles philosophically
the doors in control booth start leaving
robbie goes back out to get his personal items
but the overdub still plays over the booth as jim doesnt realize
we take liberties cutting around on the song
all our lives we sweat and save building for a shallow grave then the soft parade has now begun listen to the engines hum people out to have some fun
a cobra on my left leopard on my right the doors and rothchild all exiting leaving botnick the engineer to clean up some technical things
and of course the two occupants of the darkened booth
fiercely calling on the dogs when all else fails you can whip the horses eyes and make them sleep and cry
the music stops
inside the booth two shadows breathe deep huddled on the floor in each others arms
a whisper out of the dark
i love you
jim his head cocked lost in the memory
reciting why does my mind circle around you
why do planets wonder what it would be like to be you
all your soft wild promises were words birds endlessly in flight being drunk is the best disguise as the body is ravaged the spirit grows stronger pause
he coughs horribly the phlegm sucking out his chest with a horrid asthmatic sound which he douses with another cigarette and another shot of whiskey
the bushmills now two thirds empty
he looks over at the mystery woman now beside him at the microphone
mike and the secretary watch
the bored engineer across the darkened midnight room yawns
lets send out for some pizza jim
nah how bout some tacos when were through
downs another shot continues the world on fire taxi from africa the grand hotel he was drunk a big party last night back going back in all directions sleeping these
insane hours ill never wake up in a good mood again im sick of these stinky boots do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid admirals
and that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood
do you know we are ruled by tv
pause oh great creator of being grant us one more hour to perform our art and perfect our lives the moths and atheists are doubly divine in dying we live
we die and death not ends it journey we more into the nightmare were reaching for death on the end of a candle were trying for something thats already found us
crammed into every available space of an old seaplane hangar with no seats standing room only a mass of kids swelter in the heat grumbling fanning themselves with programs as
a warm up band plays
in the wings of the stage a radio dj critic is recording on tape
its the same kid we saw long ago at the whiskey backstage pronouncing the arrival of the doors on the scene
now hes got a beard glasses a more cynical face
into microphone a hot night in miami january every space in the auditorium is consumed
unfortunately the doors have long since sold out
theyve become an act
morrison falls off the stage at least every other performance
the soft parade album only confirms the plasticity of their approach
songs like touch me and follow me down are not the doors we once knew
so the question is why am i here
are funerals entertainment
densmore looks on from the stage wings withdraws to ray nearby
he aint gonna show
i know it man
we should fuckin go on without him
bills with him
theyre an hour away hell get him here
siddons the manager tugs on morrison whos getting soused with dog tom mike and rothchild the producer
system announcing the departure of the miami flight
we missed one already we gotta get this one man
jim slams has shot glass on the bar
hes got a beard for the first time looking like a tribal elder
four more all around and up and down
as the waitress takes the order urgent dont be so melodramatic bill its not fun anymore
i cant fly sober

to bill youre an awful little guy to be talking like that
muttering chump change were working for chump change
look at you youre a pathetic fuckin slob and so are all your friends
i got an idea bill youre fired
the warm up band is applauded and booed
the crowd resembles a pit of snakes wriggling on top of each other
impatient listen to em
theyre not coming for the music anymore
theyre coming to see a fuckin freak show
you think its easy for him
he moves left hes got vice squad on the right narcs and the audience just waiting for him to get busted
he wanted it
i just dont fuckin get the point anymore
i never did i guess
yask me hes just become a drunken fuckin asshole thats what
and hes gonna take us down with him
compassion was never your forte man
dont lecture me mr
philosopher you never felt a fuckin thing in your life
i loved that man
i loved what he was
robbie strums his guitar breaks the tension in the room
a lick of five to one
it aint the old jim thats for sure
i think hes living for everybody else man and somewhere along the way hes lost his own self
almost to himself the wine man the ancient wine
the ancient wine
something he once told us
when the madness took over
sequence omitted from original script
the stewardess uptight tries a smile at jim tom mike all belted in one row
my name is rita hager and if
if your name is rita then yor ol man must be ol man rita
guffaws chorusing that ol man riva he just keep rolling along
excuse me sir my father is not my old man
a baby with her mother stares at jim fascinated
he lifts his dark glasses winks back at her
the stewardess slips the oxygen mask over her face
in the event of a decrease of pressure pull the oxygen mask to your
ma ol lady had one of those but she calls it a diaphragm when im eating her out
nah its a douche bag on a dixie cup
im sorry sir but youre embarrassing me
come on guys cool it
other passengers looking over
dog squeezes from the lavatory and drops a small bar of soap in jims drink
they laugh push yell
jim is smoking a cigar
teasing to rothchild in the row behind him cmon paul you can get us some heroin man
suddenly serious no i cant and i wont
cause i dont want to participate in anything that would accomplish your goal
wry oh and what is my goal paul
death old friend
i just want the pure beauty of absolute zero and sing the blues man do nuthin go nowhere just be

tom spews the contents of his mouth all over jim in response
jim throws his sandwich back at tom
then another drink goes
fuck you ignorant devils asshole slave

a full fledged food fight in progress
dog tom jim mike pushing and shoving
a drink spills over an innocent incoming
the stewardess coming up with the captain
if you young men dont change your attitude right now when we get to miami youre going to be arrested
reflexively saluting yessir you asshole
plane taxiing up
two police cars red lights revolving are waiting
pilot escorting four fbi agents aboard
as captain of this ship im placing all four of you under arrest
the fbi will

jim stunned in his drunkenness
siddons and rothchild protesting ad libs
the crowd is heckling a long haired hippie in a leather hat who cradles a live snow white lamb telling him to get off screaming ad lib for the doors
jim jim jim
look at this thing
look at this beautiful little living thing
how can you eat it
how can you eat its flesh
angry fists pound the edge of the proscenium
bodies push and pack against each other
if hieronymus bosch had painted a rock concert this would be it
everybody moving fast
as jim dark sunglasses and beard surrounded by two fbi agents and his bodyguards move toward the stage two hours late
siddons with him arguing ad lib with ray and the promoter a southern sleazeball with long muttonchops and velvet shirt and beads
a mess the crowd chanting doors
screaming at promoter what the fuck happened to the seats

you said you love pain man but you run from it every chance you get
the doors come out finally
the noise is overwhelming
acid light noise
wagnerian gods hitler
jim spreading his arms like icarus set to fly
the roars redouble their feet stomping out insane joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at jims feet
he is a god now as he bends regally picks one up
cops everywhere looking as
he lights it
the crowd going nuts as the doors go into the ominous introductory strains of five to one trying to get the onus off jim and the show on the road
the audience knows the song go into a primal foot stomp with it
bras are thrown on stage
kids writhe madly in the primal doors dance
people with sparklers running through the hangar
camera flashbulbs popping throughout the show

jim drunk high smoking the jay wont go into the lyrics right off forcing the doors to circle the beat again
he jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire
beat the crowd explodes once more
as a cop heads upstage to get jim for the joint he cooly flicks it back into the crowd avoiding disaster
perfect timing as the cop looks around suddenly distracted by the crowd yelling something
an insane teenager stands on the railing of a balcony above the auditorium poised to swan dive some feet into the crowd
which he now does arms held out like wings
the crowd yells parting to allow his bulk to smack the floor
cops rushing to the spot
the kid suddenly stands up unhurt with a stoned out look on his face
then splits at a full run thru the crowd chased by the perplexed cops
everybody surging back towards the stage as jim looses one of his primal screams

during the instrumental break jim picks up one of the roses from the floor pokes it at john on the drums who whacks it to death on his skins
jim starts to whirl the mike cord like a slingshot or bolo in an ever widening arc
it flies off and smashes into the head of the promoter at the edge of the stage arguing with siddons
the man is staggered weaving siddons helping him to a first aid team
the crazy vegeterian hippie runs out on stage to give jim the white lamb to make this political point
jim holds the lamb in his arms
its purring gentle
dog chases the hippie off as he gives the microphone back to jim and takes the lamb from him
he staggers over to robbie and goes down to his knees pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned guitar solo
your ballroom days are over baby night is drawing near shadows of the evening crawl across the years you walk across the floor with a flower in your hand tryin
to tell me no one understands photographers flashing cameras
baker urging him on from the wings as he passes out
a girl runs onto the stage dumps a bottle of champagne on jims head
jim takes his shirt off soaking wet
the crowd is also stripping in the heat shirts blouses screaming so much now they are obviously way past listening to any song

the arena echoes with the uncomprehending chant of the mob
one more time get together one more time get together one more time special effect the indian ghost is leaving jims body spectrally moving off him hovering there in the
air its eyes the face of a dying indian on an arizona highway then gone

two hundred persons are gathered on the lawn outside banners decrying the doors
a middle aged speaker clean cut squarely dressed expresses his outrage
bullhorn endorsed by president richard nixon

the song climaxes into an inner scream of madness
for the music is your special friend dance on fire as it intends music is your only friend until the end silence on jim
mildly i think im having a nervous breakdown
the sound of wind the backbeat of la woman flooding in
jim dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the th floor rooftop wind blowing thru his wild hair the card zooming by like racer lights on sunset below
the song la woman continues born from this renewed feeling of danger
well i just got into town bout an hour ago took a look around see which way the wind blow where the little girls in their hollywood bungalows pam screaming
for him to come back from the edge as tom baker and mike and dog and a cameraman film in mm
jim yelling back as he drinks from a pint of whiskey enjoying himself enormously

jim cracking up with laughter
baker drunk and the film crew love it swishpanning with a cheap sungun
dancing we got it man

pam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start climbing out onto the ledge skirts blowing in the wind
jim moving further along the ledge
raw la woman x la woman sunday afternoon x drive thru your suburbs into your blues x into your blue blue blues into your blues siddons and ray terrified
is this the night its finally going to end in a suicide plunge
ray trying to stop pam too late

jim watching her come amazed at her risk
yelling down jim

he watches does nothing
come on baby come on
trying another tack jim we gotta finish la woman
dont have an ending ray
reaches his hand out
she is closer
white theyre both gonna die
are you ray goes after tom baker and the film crew
yelling shouting but down below in the intimacy of the ledge blowing out on the edge the wind and the world and death
two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of the chateau reach their hands out for each other
come on baby come on quoting him
but one the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire raw singing i see your hair is burning
if they say i never loved you you know they are a liar
and throws off the challenge with a shrug all the poetry has wolves in it pam
she has never been so concentrated inching closer to him
her heels overhanging oblivion
i dont wanna die with you jim morrison i dont wanna die
never saw a woman so alone x so alone lone lone cmon pam this is it
well do it right here
you and me
ray tom siddons mike dog they all watch in horror sensing it will happen
they have even stopped filming
he dodges her touch confused
to the last possible second
then shes there in his arms
her arms latch around him and she hugs him with all her wiry soul
jim lets go lets leave this town
you and me
never come back
demonic we can
just one more step
i want to live with you
i want to live with you
the two lovers huddled together on the ledge
he slips his head down on her lap looking up into her eyes with the strangest tears in his eyes
a poem there was preserved in her the fresh miracle of surprise
clothed in sunlight restless in wanting dying of fever married to doubt how it has changed you how slowly estranged you solely arranged you beg for your mercy or
but all will pass lie down in green grass and smile and muse and gaze upon her smooth resemblance to the mating queen who it seems is in love with
the horseman tomorrow we enter the tomb of my birth i want to be ready
on her face moved
la woman floods in on his smile an upbeat surge
upstairs the onlookers relax
hotel management and cops are now rushing up in background
mojo rising mr
mojo risin x theres music rocking from the inside
cables and baffles run from the second story down to the rehearsal room on the first
keep on risin got to keep on risin risin risin x the secretaries and staff dance to the sound rocking thru the floor
well i just got into town about an hour ago took a look around see which way the wind blow camera moving thru the offices past the office boy past
siddons past the publicist etc a farewell to the band
we see ray robbie john botnick a bass and nd rhythm guitarist wives girlfriends but no jim
theyre really driving the music soars
pamelas hair shaking as she swings to the beat
with a little girl in a hollywood bungalow are you a lucky lady in the city of light
or just another lost angel city of night
wires run into a tiny toilet revealing jim with headphones to his ears barking into a dangling mike one leg propped on a toilet seat in a groove
a new strange unparalleled beauty in his voice hoarser but wiser haunted by experience yet joyful as youth jim is ironically at his best
la woman x la woman sunday afternoon x drive thru your suburbs into your blues x into your blue blue blues montage moving moving moving all the povs from fast
moving cars travelling with the pace of l
song of freedom of escape the strip the cars the freeway the billboards
camera creeping towards anne oriordan as she waits alone on a white table for the doctor to arrive
jim never showed up after all
but on we go
i see your hair is burning hills are filled with fire if they say i never lovd you you know they are a liar etc never saw a woman so
alone x so alone lone lone so alone jim drives up in his beaten gto mustang top down bags all over the place hops out
carrying his bulk with grace knocks and rings
riders on the storm starting to play over
dorothy opens the door
jim a stack of presents under his arm
you cut your hair
were trying to have another baby
moving past her what was your hair getting in the way
she smacks him lightly where are the kids
he spots them crossing to the yard where a childrens birthday is in progress two dozen kids a clown acting out for them
a few parents and friends robbie and lynne their kid john and his recent lady their kid
when the kids spot jim they light up
hey am i late or is this the cool remnant of a dream
rushing to him eee
its uncle jim
what did you bring me jim
picks up robin hows my girl
and hows my boy
they stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head
a bearded santa claus now engulfed with kids though puffy body gone a literal physical wreck yet a gentle pathos about him and still a charisma that the children react
to without thinking
he gives out the presents all over
ad libs for you
pancho gets this one
hey dorothy dont grab now
open that one thats yours
keep your paws off that now
as ray and robbie and john and the others circle him
to robin a year old and to you princess from your royal servant james douglas morrison bows as robin the cutest of them all a bow in her hair takes
the package opens it
you wanna hear the new mixes on la no i gotta plane to catch
wont take long man its the best one since days
we added rain to riders come on
jim cocks his head listening to it playing from an inner room his eyes on robin opening the gift a beautiful antique doll of an th century poet rock star
stuffed velour jacket white fluffy lace collar it could be byron or it could be jim morrison in fact the hair is perfectly weaved to resemble jim in his young lion phase an ironic gift meant from the heart
it stops everybody they all look
a haunted quality to the doll
to jim its you
she kisses him
oh its beautiful
thank you uncle jim
off the patio windows of the birthday party sounds and sunshine pouring in
the clown running around laughter
the music plays bruce at the mixing board
riders on the storm x into this house were born into this world were thrown like a dog without a bone an actor out on loan riders on the storm
where we and jim came in i guess
jim drinks from a cognac bottle straight foot tapping enjoying it knows its good but other things are calling
this is history
i gotta admit that aint bad for four guys who werent even talking that day
slapping shoulders shaking hands

we had some moments on stage like no one will ever fucking know

jim do not go gently into that good night
rage rage against the dying of the light
he winks goodbye the kids running up to grab jim pulls him back to the party
come ere uncle jim were playing blind mans bluff
jim a bearded santa claus with the birthday hat on his head surrounded by the girls and boys and dorothy shooting a home movie
theyre eating birthday cake but uncle jim is drinking straight from the cognac bottle a strange sight
to robin so what are you gonna be when you grow up
i wanna be your wife he laughs looks at dorothy whos shooting him with the super
i dont know can i afford you
pam kinda wiped me out with her dress store yknow
ill make my own dresses and youll see ill be the best wife
nodding youll never be alone jim
to dorothy you know ive never been happier
not as much of a rush as i used to be in yknow
this is the strangest life ive ever known
his eyes on a little boy whos walking into the party sitting down with the others ignored isolated a birthday cap on his head
clothes belong to the s and the face seems familiar
jim is not sure woozy from the cognac
as he fades
we saw the boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in the arizona desert
jims head falling gently into his folded arms on the table the cognac bottle at his elbow merlin hat on beard the kids laughing pulling his ears and nose he
doesnt wake up
as ray comes over now rouses him gently
gotta plane to catch man
jim coming awake in that instant alert way of his but obviously hung over
splittling headache from which the future is made
puzzling remark he gets up shaky exits kids tearing at him
the beach is behind them the last of the frisbee players and dogs the skaters go by as we continue to hear riders from within
is pam really there in paris waiting
ironic head hurts sure
the counts there so where else would she be
gotta try to start over without all the hassles yknow
i think we can
i never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man
well she is kinda flakey like me
i mean shes just so vulnerable about everything
it makes me sad man
pause but shes always kinda believed in something about me yknow her little picture of me as the unsung poet and its a fantasy i kinda dig yknow stead of
the one i live
i dont know man i dont wanna sound like your old man but youre only youre living like you gotta get it all in you gotta slow down man you
did it you broke thru to the other side
we didnt break thru ray we just pushed things a little
when you really break thru theres nothing left
no music no doors no god nothing only a will to power
i dont believe that
you were an american prince man with overbred genes jim scoffs laughs no
what couldve been jim
you couldve been president
jim cracks up no man
what couldve been jim
we stood here on this beach on the edge of the pacific that crazy summer day in and we knew you and i we knew we were at the edge
of the mind
we were there man
one planet one globe one mind
consciousness we raised it we were there
jim not the sentimental type climbs in his car amused
and now what
smiles lethally sweet youve made me into ishmael
i am the last survivor of the pequod
and i exist only to tell the story of ahab who fought the black whale
loves it laughs it was white ray
you gotta stop harpin on that day
i was so ripped i can hardly remember it
ray leans in lightening up
hey what was that poem you once wrote about two chicks on the pier
come on man i gotta fly
voice over pulling out the car in that year we had a great visitation of energy back in those days everything was simpler and more confused one summer night going
to the pier i ran into two young girls the blonde was called freedom the dark one enterprise we talked and they told me this story
as he departs waving
what was the story
his point of view jim receding into the sun in his mustang making a shakey screeching curve at the bend of the beach
and hes gone
an ominous roar of an airplane above ray
the plane flies off into the setting ball of red sun
the bearded poet hunches in his chair exhausted clutching the paper finished
he downs a final shot grunts to the indian ghostman sitting there on a stool watching him in the corner of the studio
the ghostman laughs but nothing comes out of his mouth
his wrinkled eyes are happy feathered ponytail he nods
well didja get all that
you done good jim go now rest the engineer exhausted doesnt feel anything funny
yeah i got it jim
the poets face brightens
a small but ever so sweet smile of triumph hikes up the corners of his mouth
lets get some tacos
he stands sways than moves out of view
the empty bottle of whiskey its sands run out is left behind
as we fade out a hardy mischievous morrison laugh and a ripple of sensuous music carry us into the lilting lamenting strains of an american prayer the end without lyrics
for now as we cut to pamela is agitated in her sleep waking as she feels him watching
is that him
at the door
a shadow leaves
footsteps moving down the narrow parisian corridor with the creaky floor
looks at the time
somewhere near dawn
the sounds of a bath being drawn
nightmare or sleep
she tries to fade back to sleep but the music and the whispering prod her pull her awake
putting her robe on the slippers the light
she is much more ravaged looking than before
she finds him now
his face floating upwards angelic eyes the beard is now gone a little smile on his face
he must be playing another joke
although she really knows as she says the words jim
it was you
i always know when its you
moving closer come on baby get out of the tub
mamall dry you off
pause jim morrison now you stop joking you hear me cut it out
at peace as she sobs the music cresting to jims lyrics
was it all right jim did you enjoy it when it came my baby
just like you said itd be
they are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour
unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest youve brought to bed
death makes angels of us all
and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws
his face etching into a perfect alexandrine bust of physical beauty
the camera moving to reveal a wintry day leaves blowing the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery the crumbling tombs the flowers fresh and dead around jims tomb the
graffiti wine bottles wilde bizet piaf chopin morrison
no more money no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law
i will not go i prefer a feast of friends to the giant family
the music rolling up on smoke
the distant cheers of a crowd
in slightly slow motion a figure moves down a corridor into a blinding light of stage and smoke
three other shadows are there waiting as the ghost moves to the microphone in altered motion
the audience is out there somewhere in the dark we sense they too have become ghosts as all of us will one day
the music continuing up to roll from american prayer the end snatches we annotate
ladies and gentlemen from los angeles california the doors
ghostly applause snatches have you seen the warm progress under the stars
have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom
have you been born yet and are you alive
where is the feast we were promised
lets reinvent the gods the myths of the ages
we need great golden copulations camera closing past the doors to jim alone circling the mike with his dance the indian ghostman jigging shaman like off to the side now
levitating above the stage all crazy gawky dancing
well ill tell you a story of whiskey mystics and men and about the believers and how the whole thing began first there were women and children obeying the moon
then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon
the moon is a dry blood beast we have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets
we live we die and death not ends it screams in agony ending with a solitary sing song croak
bird of prey bird of prey flying high flying high in the summer sky bird of prey bird of prey flying high flying high gently pass by bird of prey
bird of prey flying high flying high take me on your flight pause then i will come again down from the wild mountains lets lighten it up with some good old rock and roll
