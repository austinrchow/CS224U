b if window
href b b being there december draft an afternoon in late november the leaves have left the trees and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches
the garden is long and narrow guarded on either side by a high brick wall
at one end stands the rear of a three story brick townhouse at the other a one story brick building
classical music is heard in the distance
a man handsomely dressed in a well tailored suit of the s works in the garden
a gardeners apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways
he works slowly precisely obviously engrossed in his surroundings
this man is called chance
chance stops working for a moment takes a pocket watch from inside his coat checks the time
he looks to the darkening skies returns the watch to his pocket
as chance starts toward the one story brick building he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork
the sound of the music increases as chance enters the garage from the garden
a gleaming touring car is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall
chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf carefully puts it over the car
when he finishes covering the car for the night chance picks up the pitchfork leaves the garage through a side entry
the potting room is filled with the tools of the gardener everything arranged in an orderly fashion
rows of small pots are on tables young plants sprouting from some of them
a small s table model black and white tv rests on a shelf
it is playing tuned to the boston pops orchestra
attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels
the wheels spins creates an early form of color tv
as chance enters his attention is on the television set
he watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away
chance turns off the tv and leaves the room but the sound of the boston pops continues
a room adjacent to the potting room
a large screen remote control color television set dominates the room
it is on tuned to the boston pops
in contrast to the new tv the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties
there are no books magazines newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen
chance comes in watches the tv with a detached gaze as he removes his apron
he changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag
he takes off his suit jacket hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others all of like quality
chance changes the channel once again
chance wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag crosses from the rear building to the main house
the interior of the main house has the mustiness of age the warmth of oak
white dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture
chance enters walks through the hallway
a large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs
it is neatly folded back at one end leaving one chair and place setting uncovered
a small portable color tv is next to the place setting
chance enters puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway
he sits at the dining room table turns on the tv and carefully unfolds his napkin puts it on his lap as he watches the screen
louise an elderly black maid enters with a tray of food and chances clean laundry
sets dinner before chance evening chance
slowly perfect diction no accent of any kind good evening louise
louise sets chances clean clothes on the small table picks up his laundry bag
the old man is getting weaker chance
begins to eat i see
im afraid hes slippin a bit with every hour that goes by
chance his manners impeccable concentrates on the tv as he eats
a buzzer sounds louise looks upstairs
back up those stairs damn
that mans needin me more and more just before he never needs me again
still watches tv is his back feeling better
louise gives chance a look
you and your gobbledegook
youre gonna be the death of me yet chance
she turns to leave unless those stairs are
the good lords liable to snatch up two unwillin souls at the same time if i keep on trampin up those stairs
i dont want none of that
louise disappears through the doorway
chance continues to eat and watch tv
chance is asleep lying on his back
his eyes slowly open and with no change of expression he sits up and turns on the tv with the remote control
chance gets out of bed goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer checks the time
he crosses to the closet his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television
he puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room
chance enters turns on the tv with the spinning color wheel then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can
he turns off the tv and exits
chance comes into the garage takes the cover off of the touring car folds it and puts it on a shelf
he leaves the garage
chance returns to his room changes channels on the television takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the closet then goes into the bathroom
a light snow is falling
the door to the small building opens chance peeks out then goes back inside
a few seconds pass and chance reappears this time with an umbrella
smartly dressed in suit and tie he crosses to the main house
chance opens the door shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering
he hangs the umbrella on a doorknob then heads for the dining room
repeating his ritual chance enters the dining room sits turns on the tv carefully spreads his napkin on his lap
he watches the screen for a moment then turns expecting louise
she doesnt appear so he turns back watches tv
after a few beats chance hears louises footsteps hurrying down the stairs
she comes into the dining room visibly distraught
chance looks up smiles
good morning louise
out of breath hes dead chance
the old mans dead
flatly turns back to tv i see
must of happened durin the night i dont know
lord he wasnt breathin and as cold as a fish
i touched him just to see and you believe me chance thats doin more than i get paid to do
then i just covered him up pulled the sheet over his head

then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably he wasnt any too alert
he just said yeah hes been expectin it and said hed send somebody over
lord what a mornin
watches news flashes of seasons first snowfall yes louise its snowing in the garden today
have you looked outside and seen the snow
its very white
a beat of silence from louise then anger
is that all you got to say
chance smiles is silent that old mans layin up there dead as hell and it just dont make any difference to you
with a smile accepting death yes louise
i have seen it often
it happens to old people
well aint that the truth
louise throws back the cover from a chair next to chance and sits softening a bit toward him
oh lord chance i dont know what i was expectin from you
im sorry for yellin like i did
no sir i just dont know what i was expectin
chance doesnt react watches tv i spose id better gather up some breakfast for you
a turn to her yes im very hungry

she starts out stops by the door what are you goin to do now chance
gazing at tv im going to work in the garden
louise gives chance a long look then turns to leave
as she goes ill get you some eggs
chance nods in approval then changes the channel on the tv
an enclosed stairway
chance enters proceeds up the stairs
chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase
he moves off down the hall
the furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the old man is
there is a polite knock at the door then chance enters the room
as chance moves slowly to the old mans bed we sense a feeling of respect from chance as well as a bit of curiosity
chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the old mans face
he touches the mans forehead lightly briefly then replaces the sheet
chance moves to the tv like the one in his own room and turns it on
he sits in an easy chair next to the old mans bed and watches a movie from the early forties
chance puts an arm out rests it on the old mans covered body
with the other he changes the channels with the remote control
he returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady
the scene seems to have sunk into his mind
it has stopped snowing
chance wearing a hat the gardening apron over his suit and boots putters in the garden
louise comes out of the main house
she is dressed warmly a scarf over her head a heavy coat
chance sees her tips his hat to louise exactly like the man he saw on television
well aint you the gentleman this mornin
a pause gotta go now chance
resumes working yes
youre gonna need somebody someones gotta be around for you boy
he keeps working you oughta find yourself a lady chance
she smiles slightly with caring but i guess it oughta be an old lady cause you aint gonna do a young one any good not with that little thing of
she reaches out puts a hand on his shoulder youre always gonna be a little boy aint you
he smiles keeps working goodbye chance
louise gives his shoulder a squeeze turns and moves toward the house
as she goes goodbye louise
louise waves as she enters the townhouse
chance tips his hat once again as she disappears
louise enters the hallway picks up a couple of suit cases waiting by the door
she stops as she sees two men in white carrying a stretcher down the main staircase
she notices the ease with which they bring the old mans body down the stairs
he used to be a big man
spose he wasted away to about nothin
a beat then she talks to the body of the old man i guess ill be goin off to find me some folks old man
im not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer
the stretcher bearers move to the front door
louise steps in front of them
to stretcher bearers wait up
im goin out that door first
louise takes one more look at the covered body then opens the front door leaves
the tv plays offstage as chance washes up in the bathroom
he finishes comes into the bedroom takes a pair of house slippers from his closet turns off the television and leaves the room
chance carrying his slippers crosses through the layer of fresh snow to the townhouse
chance wearing the slippers enters and sits at his place
he turns on the tv puts the napkin on his lap
he watches tv for a moment then turns looks for louise
she does not appear so he resumes watching tv
he changes channels views a wildly exciting football game
at a peak in the excitement he again switches channels
chance watches tv news coverage of the president of the united states greeting foreign dignitaries at the white house
close shots on television reveal that the president uses a two handed handshake when meeting his guests
unconsciously chance grips one hand with the other the scene on tv seeming to have sunk into his mind
a key is heard in the lock
the door opens and thomas franklin and sally hayes enter
franklin an attorney is in his late thirties carries a large briefcase
hayes is younger attractive also an attorney
she totes a briefcase has the look of a modern liberated woman
hayes appears to be surprised at the interior of the house
looks around this is another world tom i never would have believed it
he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties
before i was born
would you take me on a tour
he smiles the safe is in mr
jennings bedroom thatll be stop number one
franklin puts a hand on hayes shoulder as they go off down the hall
chance still watches tv waits for louise to serve him
franklin and hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room
they are both surprised to see chance
hello we thought we heard something
moves to chance hand outstretched im thomas franklin
chance remains seated takes franklins hand warmly in both of his like the president did on tv
im chance the gardener
a beat the gardener
thinks its a joke laughs yes of course
chance this is ms
hayes moves to shake chances hand
chance im very pleased to meet you
doesnt rise again shakes with both hands yes
chance turns back to the tv and hayes and franklin exchange looks
after an uneasy pause were with franklin jennings and roberts the law firm handling the estate
a smile totally at ease yes thomas i understand
another period of silence
franklin and hayes seem perplexed
are you waiting for someone
im waiting for my lunch
you have a luncheon appointment here
louise will bring me lunch
a look to hayes but she should have left earlier today
smiles at hayes i see
a beat youve quite a sense of humor mr
chance but all kidding aside may i ask just what you are doing here
i live here
you live here
a look to hayes we dont have any record of that
its very cold outside today isnt it thomas
a beat how long have you been living here
ever since i can remember since i was a child
doubting since you were a child
i have always been here
i have always worked in the garden
then you really are a gardener
your appearance doesnt suggest that at all mr
do you have any proof of your employment mr
chance any checks from the deceased any contracts or documents
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed
how were you paid
i was given meals and a home
what about money
i never needed money
franklin steps to the tv turns it off
chance perhaps you could show us some identification with your address a drivers license a credit card checkbook
no i do not have any of those
then how about medical records
could you give us the name of your doctor or your dentist
i have no need for a doctor or dentist
i have never been ill
i have never been allowed outside of this house and except for joe i have never had any visitors
turns tv back on joe saracini
he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house
that was in
changes channels yes
i remember when he came
he was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book
of men and women
chance that was twenty seven years ago
yes and the old man used to come to my garden
he would read and rest there
come now mr
jennings had been bedridden for thirty five years since he fractured his spine
yes thomas that is correct
then he stopped visiting my garden
a beat we shall need some proof of your having resided here mr
you have me i am here
what more proof do you need
franklin and hayes exchange looks
chance puts on his snow boots as franklin and hayes continue their questioning
have you served in the army
but i have seen the army on television
how about taxes mr
chance surely you must have paid taxes
chance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside
chance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward the rear building
points those trees were very young when i first arrived
are you related to the deceased mr
no i dont think so
and i have planted and shaped all the hedges and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers
might you have a birth certificate mr
points to wall thats where joe fixed the bricks
they arrive at the rear building and chance opens the door to the garage
franklin and hayes follow him inside
franklin and hayes are taken aback by the touring car
admires car do you drive this mr
i have never been in an automobile
amazed you never been in a car
chance is silent for a moment he blushes slightly
from time to time i did sit in it
just in here
it hasnt been outside since the old man hurt himself
he turns i live in here
chance moves toward his room franklin and hayes follow
chance sits on the bed to remove his boots as hayes and franklin inspect the room
the old man gave me nice television sets this one has remote control
he turns it on with the remote he has one just like it
chance the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased
yes i understand
chance puts on his slippers crosses to the closet opens the door
it is filled with mens wear
i am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the old mans suits
they all fit me very well
i can also take his shirts shoes and coats
it is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style
i have seen styles on television
getting back to business what are your plans now mr
i would like to stay and work in my garden
chance turns to watch tv
franklin takes hayes to a side of the room
quietly what do you make of all this
i really dont know tom he seems so honest and simple
in a way hes quite charming
looks at chance yeah
its very bizarre i dont know what to think
hes either very very bright or very very dense hes hard to figure
he unzips briefcase lets just keep everything legal
franklin takes out some papers approaches chance
chance assuming what you say is the truth i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceaseds estate
does not understand im fine thomas
the garden is a healthy one
there is no need for a claim
then if you would please sign a paper to that effect
franklin hands the release to chance but chance does not take it
i dont know how to sign
come now mr
smiles i have no claim thomas
but you wont sign correct
very well mr
chance if you insist on dragging this matter on
but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon
if indeed you do reside here you will have to move out
i dont understand thomas
i think you do mr
however i will reiterate this house is closed and you must leave
he gives chance his business card call me if you change your mind about signing
turns to hayes cmon sally lets grab a bite
a smile to chance good day mr
returns smile good day sally
chance watches as they leave then puts franklins card on a desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at television
a large attic filled with the old mans possessions of the past
chance enters turns on an old black and white tv with a magnifying lens attached to the front
as it plays he selects a fine leather suitcase from several takes a hand made suit from a long rack
the tv is on as chance packs his belongings
chance very nicely dressed comes out of the rear building carrying his suitcase
he stops on occasion to inspect his garden as he walks toward the townhouse
chance is reluctant to open the front door
after some hesitation he gathers up his courage opens it and steps outside closing the door behind him
chance stops short on the front steps the townhouse is situated in a decaying ghetto
the snow is a dirty grey houses adjoining have their windows shattered are smeared with grafitti
chance tries to return to the safety of the townhouse but the door is locked
he stands on the steps for a moment then moves to the trash laden sidewalk
he stops ponders which way to go finally makes up his mind and moves off to his left
the buildings are crumbling rusted out cars line the street
a group of black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the sidewalk a fire burning between them for warmth
chance rounds the corner walks up to them
he stands by them smiles
they stare back no sign of friendship in their faces
chance nods politely to them then walks away down the sidewalk
a group of eight to ten hard core ghetto youths hang out on a corner
other passersby give them a wide berth they are unapproachable
chance nears the group approaches
friendly excuse me would you please tell me where i could find a garden to work in
they turn to him as one silent amazed that this white trespasser would intrude on their jiving
after a beat there is much to be done during the winter i must start the seeds for the spring i must work the soil
one of the black youths lolo interrupts chance
what you growin man
the leader of the gang abbaz shuts up lolo with an elbow and moves menacingly forward
nose to nose with chance what you doin here boy
i had to leave my garden
i want to find another
who sent you here boy
did that chickenshit asshole raphael send you here boy
thomas franklin told me that i had to leave the old mans house hes dead now you know
dead my ass
now get this honkie you go tell raphael that i aint takin no jive from no western union messenger
you tell that asshole if he got somethin to tell me to get his ass here himself
edges closer to chance you got that boy
chance smiles at abbaz and reaches into his pocket
he takes out his remote control tv changer if i see raphael i will tell him
chance points the changer at abbaz and clicks it three times tries to change the picture
abbaz immediately pulls out a switchblade whips the blade open
holds knife at chance now move honkie
before i cut your white ass
chance disappointed that the changer did not work returns it to his pocket
as he leaves good day
abbaz lolo and the gang watch him go then begin to buzz with excitement who the fuck died
whyd he pull that changer on us man
the old man died must be papa joe
hes some weird honkie man
a bulletin board affixed to a storefront in chinatown
chance gazes at the notes pinned to it written in chinese
smiling he turns from it walks on through the area
a street lined with adult book stores x rated movies and strip joints
an elderly black woman approaches carrying a bag of groceries
chance steps in front of the woman stops her
im very hungry now
would you please bring me my lunch
the woman looks up to chance becomes very frightened
she turns and half runs into a sleazy bar for safety
chance watches after her for a moment then continues along
chance stands looking through a chain link fence watching some teenage boys playing basketball
he bangs on the fence calls to them
i have seen your game
i have watched elvin hayes play it many times
they call him big e
the boys ignore him chance walks away
chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street
he seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side
in the background can be seen the washington monument
chance seems stumped on which way to go
he looks up one street then the other has no idea where they lead
he turns looks behind him and sees a large statue of benito juarez pointing
chance smiles and goes off in the direction that benito points
tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the white house
chance is turned the other way inspecting the branches of a dying tree
chance moves to a policeman standing nearby
points to tree that tree is very sick
it should be cared for
the policeman looks at the tree then at chance figures a man dressed that well must be important
ill report it right away
that would be a good thing to do
the policeman takes out his walkie talkie as chance walks away
a fashionable area
expensive shops well kept streets and sidewalks
a television store has caught chances eye
he stands by the display window looks in at a dozen or so color tvs all turned on playing various channels
a video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an advent tv
chance is intrigued by his own image
he poses lifts one arm then the other to make sure that it is really him on television
he moves forward smiles then moves slowly backward notices himself become smaller on the screen
he steps back off the curb frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the advent
standing between two parked cars chance takes out his remote control clicks it at the advent
four or five other sets in the window change channels but he does not reappear on the giant screen
as he does this the car to his left a large american made limousine backs up
the car bumps chance pins him against the car to his right
chance cries out in pain drops his suitcase his changer and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo
the chauffeur david and the liveryman jeffrey immediately jump from the car run back to chance
im very sorry sir
david and jeffrey reach out to help but chance is wedged solidly between the two cars
in pain i cant move
rushes back to limo my lord
this is terrible sir i hope youre not badly injured
im not badly injured
but my leg is very sore
david pulls the car forward freeing chance
a few bystanders begin to gather as jeffrey helps chance to the sidewalk
can you walk
its not broken is it
leans against limo holds leg its very sore
david gets out of the car comes back
perhaps i should call an ambulance
a bystander interrupts
somebody ought to call the police
looks over smiles theres no need for police its just my leg
during this the rear door of the limo opens and eve rand steps out
eve is in her late thirties has the look of a traditional new england lady
she watches as jeffrey tends to chance
i dont think we should call anyone just yet it may not even be all that serious
obviously hurting i agree
lets have a look do you mind
i would like to look
chance bends raises his trouser leg
a red bluish swollen bruise three inches in diameter is forming on his calf
its starting to swell is it painful
eve moves closer to chance looks at the bruise
to chance wont you let us do something for you
your leg should be examined we could take you to a hospital
smiles at eve theres no need for a hospital
why there certainly is
you must see a doctor i insist on it
please let us take you
eve turns to get back into the limo
david goes with her to hold the door
im terribly sorry mrs
rand i never saw the man
oh i dont think it was anyones fault david
thank you maam
chance is hesitant about getting in the car
jeffrey offers a helping hand
ive never ridden in an automobile
a beat i assure you sir david is a very careful driver
please wont you let us take you
looks at the car then decides yes
you can take me
jeffrey assists chance into the rear seat of the limo
as he gets in my suitcase
ill take care of that
jeffrey closes the door goes back to pick up chances suitcase does not notice the remote control
as jeffrey puts chances bag into the trunk we see the personalized license plate rand l
chance and eve settle in the back seat
as they talk david starts up the limo jeffrey joins him in front and the limo pulls out into traffic
i hope youre comfortable
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to do over a simple little accident
of course they can be very frightening and i must apologize for david hes never had an accident before
hes a very careful driver
why yes he is
is your leg feeling any better
its feeling better but its still very sore
a thought say would you mind seeing our family doctor
doesnt understand your family doctor
my husband has been very ill
his doctor and nurses are staying with us
those hospitals can be so impersonal why it might be hours before you are treated
fine it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you
leans forward david well just go on home
jeffrey would you call and let them know
eve presses a button the glass partition closes
as the window rolls up behind him jeffrey dials the limo telephone
there is a moment of silence
eve still a bit on edge from the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger in the car presses another button
the limos bar moves out revealing a row of decanters and glasses
would you care for a drink
as eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass chance notices the limos tv set
i would like to watch television
a bit surprised oh
she hands chance the cognac turns on the tv
oh by the way im eve rand
chance takes a sip of the cognac is not accustomed to alcohol coughs
there is another moment of silence
may i ask your name
with a slight cough my name is chance
pardon me was that mr
still indistinct no
im a gardener
youre not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you
im not related to basil and perdita
well theyre just a wonderful couple weve been friends for years
we visit their island quite often
chance reaches out to change the channel on the tv suddenly realizes he doesnt have his remote control
he starts going through his pockets searches for it
did you lose something
i lost my remote control
well im very sorry
another pause chance reaches out changes channels on tv
ill feel so relieved after dr
allenby examines your leg
after that david can run you on home or to your office or wherever youd prefer
chance still watches tv is there anything special you would like to watch
i like to watch
this is fine
chance watches the news
eve sips on her cognac as david eases the limo out of the city of washington
the limo approaches then turns into the entrance way of the rand estate
two guards stand on either side of the open gate salute as the car passes through
the drive runs alongside a stream then turns and crosses a large meadow
the limousine passes still no sign of the house
it is a very very long driveway
chance is glued to the tv switches channels again watches the news
eve takes his fascination with television as a sign of intelligence
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events
i admire that in a person
as for myself i find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times
chance nods changes the channel watches a mighty mouse cartoon
eve looks at him perplexed then takes it for a joke and smiles
two uniformed valets wilson and perkins await the limousines by the front door of the rand mansion
wilson stands behind a wheelchair
as the limo parks perkins and jeffrey assist chance into the chair
wilson turns to eve as she gets out of the limo
good evening mrs
good evening wilson
i shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite maam
allenby is standing by
thank you wilson
that will be fine
perkins and jeffrey carry chance in the chair up the steps and into the house
eve and wilson follow
once inside the house wilson takes over wheeling chance
a lady greta is waiting to take eves coat
thank you greta
to wilson ill be with mr
rand if im needed
to chance ill see you after the doctor has a look at your leg mr
looking around mansion yes i think he should examine my leg
eve watches as wilson wheels chance around a corner
the doors open wilson pushes chance into the elevator
as wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them a strange look comes over chances face
looks to wilson ive never been in one of these
wilson thinks that chance is talking about the wheelchair
its one of mr
since hes been ill
chance looks around the elevator
does it have a television
laughs no but mr
rand does have one with an electric motor that way he can get around by himself
chance again checks out the elevator
how long do we stay in here
i dont know see what the doctor says
the elevator stops on the third floor
a hallway adjoining a large glass enclosed room
eve passes through the hall enters the room
eve enters into a hermetically sealed area set up with all the latest hospital emergency gear oxygen ekg machine x ray machine transfusion equipment sterilizers etc
benjamin rand wearing a silk bathrobe lies in a king sized bed in the center of the room
a nurse constance is attending to her duties in the room looks up as eve comes in
good evening mrs
good evening constance
ben rand perks up as he sees eve crossing to him
he is in his sixties maintains an inner strength and dignity despite the sapping effects of his illness
with weakness eve
eve kisses him holds his hand
oh ben i miss you so when im out
how are you feeling
and im getting tired of being so tired
other than that im doing very well
no its been a good day better than yours from what ive been told
holds his hand against her cheek you heard
i may be a shut in but i do not lack for news
im sorry you had to go through all that
oh it wasnt all that bad darling
we were fortunate that mr
gardiner turned out to be so reasonable
good id like to meet a reasonable man
why dont you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner
sits on the side of the bed do you feel well enough for that
tell me the truth eve if i wait until i feel better will i ever meet the man
there is silence from eve
rand squeezes her hand turns to constance
i want new blood tonight im getting up for dinner
dont argue tell robert i want new blood
turns to eve ask him to dinner
rand pulls eves hand close kisses it
an enormous bedroom filled with th century antique furniture
robert allenby dabs chances ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol prior to an injection
chance stands with his pants to the floor looks to the television which is not turned on
the injection will ease the pain and swelling mr
ive seen it done before
now youll barely feel this
it wont hurt at all
allenby administers the injection chance reacts from the pain
you were wrong it did hurt
a chuckle but not for long
as allenby puts a band aid on chances ass chance spots a remote control for the tv on the bedside table
he reaches out picks it up
its good that there was no apparent damage to the bone
i think so too
however with injuries such as this i have run into minor hemorrhaging which really isnt too serious at the time but can cause secondary problems if not looked after
chance turns on the tv
a look to the tv then to chance you can pull your trousers up now
as chance pulls up pants just to take the proper precautions mr
gardiner id recommend we take you downstairs and x ray your leg
no reaction from chance allenby takes a long look at him by the way mr
gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out
doesnt understand straight out
are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rands
after a beat claim
oh claim thats what thomas asked me
thomas franklin an attorney
turns back to tv yes
suddenly very cold then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys
theres no need for a claim the garden is a healthy one
gives chance a look oh i see
warms up well then
youre a very funny man mr
you caught me off guard i must admit
changes channels sits on bed thank you
good keep your weight off that leg mr
in fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible
since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs
i can promise you the finest in care unless of course you would prefer to go elsewhere
yes i could stay here
would you like me to speak to your personal physician
allenby waits for chance to say more he does not
finally allenby picks up his bag heads for the door
stops by door ill send wilson up to take you for x rays mr
feel free to use the telephone and please let me know if you have any discomfort
clicking changer yes i will
allenby gives him a look then leaves
chance watches an old movie of a man lighting a cigar
the man enjoys the cigar blows out smoke
the scene seems to sink into chances mind
eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming cup of tea
allenby comes outside joins her
good god eve youll freeze out here
i wanted some fresh air robert
how is mr
a rather large contusion but i dont feel there is any serious damage
id like to keep an eye on him though i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days
is that necessary
not necessary but preferable
i dont think hell be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man
yes he is different
not the kind of person one usually meets in washington
gardiner may be a welcome change of pace
hes very intense and internal dont you think
at times yes
but thats not an uncommon reaction to such an accident
actually i found him to have quite a sense of humor
it might be pleasant for a couple of days
eve puts down her tea robert
is there any improvement
eve is silent for a moment looks out to the darkness
sometimes when i see ben i could swear that hes getting stronger
something that he might say the way he moves or a look in his eyes makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that hell be better soon
its just so hard to believe whats really happening
allenby reaches out holds eves hand
the elevator door opens wilson guides chance in the wheelchair into the hallway
looks back to elevator that is a very small room
laughs yes sir i guess thats true smallest room in the house
glancing around yes
it seems to be
wilson takes this as another joke chuckles as he wheels chance toward rands hospital room
constance and another nurse teresa stand by as rand is being given a transfusion
rand lifts his head as wilson wheels chance into the room
welcome to rand memorial hospital mr
looks around room i see
wilson pushes chance to the x ray machine where the technician billings a black man waits
as wilson and billings help chance onto the x ray table chances face brightens up
i feel very good in here
sure you do
this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up
i like that very much
lining up chances leg this wont take long mr
please hold still when i ask
chance stares at billings reacts to him being black
to billings do you know raphael
no sir i dont believe i do
i have a message for him
a black man gave me the message
well i still dont believe i know the man mr
now hold still
rand looks over as billings takes the x ray
aplastic anemia mr
gardiner aplastic anemia
chance smiles to rand
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells
not a damn thing they can do about it
oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions
and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr
gardiner is that its generally a young persons disease
here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young persons disease
still smiles at rand yes
you look very sick
hold still please mr
a laugh i am very sick and as you can see by all this paraphernalia i am very wealthy
i think i would rather be wealthy and sick than poor and sick
looks around the room i understand
ive never seen anything like this on television
please hold still mr
you too mr
rand you must stay quiet
rand lays his head back
were prisoners mr
gardiner were prisoners of tubes and technology
flat on his back you will join us for dinner wont you mr
also flat on his back yes
i am very hungry
so am i my boy so am i
thurmand a waiter and marianne a waitress enter into the rand dining room carrying trays of food
the dining room is immense a foot ceiling huge fireplace
allenby eve rand and chance both in wheelchairs sit around the table
rand speaks slowly with obvious weakness
i know exactly what you mean
today the businessman is at the mercy of kid lawyers from the sec
all they want to do is regulate our natural growth
its happening across the country
to everyone im afraid
the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession as we know it is being legislated out of existence
by kid lawyers
eve turns to chance
wont your injury prevent you from attending to business mr
it wont do that
would you like us to notify anyone for you
the old man died and louise left
there is a moment of silence
im very sorry
well if you have any need for any of our facilities please do not hesitate to ask
do you need a secretary
no thank you
my house has been closed
when you say your house has been closed you mean to say that your business was shut down
shut down and locked by the attorneys
whatd i tell you
i hope that staying here wont be an inconvenience for you
i like it here
thats good mr
or may i call you chauncey
agreeable to being called chauncey yes
chauncey is fine
and im ben
smiles to chance and please call me robert
so tell me chauncey what are your plans now
chance looks around the room
does this house have a garden
allenby gives chance a look
do we have a garden
tomorrow chauncey you will see our gardens
i would like to work in your garden
laughs oh i know exactly what you mean
i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself such a pleasant way to forget ones troubles
i am a very good gardener
well put chauncey excellent
isnt that what a businessman is
a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of
value for his family and community
yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard
thank you ben
the garden that i left was such a place
everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands
i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow
but i dont have that any more
points to ceiling all thats left for me now is the room upstairs
now wait a minute chauncey you are young you are healthy for gods sake dont give up on yourself
you have to fight
you cant let those bastards keep you down
i dont want to hear any more from you about the room upstairs
thats where im going soon
there is a long pause
chance looks up then smiles at rand
its a very pleasant room ben
laughs yes im sure it is
thats what they say anyway
another period of silence
the servants bustle around the room as allenby studies chance
allenby opens the door
rand enters in his electric wheelchair followed by chance being pushed by wilson
i dont know what youve heard about me chauncey but im sure you know everything there is to know
rand holds out humidor to chance
yes thank you
takes cigar no ben
i dont know everything about you
rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself
no of course you dont
excuse me for being so presumptuous
no man knows everything about another man however very few are honest enough to admit it
that is so true
youre different chauncey
quite different than most men
thank you robert
rand lights his own cigar then hands an ornate lighter to chance
picks up pool cue weakly strokes the balls you know chauncey there are thousands of american businessmen large and small that share your plight
ive been concerned with the situation for some time now
chance not knowing to bite off the tip tries to light the cigar like the man on tv
it will not light
so ive been thinking about beginning a financial assistance program chauncey to help out american businessmen that have been harassed by inflation excessive taxation unions and other indecencies
allenby watches chance trying to light the cigar as rand speaks on shooting pool as he talks
id like to offer the decent gardeners of the business community a helping hand
after all they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well being of our middle class
tell me would you have any thoughts on such a program
chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray smiles at allenby then answers rand
a smile reluctant to speak eh chauncey
well i can understand that
when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time
just give it some thought work with the idea im sure youll have plenty to say in a few days
i could give it some thought ben but my leg is very sore
looks to allenby robert take a look would you
some pain is to be expected
bends to chance looks at leg and i think what would be best for the two of you is a good nights rest
checks watch its late im afraid its time for my patients to prepare for bed
puts down pool cue we have common foes chauncey kid lawyers and our physician
allenby laughs as he takes rands cigar from him snuffs it in the ashtray
wilson stands behind chance in the wheelchair
chance glances slowly and inquisitively around the elevator
when his eyes meet wilsons the valet breaks out in laughter
laughing trying to apologize sorry sir i just couldnt contain myself
i knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator
excuse me sir
the elevator stops the door opens
wilson wheels chance out of the elevator
looks back as the door closes hmmm
laughs again yes sir elevator
wilson stops laughing becomes the stone faced servant once again as he notices eve coming out of her bedroom
wilson stops wheeling chance stands stiffly at attention as eve and chance talk
chauncey i wanted to tell you how dreadful i feel about the accident today but that im delighted that you are staying with us
thank you eve i like this house very much
and ben is just mad about you youve lifted his spirits so its just
well its just a real pleasure having you with us
ben is very ill eve ive seen that before
i know chauncey
i like ben very much
he reminds me of the old man
are you going to leave and close the house when he dies
eve is not prepared for such a question
no i dont think so
chance smiles at eve and there is a moment of silence before eve steps back into her bedroom
good night chauncey
good night eve
eve closes the door
wilson wheels chance down the hallway toward the guest room
eve comes out of the house jeffrey holds the door for her as she gets into rand l
jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls away
chance comes out of the front door walking with a limp
his first view of the rand grounds in the daylight he is taken by the extent of the greenery
an attendant lewis hurries to chance
did you want a car sir
i would like a car
lewis goes to his post picks up a phone
as chance looks at the surroundings allenby and wilson with chances wheelchair come out of the house
frowns as he sees chance walking chauncey there you are
what are you doing on that leg
its fine today robert
shame on you chauncey you should let me be the judge of that
motions to wilson please sit in the chair
wilson pushes the wheelchair to chance he sits
checks leg i swear chauncey between you and benjamin ive got my hands full
looks at calf say that is coming along the swelling has gone down considerably
pokes a spot any pain here
but its not bad
a limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion waits for chance
continues examining benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his financial institute today but obviously the strain would be impossible
how about here chauncey any soreness
hardly any robert
lewis the attendant interrupts
your limousine sir
oh thank you
reacting to limo were you going somewhere
a beat oh
checks leg my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers
anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt
hes due here soon i believe
i know about the president
mildly surprised oh
ben called me
he wants me to meet the president
stands he does does he
yes ben told me to be in his room at ten oclock
why thats terrific chauncey
how do i know when its ten oclock
a long look from allenby then he looks at his watch
its five of youd best get on in there
thank you robert
wilson begins to push chance
i would like to walk today
hell yes walk
youre meeting the president arent you
gets out of chair oh really
allenby a bit puzzled watches as chance goes into the house
chance limps aimlessly through a hallway
he stops admires a large tapestry on the wall
a servant smythe notices chance appears confused approaches him
may i help you mr
with a smile yes
i would like to go to rand memorial hospital
a pause sir
there is another long pause
did you wish to see someone sir
yes i would like to see ben
rand of course
right this way sir
chance follows smythe down the hall
rand is in an easy chair dressed for his meeting with the president
the two nurses are working at the disinfecting table
rand smiles as chance is shown into the room by smythe
chauncey up and around this morning are you
my leg is not very sore
well thats good news my boy
youre looking much better today ben
its all make up chauncey
i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i didnt want the president to think i was going to die during our talk
no one likes a dying man my boy because few know what death is
all we know is the terror of it
but youre an exception chauncey thats what i admire in you your marvelous balance
you dont stagger back and forth between fear and hope youre a truly peaceful man
thank you ben
looks at rand closely the nurse did a very good job ben
the nurses turn look at chance
wilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front steps
two black plymouth sedans pull up and park
eight men in grey business suits get out
one of them woltz goes directly to wilson
good morning mr
good morning mr
woltz nice to see you again
how have you been
fine thank you
hands woltz paper we have an additional guest with us today mr
reads list i see
turns to other men okay lets go to work
the eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits and go into the house
allenby gets off the elevator stands and thinks for a moment then heads off down the hallway in the direction of chances room
chance watches television as rand speaks
yes when i was younger i had thoughts about public office
but i found chauncey that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen
of course my wealth provided me with considerable influence but ive tried believe me not to misuse that power
its extremely important chauncey when one is in a position of eminence that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country
the temptations are strong and ive been labeled a kingmaker by many but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people
i have tried to remain honest to myself
changing channels i see ben
maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey
maybe one day
two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion
as men from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and take positions around the driveway lewis hurries to his post picks up his phone
the nerve center of the rand enterprises since he has become ill
four or five desks all the latest electronic office equipment three tvs with video taping facilities countless telephones
aubrey rands senior secretary is at her desk answers her phone
into phone yes
oh very good lewis thank you
aubrey hangs up picks up another phone pushes a button
rand smiles at chance as the phone rings
into phone yes mrs
show the president to the library well be along in a few minutes
rand hangs up the phone turns to chance with a twinkle in his eyes
its an old habit that goes along with power keep them waiting
teresa brings rands wheelchair to him
stands very weak not now teresa
im seeing the president on my own two feet
puts an arm around chance for support shall we go chauncey
thats a good idea
rand walks slowly clings to the limping chance tightly as they leave the room
secret service men are seen in the background as rand stops outside mrs
aubreys office leans in
aubrey have you received the papers on the caracas agreement
theyre ready for you to sign
turns to chance a good woman mrs
seeing her for first time i agree ben
they shuffle off down the hallway
chance smiles at the secret service men that they pass
woltz and wilson wait by the library door
woltz takes a small metal detector from his pocket as rand and chance approach
good morning mr
woltz how have you been
passes detector over rands body just fine thank you sir
turns to chance and you must be mr
passes detector over chance just a formality mr
as he finishes thank you very much
wilson knocks lightly then opens the library door rand and chance enter
rand and chance come into the library and the president goes to rand with both hands outstretched
very weak mr
president how good to see you
its so good to see you too ben you look terrific
barely able to stand im not convinced of that mr
president but your visit has raised my spirits
well im delighted to be here my friend
ive missed you
guides rand to chair here sit down get off your feet
as rand sinks into the chair chance approaches the president with both hands outstretched
good morning mr
chance and the president exchange a two handed handshake
rand still weak from standing catches his breath and introduces chance
president id like you to meet my dear friend mr
gardiner my pleasure
you look much taller on television mr
a beat oh really
smiling you will find that my house guest does not bandy words mr
the president gives chance a look then laughs
gardiner thats just fine with me im a man that appreciates a frank discussion
be seated please mr
sitting yes i will
also sits now ben did you happen to get a chance to
chance perks up at the mention of his name interrupts
there is a beat as the president looks at chance quizzically then he continues
i just wondered if you had gone over my speech ben
yes i did
overall pretty good
president i think its very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game
i sympathize with your position mr
president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos
thats too big a risk i cant take the chance
again perks up yes
once again the president gives chance a puzzled look
perkins accompanies secret service agent riff as he checks out the third floor
riff knocks on each door looks inside then moves in
allenby is searching through chancels clothes looking for some sort of identification
there is a knock at the door allenby pulls back from the closet as riff opens the door looks inside
entering good morning
im riff secret service
perkins watches curiously as riff passes the metal detector over allenbys clothing
the president is worried about what rand is telling him
he paces smokes a cigarette
chance smiles through it all
there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can youve reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis
and from where i see it mr
president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point
we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible
its that serious huh
im afraid so
the president now looks nearly as bad as rand
he sits turns to chance
do you agree with ben mr
are we finished
or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives
a beat as long as the roots are not severed all is well and all will be well in the garden
a pause in the garden
that is correct
in a garden growth has its season
there is spring and summer but there is also fall and winter
and then spring and summer again
staring at chance spring and summer
confused yes i see
fall and winter
smiles at chance yes indeed
a beat could you go through that one more time please mr
i think what my most insightful friend is saying mr
president is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy
that is correct
pleased well mr
gardiner i must admit that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements ive heard in a very very long time
the president puts out his cigarette rises
many of us forget that nature and society are one
yes though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature we are still a part of it
like nature our economic system remains in the long run stable and rational
and that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy
he smiles at chance who is absorbed in looking around the room at the books i envy your good solid sense mr
gardiner that is precisely what we lack on capitol hill
glances at watch i must be going
holds out hand to chance mr
gardiner this visit has been enlightening
chance rises and shakes the presidents hand
you will honor me and my family with a visit wont you
wonderful well all look forward to seeing you
turns to rand is eve around
id like to say hello
no she flew up to boston for another charity event
shell be sorry to have missed you
im sorry too
well nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you and ben i want to thank you for your time and thoughts
president i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man
now ben i wont have any of that
why dont you listen to your good friend chauncey this is a time to think of life
the president clasps rands hand
youre right mr
president i dont like feeling sorry for myself
take care of yourself ben
you take care too bobby
as he turns to go a smile to chance mr
the president leaves the library and chance sits back down
as the door closes hes a decent fellow the president isnt he
yes ben he is
he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately seldom if ever at all
im glad he came ben
it was nice talking to the president
an aide kaufman waits by the front door of the rand mansion
as the president comes out he speaks quietly to kaufman
kaufman im going to need information on mr
chauncey gardiners background
makes note of name gardiner yes sir
and put it through on a code red i want it as soon as possible
no problem chief
they head toward the waiting limousines
rand has an arm around chance hangs on for dear life as the two of them walk through the hall
behind them wilson and perkins push empty wheelchairs
very weak you know chauncey theres something about you
youre direct you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly
you dont play games with words to protect yourself
i feel i can speak to you frankly
you know what i was talking to you about last night
blankly no ben
oh sure you do the financial assistance program
i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking
id like you to meet with the members of the board well be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time
stops outside his door and please chauncey dont rush your decision
i know youre not a man to act on the spur of the moment
thank you ben
and now chauncey im afraid you must excuse me im very tired all of a sudden
wilson and perkins leave the wheelchairs assist rand into his hospital room
as they go in im sorry that you are so sick ben
the door closes chance limps off down the hall
chance with a limp walks down a pathway in the garden admires the greenery
in the background coming from the house we see eve
approaches chance calls chauncey
stops turns hello eve
your leg must be getting better
its feeling much better now
im glad to hear that
they walk together how did you like meeting the president
hes very nice
yes he is
im sorry i didnt get to see him
they walk along in silence for a moment
chance sees a huge greenhouse not far from them heads toward it
eve turns to him hesitates then questions
last night you mentioned an old man that died
was he a relative
or an intimate friend
looking at greenhouse he was a very wealthy man he looked after me since i was young
oh i see
your mentor perhaps
eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the old man
forgive me chauncey i didnt mean to pry
you must have been very close to him
getting more to the point and what about louise
you mentioned that she had gone were you close to her also
i liked louise very much
she was his maid
relieved oh his maid
stupid me i thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with
she brought me my meals
pleased of course
eve edges slightly closer to chance
chance edges slightly closer to the greenhouse is fascinated by it
what is that
pleased oh i like that very much
yes so do we
chance peeks through one of the windows
rand is in bed
eve chance and allenby are seated around him the two nurses standing to one side
they all watch the presidents address to the financial institute on tv
chance inhales deeply enjoys the oxygen in the room
rand is looking weaker
every so often allenby casts a concerned glance his way
and there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nations history
and there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course
well let me tell you gentlemen i have been conducting multiple level consultations with members of the cabinet house and senate
i have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country
and this very morning i had an in depth discussion with your founder and chairman of the board mr
benjamin turnbull rand and his close friend and advisor mr
rand perks up a bit at this mention
allenby manages a smile once again looks at rand checking his condition
eve looks proudly at chance who continues to enjoy the oxygen
well gentlemen i found this to be a most rewarding conference
to quote mr
gardiner a most intuitive man as long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny
rand starts coughing breathing heavily
allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside
allenby shoots a quick look to eve and chance
motioning toward door excuse us please
eve and chance leave the room as allenby administers aid to rand
gentlemen let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter instead let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime let us await the rewards of summer
as in a garden of the earth let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the
eve and chance sit in silence on the patio
eves eyes are swollen red she has been crying
she turns to chance reaches out touches his hand
pause im very grateful that youre here chauncey
pause with us
so am i eve
allenby comes out the door his mood is serious professional
eve turns quickly awaits his news
sits alongside eve eve this has been an exhausting day for ben
anxious but hes
hes resting comfortably now
theres no cause for alarm yet
aubrey comes out of the house
gardiner i have a telephone call for you
sidney courtney the financial editor of the washington post
not moving thank you
would you care to take it sir
chance still does not move
eve mistakes chances not moving for concern for herself
she puts a hand on his shoulder
ill be all right chauncey you go ahead with mrs
rising yes eve
youll be all right
chance follows mrs
aubrey into the house
eve watches him go then turns to allenby
hes such a sensitive man so considerate
aubrey leads chance to a phone at one of the desks
the three television sets are on attract chances attention
picks up phone looks at tvs hello
sid courtney a black man in his fifties wears a rumpled wool jacket smokes a pipe
this is sid courtney washington post
im sorry to disturb you mr
gardiner i know you must be very busy
looking from one tv to the other no
im not busy
then ill be brief
i covered the presidents speech at the financial institute today and since the post would like to be as exact as possible we would appreciate your comments on the meeting
that took place between mr
rand the president and yourself
the president is a nice person
i enjoyed it very much
and so it seems did the president but we would like to have some facts such as uh
what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation
i think you should ask mr
but since he is ill im taking the liberty of asking you
yes that is correct
i think you should ask mr
courtney doesnt understand but continues his questioning
then one more quick question mr
gardiner since we at the post would like to uh update our profile on you what exactly is your business
i have nothing more to say
chance hangs up the phone watches the tvs
courtney listens to the dial tone then puts the receiver down
to himself typical no wonder hes so close to rand
chance comes out of mrs
aubreys office notices the service elevator
he gets in the elevator
chance looks at the row of buttons presses one
he smiles as he feels the elevator move
one of mrs
aubreys secretaries jennifer waits with an arm load of paperwork for the elevator
the door opens chance smiles at her as he steps out
surprised to see him why hello mr
gardiner are you looking for someone
jennifer gets in the elevator the doors close
chance looks around the basement puzzled
he had expected to be on the third floor
aubrey is at her desk buzzing her inter house phone
as jennifer enters mrs
aubrey hangs up in frustration
i cant find mr
hes in the basement
whats he doing in the basement
i dont know mrs
aubrey grabs a notepad leaves the office
aubrey comes out of the service elevator hurries through the basement
she checks the boiler room
the electrical room
the photographers studio eve is sitting for a portrait the gym allenby is working out chance stands in the middle of the two lane bowling alley totally confused
aubrey enters he smiles at her
gardiner ive been looking all over
morton hull the producer of this evening just called
yes i have seen that show on television
they would like you to appear on the show tonight
the vice president was scheduled but he had to cancel and they asked if you would be interested
i would like to be on that show
they felt that since you had such close ties with the president you would be a splendid choice
chance nods there is a pause can i help you
are you looking for something
i like this attic very much
aubrey gives him a look leaves
air force passes through the clouds
the president sits on a couch in one of the compartments on the jet
before him stand six of his staff kaufman included
gentlemen i quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown
yes sir we are aware of all that but still we havent been able to
interrupts hes an advisor and close personal friend of rands
for christ sakes they have volumes of data on benjamin
president we attempted to contact mr
rand but he was too ill to
again interrupts i do not want benjamin rand disturbed
you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man
use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner if you run into problems alert honeycutt
he stands ill be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time
he starts for door ive got to take a leak
as the president goes to the mens room two of the aides reach for telephones
chance wears a velvet bathrobe watches tv
perkins lays out a suit shirt tie etc
on the bed
i believe these garments will be quite appropriate mr
eyes on tv yes
they are fine
there is a knock at the door
excuse me sir
perkins answers the door it is eve
rises hello eve
chauncey i just wanted to wish you well
i know youll be smashing
thank you eve
and benjamin sends along his best wishes
how is ben feeling
hes tired chauncey but hes going to watch you tonight
well both be watching
i like to watch too
i know you do you and your television
a pause good luck chauncey
eve impulsively steps forward kisses chance on the cheek
chance smiles at her and eve slightly embarrassed turns and leaves the room
chance sits back down watches tv as perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom
courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers
one man kinney a research assistant sits behind a stack of paperwork has a downcast expression as he listens to courtney
gardiner is laconic matter of fact
the scuttlebutt is that hes a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american
but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man were going to need facts on his background
turns to kinney kinney what did you come up with
after a pause nothing
sighs taps pencil on table skip the levity kinney what have you got
another pause i realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on gardiner
we have no material on him zilch
the room is quiet except for the tapping of courtneys pencil
the rand limousine parks in front of the station
as jeffrey opens the door for chance morton hull steps to the limo
gardiner im morton hull the producer of this evening
as they shake hands hello morton
hull takes chance into the station
constance rands nurse enters chances room goes to the closet
chance is intrigued by the surroundings as hull guides him through the corridor
of course mr
gardiner the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nations
do you realize mr
gardiner that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years
its a very good show
im glad you like it mr
hull takes chance into the make up room
constance is in the closet searching through chances pockets finding nothing
she takes out a small knife cuts a label from one of the jackets
quickly she examines one of chances shoes copies the name of the shoemaker in a notebook
constance hurries to the dresser continues her search
colson the makeup man comes through the corridor carrying a glass of water
he turns into the makeup room goes to chance who sits in front of the lights
hull sits next to chance briefs him on the show
chance has his eyes on a tv monitor watches the guest preceding him on this evening
gives chance water here you go mr
im very thirsty
yes sir its hot under those lights
colson applies finishing touches to chance
now if the host wants to ask you a question hell raise his left forefinger to his left eyebrow
chance watches tv then youll stop and hell say something and then youll answer
on the tv william dupont the host wraps up his talk with his guest
a last minute dab okay mr
gardiner youre all set
hull leads chance out of the makeup room
colson closes the door then carefully picks up chances water glass wraps it in kleenex puts it in his overcoat pocket
william dupont introduces chance
ladies and gentlemen our very distinguished quest mr
the band plays as chance comes onto the stage
an audience of about three hundred applauds chance as he appears
two tv cameras move with him as he walks with a smile and a limp to center stage
dupont shakes chances hand chance holds duponts hand with both of his own
gardiner how very nice to have you with us this evening
showing chance to chair id like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the vice president
sits youre welcome
also sitting i always find it surprising mr
gardiner to find men like yourself who are working so intimately with the president yet manage to remain relatively unknown
that is surprising
a beat well your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on
doesnt understand i hope so
of course you know mr
gardiner that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests i hope you dont object to that
i dont object
fine then lets get started
the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all and i would like to know if you agree with the presidents view of the economy
applause and laughter from the audience
dupont accustomed to parrying with his guests asks again
come now mr
gardiner before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand did he not
i was there with ben
i know that mr
a beat well let me rephrase the question the president compared the economy of this country to a garden and stated that after a period of decline a time of
growth would naturally follow
do you go along with this belief
yes i know the garden very well
i have worked in it all my life
it is a good garden and a healthy one its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers as long as they are trimmed and watered in the
the garden needs a lot of care
i do agree with the president everything in it will grow strong and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds
the audience applauds chances apparent metaphor
dupont waits for it all to subside then asks another question
rand is in bed
eve sits in a chair next to the bed squeezes rands hand in excitement as they both watch chance on television
teresa the nurse watches in the background
over tv well mr
gardiner that was very well put indeed and i feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to wallow in complaints or take delight in
the president and first lady are in bed together watching the show
that insolent son of a bitch
over tv lets make it clear mr
gardiner its your view that the collapse of the stock market the dramatic increase in unemployment you feel that this is just another season so to speak in the garden
the first lady cuddles close the president ruffles his hair tries to cheer him up
in a garden things grow but first some things must wither some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves
a small dark room
a videotape machine is running
also a machine is turning that records the harmonics of chances voice
two cia men run the equipment watch as a needle charts chances voice onto paper
over tv then they grow thicker and stronger and taller
some trees die but fresh saplings replace them
gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love
franklin the attorney that evicted chance comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth
his wife johanna is in bed absorbed in this evening
franklin sits on the end of the bed watches the show
over tv and if you give your garden a lot of love and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience in the proper season you will
see it grow to be very beautiful
more applause from the tv
franklin leans closer to the set
puzzled its that gardener
yes chauncey gardiner
hes a real gardener
laughs he does talk like one but i think hes brilliant
over tv i think your metaphors are quite interesting mr
gardiner but havent we seen seasons that have been devastating to certain countries
the president and first lady continue to watch
over tv such as disasterous winters prolonged droughts that have wiped out crops hurricanes that have all but swept away island communities
doesnt a country need to have someone in charge that can see it through such crises
the first lady moves closer to him
the tv its volume low plays in the background as constance with a pair of tweezers plucks a hair from chances pillow puts it into a small vial
over tv dont we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons
the bad as well as the good
over tv yes
we need a very good gardener
dupont continues his questions
do you feel that we have a very good gardener in office at this time mr
at the end of the question dupont glances over chances shoulder to look at the monitor
a beat i understand
chance turns to see what dupont is looking at sees the back of his own head on the tv screen
i realize that might be a difficult question for you mr
gardiner but there are a lot of us around the country that would like to hear your thoughts on the matter
chance is still turned to the monitor
it is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded and the other side to be dry
allenby watches chance on television
the camera that covered dupont in close up has now pulled back includes dupont and chance both looking into camera
allenby is concerned he is unsure of chance
over tv some plants do well in the sun and others grow better in the cool of the shade
a group of elderly black people sit in the lobby watch this evening on an old black and white tv
over tv it is the gardeners responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry
it is the gardeners responsibility not to plant a sun loving flower in the shade of a high wall
during the preceding speech louise the maid from the old mans house chatters
all the time he talked gobbledegook
an its for sure a white mans world in america hell i raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an ill say right now he never
learned to read an write no sir
had no brains at all was stuffed with rice puddin between the ears
shortchanged by the lord and dumb as a jackass an look at him now
yes sir all you gotta be is white in america an you get whatever you want
just listen to that boy gobbledegook
there is a chorus of amens as she finishes
it is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones
if the gardener does his job everything will be fine
audience applause is heard over tv
rand claps weakly along with the tv sound
eve and teresa also clap
rand looks up as constance comes into the room
damn constance get in here
you shouldnt miss any of this
constance hurries to teresas side
rand turns to eve
im becoming quite attached to chauncey quite attached
eve smiles and so are you arent you eve
a beat yes i am ben
reaches out takes her hand thats good
over tv well mr
gardiner from the sound of our audience id say that your words are a most welcome respite from what weve been hearing from others
over tv thank you
dupont asks another question
im sorry to say that our time is running short but before we close id like to ask one final question
what sort of gardener sir would you be
with confidence i am a very serious gardener
more applause over the tv
the president pales
he rolls over in bed
the first lady reaches out puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand shuts off the tv with the other
okay ill see you in twenty minutes
franklin hangs up the phone scurries around getting dressed
his wife johanna sits grimly in bed
coldly business bullshit
going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar
sally hayes is not a bitch shes a damn fine attorney
ive got to talk to her about this gardiner
turns over in bed good night
cuts him off i said good night
franklin gives up hurries from the room
colson carefully carrying his overcoat walks with chance through the corridor
a delighted hull walks behind them
just marvelous mr
what spirit you have what confidence
exactly what this country needs
chance smiles at well wishers as they continue on through the corridor
the first lady is snuggled up close to the president caresses his body
after a moment it becomes clear to her that he is not up to the occasion
i just cant right now
im sorry dearest
i just cant
the first lady looks at him for a beat then turns lies on her back and stares at the ceiling
an in meeting place for the upper middle washington d
thomas franklin and sally hayes sit at a table drinks in front of them
it didnt make any sense to me at all
i didnt know what the hell he was talking about
he wasnt making a speech to us tom he was talking to the masses
he was very clever keeping it at a third grade level thats what they understand
well i dont understand what was up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us
what was he doing
maybe the government had something to do with it
you know sally i really feel like ive been had and you know what that means dont you
it means that any political future i had is right down the toilet
the camera begins to slowly move away from the table the sound of franklins voice continues
jesus the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney that is really a downer
and christ sally i almost forgot johanna is starting to think somethings going on between
franklins voice fades into the background hubbub
the voice of kinney the research assistant from the washington post is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by sidney courtney and his staff
sid be reasonable ive been everywhere theres no place left to check
sure try again where
theres nothing its like he never existed
sid its useless
i said try again
kinney stands shoves his paperwork across the table
up yours sid
you try again i quit
kinney takes his drink with him as he leaves the lounge
the household staff is lined up on the front steps applauding chance as he steps from the limousine
chance accepts the plaudit though does not understand the reason
as he nears the steps perkins and wilson step forward
an outstanding speech sir
may i take your coat mr
thank you perkins
perkins nods takes chances overcoat allows everyone to enter the house ahead of him
alone on the steps perkins quickly searches through the pockets of the coat finds nothing
rand is in bed
eve sits on the edge looks warmly to chance who stands nearby
allenby prepares an injection for rand and occasionally glances curiously at chance
chance breathes deeply enjoys the oxygen
with some effort you possess a great gift chauncey of being natural
and that my boy is a rare talent the true mark of a leader
you were strong and brave yet did not moralize
i hope the entire country was watching you tonight the entire country
allenby crosses to rand needle in hand
and you benjamin must be strong and brave for me
turn over please
holds up hand in a minute robert in a minute
chauncey i would like to ask a favor of you
senator rowleys widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union
i think its rather obvious that robert wont allow me to attend so would you go in my place and escort eve
i would like to escort eve
together the two of you should create quite a stir i can already hear the gossip
with a blush ben really
reaches out a tired hand to chance chance holds it thank you chauncey
thank you very much
takes back hand all right robert im all yours
eve and chance quietly leave the room
allenby watches chance go then readies rand for the injection
the elevator door opens eve and chance come into the hallway
chance looks back at the elevator for a beat then the two walk quietly down the hall
stopping by bedroom door you dont happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase do you
no thank you
well we can fix up one of bens for you tomorrow night
sophie insists an black tie
a pause softly i have very few friends chauncey
and benjamins friends are all quite a bit older
eve gives chance a long look then kisses him on the lips
she steps back smiles
good night chauncey
good night eve
eve goes into her bedroom closes the door
chance heads for his room as though nothing had happened
kaufman and the five other aides nervously await the presidents arrival
the door opens the president briskly enters the room
good morning gentlemen
as one good morning sir
the president leads the way into the oval office
as the president goes to his desk kaufman hands him a folder
the president sits reads it quickly it is very brief
to kaufman this is not what i requested
this information goes back three days
i want the standard file you know that
where the hell is it
uh have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr
what the hell are you talking about kaufman
well we do have data from honeycutts sources chief but it isnt pertinent
id like to hear that data kaufman
kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right
reading suits hand made by a tailor in chicago in
the tailor went out of business in then took his own life
his shoes were hand made in
the cobbler has long since been dead
underwear all of the finest cloth factory destroyed by fire in
the man carries no identification no wallet no drivers license no credit cards
he carries one item along with him a fine swiss pocket watch crafted at the turn of the century so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when
purchase was made
he has never dyed his hair
computers have analyzed gardiners vocal characteristics it is impossible to determine his ethnic background they feel his accent may be northeastern but they will not commit to that
fingerprint check proved negative no identification possible
a pause thats it mr
the president stares at kaufman for a beat then speaks into his intercom
into intercom miss davis id like my eggs poached this morning please
a quick yes sir from miss davis over the intercom
the president leans back in his swivel chair looks at kaufman
so what does all that add up to
well sir it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power
but we ruled that out as they invariably are provided with too much documentation too much american identity
dont quite know what to make of it yet sir
but well keep on top of it mr
president well come up with the answer
with sarcasm i would appreciate that
the aides quickly leave the office
chance is in bed a bed tray on his lap eating breakfast
a pile of the mornings newspapers lies at the foot of the bed untouched
the tv is playing chance watches as he eats
there is a knock at the door
without turning from tv come in
eve enters wearing a robe over her nightgown
have you seen the papers
i dont read the papers
moving to bed well it seems youve been described as one of the architects of the presidents speech
and your own comments from the this evening show are quoted side by side with the presidents
i like the president
he is a very nice man
sits on bed i know
a moment so are you chauncey
another moment chance watches tv do you mind my being here like this
a bite of toast no eve
i like you to be here
eve smiles moves a little closer to chance
you know chauncey
i want us to be
with difficulty i want us
you and i to become
i want us to become very close you know
i know that
eve suddenly begins to cry sobbing quietly at first then losing control the tears flowing freely
to comfort her chance puts his arm around her shoulder nearly tipping his breakfast tray
eve responds to his touch draws closer holds chance tightly
chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast keep an eye on the tv and to comfort eve
she gives in to her desires begins to caress chance running her hand over his body
she kisses him his eyes his neck his lips his ears
chance does not return the lovemaking and eve eventually catches hold of herself stops
she lies quietly beside chance for a time regains her demeanor then speaks
im grateful to you chauncey
i would have opened to you with a touch and you know that
chance confused turns to her but youre so strong i can trust myself with you
im glad chauncey im glad that you showed so much restraint
im very glad that you didnt open
i know you are chauncey
a pause you conquer a woman from within herself you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love
another bite of toast yes
that could be true
sits up i guess i may as well be honest about my feelings chauncey as i know you are i am in love with you
i love you and i want you
and i know that you know it and im grateful that youve decided to wait until
eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence
she rises straightens her robe and moves toward the door
stopping by door i do love you chauncey
a knock at the door startles eve
she turns opens it to maggie the seam tress
maggie carries one of rands tuxedos
oh come in maggie
entering yes maam
chauncey maggie will alter bens tuxedo for you now
maggie stands by patiently as chance eats his once warm scrambled eggs and watches mr
rogers neighborhood on tv
allenby is at his desk searching through the washington d
he finds a number dials
into phone mr
thomas franklin please
a wait is thomas franklin in
a beat yes this is dr
robert allenby would you please tell mr
franklin that i would like to talk to him
it concerns chauncey gardiner
teresa and constance work in a corner of the room
rand is in bed very still deep in thought
the rand limousine pulls up to sophies house
jeffrey opens the door for eve and chance
he wears bens tuxedo eve is in a formal gown
the press is waiting a couple of reporters photographers and a mini cam crew from local tv station gather around eve and chance
gardiner what did you think of the posts editorial on the presidents speech
smiling for photogs i didnt read it
surprised but air you must have at least glanced at it
i did not glance at it
gardiner the new york times spoke of your peculiar brand of optimism what was your reaction to that
continues to pose for pictures i did not read that either
well how do you feel about that phrase peculiar brand of optimism
i do not know what it means
sorry to persist air but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read
i do not read any newspapers
i watch tv
there is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this
the tv reporter smiles questions chance
do you mean mr
gardiner that you find televisions coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers
flatly i like to watch tv
pleased thank you mr
gardiner for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years
few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it
eve and chance walk toward the front door leaving the newsmen to talk among themselves
ive never seen anyone handle the media as well as you chauncey
youre so cool and detached almost as if you were born to it
thank you eve
the front door is opened for them by an attendant
the black tie reception is in progress
the house is crowded possibly a hundred guests mostly foreign ambassadors and other such dignitaries
eve and chance enter are greeted by dennis watson a state department official
rand how good to see you
looks to chance and you must be mr
chauncey this is mr
dennis watson of the state department
they shake hello dennis
a pleasure to meet you sir
sophie an older woman bedecked with jewelry approaches embraces eve
how nice of you to come
sophie steps back looks at chance
and look who you brought with
sophie this is chauncey gardiner
hugs chance oh ive been just dying to meet you mr
chauncey this is mrs
being hugged hello sophia
steps back admires chance sophie please call me sophie
sophie pulls them both into the party leaving dennis looking after chance as he walks away
as they go to chance you just have to let me introduce you to some of the exciting people here
why pat boone and his daughter may drop by later
they disappear into the crowd
the president is hunched over his desk absorbed in constructing a model airplane a world war ii flying fortress bomber
the first lady sits nearby plays solitaire on a small table
the president glances to her then back to his work
gluing the wing how are the kids getting along
well i just talked to cindy this morning
she loves california but to quote her she says the secret service is getting to be a drag
i guess she wants her privacy
im glad theyre along with her if you know what i mean
how about jack
well i think jack needs some time alone with you darling
hes getting to that age you know
he really misses you
ill have a talk with him as soon as
a knock at the door interrupts the president
calls out yes come in
sorry to disturb you chief but we have new developments
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiners background
so far they havent come up with a thing whats more as a result of their eagerness one of their ablest agents blew his cover we have him in custody
at this time
yes chief eight other foreign powers have put gardiner under surveillance
were around the clock now sir ill keep you posted
the president nods kaufman leaves
the president puts some more glue on the wing
sophie pulls eve and chance to ambassador skrapinov and his wife
skrapinov smiles as he sees eve
skrapinov kisses eves hand
it seems like ages mr
a nod to his wife mrs
skrapinov returns the nod as sophie introduces chance
gardiner let me introduce you to our guest of honor his excellency vladimar skrapinov ambassador of the soviet union
chance warmly shakes skrapinovs hand with both of his own
stumbles over name hello
ambassador skrapinov this is mr
and this is mrs
chance smiles at mrs
skrapinov as the ambassador puts an arm around him
you must sit with us my friend we have much to discuss
to eve how is my dear friend benjamin feeling
hes doing as well as could be expected mr
he still speaks of the stimulating discussions hes had with you
please give him my regards
tugs at eve come on eve
lets let the men talk there are so many people that have been asking about you
to chance and skrapinov would you two excuse me for a moment
rand i shall yield the pleasure of your company to others
i shall yield too
smiling ill be back soon
eve and sophie leave
skrapinov leads his wife and chance to their table
as they walk im sorry we havent met sooner mr
i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your down to earth philosophy
im not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president
quietly tell me mr
gardiner just how serious is benjamins illness
i did not want to upset mrs
rand by discussing it in detail
ben is very ill
yes so ive heard a shame
as you know we in the soviet union have the keenest interest in developments of the first american financial corporation
we are pleased to hear that you may fill benjamins place should he fail to recover
arrive at table be seated please mr
chance sits between skrapinov and mrs
moves chair close to chance mr
gardiner i wish to be quite candid considering the gravity of your economic situation shouldnt we the diplomats and you the businessman get together more often
yes i agree i think so too
to exchange our thoughts what does a russian know about business
on the other hand what does an american know about diplomacy
yes i understand
and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues so why not a coming together
an interchange of opinion
we may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far
an engaging smile we are not far
motions at nearness of their chairs our chairs almost touch
our chairs are indeed almost touching
and we want to remain seated on them correct
we dont want them snatched from under us am i right
because if one goes the other goes and then boom
and we are both down before our time you see
and neither of us wants that do you agree
i certainly do
tell me mr
gardiner do you by any chance enjoy krylovs fables
i ask this because there is something
there is something krylovian about you
do you think so
do you think so
so you know krylov
skrapinov pauses then leans close to chance speaks softly in russian
chance having never heard this language raises his eyebrows and laughs
skrapinov remains impassive
amazed so you know your krylov in russian do you
gardiner i must confess i had suspected as much all along i know an educated man when i meet one
yes it is very good
yes it is
beat would you tell me your name again please
slaps chance on the back ho
a dash of american humor
i like that name very much
and yours sir chauncey gardiner
in russian how poetic
chauncey a name of uncertain meaning
and gardiner a bit of the french a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers
a beautiful name my friend
as he speaks in russian eve comes to the table taps skrapinov on the shoulder
immediately rises mrs
you have returned to us
only to steal mr
gardiner away if i might
to chance everyone wants to meet you
that would be good
shakes chances hand we must speak again mr
gardiner many times
as eve and chance leave skrapinov turns and nods to a man standing a short distance away
the man karpatov hurries to the table
what have you found
in russian we have nothing on him ambassador skrapinov
holds up hand looks around quietly please
gardiner for one understands our language
in english softly sorry comrade ambassador
what do you mean there is nothing
there is no information available on the man before he moved into benjamin rands
it has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the united states government
skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation
where was this man gardiner before last week
apparently the white house shares our curiosity they have also launched an investigation and according to our sources neither the f
nor the c
has met with success
clearly such interest on their part is of great political significance
clearly yes comrade
take this down
karpatov takes out notepad i want this quote included in the tass coverage chauncey gardiner in an intimate discussion with ambassador skrapinov noted that unless the leaders of the opposing
political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes
very good your excellency
karpatov leaves the table
the same lounge as before
sidney courtney sits at the same table as earlier only this time with the editor of the washington post lyman stuart
courtney puffs on his pipe as he speaks
its strictly rumor at this stage lyman just something in the wind
something rather big in the wind id say
so whose files were destroyed
the cias or the fbis
i dont know
like i said its just rumor so far but we should start nosing around see if we can talk to some people
the camera begins to slowly move away from their table
the question is why
why would they destroy gardiners files
what is it about his past they are trying to cover up
his voice fades a criminal record
a membership in a subversive organization
the sound of stuarts voice dissolves into thomas franklins as the camera settles on dr
allenby and franklin sitting at a table nearby
and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child working as a gardener
he showed us a room in the garage where he said he stayed and i
well i didnt really believe him of course but why the act
i have no idea
another thing that baffles me doctor what was his connection with the deceased
major financial dealings obviously but our firm has no record of any such transactions
you say he showed you his garden
well he said it was his he walked us through it
leans close to franklin mr
franklin i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr
gardiner to yourselves
theres no telling what he was involved in and the matter may be extremely confidential
so please not a word
of course doctor i understand
thank you mr
certainly glad to be of help
allenby rises leaves the bar
eve and sophie are talking to a small group
chance moves away to get an hors doeuvre and is approached by ronald stiegler a publisher
gardiner im ronald stiegler of harvard books
a two handed handshake hello ronald
gardiner my editors and i have been wondering if youd consider writing a book for us
something on your political philosophy
what do you say
i cant write
smiles of course who can nowadays
i have trouble writing a post card to my children
look we could give you a six figure advance provide you with the very best ghostwriter research assistants proof readers
i cant read
of course not
no one has the time to read
one glances at things watches television
i like to watch
sure you do
no one reads
listen book publishing isnt exactly a bed of roses these days
mild interest what sort of bed is it
rand is in bed
sitting nearby are two attorneys monroe and townsend
aubrey stands to one side and constance and teresa prepare an iv for rand
speaks slowly with effort everything
i said everything and thats exactly what i mean
rand the holdings are so extensive i would like to be more precise in
interrupts what could be more precise than everything
allenby enters the room stands by the door unnoticed
turns to townsend everything to mrs
drafting a will right everything
you two dont have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation no one knows that better than myself
but you must understand that i have an endless faith in mrs
rands abilities i know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need
she has shared my life gentlemen she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets
life has suddenly become very simple for me now i may be older than my years and you might think me to be somewhat feeble
but i am still in love gentlemen thank god for that
allenby silently leaves the room
dennis watson of the state department talks with chance in a corner of the living room
dennis whispers something into chances ear and chance gives him an innocent smile
dennis is encouraged by the smile
we could do it now we can go upstairs
no reaction from chance please its time for us
blankly i like to watch
you mean just watch me
doing it alone
i like to watch very much
well if thats what you want then i want it too
takes chances arm we can go this way
i want to tell eve
you mean mrs
pulling chance oh you can tell her later
shell never miss you in this crowd
dennis leads chance out of the crowded room
a light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened bedroom
the president and the first lady are in bed
they each lie on their backs a distance apart and are silent
after some time maybe you should talk to somebody darling
no that wont do any good
another pause is it me
is there something ive done
oh no sweetheart its not you
another pause its your damn job
it never happened when you were a senator
its not that i just
the inter white house phone rings the president reaches for it
into phone yeah kaufman what is it
over phone chief we have a break in the case
our man at the washington post says they are working on a story that either the cia or the fbi destroyed gardiners files before anyone could get to them
over phone i cant say at this time neither agency will admit to a thing
getting out of bed okay get both directors over here ill be right down
the president hangs up the phone as the first lady stares at the ceiling
a small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry
the lights are very dim and dennis who we cannot see is lying on the floor
dennis clothes are draped over a chair
chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk
he turns the tv on
softly can you see well
squints at small screen yes very well thank you
do you like it
its very tiny but its good
disappointed at it being tiny are you sure you like it
yes i do its very good
chance reacts to the change in tone of dennis voice turns to look at him on the floor
hearing the groans and heavy breathing chance thinks dennis is ill
do you need a doctor
i could call robert
i dont want robert
through the groans your foot
give me your foot
dennis reaches out with his free hand grabs chances foot pulls it to himself
some pain thank you
but my leg is still a little sore
chance watches as dennis goes through some spasms then his body relaxes
chance is concerned for dennis health
are you sure youre not ill
we hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor
a long black limousine with a red star on the door pulls away from sophies house
alexis novogrod a high ranking kgb officer and two of his underlings are in the limousine along with skrapinov his wife and karpatov
novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing fresh from moscow
they all drink vodka
dialogue in russian english subtitles the rank and file in the fbi feel he is fbi but others feel he is a cia man who knows how to destroy fbi
that could be possible
but we are quite certain comrade that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup detat
a coup detat
of course that was foreseen by lenin himself
that is correct comrade skrapinov
we have ascertained that gardiner heads a big business power group that will soon be taking over the american government
i could work with that faction quite nicely colonel novogrod
you have proven that already comrade skrapinov you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship
thank you colonel
raising his glass let us toast to the success of the coup
they all raise their glasses
the men and mrs
skrapinov drink their vodkas
the reception is breaking up
eve wearing her coat searches for chance in the crowd
she sees him taps him on the shoulder from behind
chauncey where have you been
i was afraid you got bored and left or that you were with some mysterious woman
i was with a man
we went upstairs
chauncey youre always involved in some sort of discussion
he was very ill i stayed with him for a while
it must be the punch and it is stuffy in here i feel it a little myself
youre an angel my dear thank god there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort
eve and chance leave the reception
the president sits behind his desk in a bathrobe his hair mussed
standing before him are grover honeycutt the director of the f
and clifford baldwin c
kaufman stands to one side
all are red eyed tired and frustrated
i never gave such a directive mr
nor i sir it would be out of the question
gentlemen i didnt call you here at such an hour to make accusations i just want to explore the possibilities
now i have three questions is the man a foreign agent
or have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient
or thirdly have the mans files been destroyed
now id like some answers
gardiner is not a foreign agent there are now sixteen countries investigating the man
we can rule that out
can we rule out inefficiency
there is silence in the room
a couple of looks but silence
what about question three
is it possible to erase all traces of a man
highly unlikely sir
in fact the boys around the bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off would be an ex f
a look to honeycutt i dont think thats entirely true grover
to baldwin and what do the boys around intelligence think
they dont quite know what to think
rising gentlemen needless to say there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations
goes to door good night
the president leaves the oval office
eve and chance walk down the hallway
holding his hand i feel so close to you so safe with you chauncey
stops at her bedroom door and benjamin understands that dearest
he understands and accepts my feelings for you
ben is very wise
opens her door come in chauncey please come in
chance enters eve closes the door behind them
eve turns on a soft lamp chance goes directly to her tv turns it on
i can sense that youve been through a lot chauncey
but one day when you feel like it youll tell me all about your life
chance watches an old movie but even if you tell me nothing even if its too painful for you to reveal your past
as she talks chance watches a love scene on tv
the hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace
the scene seems to sink into chances mind
he abruptly turns takes eve into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth
just as abruptly he turns away and changes channels on tv
breathless oh chauncey
i do love you so much
she takes chance in her arms kisses him wildly
they fall to her bed in an embrace
as she holds him kisses him runs her hands over his body chance watches television neither resists nor responds to eves caresses
suddenly she stops lets her head fall on chances chest
you dont want me chauncey
you dont feel anything for me
nothing at all
chance sits up on the bed then feeling her sadness gently strokes her hair as he looks at tv
i just dont excite you at all
i dont know what you want
i dont know what you like
i like to watch
not understanding to watch
to watch me
i like to watch
uncertain is that all you want
a hesitation to watch me
its very good eve
but ive never done
another hesitation you mean
when i do it
when i touch myself
eve slowly gets up from the bed nervously paces the bedroom as chance watches tv
she makes a decision moves to chance kisses him
getting aroused oh chauncey
she steps back slips off her dress
she does not undress any further instead leans close to chance
one of those little things you dont know about me yet darling im a little shy
she smiles gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself
chance divides his attention between eve and the tv watching both with an equal detachment
eve begins to respond to her own touch finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her own body
chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm
as eves body trembles chance yawns gets up from the bed
going to door good night eve
a low purr is heard from eve as chance leaves
allenby constance and teresa are readying a transfusion for rand
there is a feeling of urgency as they work
rand very weak strains to speak to allenby
no more robert
no more needles
sits on the side of the bed its not good ben im sure you can feel it
i know robert
but strangely enough i dont feel too bad about now
i feel all right
i guess its easier
knowing chauncey is here
to take care of things
teresa is about to swab rands arm with alcohol but he pulls away
no i dont want any of that
please just get me mr
gardiner teresa please
hell head it up
teresa looks to allenby he nods to her
teresa puts the cotton down leaves the room
a light snow is failing
eve is in a fur coat holds a steaming cup of coffee
chance stands next to her an umbrella in one hand
he holds his other arm out catching the snowflakes as they fall
and i feel so free now chauncey
until i met you i never felt acknowledged by a man
chance gazes out at the falling snow i always had the feeling that i was just a vessel for a man someone that he could take hold of pierce and
i was merely an aspect of somebodys lovemaking
do you know what i mean
chance turns to her says nothing presses the cold snowflakes to his face
presses close to him dearest you uncoil my wants desire flows within me and when you watch me my passion dissolves it
you set me free
i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged
thats very interesting eve
teresa appears in the doorway
rand would like to see you
i would like to see ben
chance gives eve a warm smile then follows teresa into the house
allenby with nothing more he can do to prolong rands life sits on the bed close to him grips his hand tightly
teresa shows chance into the room and allenby motions to the nurses to leave
as they do chance once again breathing the oxygen with a smile goes to rands bedside
yes ben are you going to die now
a weak smile im about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel my boy
oh i see
reaches out to him let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey
let me feel your strength
holds chances hand yes thats good
i hope chauncey i hope that youll stay with eve
take care of her watch over her shes a delicate flower chauncey
smiling a flower
she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey
theres much to be looked after

and ive felt love
my associates chauncey ive talked with them about you
theyre eager to meet you
very eager to meet you
im very fond of you chauncey
and i understand eve

rand slumps down dead
allenby checks his pulse turns to chance
hes gone chauncey
i have seen it before
it happens to old people
covers rands face yes i suppose thats true
chance reaches out uncovers rands face gently touches the mans forehead feels the coldness
allenby eyes him as chance stays with rand for a moment then replaces the sheet
turns to allenby will you be leaving now robert
in a day or two yes
eve is going to stay
the house will not be closed
a moment a look youve become quite a close friend of eves havent you mr
a beat chance
i love eve very much
another beat and you are really a gardener arent you
brightens yes robert i am
a smile at allenby ill go tell eve about ben now robert
chance leaves the bedroom
allenby watches him go then sits back in a chair his head spinning
a cloudy cold day patches of snow are on the ground
the rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion listen to funeral services for rand on a pair of loudspeakers
pan around reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking the mansion
fifty mourners are gathered around the rand family mausoleum
chance stands with eve and allenby
the president of the united states stands before a microphone
millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of benjamin rand but unfortunately only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss
to most benjamin rand was a legend to those of us gathered here today benjamin was a beloved friend
my personal association with benjamin dates back many years and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever
as the president speaks chance turns and walks away
eve and allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area
i initially came in contact with the rand name in
was a young lieutenant in the air corps a navigator flying missions over europe
that plane that i learned to know so well was manufactured by the rand aeronautics corporation
a beat benjamin rand was an industrial giant known to be powerful and uncompromising and yet on a personal level we have all felt his warmth and humor
a beat i would like to share with you a few quotes and a few feelings from our dear friend
holds up paper reads i do not regret having political differences with men that i respect i do regret however that our philosophies kept us apart
i have no use for those on welfare no patience whatsoever
but if i am to be honest with myself i must admit that they have no use for me either
i was born into a position of extreme wealth i have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty i do not know the feelings of being poor and that
is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world
for a man in my position that is inexcusable
life is a state of mind
when i was a boy i was told that the lord fashioned us from his own image
thats when i decided to manufacture mirrors
ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats
huddled together at one end of the hall are six important businessmen speaking in hushed tones
james dudley a powerful industrialist speaks
but what do we know of the man
we have no inkling of his past
sewell nelson a corporation chairman joins in
correct and that is an asset
a mans past can cripple him his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny
another executive peter caldwell agrees
to this time he hasnt said anything that could be used against him
charlie bob bennet a texas oil millionaire well im certainly open to the thought it would be sheer lunacy to support the president for another term
no one will go along with that
look at the facts gentlemen the response from his appearance on this evening was overwhelming he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair
lyman murray a banker hes personable elusive yet seemingly honest
hes riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement
as far as his thinking goes he appears to be one of us
i firmly believe gentlemen that he is our only chance mr
chance his umbrella under his arm walks through the woods
the services are over
eve allenby talk with the president and the first lady
it was very moving bobby thank you so much
were all going to miss him eve
glances around wheres mr
he walked off
chauncey is so sensitive
he was overcome with grief
i can certainly understand that
im so sorry for you eve
thank you nancy
ill call you soon
the president and first lady head toward their limousine
chance walks deeper into the woods absorbed in the greenery
he stops by a tree brushes some snow from a branch moves on
the majority of mourners have left
eve and allenby walk slowly to the rand limousine look around for chance
do you think we should look for him
i dont think so he should be along soon
i wish he were here
eve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine
chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb hanging to the ground
he stops inspects the break runs his fingers along the split in the bark
he looks to the ground notices that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling bending it double
chance pulls the limb away then kneels beside the seedling
he removes an expensive paid of suede gloves and with gentle fingers brushes the dirt and snow away from the seedling
chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree
he unfolds his umbrella places it over the seedling in a way to give it protection yet to still allow it to receive light from the winter sun
chance stands puts his gloves back on and continues his walk disappearing into a remote section of the woods
jeffrey stands holding the door for eve and allenby all the other cars have gone
eve is worried gets into the car
chance walks through the woods his pace faster than before
the limousine still waits for chance
eve is deeply concerned for chance
we have to find him robert he could be lost something may have happened we cant leave him
you really care for him dont you eve
i do we do both of us ben and i feel so much for chauncey
i think wed better go look for him
he taps on the glass partition david
david starts up the limousine
chance walks with determination through the woods
allenby and eve search for chance as david drives along a narrow road through the woods
jeffrey sitting in front suddenly calls out
about yards ahead of them chance crosses the road continues on down a hill
there he is
david stops the limousine at the point where chance crossed
eve hurries out of the car
chance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill
eve calls to him
stops looks up hello eve
eve runs half falls as she goes down the hill
she gets to him holds him tightly
oh chauncey darling
where have you been
we thought wed lost you weve been looking all over
ive been looking for you too eve
she hugs him one more time then she leads him back up the hill to the waiting limousine
allenby gets out of the car greets chance with a handshake and an arm around the shoulder
then the three get into the limousine
