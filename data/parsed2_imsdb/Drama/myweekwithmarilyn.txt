written by adrian hodges over a dark screen we see the caption this is a fairy story an episode out of time and space which nevertheless was real colin clark
then fade up on newsreel footage of sir laurence olivier and vivien leigh arriving back at tilbury docks to be greeted by an excited crowd of fans
as they progress down the gangplank and stop to sign autographs we hear an excited commentary over returning to england are britains acting royalty sir laurence olivier and lady olivier
better known as stunning gone with the wind star vivien leigh
sir laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of terence rattigans stage play the
sleeping prince with none other than hollywood siren marilyn monroe
when the worlds greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive we can be sure that sparks will fly
now now lady olivier dont worry any romance is strictly for the camera
as olivier and vivien smile for the photographers we it is
saltwood castle the family home of the clark family looms over the landscape framed by the setting sun
it is majestic an englishmans dream of a home complete with turrets and even a moat
there is a feeling of timeless beauty and stability about the scene something profoundly english
we are a very long way from hollywood
colin clark hurries across the lawn carrying a bag he is casually dressed boyish and handsome
he heads towards a beautiful ramshackle building and through the ancient oak doors
colin bounds up the stairs into the library
as colin enters he sees sir kenneth clark standing in front of a painting on an easel by the italian baroque painter annibale carracci
he has two students with him a man and a woman in their early s and is in mid description of the painting
and this is one of carraccis earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous baroque style which is clearly rooted in the tradition of
high renaissance and antiquity
colin pauses briefly and hurries towards them
throughout the scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go
the whole thing should be played at breakneck pace
kenneth beams affectionately
have you met james and anna
two very brilliant pupils
he has the avuncular air of a benign academic affable and a little eccentric
colin smiles hurriedly at the students no time to waste
im leaving for london now pa
well bon chance dear boy
he puts a friendly arm around colins shoulder and starts to walk him back to the door
i can always get you a research position at the v a when youve grown up a bit and got this film idea out of your system
colins smiles but before he can reply jane clark whirls into the room a ball of energy talking nineteen to the dozen
kenneth you might have told cook we were another two for dinner
what is everyone supposed to eat
oh colin darling there you are
she looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress eccentrically combined with gardening attire her mind on a dozen things at once
im off now mama
my job interview remember
but she is already continuing her journey
colin smiles hurriedly at kenneth who gives him an affectionate wave as colin dashes after his mother
she leaves the library
jane strides across the lawn with colin rushing to catch up
cant you stay for dinner
theres nothing to eat but im sure the conversation will be charming
i dont want to be late in the morning
as colin hurries after jane he is nearly run down by an elderly gardener with a lawn mower and has to take lightning evasive action
jane doesnt notice
im sure they wont mind
youll be a famous film director in no time
i know your fathers put in a word
i wish he hadnt done that
i can manage on my own
she stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her
jane looks around the garden with a frown
i have to watch jenkins like a hawk
one more of his murderous prunings and well lose the tea roses for ever
and shes off again with colin still following
he cant help smiling at the madness of it all
the sun is setting casting a golden glow over the castle
colin and jane emerge from the front door colin pauses in the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but racy mg sports car
only now does jane really turn her attention fully to him for the first time
now go and have a lovely time darling
were always here when youre ready to talk your future
colin wants to protest but before he can get the words out jane sees a young gardener walking at the side of the house with a wheel barrow
her face lights up
be an angel find cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight
then bring the car round
i must get to the village before the shop shuts
she dashes away after the gardener turning back as an afterthought to blow a kiss at colin as she goes
colin smiles then pauses for a moment to look at the house
we can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly his need to get away
he gets in puts the car in gear and the bristol pulls out of the drive and across the moat
in the last rays of the sun the countryside looks magical but colin only has eyes for the road ahead
in the s from colins point of view
as he a sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside
it is early morning in the heart of londons west end
the streets hum with activity as office workers in hats and raincoats stream from the tube stations
colin pushes his way through the early morning crowds in piccadilly
this is his patch he is very much at home here negotiating the busy streets with ease
as he passes by the upmarket burlington arcade a tailor pauses in measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave
colin waves back
checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops outside the imposing facade of piccadilly
a plaque outside the door announces laurence olivier productions
colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure everything is correctly in place then goes to the door and rings the bell
the reception area is luxurious deep pile carpets and plush sofas
vanessa the beautiful secretary sits behind her imposing desk gazing doubtfully at colin
youre not in mr
larry told me to come
she pauses dubiously then reaches for her telephone
we hear a man answer in an office down the hall his voice carrying irritably
i have a mr
colin clark here
he says sir laurence sent him
she stresses the proper name in disapproval of colins familiarity
not another one of viviens pretty boys
vanessa looks at colin with amusement
his smile falters as he feels himself coming down to earth with a bump
hugh perceval s is laurence oliviers production executive
he is tall and gloomy with black rimmed spectacles and thinning dark hair
he looks at colin grimly as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco
well what do you want
a job on your marilyn monroe film
oh really what as
i want to work on the production side
he smiles with as much charm as he can muster
perceval isnt impressed
there are no jobs yet
we dont start shooting for eight weeks
may i wait
until theres a job
for eight weeks
something might come up
perceval is distracted as the telephone rings
larry wondered how the script was coming
colin troops back to the sofa
vanessa gives him a cool glance
colin looks at the clock
it has just gone
we see the day pass as colin sits on the sofa the clock ticking slowly on the wall vanessa busy at her desk colin looking up hopefully from time to
time only to be disappointed
it is now nearly oclock
colin sits exactly as he was
perceval shares a look with vanessa as he comes out of his office
he gazes drily at colin
there are no jobs
ill come back tomorrow morning
just in case
its a free country
he sounds as though he rather regrets it
colin arrives early ready for another day
colin is back in his place at
sharp the next morning
perceval gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his office
vanessa glances up from her typewriter
he meets her eye optimistically but she ignores him
the clock ticks around with agonising slowness to
vanessa finally gives colin a pitying look
are you going to sit there all day
if i have to
youre very determined
id do anything to be in the film business
she smiles cheekily
he grins back sensing an opportunity
you can start by making me a cup of tea
white two sugars
close on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to
vanessa puts on her gloves and collects her bag
she gives colin a sly look
you can answer the telephone while im at lunch if you like
the phone rings
he picks it up
laurence olivier productions
is sir laurence there
hes at notley until the end of the week
can i take a message
ill call back
no sooner has colin hung up than perceval appears
he stares at colin
vanessa asked me to
oh did she
why didnt you put that call through
there didnt seem any need to bother you
but if you want me to transfer every single one
perceval looks at him grudgingly
use your judgement
he hesitates and looks back
i need a number for noel coward
it wont be in the book so youll have to track him down
colin realises this is a test
he thinks quickly
the phone rings in the beautiful central hall
jane clark picks up the phone
how are you getting on
colin glances towards percevals office and talks quickly
this is urgent
i need noel cowards london number
my life depends on it
let me see
ask him if hes coming to saltwood for the bank holiday
mama youre an angel
perceval looks up as colin puts the number on his desk
that was quick
i had a bit of luck
perceval looks at him shrewdly
am i supposed to be impressed
did mummy and daddy help
dont think they can do the job for you
the only way youll get on in this business is through bloody hard work
a new morning
colin perches restlessly on the sofa
despite his modest triumph he is back where he started
the seconds pass in dull silence
he is beginning to think his campaign will fail
but then in a heartbeat everything changes
he looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and sir laurence olivier strides in with his wife vivien leigh on his arm
at the age of sir laurence olivier is at the peak of his fame
he is handsome and charismatic and vivien is scarcely less extraordinary
the gone with the wind star remains classically lovely flirtatious and captivating
individually they are charismatic enough but together they are electrifying seeming to charge the air around them with the power of their personalities galvanising anyone who comes into contact with
vanessa leaps to her feet and perceval hurries to greet them as colin stands up uncertainly
olivier is all amiable bluster and bonhomie
do you know hughie it is simply impossible to get marilyn monroe on the telephone
the darling girl spends the entire day asleep
but great beauty has its way
he laughs but then notices viviens less than enthusiastic response
seeking refuge in some distraction he notices colin hovering by the sofa
he smiles vaguely and glances at vivien for help
you remember colin darling
you met him at the clarks party
what are you doing here
you said there might be a job on your film
olivier has no recollection of this and fumbles in his pockets to cover his confusion bringing out a packet of cigarettes and offering them to colin with breezy charm
have a cigarette
keep the pack
he turns quickly to perceval
there wont be any film unless miss monroe gets her splendid posterior out of bed
the house committee are threatening to withhold millers passport
they say hes a communist
no arthur no marilyn
ill have a word with the american ambassador
im taking him to see vivien in south sea bubble on thursday
now tell me hughie are terrys rewrites in
he puts an arm around percevals shoulders and they disappear together into percevals office
vivien lingers behind smiling radiantly at colin who looks dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand
he now sees they are called oliviers
vivien wrinkles her nose in amusement
they named them after larry
the first actor since du maurier to have his own brand and they pay him an absolute fortune
pause im afraid theyre rather ghastly
she cups colins cheeks with her hands and studies him in mock awe
isnt he gorgeous vanessa
i suppose hes all right
viviens eyes sparkle
olivier emerges from the office with a handful of script pages and vivien looks at him slyly getting her own back for his tactless over praise of marilyns charms as
she strokes colins cheek
lets elope together and have the most glorious affair
arch oh but then whod look after my poor larry
olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation
vivien winks at colin and takes her husbands arm
now darling you must do something for colin
you absolutely promised
olivier looks hunted
there is no way out
he glances back at perceval as he comes in
lets try to find him something to do hughie
colin grins in triumph
vivien smiles at him
you will take care of my precious larrykins wont you
she flirtatiously offers up her cheek for colin to kiss
colins smile falters as he sees perceval looking at him grimly
colin stands eagerly at percevals desk
perceval looks at him more than usually brusque
arthur jacobs miss monroes publicist is flying in tomorrow
he wants to see the house shell be staying in
find something suitable
colin knocks and walks into percevals office carrying a tray with tea and a plate of biscuits
the blinds are closed and a mm projector is running silent images play on a fold up screen in the corner of the room
framed in the light of the projector are perceval and the films lighting cameraman jack cardiff
they take no notice of colin
he looks up at the screen
the two men are watching make up hair and wardrobe tests for the film
marilyn monroe in character as elsie marina
the film shows marilyn looking sweet and pretty chatting silently to someone just off camera mugging playfully in costume larking about with her hair and then when she wants to
turning on her full film star wattage and looking wonderful every inch the beautiful icon
it is an intimate glimpse of her at work
colin watches fascinated completely forgetting why hes there still holding the tray larry says he particularly likes this dress
she looks radiant
exactly we need to tone her down a bit
how the hell do you tone down marilyn monroe
he immediately regrets it
both men turn to look at him
perceval turns off the projector and gazes at him stonily
marilyn monroes publicist is flying in tomorrow
he wants to see the house shell be staying in
find something suitable
colin nods eagerly anxious to get out
he is already at the door when perceval barks at him again
and leave the bloody tea
colin had forgotten the tray
he blushes furiously puts it down and hurries out
colin has a map spread out on the bonnet of his bristol sports car
he finds pinewood studios then draws a ring around its circumference
he taps his pencil thoughtfully as he lights a cigarette one of the branded pack that olivier gave him
he inhales deeply thinking then grimaces in distaste quickly stubbing it out under his foot
colin pulls into the drive of tibbs farm a charming english cottage
cotes preedy the owner clearly has a very high opinion of tibbs farm
aloof and snobbish he stands by the front door looking down his nose at colin
out of the question
i cant have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots
wed pay a hundred pounds per week for weeks
my wife would never agree
thats a pity
ill have to tell miss monroe to look elsewhere then
cotes preedy double takes
shes making a film with sir laurence olivier
the sleeping prince
from the play by terence rattigan
i saw it in the west end a couple of years ago
vivien leigh was marvellous
its marilyn monroe in the film
cotes preedy smiles transparently
after a second i suppose id have to be introduced
arthur jacobs marilyns publicist is a close cropped pugnacious figure in his mid forties
he waits impatiently outside oliviers office a stack of newspapers under his arm
colin comes hurrying up smiling brightly
good morning mr
i hope you had a pleasant flight
wheres the fucking car
jacobs sits in the passenger seat of colins bristol sports car reading his stack of newspapers
after a moment he grunts in disgust
jeez do you brits actually read this stuff
he winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot out into the lane
the pages billow out in a great cloud behind the speeding car landing in the pretty hedgerows and on neat front lawns
colin gapes in astonishment
welcome to hollywood
jacobs slouches out of the house magnificently unimpressed
cotes preedy follows him proudly with colin at his side
jacobs takes a long unimpressed look at the property
what is this place
cotes preedys face falls
its one of the best houses in the area
and i thought you brits had taste
he glances at colin
is this the best you can do
its very near pinewood
well take it
pause but ditch the wallpaper
its given me a migraine
jacobs slaps down a copy of the evening standard on the desk
the front page carries a picture of tibbs farm with the caption exclusive marilyns luxury home in england
he jabs a finger at it angrily
news travels fast
that house was perfect for marilyn
we cant use it now
yes we can
i knew cotes preedy wouldnt be able to keep this quiet
they stare to him in surprise
he looks at them boldly
when you asked me to find a house for miss monroe i took the precaution of finding two
the other one parkside is much better and the owner is very discreet
but now we have two expensive houses when we only wanted one
i thought someone else on the production might want it
oh did you
there is a dangerous moment when things could go either way
colin has gambled everything in a bid to impress them
he waits in tense silence staring at their puzzled expressions
but then jacobs shrugs
i guess milton could use it
its near the studio near marilyn
olivier looks at colin then bursts out laughing
what are we paying you boy
he glances at colin with amusement
see to it hughie
perceval sighs grimly
pinewood studios is the glamorous heart of the british film industry
colin drives up to the gate and smiles at the colin clark
sir laurence olivier productions
actors in full costume walk past technicians move lights and cameras extras are herded to their scenes by harried assistant directors
colin takes it all in with wondering eyes
to him the studio is a magical place
the dressing rooms are little more than empty shells
jacobs looks around
olivier and perceval are with him while colin waits attentively
the set decorators will have it all sorted out in no time
marilyn hates red
pause and green
what about white
id have to clear it with her
olivier glances mischievously at colin
beige is rarely controversial
jacobs considers this unaware that olivier is teasing him
i guess thats okay
shes never said nothing about beige
paula will need the room next door
marilyns acting coach
olivier looks at him darkly
shes nuts about the method
stanislavski and the method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they dont belong on a film set
time is too tight
im sure marilyn understands
he turns and walks away
jacobs frowns uncertainly
who the hell is this commie stan slavski
colin stands in the production office
david orton s the first assistant director a thin fair haired man regards him with obvious irritation
i dont know why hugh perceval sent you here
theres nothing i can do for you
are you in the union
then you cant have a job on the film
how do i get in the union
by getting a job on the film
but you just said i couldnt have a job on the film unless i was in the union
its called a closed shop
colin looks at him helplessly
orton relents a little
i suppose i might be able to sort something out
the union owes me a few favours
we havent got a third yet
third assistant director
pause you do know what the job is
assisting the director
thats the last thing you do
the thirds job is to do whatever the fuck i tell him
orton walks to the door then looks back
what are you waiting for
colin scrambles to follow him out
as orton and colin pass the wardrobe department colin notices a pretty wardrobe girl lucy putting costumes on the racks
she has dark hair and laughing eyes and is a year or so younger than him
orton follows his gaze
colin jumps as orton glowers at him
you dont shit on your own doorstep
but he sneaks a look back at lucy as he goes
orton and colin hurry through pinewood
where are you staying
my fathers place in the albany
you can forget that
the third always stays nearby not in some bloody palace in london
pause book a room at the dog and duck down the road
its a bit rough but youll get used to it
he grins enjoying himself
now make yourself useful
marilyn needs a bodyguard
sort something out
perceval sits with colin and roger smith
smith is a dignified figure in his mid fifties
his erect bearing speaks of a lifetime in the police
im sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job superintendant
no need for the title
im retired from the force
pause something about looking after a cinema actress
not just any actress
he gets no reaction from the stolid ex policeman
ive never had much time for the pictures
pause for the next four months you never leave her side day or night
there will be crowds
that doesnt bother me
perceval pauses awkwardly
her behaviour is reputedly a little
amongst other things
perceval leaves a tactful pause
it would be useful if you could keep us informed of her
you want me to spy on her
perceval and roger understand each other perfectly
just the odd early warning if you know shes going to be late on set
that kind of thing
smith takes this in his stride he seems wholly immune to the glamour of the movies
jacobs chases after olivier trying to get his attention
olivier is busy studying preliminary sketches of costumes and set
you need to speak to the coca cola people larry
theyre crazy to be involved with marilyn
perceval and colin meet them coming the other way
the house committee have decided miller isnt a communist after all
of course he is
all those pain in the ass new york intellectuals are reds
olivier rolls his eyes behind jacobs back
it means marilyn will be flying in next week on schedule
shell have to be met
naturally vivien and i will be there to greet her
but lets keep it low key shall we
ive got it all under control
the customs areas is besieged by shouting pushing journalists as the police fight to keep control
in the middle of the chaos colin stands with roger smith watching olivier and vivien addressing the gathered press
it is a deep happiness to me to be translating terence rattigans magnificent play to the screen
a voice suddenly rings out from the back of the previously attentive crowd
the planes landed
as one the entire crowd turns away from olivier and rushes towards the plane
suddenly abandoned olivier and vivien look momentarily startled before vivien glances at him with a half smile
it seems were not top of the bill anymore darling
marilyn monroe walks down the steps of a twa jet on a rainy london day
she clutches a bouquet of flowers and wears her raincoat is slung loosely over her shoulders
her new husband arthur miller walks a step or two behind her wearing a light summer jacket
marilyn and miller walks across the tarmac towards the terminal and the crowd of press waiting for them
there she is
the reporters surge forward
colin follows their collective gaze
she looks exactly as she should
the radiant smile the platinum blonde hair the sexy wiggle
the most famous film star in the world so much herself it is almost unreal
walking through the crowd marilyn smiles easily whereas miller looks stern and a little dazed by the sudden flurry of attention
flashbulbs pop as the police struggle to contain the crowd
marilyn puts her arm around miller who grins blankly
the flashbulbs burst in front of them a solid wall of dazzling light
over here marilyn
marilyn this way
arthur jacobs observes the chaotic scenes with obvious relish grinning towards roger and colin
youre looking at tomorrows front page boys
roger looks at colin
we have to get them to the hall
colin barges his way through the scrum behind roger and briefly finds himself directly in front of marilyn
for a moment he is transfixed by her beauty and charisma but she doesnt even see him as she follows the commanding roger obediently tugging miller along behind her leaving
colin in her wake
marilyn sits with miller at her side flanked by olivier and vivien
marilyn wears a large pair of sunglasses
photographers jam their flashbulbs into her face
roger hovers protectively with colin
olivier smiles as he addresses the crowd
its my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction
a great actress on her first trip to london whom i have no doubt
how do you like being married marilyn
i like it a lot
is this third time lucky
you bet it is
arthurs the greatest man i ever met
olivier smiles tolerantly mildly put out at this
marilyn takes off her sunglasses and blinks
she takes millers arm and looks at him adoringly
he bites down savagely on his unlit pipe
marilyn are you planning to see the sights
id love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in piccadilly circus
there is a appreciative laughter from reporters
is it true you want to be a classical actor now
i want to be the best actress i can be
theres a rumour youre going to be in the brothers karamazov on broadway
im considering it
which of them will you be playing
the agenda is clear marilyn is the dumb blonde and should act accordingly
but she takes it in her stride smiling sweetly
ill be playing grushenka
can you spell that
there is laughter at the reporters expense
so would you say youre an intellectual now
my husband is
she looks adoringly at miller who smiles vaguely
whats your definition of an intellectual marilyn
i guess you could look it up in a dictionary
this time the laughter is emphatically on marilyns side
one of the reporters turns to vivien
vivien you created the part of elsie marina on stage
do you have any advice for marilyn
i am sure if miss monroe needs any advice shell get it from her director
i hear hes terribly good
the reporters laugh with her and olivier smiles graciously
but as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of jealous hurt in her eyes
olivier intervenes quickly to continue his prepared speech of welcome
in the sleeping prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for miss monroes luminous and justly celebrated talent
he stops as a reporter shouts over him
marilyn is it true you wear nothing in bed except chanel no
as im in england lets say i sleep in nothing but yardleys lavender
the press laugh in delight
on the edge of the crowd colin watches her amused and impressed
a convoy of cars pass through the throng of journalists waiting at the gate
marilyns secret hideaway is no longer much of a secret
the classical old house is elegant and luxurious
outside the front door marilyn miller olivier and vivien have their picture taken by the official photographer
roger watches unobtrusively
are all your press conferences like that darling
well that was quieter than some
vivien smiles at the wry joke
arthur jacobs watches the proceedings with an eagle eye
okay lets get a snap of the newlyweds
its not a firing squad
as the group breaks up milton greene handsome and dark haired now approaches olivier and colin
this is some place you found
he glances at the house
olivier smiles generously
you have my new assistant colin to thank for that
pause he shepherds colin over this is milton greene
you must be very nice to him
he owns half of marilyn monroe productions
forty nine per cent larry
greene offers them a tired smile
olivier produces one of his branded packets and offers a cigarette to milton
have a cigarette
i dont smoke
if he notices the olivier name he doesnt show it
olivier looks mildly put out
milton marilyn and rehearsals
and the studio wants a new title
olivier escorts milton away
miller and marilyn are now being photographed on their own
roger moves over to jacobs and murmurs discreetly in his ear
jacobs nods and moves in to end the session
the boys at the gate are getting restless
lets give them two minutes and then were done
roger waves to the policemen who open the gates
the press come pouring in like a mob of revolutionaries storming the bastille
colin notices marilyn grip millers hand tightly as the flashbulbs pop all around her
a moment later he is surprised to find vivien at his elbow
marvellous isnt she
i suppose youre quite smitten
colin looks at her shrewdly sensing he is being tested
shes all right
a bit common
larry fell desperately in love with her in new york
hes determined to seduce her
but shes only been married three weeks
oh colin i thought you were a man of the world
she gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately
vivien contd contd of course larry would never leave me
pause but if anything were to happen you would let me know wouldnt you
im sure he loves you very much
there is a flash of sudden anger in her expression
oh dont be such a boy
colin looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition
at least you still adore me dont you
there is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second
no one will love me for much longer
not even you
he goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his lips her smile quickly restored
the dog and duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane near the studios
it is a rough local place utterly devoid of glamour or comfort
colin stands outside staring at it grimly his bag in his hand
a few hard core locals stand nursing their pints at the bar
one is idly throwing darts
the wallpaper is faded yellow with cigarette smoke stale sandwiches curl in a display case
colin looks around his heart sinking
barry the landlord looks him up and down disparagingly
i booked a room
barry takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar spins it around for colin to sign
what brings you up this way
colin cant help looking a little pleased with himself
im here working on a film
the locals look up from their pints unimpressed
what films that
its called the sleeping prince
the darts player andy doesnt turn
his aim remains steady
ignore andy not a film fan are you andy
andy doesnt look away from his game
cant be bothered
colin tries to impress
marilyn monroes in it
ill be working with her
oh will you now
the regulars grin unkindly into their pints
andy doesnt look away from his game as he offers laconically the queen and prince philip popped in for a pint earlier
pity you just missed them
there are supportive snorts of derision from the locals
colin takes it on the chin
barry hands him a key
the rooms three quid a week first week in advance
youre in number two
colin takes the key and his bag just as barry adds with perfect deadpan timing youll be sharing with grace kelly
the locals laugh into their beer
colin smiles gamely
colin stands aghast
he is staying in a grim little room above the noisy saloon bar
the wallpaper is peeling the furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp
dirty net curtains flutter in the window
he puts his bag on the bed and sits down
the mattress sags pitifully
he looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot under the bed
he slides it back with a look of revulsion
the principal cast of the sleeping prince as it was still known at the time assemble on the sound stage amongst the half finished set
they chat and smoke their scripts in their hands
olivier stands in their midst very much first amongst equals
one chair sits conspicuously unoccupied
dame sybil thorndike severe looking but kindly very much the grand dame of the gathering smiles cheerfully
richard wattis leans over to her with a cheerful grin
what a wonderful adventure dame sybil
such a lark
i long to see her
colin stands by the door
olivier looks at his watch and shoots him a questioning glance
colin hurries along the corridor and stops outside marilyns dressing room
he knocks on it politely
the door opens sharply and a small bohemian looking woman in her s stands staring at him
this is paula strasberg
sir laurence sends his compliments
hes ready for the he glances beyond paula to where marilyn sits by the mirror her reflection framed in the lights
she wears little or no make up
paula looks at him sharply
but marilyn is not ready
marilyn glances up at colin in the mirror and smiles with unexpected simplicity
excuse the horrible face
she finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on
colin leads marilyn and paula to the rehearsal room
he sneaks a glance at her
she has a vulnerable lost expression
colin cant help staring at her until he notices paula looking at him and quickly glances away
the cast are all seated around the large table as colin leads marilyn and paula onto the stage
marilyn keeps her dark glasses on throughout
olivier rises to greet her
marilyn here you are everyone is so excited to meet you
he gestures to the company
let us begin
do sit down please
sybil thorndike looks sweetly at marilyn from across the table and indicates the empty one at her side
how lovely you are
here i kept a place for you
paula bursts forward steering marilyn away instead to an empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables
she looks at richard wattis the actor occupying the seat next to the empty one
i have to be next to marilyn
the startled wattis gets up graciously and troops all the way around the table to the seat next to sybil thorndike
dont worry dear we wont bite
paula looks at her in truculent apology
she likes me by her side
what a good idea
i wish we could all bring a friend
one does get so terribly nervous
its just like the first day at school isnt it
she smiles kindly at marilyn who smiles back tentatively from behind her dark glasses
he smiles with considerable charm as he makes his opening speech of welcome
welcome dear marilyn to our little fraternity
pause looks around we may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first but i hope that in time you may come to find your method in our
pleased with his over contrived rhetorical flourish he gives paula a pointed look
she glowers back obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way
marilyn also looks up in confusion at oliviers well intentioned but clumsy joke
oblivious to her reaction he opens his script with a sentimental flourish
my very noble and approvd good masters let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together
pause with boldness and we pray good fortune may we strive to create a work of art that led by your good graces will be cherished as long as motion
pictures may be remembered
he is momentarily close to tears
wattis rolls his eyes discreetly earning a grin from the actor paul hardwick
there is a rustle of pages and a few coughs a mood of eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the reading
paula turns the pages of marilyns script for her as though helping a child to read
olivier is in full flow employing a heavy mittel european accent
were you surprised to get my invitation
marilyn stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly
ill say i was surprised
i was so surprised i couldnt hardly think you meant me
oh but of course i meant you
i had your name most carefully marked down on my programme
in matters of this kind i assure you i am most methodical
who did you think i meant if not you
marilyn drops out of character with a sweet nervous smile
gee mister sir i could listen to your accent all day
there are private grins amongst the actors
olivier smiles kindly
you are amongst friends my darling angel
just plain larry will suffice
pause when youre ready
flustered marilyn looks at her script
well maisie springfield
oh no no no not maisie springfield shes quite what i would call old hat
paula leans across mounting a whispered running commentary in marilyns ear as olivier speaks
remember why youre in the embassy marilyn
what does the grand duke want from elsie
she thought there were going to be a lot of people here and its just her
olivier waits patiently
its your line marilyn
oh lets see
oh and am i what youd call new hat
olivier tries to continue but is yet again brought up short by paulas passionate whispering
locate the experience marilyn
look for the memory that helps you
remember when you went to that party at chaplins house and you were the only guest
how did that make you feel
this time olivier stares at paula
it is only a readthrough paula
marilyn has to begin finding the character
the character is on the page
the words maybe
not the character
richard wattis whispers to paul hardwick
shes half cut
dame sybil thorndike frowns with regal disapproval and smiles warmly at marilyn
arent we going to have fun
the readthrough over olivier rails quietly at milton while colin clears up the tea cups and plates used by the actors
we cant have two fucking directors
marilyn wants paula
shes got me
paula is costing us two and half thousand bucks a week
we might as well use her
pause listen larry accept marilyn on her own terms and youll be okay
try to change her and shell drive you crazy
olivier stalks away
colin takes a chance and follows him
dear christ what have i got myself into
colin follows lucy the wardrobe girl down a rack of clothes
he is charming glib and persistent
come out with me tonight
tomorrow night then
im washing my hair
your hairs lovely
she stops to look at him attracted but cautious
look i have two rules
one never touch the talent
everyone has a lot of rules around here
and two never go out with thirds
because theyre all randy little buggers who just want some fun during shooting
im not like that
she looks at him sceptically
im free on saturday
colin ducks into a rack of clothes making a face at lucy
she cant help smiling back
first light over pinewood studios
although it is august it is chilly so early in the morning
colin stands by the gate wearing only his thin summer jacket
he blows on his hands to keep warm
a black car appears
the window winds down and dame sybil thorndike pops her head out
how kind of you to meet us
dear me you do look cold
theyre ready for you in make up dame sybil
dont you love the first day of a new production
i dont know dame sybil
ive never had one before
dame sybil gazes at him with wistful sadness
oh to be young again
she blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate
almost immediately oliviers chauffeur driven bentley appears
marilyn here yet
colin looks anxiously down the empty road
david orton strides towards him angrily
what the fucks going on
i thought you had a contact in her house
well bloody use him then
roger greets colin on the doorstep with a grin
she hasnt come down yet
neither has miller
theyre playing trains
colin stares at him blankly
colin roger and milton sit in silence studiously avoiding each others eyes
somewhere upstairs bed springs creek under the pressure of enthusiastic love making
the phone rings
milton nods to colin to pick it up
colin is glad of the distraction
we hear ortons irate tones on the end of the line
colin glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say
getting into character
dame sybil stands alone
richard wattis rosamund greenwood maud and two footman in full costume sweating under the hot lights
olivier prowls the set smoking impatiently
colin is at his side with david orton
shes kept dame sybil thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours
its simply not fair
the door finally opens and marilyn emerges with paula on one side and milton on the other
in her figure hugging shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly beautiful
her hair is like a halo of light around her head
no one can take their eyes off her
slowly all work on the set stops
marilyn walks to the set acutely aware of the scrutiny of the crew
she smiles nervously then suddenly hesitates feeling the weight of everyones attention
anxiety flits across her face
she whispers something to paula and bolts back towards her dressing room
olivier stares after her in shock
she wasnt happy with her make up
olivier loosens his collar irritably and glances at orton
orton you wanted me to check the back projection
please join us mr
he stalks away followed by cardiff and orton
colin sees sybil thorndike standing on set
she beams at him cheerfully
isnt she pretty though
would you like to sit down dame sybil
how kind of you colin
yes why dont we all sit down
colin sees her chair by the camera and goes innocently to fetch it
but as he picks it up he is confronted by a stern looking crew member in overalls
are you a member of nattke
that chair is a prop
props are nattke
if act members are going to do nattke jobs im calling my men out
every eye is suddenly on colin
taking his shock for stubbornness trevor turns to the set and bellows
half the crew immediately down tools
colin looks on in horror
sybil thorndike frowns in reproach
im sure were all good union members here
theres no need to fall out over something so trivial
it might be trivial to you dame sybil but its my livelihood
hes not in the union
pause to colin put the chair down
colin stares at him frozen
put the chair down now
colin drops it as though it was on fire
it clatters to the stage
sybil thorndike bears down on trevor majestically
i rather think youve made your point
solidarity is the important thing here
when unions fall out its only management that benefits
trevor pauses not at all sure about this but then shrugs magnanimously
if i see you doing a nattke job again ill close this set down quicker than you can blink
he turns to one of his men
dave dame sybil needs a chair
dave picks up the same chair moves it approximately six inches and places it behind sybil thorndike who finally sits down her sunny good humour instantly restored
i was on the picket lines in you know
sybil thorndike contd now that was a strike
we were all bolsheviks then
she smiles nostalgically as orton appears to hustle colin away muttering furiously
didnt they teach you anything at eton
now fuck off and see if you can get me a bacon sandwich without starting world war iii
marilyn is at last on set and ready to shoot
sybil thorndike as the queen dowager waits behind a door
olivier is in front of the camera with marilyn who flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture
paula mutters a last few words in her ear reading her lines to her from her small brown notebook
colin watches intently
a bell rings and the red light goes on
the camera operator denys rolls the camera
very quiet everyone
the clapper loader clicks the clapperboard
twenty two take one
now before you meet my mother in law i must warn you she is a little vague and can be very deaf
sybil thorndike sweeps through the door right on cue with maud her lady in waiting following
she is effortlessly in command of her lines
my dear such boredom
the decorations hideous and the music
our friend the ex king of moravia drove me home
he is now called the duke of strelitz he cannot of course go to the abbey tomorrow but he is most anxious you should invite him to the room you
have taken in the ritz for nicky
oh there you are my dear i did not see you give me a glass of that champagne i see over there
might i present miss elsie marina
oh yes my dear of course i remember you well
they all look at marilyn
and nothing happens
i forgot my line
sybil thorndike smiles cheerfully
its so easily done isnt it
im sure i went wrong somewhere there too
shall we have another go larry
the clapperboard snaps
oh yes my dear of course i remember you well
oh im quite sure you dont your royal
oh i mean your uh imperial
it is not clear whether marilyns hesitance is acted or not but the others press on gamely
what does she say
she says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory
marilyn jumps in shouting her line over the top of him
im in the coconut girl at the avenue
there is a pause
sybil thorndike hesitates
didnt i have a line somewhere there dear
the clapperboard snaps shut again
thank you my dear
pause sweetly pretty
she should use more mascara
when one is young one should use a lot of mascara and when one is old one should use much more
what do you do my dear
im in the coconut girl at the avenue
she says she is an actress
marilyn looks at him hesitant but just about in character
olivier glances at orton who nods
cut it there
check the gate
after a second gates good
there is a near audible sigh of relief around the set
sybil thorndike smiles
that was perfect marilyn
youre elsie to the life
marilyn smiles awkwardly not really believing her but sybil carries on with complete conviction
sybil thorndike contd perhaps we could practise our lines together later
youd be doing me such a kindness
at my great age its just so hard to make them stick
why dont you come for tea tomorrow
in fact sybil is word perfect every time and everyone knows it
but it is a kind and tactful gesture
marilyns face lights up
olivier looks at colin in dismay
i should have cast vivien
if anyone can make her great its you
youre a genius
the worlds greatest living actor so they say
olivier looks at him wanting to be reassured
he fumbles for a cigarette with shaking fingers and colin hurries to light it
he smiles wryly
lets hope im as brilliant as you think i am
pause now be a good boy and keep an eye on her
marilyn and paula are heading for the dressing room
marilyn looks tired and disconnected
colin is just behind them on another errand
he cant help overhearing paulas insistent honeyed tones as she responds to marilyns uncertainty
i just cant figure this movie out
you were wonderful
you are the most gifted actress i have ever known
you were superb marilyn
you were divine
he was angry with me i could tell
you were great
you are a great great actress
all my life i have prayed for a great actress i could help and guide
she stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the corridor in front of marilyn
colin stops awkwardly his path blocked
i prayed to god on my knees
and he has given me you
you are that great actress marilyn
come on paula get up
not until you admit you were great
marilyn smiles her mood slowly lightening
i guess i was
colin glances at her seeing his chance to help
you really were very good miss monroe
marilyn smiles vaguely
paula gives him a fierce look colin moves past quickly
the mood in the club is cosmopolitan lively but elegant
rows of small tables are arranged around the stage a few young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an exuberant upbeat number
the music comes to an end and the couples return to their tables colin and lucy among them
there is champagne on the table colin pours them both a glass
are you sure you can afford all this
oh its all right
it must be costing a weeks wages
its worth it
lucy cant help being charmed
youre not the average third are you
most of them would be happy with a swift half and a grope in the pub car park
im not living off my parents if thats what you mean
i want to make my own way no matter what
by making eyes at vivien leigh
who told you that
word gets around
viviens a friend of my fathers
so theres nothing in it
you and vivien
he smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her
she avoids him coolly
im not that easy
the waiter approaches with a bill on a silver salver and offers him a pen
youll be signing on your fathers account sir
colin blushes violently
i settle my own bills
the waiter nods discreetly and leaves
lucy looks at colin with a teasing smile
i was always going to pay you know
of course you were
he looks at her but there is no hint of mockery in her smile and he is grateful
do you think marilyn is beautiful
not compared to you
lucy laughs colin looks hurt
you dont have to try so hard to be charming
youre nice enough as it is
well you could be
she touches his hand and takes a drag from his cigarette as he refills her glass
you know marilyns really still in love with joe dimaggio
so they say
she married miller on the rebound
the papers are calling them the hourglass and the egghead
which one is which
she bursts out laughing
her eyes sparkle and she looks captivating in the glistening lights
he goes to kiss her and this time she doesnt stop him
colins bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined with pleasant semi detached houses
lucys house has a neat patch of front lawn a stolid family car in the drive and net curtains in the windows
it is very little different from any of its neighbours
colin and lucy are kissing in the small best parlour at the front of the house
it is spotlessly neat and clean
colin touches lucys breasts and then opens the buttons of her blouse
she puts her hand on his stopping him
wait a while crocodile
i really do like you lucy
she looks at him shrewdly
she hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above
thats my dad
she gives colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies herself
a moment later the door opens and lucys father mr
armstrong comes in wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas
he glances at colin with a suspicious smile as he looks at his daughter
time to be thinking about bed darling
early start tomorrow
we were just going over tomorrows schedule
colin and lucy share a small private smile
he takes his cue and stands up
yes i should be off
pleased to meet you mr
he offers the surprised mr
armstrong a confident handshake
this is a very nice house youve got
do you know this part of the world
my family are more country people
lost for words they stare at each other for another moment before mr
armstrong smiles vaguely then goes
lucy follows him with a smile at colin
he grins and whispers
he follows her out into the hall
as he walks down the path colin pauses
he looks around at the uniform semi detached houses all around him
he is uncomfortable here so far from the glamorous world of his parents or pinewood studios
he has a strong sense that he and lucy are from very different worlds and walks to his car with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away
colin is back on the early morning watch
a black car draws up and sybil thorndike leans out
colin dear i thought you looked cold so i bought you this
she hands him a bright red woollen scarf
colin is touched
thank you dame sybil
film sets and rehearsal rooms are the coldest places on earth
he smiles as her car drives away
he wraps the scarf around his neck and looks up and down the road again
the crew stand around in sullen discontent
olivier paces back and forth with milton at his side
she should be on time like everyone else
she is a star
im a fucking star
he looks around in frustration
if we nip this behaviour in the bud perhaps it wont be repeated
this is marilyn youre talking about
olivier scowls at colin who gives him a cigarette
marilyn finally emerges with paula at her elbow
olivier advances on her his anger simmering
marilyn darling you are an angel and i kiss the hem of your garment but why cant you get here on time for the love of fuck
you have that word in england too
she looks at him in surprise
she looks sedated not quite there
paula leaps protectively to her defence
marilyn has to prepare properly
she has to find in herself all that lies under the surface
acting isnt just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose
olivier gives her a freezing look then takes marilyns hand leading her forward like a child
you must apologise to dame sybil
marilyn reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm
olivier propels marilyn towards sybil thorndike
marilyn reddens with humiliation
cutting her off my dear you mustnt concern yourself
a great actress like you has many other things on her mind
a radiant smile spreads slowly across marilyns face as the older womans words sink in
you think im a great actress
none of the rest of us truly know how to act for the camera
but you do
it is a rare gift
she looks sharply at olivier
sybil thorndike contd this poor girl hasnt had your years of experience
she is in a strange country acting a strange part
now are you helping or bullying
olivier looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked
colin looks on startled
olivier milton perceval orton and the editor jack harris watch rushes
colin lurks about unnoticed at the back
they watch one of oliviers speeches from the the coconut girl sequence we saw filming in scenes and
he is dry and clipped every take precise and professional
it is an effective but theatrical performance
marilyn sneaks in with arthur miller
they sit in the back row watching her performance from the same scene
she fluffs take after take gets her words wrong and pauses looking dazed
colin notices her clutching millers hand tightly
but finally a good take comes up
she is charming and natural and her performance suddenly makes oliviers look stiff and clumsy
miller smiles in relief and reassurance
that ones pretty damn good
you knocked it out of the park
marilyn glows at his praise
when marilyn gets it right you just dont want to look at anyone else
for all his greatness as an actor he will never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive marilyn
and the injustice of it is like a stab through his heart
at the back colin only has eyes for the screen
he watches marilyns image enthralled
until now he has taken marilyn entirely at oliviers valuation but as he watches her on screen he begins to see things differently
he sneaks a look at her in real life
she is holding millers hand tightly looking tense and vulnerable as one disastrous take follows another
colin comes out of the viewing theatre behind olivier and weve only been shooting for four days and were already two weeks behind
colin cant resist blurting out a comment
why not only show her the good takes
then she might feel better about herself
he looks self conscious as they both turn to stare at him
the kids right
she could use the confidence
i believe its traditional for the producer of the film to watch rushes
besides shes an experienced actress
she should learn from her mistakes
they just upset her
not half as much as they upset me
colin hurries across the stage carrying a fresh carton of oliviers
orton stops him
ill do that
you go and find marilyns script
she thinks she left it in her dressing room
colin bursts into the dressing room without knocking
clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor
there are pill bottles full and empty on every surface along with empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers
colin rummages around on the table moving piles of scripts and books
he walks casually through the half open door into the inner chamber
and stops dead in his tracks
marilyn stands by a chair a towel wrapped around her head
she is completely naked
she looks at him in astonishment
he stares back equally astounded
he sees her script heavily covered in handwritten notes lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and a bottle of pills
i found it
calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it around herself
she smiles quizzically
you can go now colin
he hesitates a beat surprised that she knows his name before he fumbles for the door
colin slams the door aghast
colin and lucy are buried in the clothes racks kissing passionately
they surface for air
david wants to know if youre ready for the extras in the ballroom scene
tell him he can start sending them up
they kiss again
he pulls away
im looking forward to saturday
he looks at her uncertainly
i cant do saturday
marilyn wants to go shopping
since when do you work for her
larry asked me to help out
she smiles sardonically teasing him but a little hurt
well of course you must do what larry says
next friday instead
she shrugs in agreement
ill pick you up
he smiles a little too glibly and hurries away
lucy gazes after him
he doesnt look back
colin sits in the front with roger driving
marilyn arthur miller and milton greene sit in the back
it is very quiet in the normally busy west end
shops have begun shutting after lunch and the city is rapidly emptying
shoppers wander past taking little notice of marilyn who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark glasses
miller walks at her side holding her hand
she glances at milton with an awkward laugh
gee its quiet
but theyre expecting us
she stops to window shop
milton lowers his voice to colin
no ones recognised her
at least she can shop in peace
marilyns a star
stars dont even pee alone
he looks around anxiously
but then a passer by suddenly narrows his eyes and takes a second look
his face lights up and he shouts its marilyn monroe
marilyn gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is surrounded by a crowd of shoppers alerted by the fuss
a feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come running to look pushing and shoving to see
marilyn is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob
to begin with she enjoys it smiling and posing happily for the cameras that appear out of nowhere
but as the crowd press towards something in the mood of the gathering changes it becomes wild and over excited mood as people scream marilyns name and shove bits of
paper to sign in her face
a woman is pushed to the ground and marilyn is forced back against the shop window
colin sees a flicker of panic on her face
my god shell be torn apart
get her out of here
colin and roger hurl themselves into the crowd doing what they can to keep the excited fans at bay
they manage to force a path to the car drag the door open and bundle marilyn and miller into the back
marilyn is pinned against the door and colin has to put his arm around her shoulders as he helps her in
he hurls himself into the front with milton running alongside the moving car to dive in beside marilyn
people run alongside hammering wildly on the windows in violent hysteria
milton does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos
jeez marilyn they really fucking love you
as colin looks in the rear view mirror he sees miller shaking his head in dazed horror as marilyn slumps half collapsed into the seat beside him
someones going to get hurt
colin shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes meet marilyns
he sees or imagines a terrible sadness before she quickly replaces her dark glasses
colin stands silently by the camera watching marilyn and richard wattis in character as elsie marina and northbrook open the doors of the grand dukes drawing room
well were still the first ones arent we
gee this is all right isnt it
olivier looks out from behind the camera patient and charming
the line is gee this is all right too isnt it
its a tiny word my darling but it matters
lets go straight away
marilyn smiles vaguely
hair and make up rush to do last minute checks
the clapperboard clatters down
wattis and marilyn come in again on their cue
well were still the first ones arent we
gee this is all right isnt it
nearly there but terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him
straight away please
well were still the first ones arent we
gee this is
all right isnt it
by now there is a panic stricken edge to her voice
cant we just drop it
the point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene
now you are admiring this room as well
pause she looks stricken paula
olivier looks startled
paula comes scurrying across
marilyn appeals to her turning away from olivier
i dont get it
hes such a strange man
i think shed figure out he only invited her to sleep with her
the reason marilyn cant remember the line is because she doesnt believe the situation her character is in
olivier takes out all his pent up frustration on paula
then she should pretend to believe it
paula bristles at this insult to her husbands work
were talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap
were in absolute agreement paula
acting is all about sincerity
and if you can fake that youre off to the races
paula only stares at him in disgust
thoroughly alarmed milton intervenes
maybe we should try for another take
marilyn needs time to give a great performance
you should give her as long as it takes
chaplin took eight months to make a movie
eight months of this
id rather kill myself
throughout all this marilyn herself looks lost
colin watches her as she feels the crews irritable collective gaze
flustered she flutters her hands in a calming gesture then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on her
costume is too tight to allow her to sit down
paula accompanies her
marilyn looks up at her in anguish
i cant do this
paula looks at her adamantly
you can do it
you cant fail
you will have more pain you will suffer more but you will create
all you need is time
marilyn looks at her desperately wanting to believe it
remember marilyn a tree is never just a tree
what kind of tree is elsie
an elm tree
a birch tree
under his breath to god knows but im a weeping fucking willow
think about the things you like instead of him
the character comes alive if you know what youre doing
marilyn listens intently a frown flitting across her face
she goes back to her mark
the whole crew is on tenterhooks
camera running speed mark it
well were still the first ones arent we
gee this is all right isnt it
a look of near panic creeps into marilyns eyes at her inability to remember the line
the clapperboard snaps one final time
take twenty three
marilyns smile is a grimace of terror
colin can hardly bear to look
everyone holds their breath
well were still the first ones arent we
pause gee this is all right too isnt it
there is a stunned moment
wattis gapes and marilyn looks around uncertainly
did she say it
olivier gestures frantically from behind the camera that she should carry on
there is an agonising beat
and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set
whats the matter now
he takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the set lowering his voice trying to conceal his exasperation with a honeyed tone
forgive me marilyn
this is my failure not yours
tell me how i can help you
i dont know who elsie is
i cant act her if i dont know who she is
elsie is all in the script i cant find her
shes not there
but you have her precisely you know her inside out
im in awe of your gift
we all are
shes not real
why not simply rely on your natural talents
are you saying i dont need to act
olivier is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her own natural talent as he sees it
he looks at her in genuine anguish
marilyn you are the most attractive woman in the world
im simply suggesting you be yourself
i dont want to be myself
pause i want to be an actress playing a character
trying to be helpful all you have to do dear marilyn is be sexy
isnt that what you do
marilyn flinches as though slapped
tension ripples through the set
colin watches in dismay
i want lee
youve already got paula for heavens sake
im the director
speak to me
i am only lees representative
its five in the morning in new york
her furious scream brings all activity to a halt
she storms off the set with paula following
the atmosphere is awful
olivier sits brooding savagely in front of his make up mirror with milton greene
colin unobtrusively fetches whisky and cigarettes for them both as olivier abruptly booms out to himself
o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell
pause exasperated paulas not an actress
she not a director not a teacher
her only talent is buttering up marilyn
it would be worse if she wasnt around
you know what would make marilyn monroe a real actor
a season in rep
they wouldnt stand for this kind of nonsense at the hippodrome in eastbourne
you have to be patient with her
trying to teach marilyn how to act is like teaching urdu to a badger
milton gives him a look but says nothing
instead he picks up his bag and opens it
it is stuffed with bottles of pills
he takes one of them checks the label and puts it in his pocket
i better go see her
shell need something to help her calm down
colin holds the door for him as he goes out
after a second pills to sleep pills to wake up
pills to calm her down pills to give her energy
no wonder shes permanently ten feet underwater
colin looks at him tentatively
maybe shes scared
were all scared
its part of being an actor
but you have the training to deal with it
olivier turns from the mirror to survey him
i wouldnt buy the little girl lost act if i were you
though heaven knows its tempting
he sighs wistfully
and i think marilyn knows exactly what shes doing
colin isnt so sure but wisely holds his tongue
you better get over to parkside and make sure the poor girls all right
pause and colin
dont forget who you work for
colin draws up outside marilyns house
the place is dark and quiet
roger takes two bottles of beer from the well stocked drinks cabinet and hands one to colin putting a coaster for him on the coffee table
colin looks around the opulent drawing room
are you sure they wont mind
they can spare it
pause marilyns okay
shes taken some pills and gone to bed
he frowns darkly
they like to keep her doped up
it makes her easier to control
you mean miller
shakes his head the others
theyre terrified their cash cow will slip away
he smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle
colin wakes abruptly from a doze as his empty bottle of beer rolls to the floor
roger is fast asleep
colin glances at the clock
it is nearly midnight
colin a little drunk creeps out of the toilet
the narrow strip of light from the door disappears leaving the hall in darkness
colin inches forward uncertainly
he stops waiting for his eyes to adjust
the house is totally silent
then just as he is about to move he hears something
breathing very close by
faint but unmistakable
shallow breaths like sighs
colin is paralysed
a beat then a door is flung open along the hall and light floods into the corridor
marilyn is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall only a few feet away from colin
she is wrapped in a pink bed cover and stares directly at him her expression blank and sedated
by her side is an open spiral bound notebook its pages closely crammed with handwriting
come back to bed
its not what you think
she stares at colin
it is not even clear she knows he is there
colin gazes back at her paralysed
millers voice comes again flat and tired
its just a few ideas
pause bring back my book and lets get some sleep
finally marilyn stirs and closes the notebook
holding it to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders she gets up and goes into the bedroom closing the door
as the light snaps off colin breathes for the first time in what feels like minutes
colin muffled in his scarf looks up as marilyns car cruises to a halt at the gate
good morning miss monroe
she is hunched in the back her hair in a scarf her face protected by her large sunglasses with paula by her side
she doesnt look up
olivier david orton and colin huddle around the camera
jeremy spenser and technicians stand around bored and listless
they speak in low urgent tones
its nearly lunch time
she isnt feeling the part
its a light comedy
how much feeling can it possibly require
give her a few minutes
she cant hide in her bloody dressing room all day
oh yes she can
olivier looks at him angrily
he is close to the end of his tether
go and find out what the hells going on
colin knocks softly on the dressing room door
paula appears opening it no more than a crack
she looks out suspiciously sees it is colin and turns back into the room
colin waits a moment then paula opens the door wider
paula contd contd come in
marilyn wants to see you
colin stares at her in surprise
colin comes in
the dressing room is in semi darkness
paula settles down in the corner
marilyn lies on a sofa wearing a bathrobe her face in shadow
pill bottles are scattered across the dresser at her elbow
there is a long pause
she sighs softly
how old are you
pause nearly you remind us of the young king in the movie
kind of honest and innocent
im not innocent
she turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into the light
whats your job on this picture
im the third assistant director
just a gopher really
go for this go for that
youre larrys assistant too
he shrugs awkwardly
what were you doing in my house last night
did he send you
it seems pointless to deny it
he was worried about you
are you spying on me
of course not
why would anyone spy on you
she sighs and looks away
are you all right miss monroe
he waits hesitantly but she seems to have drifted off
but then suddenly she turns back to him her eyes huge
whose side are you on
colin stares at her
she looks utterly beautiful and vulnerable in the shadowy light
there is only one answer anyone could give
yours miss monroe
she rewards him with a brilliant smile her whole face lighting up
call me marilyn
he is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy
she looks so lost and vulnerable
perhaps he means it
perhaps he is on her side now
as colin walks down through the studio he meets richard wattis with paul hardwick on their way to wardrobe
wattis winks at him
marilyns got a new boyfriend
larry will get jealous
you can say that again
he gives a camp laugh
colin tries to shrug it off with a lightness he doesnt feel
you were in there for ten minutes at least
plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle
paula was with us the whole time
the mind boggles dear
colin smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see lucy nearby
she has heard every word of the exchange
marilyn is finally back on the set filming a solo dance routine
released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky mildly silly
and charming all at the same time
the dance is deliberately a little amateurish
elsie marina isnt meant to be any sort of superstar
but she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance and marilyn captures all this perfectly
within the scene the actor jeremy spenser playing nicky watches from the doorway
everyone watches silently from behind the camera
no one can look away least of all colin
it feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become and marilyn is radiant
even olivier has a reluctant half smile on his face as he watches
the stage is empty except for olivier and miller
they sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room
colin pours whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows
both men ignore him
he is too unimportant to worry about
miller leans forward holding his pipe but not smoking it
i dreamed last night i could hear singing
and then i realised it wasnt a dream
there was a male voice choir serenading marilyn under our window
at two in the morning
its a circus
a freak show
olivier smiles but miller looks dazed
im going back to new york for a few days
i need to see my kids
i need a break
that wont help marilyn
after a moment i cant help her
pause you know what she loves to do most
its what she lives for
sleep is her demon
he pauses for a second
ive disappointed her
olivier looks at him
miller shakes his head
she thought i could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke
that i could make her a new person
he pauses for a second weighing every word carefully
she wants me to protect her but i cant
i cant even protect myself
pause she read some notes i made
they were nothing
just a few ideas
he looks up and nods slowly
she took them the wrong way
he leaves a long uneasy pause
but you do love her
your new bride and all that
miller plays with his whisky
i cant work
i cant think
pause shes devouring me
forgotten in the shadows colin listens attentively to every word
colin sees oliviers black bentley cruising towards the gate
vivien leigh sits in the back seat
hello colin darling
you look like horatio defending the bridge
are you going to let me in
vivien is doing what amounts to a royal tour
she greets everyone from the lowest chippie to the heads of department with the same flirtatious grace
olivier walks at her elbow
the crew crowd around her
she is easy and relaxed relishing every second of their attention
i hope larry isnt making you all work too hard
i know what a dreadful slave driver he can be
she sees orton and takes his hands
david he would be lost without you
just doing my job
tough as he is he melts visibly
she moves on to jack cardiff the lighting cameraman looking at him in mock misery
im getting old jack
i need you to work your miracles on me
youre more beautiful every year vivien
she laughs and turns to colin looking at him severely
now you are looking after larry like i told you
im doing my best
vivien glances away to see marilyn standing nearby awkward and excluded
she has come straight from make up and wears only a towelling robe slippers and curlers in her hair
compared to vivien she looks frumpish
vivien glides towards her hands extended
she kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands
larry tells me you are quite quite superb
im wild with jealousy
oh but everyone says you were a wonderful elsie on stage
but im too old to play her in the film
larry was quite brutal about that
you see the truth is all that matters to him
thats why we all admire him so very much
she glances at olivier with a fluttering laugh
he smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes
now i must let you work
i only came to wish you good luck
the crew press around her
marilyn watches feeling more than ever the odd one out
colin watches her from the edge of the crowd
she cuts a lonely vulnerable figure
he is totally preoccupied with her so much so that when vivien comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out
vivien stares at him
all her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older
it as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack
she gazes at him with bitter disappointment
not you too
he wants to protest but vivien is already turning away
colin pushes open the door to the projection booth
the screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in the prince and the showgirl where a startlingly beautiful marilyn in gorgeous close up eats caviar and drinks
champagne in a toast to the american president
olivier and vivien stand in the shadows of the projector beam
colin freezes in the doorway to the projection booth holding a pile of film cans
vivien is crying abjectly
i didnt think she would be so beautiful
shines on that screen
you shouldnt upset yourself
you are ten times the actress she will ever be
if you could see yourself
the way you watch her
theres never been anything between marilyn and me
she laughs hysterically
only because she didnt want you
youre imagining things
do you think im a fool
you didnt think the little tart could resist the great laurence olivier
she looks at him venomously a dangerous unbalanced hatred seething in her expression
vivien contd contd but she saw through you didnt she darling
take away the actor and whats left of the man
you cant even play the husband properly without a script
slaps him hard across the face
i hope she makes your life hell
she storms out
after a beat colin tentatively enters
olivier looks at colin in muted apology
she hasnt been well
there was a baby
colin looks down awkwardly
after a pause do you have a cigarette colin
colin hurries to offer him one of his oliviers
olivier grimaces wryly
not one of those awful things
colin finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to olivier who lights it with a shaking hand
he inhales deeply
i did think i would fall shatteringly in love with marilyn
what a joke
he looks at colin his feelings raw and exposed
remember boy when it comes to women you are never too old for humiliation
the set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again there is no sign of marilyn
the actors richard wattis and paul hardwick amongst them sit apathetically in full costume while orton stands with his arms folded
technicians chat or sit idly
as colin watches olivier looks across at milton who shrugs hopelessly
colin pours whisky for olivier
milton comes in
marilyn wont shoot today
shes gone back to parkside
shes upset about arthur leaving england
hes only going to visit his children
you dont leave marilyn alone
she cant handle it
she thinks everyones going to abandon her
the phone rings
olivier picks with a sudden burst of optimism
perhaps shes come back
into the phone yes
is colin there sir
he frowns and looks at colin in bewilderment
yes hes here
pause its for you
puzzled colin takes the phone as olivier stares at him
cut to parkside where to colins astonishment marilyn comes on the line roger is not in shot
colin why dont you drop by here on your way home
cut back to pinewood milton recognises marilyns voice instantly
what the heck
why is marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant
colin looks around helplessly
yes im sure i can do that
cut to parkside
dont tell anyone though
she hangs up
cut to pinewood colin replaces the phone in its cradle
milton and olivier stare at him
what did she want
she wants to see me
he shrugs awkwardly
milton looks at olivier in panic
he shouldnt be talking to her
hes just a kid
supposing he says something
pause why the hell didnt she call me
his angry and jealous frustration is in stark contrast to olivier who looks at colin with a new interest wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that can
work to his advantage
he smiles calmly
im sure colin knows what hes doing
dont you colin
there is a warning as well as approval in his tone
roger leads colin into the formal drawing room
miss monroe said for you to wait
she wont be long
he looks at colin dubiously as he goes out
colin is nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself
he looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and is suddenly desperate for some dutch courage
he finds the brandy and picks it up help yourself to a drink
colin wheels in surprise
marilyn stands in the doorway casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a pale cream shirt
colin looks guiltily at the brandy
i was just
checking youve got everything you need
she walks to the sideboard standing only a few inches away from him
he cant take his eyes from hers
he drops his gaze only to find himself staring at her breasts
he looks up again sharply but not before she notices
she takes the decanter from his hand
here let me
she pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him
are you frightened of me colin
because i like you
colin doesnt know what to say
marilyn gazes at him
i want you to help me
will you do that
she looks at him her eyes wide
colin feels himself sinking into her gaze
im only the third
just a messenger really
but you know whats going on
you can see both sides of the situation
he shrugs in helpless agreement
i want you to be honest
tell me everything
she indicates a chair and colin perches on it awkwardly
i thought you werent scared of me
pause are you hungry
ill have them send in a tray
he doesnt know how to reply and marilyn misreads his silence
her eyes widen in dismay
oh gee im sorry
am i interrupting something
maybe you have a mrs
colin waiting for you at home
theres no mrs
so we can talk as long as we like
he nods uncertainly
why is sir olivier so mean
he talks to me as if hes slumming
colin hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind
ill tell you whats wrong
its agony for him because hes a great actor who wants to be a film star and agony for you because youre a film star who wants to be a
and this film wont help either of you
he stops breathless knowing he has gone to far
she stares at him wide eyed with surprise
horribly self conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy reddens and coughs
are you sure you can handle that
you dont look old enough to drink
im miss monroe
i guess that makes me an old lady to you
seven years is nothing
she smiles then sits opposite him
do you know ive been married three times already
how did that happen
you were just looking for the right man
they always look right at the start
she smiles wistfully
her presence is overwhelming
the silence stretches for a second pregnant with strange possibilities
suddenly the phone rings making him jump
automatically he picks it up
milton sits at his desk
he leans forward anxiously at the sound of colins voice
is everything okay
what did she want
colin looks at marilyn and hesitates
miss monroe just had
some large packages she needed handling
he looks at marilyns voluptuous figure
marilyn looks back innocently and mouths the word packages
he turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own laughter but marilyn isnt helping
she teasingly makes shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be
he covers the phone agonised before they both collapse in irrepressible laughter
colin finally pulls himself together
there is a long silence at the other end of the line
milton turns pale
when he speaks again his anger is just barely under control
let me speak to her colin
colin offers the phone to marilyn but she shakes her head
shes tied up right now
this only sets marilyn off again
she howls with laughter and colin cant help joining her
milton stares at the phone in disbelief
whats going on
shouts let me talk to her damn it
colin looks at marilyn but she shakes her head between giggles
he turns back to the phone barely able to get the words out between snorts of laughter
im sorry milton
i have to go
he hangs up quickly
they both laugh helplessly
lets walk in the garden
see if we can find any more reporters in the bushes
colins heart contracts as she casually takes his arm
there is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks
marilyn a cardigan around her shoulders walks along the path
colin is at her side acutely aware of her physical closeness
i didnt know it was so pretty out here
you should get out more
see the sights
i am the sights
she giggles again her mood lighter
look at us
were just like elsie and the young king
what would sir laurence say if he could see us now
i dont think hed mind
marilyn grows reflective
she takes colins arm in a friendly way as they walk
i wanted to be an artist
to grow as an actor
i was so proud to be working with the great olivier
pause now he thinks im the enemy
she looks at him innocently
he doesnt understand your kind of actor
hes hated the method ever since vivien worked with elia kazan
its all too new and strange
youre the future and it frightens him
every time i walk into the studio i feel this sense of doom come over me
he looks at me like hes smelling a pile of rotten fish
and the crew hate me
paula is the only person i can trust
pause except for you now maybe
she looks at him her eyes huge
colin feels his senses swim as he stares into them
and then roger suddenly appears on the steps
phone call for you miss monroe
marilyn goes back up the path towards the house glancing back briefly at colin
thanks for telling me the truth
colin stares after her
it is a second before he realises that roger is gazing at him sternly
youll be leaving now i expect
the next morning
colin walks in as olivier is talking to i dont care if he fucks her sideways
perhaps itll calm her down
pause oh hello boy
he smiles cheerfully
i hear you spent last night with marilyn
i didnt spend the night with her
we just had a chat
i heard them chuckling
olivier offers colin a lewdly suggestive grin
perhaps if colin is very diplomatic marilyn is more likely to behave herself
she just wants a chum thats all
jesus christ what is this goodbye mr
grow up kid
he barges out of the room slamming the door behind him
olivier checks the effect of his grand duke in the mirror and sighs abruptly
i thought working with marilyn would make me feel young again
but i look dead in the rushes
dead behind the eyes
he gazes at himself thoughtfully
perhaps im angry with her because in my heart i know my own career is in a terrible rut
i wanted to renew myself through her but all i see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy
he leans back
you know i admire marilyn
i really do
despite her behaviour
she has taken everything hollywood can throw at her and triumphed
colin waits uncertain why olivier is confiding in him
an actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has
he glances up at colin in the mirror shrewd and sympathetic
but be careful boy
she doesnt need to be rescued
gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at the speed of light
as colin arrives on the set he is greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by richard wattis paul hardwick and the crew
what was marilyn like then col
going over her lines with her were you
will she be in today or is she too tired
it is all good natured stuff but colin feels strangely protective not so much on his own behalf as marilyns
she was just being friendly
there are hoots of laughter
colin retreats to a corner only to find richard wattis pursuing him
ever heard of the venus fly trap
there you are colin the innocent little fly buzzing about happily when suddenly a heavenly scent attracts you and snap
oh fuck off dickie
youve never slept with a woman in your life
i know a femme fatale when i see one love
a brief hiatus in filming
colin looks on uneasily as marilyn resting against her lean to has her costume attended to by lucy
three minutes ladies and gents
it has just dawned on colin that he has missed his date with lucy
before he can react he is jerked violently behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an angry milton
arthur miller called me
hes not happy with you
he doesnt even know who i am
marilyn must have said something
maybe she was trying to make him jealous
orton turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind the set
milton pushes colin off the set ahead of him
milton turns bitterly on colin as soon as they are outside the studio door
listen kid ive known marilyn for seven years
i fell in love with her just like youve done
colin is about to protest but milton ignores him
we had ten days together and that was it
she picked me up she put me down
thats what she does
she breaks hearts
shell break yours
my advice to you is to quit before you get burned
i dont need your advice
and im not in love with her
okay have it your way
pause you dont see marilyn again you dont even talk to her
she is completely off limits to you
colin hurries along the corridor looking for lucy who he sees pushing a rack of clothes
he stops awkwardly
she gazes at him meaningfully hurt and puzzled
i waited for you on friday
ive just been so busy
so i hear
you know how crews gossip
theres nothing in it
of course there isnt
marilyn monroe fancying you
colin is put out
up to now he has never fully confronted the possibility of marilyn wanting him but he doesnt like the idea being dismissed so lightly
lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt
before she can respond marilyn herself coming towards them in her gown her hair up in towel surrounded by paula and her make up people
she offers him a dazzling smile
colin smiles self conscious
marilyn stops and frowns looking at lucy
hey are you guys dating
thats what i heard
she looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks in hard
he shrugs casually
of course not
you know how crews like to gossip
his voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating what he has just said to lucy
you look cute together
she walks off with her retinue
there is a long pause
colin looks up to see lucy staring at him in dismay
there are sudden tears in her eyes which she wipes away angrily
i thought you were different
lucy i really like you
weve had such fun
and now its time to set your sights a little higher
i get it
pause who do you think you are cary grant
she shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe department
part of him knows he should go after her but in the end he just stays where he is
he cant help feeling an unworthy sense of relief
colin crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and collapses on it gratefully
the noise of the rowdy pub floats up through the floorboards
he covers his ears with his hands then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to block it out
the studio is quiet at the weekend
colin walks along snatching a moment for a cigarette
as he reaches the doors to the editing suites a battered old wolsey draws up beside him
roger smith is at the wheel
colin looks at him in confusion
the studio doors open and milton emerges
he glances darkly at colin and roger
any problem roger
just dropped by to take colin out to lunch
colin looks surprised
colin stubs out his cigarette and hurries to the passenger door
youre not taking him to marilyn
that would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit
oh no sir
milton sees a bulky blanket on the back seat
what do you have in there
just a picnic
weve been looking forward to it havent we colin
colin looks at him bemused
he gets in quickly
milton frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave
okay well have a nice time boys
inside the car colin looks at roger
is she okay
in the same moment marilyn herself erupts from under the blanket in the back
oh jesus she laughs looking wonderfully naughty
roger and i decided to take you out for an adventure
didnt we roger
indeed we did
if milton sees me with you
ill be sacked
he tries to scramble out but marilyn hauls him back gleefully
no one can sack you colin
pause except me of course
she pats the seat next to her
i dont like being on my own in the back
before colin can respond he sees the curious milton running back having spotted marilyn in the back
what the hell
he peers into the back window
marilyn screams and buries herself back under the blanket
colin scrambles to get over into the back seat while roger stamps on the accelerator and the car roars off
get back here you little bastard
do you hear me
roger looks at him sympathetically
marilyn emerges from under the blanket tousled and laughing
do you think he saw me
colin cant help laughing
he finally tumbles into the back seat with marilyn as the car speeds away
she scoots up to make room for him
this is fun
she threads her arm through his
he gazes down at their hands meshed together
rogers disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his eyes
in the background the defeated and frustrated milton watches the car speed away
colin and marilyn walk barefoot in the grass of windsor great park while roger leans on the bonnet of the parked wolsey holding shoes socks and sandals
there is no one else around
the wind sighs and the grass is pleasantly warm underfoot
marilyn turns her face up to the sun
this is how i ought to feel every day
impulsively marilyn hugs him
lets run away together
he turns ashen
she looks around happily
colin smiles at her
we have today anyway
one day to do whatever we like
we can go back to real life tomorrow
only one day
well maybe the weekend
or a week
she takes his hand walking contentedly at his side
what shall we do
we could go to windsor castle if you like
marilyns face breaks into a smile of pure delight
the car makes its stately progress down the magnificent drive towards the castle
roger has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to the castle
there are two uniformed policemen on duty
roger nods to the policemen who instantly recognise one of their own
detective chief superintendant smith
im escorting this lady and gentleman for the day
theyd like to look around the castle
as the policemen see marilyn their eyes widen
christ is that
he stares in disbelief
well its not diana bloody dors is it
after a second does she know anyone here sir
we need to write down a contact name in the book
roger looks stumped at this
he turns to marilyn
you dont know her majesty by any chance
we met at a movie premiere
she said my dress was pretty
im not sure that quite
my godfather works here
hes the royal librarian sir owen morshead
the policeman looks sceptically at colins casual clothes
the policeman retreats into his box
we hear him talking on the telephone
roger looks at colin
he shrugs sheepishly
my father knows everybody
a moment later the policeman returns looking surprised
he says to go straight up the hill sir
youll be met at the door
colin and marilyn are led by a footman down the long corridor
marilyn looks awed by the ancient suits of armour standing regally along the way
colin watches her enjoying her reaction
colin and marilyn are led into another corridor this one with a beautiful gold leaf ceiling decoration
marilyn looks up enchanted
the library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from floor to ceiling with books and prints
every surface is covered with important documents the place is a shrine to antique learning and culture
sir owen morshead the queens librarian is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a sly wit
he greets colin with a friendly distracted air
colin my boy
come in come in
forgive the dust
he smiles at marilyn showing no sign whatever of recognising her
you are pretty my dear
im sure you and colin have so much in common
marilyn looks around in awe
gee id love to read all these books some time
luckily one doesnt really have to
a lot of them just have pictures in
he finds a portfolio on the table and opens it
these are by an artist called holbein
marilyn smiles at a portrait of a young woman
she was the daughter of one of the kings courtiers nearly years ago
i hope i look that good when im
he takes down another folder of drawings
and these are all by leonardo da vinci
ive heard of him
didnt he paint that lady with the funny smile
she looks at him wide eyed playing up to her image as the dizzy blonde
in fact she knows exactly who da vinci is and morshead is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully
the mona lisa
do you have that one here too
alas that one got away
he closes the portfolio and takes marilyns arm briskly
now lets go to the queens apartments
shes not here at the moment but she will be sorry to have missed you
marilyn looks at him wide eyed
why she was only saying to me the other day what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth
he shares a sly smile with colin
he knows exactly who marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company
he leads her out with colin trailing in their wake
some of the rooms are very opulent but i think theres something you might like better than all that
open on a massive dolls house
everything imaginable is inside beds chairs baths basins even small rugs and chandeliers all perfectly to scale
marilyn kneels in front of it gazing from room to room with childlike joy
it is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in every room
she cries out with joy
colin kneels at her side
i sure never had a dolls house like this when i was a kid
she sees a perfect doll family inside husband wife and two children
she points at them her eyes shining
this is me thats you and these are our kids
she smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm
our daughters so pretty
all little girls should be told how pretty they are
they should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them
her eyes fill with sadness for a moment
we look like such a happy family dont we
she turns to him
they are only inches away from each other
colins heart lurches
morshead coughs discreetly
you mustnt let me keep you
im sure youre longing to be on your way
colin and marilyn emerge
a small crowd of policemen servants and castle workers has gathered
there are cheers as they see her
colin looks nervously at marilyn but she smiles and winks at him mocking herself gently
shall i be her
she jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose hip out shoulders back bosom thrust forward the classic marilyn look
the delighted crowd bursts into cheers
colin stands proudly nearby content to watch marilyn being a star basking in the certain knowledge that she will be leaving with him
one of the spectators turns to him
are you somebody mate
im no one
colin stares at marilyn
she catches his eye and smiles just for him
he feels like hes tumbling into the abyss but no longer cares
rogers car pulls up outside eton college
colin and an astonished marilyn walk through the school buildings with roger a discreet distance behind them
this isnt a school its a palace
eton is years old
it was founded by king henry vi
its like walking through history
take that room up there
they stop as colin points up at a window
thats where the boys were sent if they didnt work hard enough
where we were whipped
marilyn looks at him in shock
she looks appalled
id never send my kids away
pause how long were you here
but i was sent to boarding school when i was eight
thats what we do in my family
she smiles at this looking at him shrewdly
it seems to me that youve had most things pretty easy
in one way yes
but when youre brought up in a house of over achievers its hard to make your own mark
she looks at him sympathetic but pushing a little harder
so how are you going to do it
maybe it will be in films but if not there are so many possibilities out there
sounds pretty good to me
she smiles warmly liking him a lot more for his openness
we sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level
but before either of them can say anything a schoolboy turns the corner in his eton uniform
he looks up at marilyn his mouth hanging open in shock
then he simply turns and runs shouting at the top of his voice
its marilyn monroe
marilyn and colin are swamped in a joyous mass of eton students
marilyn smiles waves pouts even kisses one boy on the cheek
cheering boys hang out of every window
marilyn blows kisses to them all
roger has to plunge into the crowd to rescue her
colin follows after them with difficulty
marilyn pauses jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys
work hard boys
i dont want anyone whipping you
a gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily
you can whip me anytime marilyn
marilyn laughs in delight
there are cheers as colin escorts her away
roger leans back against the car smoking calmly
after the riotous excitement of the eton schoolyard the peace and quiet of the river
marilyn rushes along the sandy bank
the water glitters magically
hurry up slow poke
but we havent got any
he stops in mid sentence as he sees marilyn unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly
he tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off
he hurries to find a bush to get changed behind
as he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and marilyns cry of shock as she hits the water
oh my gosh
marilyn swims in the water humming softly to herself
colin wades in wincing at the cold
this is great
what if a boat goes past
we could be arrested
roger will fix it
oh darn it
she holds her head and he looks at her with concern
i have something in my eye
he swims across to her very aware of her naked body under the water
she holds her head up to him
i cant see anything
she tips her head back
he looks deep into her eyes and suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips
before he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away
thats the first time ive kissed anyone younger than me
theres a lot of older guys in hollywood
she swims happily totally relaxed
colin is much more self conscious keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats
finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the shore
she glances back catching colin looking
he glances away embarrassed
dont be shy colin
its nothing you havent seen before
colin wades awkwardly to the shore trying to conceal his erection with his cupped hands
and you an old etonian
she reaches for her blouse and stands shivering as she tries to dry herself
colin goes to take her in his arms
let me warm you up
she snuggles into him gratefully her teeth chattering
he rubs her naked back briskly her thin blouse the only barrier between their bodies
slowly his embrace becomes more sensual his hands slowing stroking rather than rubbing his face buried in her hair his arms pulling her dont spoil it
she looks at him her expression knowing but sweet
i want this to be the perfect date
he tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently her expression wistful
i havent had a real date since i was years old
she suddenly looks much younger her smile a poignant echo of a lost childhood
he steps back politely allowing her to put on her blouse
as she buttons it she gazes at him then impulsively leans forward to kiss him chastely on the lips
the kiss is as sweet and innocent as any year old might wish
the kiss lasts for a few seconds their lips touching gently the river shimmering magically in the sunshine behind them
when they finally break apart she rewards him with a radiant smile
that was nice
i dont get kissed much
she looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens
okay what do we do now
colin looks at her knowing it is time to return to the real world but reluctant to face it
there is a discreet cough and roger appears
time to go home i think miss monroe
she smiles a little sadly then gets up walking past him as she puts on the rest of her clothes
roger averts his eyes respectfully and waits for colin
the two men look at each other for a second
be careful not to get in too deep son
colin knows he isnt talking about the river
marilyn and colin sit in silence in the back of the car
her exuberance has vanished and there is a distant look in her eye
colin wants to say something but cant think of the right words
he puts his hand on hers and she squeezes it but then pulls away
a seething milton is waiting on the steps as roger parks the car
colin looks at him nervously
marilyn looks at him then gets out glancing at milton indifferently
she smiles sweetly
next time i come on set you better make sure colin is there
he looks at her in shock then bitterly at colin
take him home
she waves briefly to colin nothing more than a flutter of her fingers
colin watches her all the way up the steps until she disappears inside
the crew are ready the cast stand around in full costume olivier paces the set and there is no sign of marilyn
olivier turns to colin
you spent the day with her
what frame of mind was she in
she was fine
well find out whats going on
theres a good chap
perhaps we can persuade her on this splendid day to do the work shes paying herself to do
he stalks off
colin sees wattis grinning at him
dont start dicky
you wont get any sympathy from me dear
frankly i wouldnt care if marilyn dropped dead tomorrow
shes trying her best
shes marilyn monroe
this is her life
pills booze sex more pills
pause god it must be wonderful
colin doesnt laugh
wattis looks at him sympathetically
little colins in love
milton is waiting for colin at the door
marilyns not well
but she was wonderful yesterday
milton looks at him for a long moment masking his hostility in barbed politeness
i dont know what you did to her kid but she got nervous
i had to give her some pills to calm her down
she doesnt need pills
she just needs someone to care for her
someone like you
milton shakes his head patronisingly
i told you im not in love with her
you kissed her
she said that
spare me the bullshit
i know everything
colin stares at him feeling hopelessly out of his depth
you messed her up kid
he comes very close his tone fierce but wounded
ive got every penny i ever made tied up in marilyn
she owes me
if it wasnt for me shed still be on contracts that make slave wages look good
i gave her back her freedom and now millers turning her against me
thats what you get for trying to help marilyn monroe
he goes back to the house pausing at the door speaking more in sorrow than anger
if you want to play with the grown ups colin start learning the rules
a gentle summer breeze lifts the net curtains
colin is fast asleep
theres a sharp rap at the door
colin opens his eyes his mind drugged with sleep
whats the matter
a cold dread clutches at colins stomach
he stumbles out of bed and opens the door
roger stands in the doorway is she dead
shes asking for you
i think she might be in a coma
how can she be asking for me if shes in a coma
just bloody get dressed
roger and colin drive up
milton waits on the steps
he looks resentfully at colin but doesnt say anything
paula strasberg paces frantically outside marilyns bedroom door as roger milton and colin hurry up the stairs
she hasnt made a sound for over an hour
we should break down the door
how many pills did she take
oh jesus who knows
i wasnt counting
colin knocks gently
there is no reply
roger and colin carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel and prop it up against the wall
thats her window
he points with his torch
the window is open
colin shins up the ladder while roger holds it
ill open the door once im inside
colin tumbles in through the window with a clattering thump
a shaft of moonlight reveals marilyn lying naked across the bed her body partly covered by the sheet
half empty pill and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her mother gladys
for a second he fears the worst but then suddenly she groans and sits up looking at him blearily
oh hi colin
are you okay
everyone was worried about you
she pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily on the pillow
she is instantly back asleep
colin fumbles his way to the door
he searches for the key on the side table and quickly finds it
he goes to unlock the door but then pauses looking back at marilyn
he puts the key back and bends down to whisper at the keyhole
shes fine but im going to keep an eye on her
ill sleep on the sofa
come on colin open up
after a second i cant find the key
pause you can all go to bed now
colin open this door
she needs me
colin goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping marilyn his expression suffused with a tenderness we have never seen in him before
he pulls up the sheet so that it covers her nakedness then tentatively lies down to rest his head on the pillow
colin wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on blinding him
what are you doing here
marilyn sits up the sheet clutched to her chest her expression panicky and disoriented
colin hurls himself off the bed
i came in through the window
he realises this doesnt sound reassuring
milton thought you were sick
she stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed smile
is there a balcony like in romeo and juliet
pause but im not sick
what makes them think that
she reaches instinctively for the pill container on her bedside table
please dont take any more pills
she frowns clutching the pill bottle in one hand
he reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp
as he puts it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph
colin contd contd whos that
her expression softens as she looks at the picture
they took her to the sanatorium when i was a kid
i grew up in other peoples homes mostly
alongside her mothers photo is another framed picture this time of abraham lincoln
i dont know who my father is so it might as well be him
i can pick any father i want
she smiles then looks at colin wistfully
do you have a home colin
a real one
yes i do
and a mother and father who still live together
and do they love you
im sure they do
she smiles sadly
her eyes fill with tears
she looks up at him anxiously
do you love me colin
he stares at her
she looks lovely but desperately vulnerable
she reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her palm
colin gently takes her hand and takes two of them away
she smiles not objecting as he settles her back gently on the pillow
but you and i come from different worlds
youre like some greek goddess to me
im not greek
she smiles teasing him
he smiles back
she takes his hand looking at him in appeal
i dont want to be a goddess
i just want to be loved like an ordinary girl
miller loves you
she stares at him her face going blank with misery
i found his notebook
it said id let him down
writers scribble all kinds of things
it doesnt mean anything
she looks at him her eyes full of pain
he wanted me to find it
it said he should never have married me
that i was unpredictable and a woman child flighty and self centred
hes left me colin
why do the people i love always leave me
she looks so wretched so completely baffled that colin responds with sudden passion
ill never leave you
she smiles and embraces him gratefully
all people ever see is marilyn monroe
as soon as they realise im not her they run
he lies down next to her taking her awkwardly in his arms
she sighs sleepily
boy theres a lot of men in this business
and they all think youve got to sleep with them
she looks across at him their faces inches apart
youre not like that
thats why i like you
colin stares back at her guiltily
you should date that wardrobe lady
i dont want to
pause i love you marilyn
she stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again
they stare intently at each other their mood fragile touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible
marilyn leans forward and kisses him gently
the embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly hungrily
he kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily
he wants her more than he has wanted anything before
and then he stops
the fantasy he has been pursuing for weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it does for him it will only damage her further
he pulls away from her gently
her eyes flicker open lazily
whats the matter
dont you want to make love
maybe we should just be friends
she wraps herself around him curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw
as she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back
she curls against him
this is nice
i used to do this with johnny
my agent back in the old days
he was thin like you
her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep
with her body warm against him colins resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined
she mutters softly in reply
do one thing for me
come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do
show larry youre a great actress
he smiles and turns out the light
first light streams in through the curtains
colin wakes to hear marilyn singing cheerfully
he gets up and sees her through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath her back towards him
she is practicing the gentle waltz tune she is to sing in the film
i found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through
im yours no matter what others may say or do
she has never sounded so happy or carefree
colin races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a few seconds before oliviers car swings into the entrance
the great man leans out of the back window
pause christ you look rough
he looks at him thoughtfully then shrugs
let me know when marilyn arrives
if she ever does
oh im pretty sure shell be in this morning
olivier gives colin an odd look
marilyn olivier and wattis act a scene together a drunken elsie marina is being seduced by the grand duke and northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a valet plays
the violin in the doorway behind him
your grand ducal highness
this is intolerable
with the deepest respect sir my message was so important i had no choice but to intrude
no sir miss marinas aunt has been in a motor accident
the hospital is calling for her most urgently
giggles drunkenly oh go away you silly man
miss marina your aunt
you realise how serious her condition is
well its her own fault
she has no right being out at this time of night
marilyn is utterly adorable
the crew colin amongst them cant take their eyes off her
olivier glances at orton behind the camera
they have a good take and they know it
cut it there
marilyn is as happy as we have ever seen her
she seeks out colin amongst the crowd and beams at him
half the crew including olivier notice the look
colin blushes self consciously but we can feel his pride
olivier takes off his make up
colin stands behind him with the end of day bottle of whisky
olivier is in buoyant mood
it has been a good day
whatever it was you did to her boy keep doing it
olivier grins slyly and colin doesnt bother to protest
the phone rings
olivier picks it up
his face falls as he listens to the voice at the other end of the line
colin paces nervously up and down the hall
she looks at him for a long unnerving moment then speaks with sudden ferocity
from the first moment all i have felt is oliviers loathing and contempt
he thinks im unnecessary
me her drama coach surrogate mother nursemaid
on call hours a day to help her act dole out pills bolster her ego keep her sober enough to work
pause no me no marilyn
he is taken aback by her passion
she smiles bitterly then walks on
she looks back briefly
you can come up now
marilyn lies in bed with milton possessively at her side
colin comes in with paula
marilyn looks at him dully her eyes clouded and unfocused
a half empty pill bottle stands on the side
colin sits down next to her and she takes his hand ignoring the surprised look on miltons face
you think i can act dont you colin
of course i do
you were wonderful today
paula looks at milton then moves between them busily
marilyns tired now
i want him to stay with me
what would arthur say if he knew colin was here
a flicker of terror crosses marilyns face
colin turns on them angrily
you heard what she said
she wants me here
milton looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the field
paula is more reluctant to give in
she sits on the bed stroking marilyns hand
you have no idea of your position in the world marilyn
you are the greatest actress theres ever been
not just actress
the greatest woman of this or any time
i love you like a daughter
colin is surprised to see tears in her eyes
its hard now but believe me you will survive this and go on to better things
your life is ahead of you
youre young just beginning
paulas love and sincerity are obvious
she means it
colin watches her in silence
marilyn squeezes her hand and paula gets up with a heavy sigh bitterly reluctant to leave
finally she drags herself out leaving them alone
as the door closes marilyn curls herself up in the bed
im so tired of feeling scared
life is so shitty
i hate it
it hurts too much
colin looks at her his heart breaking at her anguish
im here now
ill look after you
she gives him a wry look teasing but thoughtful
good old colin
looking after me looking after larry looking after vivien
always putting everyone before yourself
there is an edge to this
he gazes at her shaken but she smiles and touches his face gently
he gets on the bed fully clothed to fold her in his arms
colin wakes with a start as he realises that marilyn is screaming in pain
it hurts colin
she is doubled up clutching her stomach sweating and frightened
colin sees a dark red stain on the sheets
i cant lose the baby
colin looks at her aghast
its a surprise
dont tell anyone
he hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door
milton and colin wait by the bathroom in marilyns suite
roger hurries in
the doctors coming
colin turns the handle but the bathroom door is locked
marilyn unlock the door
dont let anyone in
milton gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about anything except marilyn
there is a shuffling sound and the door is unlocked
at the same moment paula comes rushing in hair awry gown flapping a wild look in her eye
marilyn my baby what has colin done to you
i havent done anything
got a stomach ache
he reddens with embarrassment
i think he means her monthlies
what will arthur say if she dies
shes not dying for christs sake
the housekeeper now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side
he nods briskly
is the patient in there
please save her
its marilyn monroe
you cant let her die
connell calmly extracts himself from her grasp
perhaps youd all like to give us a little privacy
as colin shepherds the others out milton turns on him bitterly
happy now kid
connell stands in the hall outside the bedroom writing out a prescription and smoking a cigarette
he tears the prescription off the pad and looks up
whos in charge here
milton paula roger and colin all step forward as one
connell gives them a wry look and shrugs
ive given mrs
miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped
she needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that shell be fine
i suggest someone stays with her
paula leans forward and almost snatches the prescription from his hand
shell be safe with me
she looks bitterly at colin
colin walks connell to his car their feet crunching on the gravel
well goodnight then
colin holds the door open as he gets in
was she really pregnant
i think thats a private matter between mr and mrs
he looks at colin with cool disapproval then closes the door and drives off
colin stands watching shivering in his shirtsleeves
colin creeps into the room and sits on the bed
marilyn is awake
she gazes at him hazy but lucid
we have to say goodbye now colin
arthurs on his way back
when this film is over im going to settle down and be a good wife to him
im going to learn to make matzo ball soup as good as his dads
she smiles wistfully at the fantasy
we have to forget this ever happened
i dont want to forget
he struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately
let me protect you from all this
she smiles sadly
what do you want to do
you could come and live at my parents place
youd love it
its a castle like in a fairy tale
we wouldnt even have to live together
you could have your own suite of rooms
he is close to tears suddenly looking very young
she looks at him with a sad sweet smile
he shakes his head stubbornly taking her hand in passionate appeal
you could quit
forget marilyn monroe forget hollywood
let it all go
this is what ive worked for my whole life
i couldnt just give it all up
why not when it drives you crazy
her eyes widen in surprise
a flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression
you think im crazy
i didnt mean that
i just meant you could be happy
i am happy
i got everything i ever dreamed about
she smiles tentatively but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes
he looks down realising with a cruel stab of pain that olivier was right
there is no way back
she doesnt want to be rescued
he finally looks up smiling despite the tears in his eyes
of course youre happy
pause youre a star
the biggest star in the world
she smiles reassured
he drags himself off the bed and goes to the door pausing for a second as he looks back
youre right marilyn
we have to forget all this
from now on im nobody
just the third
you dont even know i exist
well never look at each other again
she giggles with some of her old playfulness
well maybe just a wink
once in a while
he smiles looks at her just once more and then goes out
as the door closes we see marilyns smile fade to be replaced by a bleak frightened expression
olivier sits in front of his make up mirror in his grand ducal uniform smoothing down his hair with pomade
colin knocks and comes in
theyre ready for you on set sir laurence
shes just arrived
only an hour late
not bad by her standards
he smiles then stands up straightening his uniform
maybe we will finish this bloody film after all
the crew are ready
the actors are on set
olivier stands by the camera
colin is half hidden in the shadows
there is a flurry of activity and marilyn emerges with paula on one side and milton on the other
she looks exactly as marilyn should
with her white dress shimmering in the lights and her platinum blonde hair glowing she has the air of a goddess
she sweeps past only inches away from colin but ignores him
he cant help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret
marilyn turns to the assembled crew
a silence settles
she smiles around blinking in the lights
she looks for comfort or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or sullen hostility
she smiles nervously
i hope you will all forgive me
it wasnt altogether my fault
i have been ill
she smiles up at their uneasy expressions struggling to understand herself and their expectations of her
id like you to remember i tried
this oddly moving and open confession is received in silence
no one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty
perhaps they think it is just another performance
olivier in character lies back on a sofa with marilyn on top of him singing the waltz that colin first heard after his night with her
marilyn looks kittenish and irresistible as she sings only a few inches from oliviers face
i found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through im yours no matter what others may say or do
be light of heart and fancy free thats the way to start there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart
she sings with touching delicacy nailing it perfectly
there is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch
colin is amongst them
it is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy for him
he suddenly realises that sybil thorndike has crept up silently behind him to watch the scene
as he turns to her she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion murmuring softly so that only he can hear
first love is such sweet despair colin
she touches his cheek gently and smiles perhaps lost in a long ago memory of her own before retreating quietly into the darkness at the back of the set
inch by laborious inch the sleeping prince moves towards the finish line
we see a montage of scenes being filmed hardwick enters as major domo through the main door of the oval room carrying a silver tray bearing shaving equipment
wattis and jeremy spenser crossing the drawing room to the grand dukes bedroom
wattis crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door
the process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is done until we come to the final shot in the sequence very quiet studio
going for a take
the big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy clunks
marilyn looks up in character as elsie her eyes glowing
ive got a solemn word of warning for you
whats that my beloved
you know whats going to happen
im going to fall in love with you because i always always do
close on marilyn as she smiles her face radiating joy and vitality
and then in the split second before orton calls cut marilyn turns her head just a fraction and winks at colin
olivier looks up from the sofa notices and smiles indulgently
okay boys and girls thats a wrap
there is a smattering of applause from the crew
marilyn leaves the stage
marilyn walks away from us down the long corridor alone
the crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a group of hardened war veterans
orton offers colin a grudging nod well done
milton now comes forward calling out above the hubbub
if youd all like to step this way youll find something i think youll like
milton indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio loaded with gaily wrapped parcels
he ushers the crew over
a parting gift to each of you from marilyn
men on the left ladies on the right
at first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd happens
one of the crew simply picks up his present without looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against the wall
there is a moment then a woman does the same with hers
suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps their present
the bin is soon overflowing
milton stares at the scene then simply shrugs and walks out
arthur jacobs utterly indifferent to the hostile undercurrent grins and waves cheerfully
its been a lot of fun kids
see you at the academy awards
he goes out grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the dustbin as he goes
colin watches all this in shocked silence
he looks at the label on his own small parcel which reads simply to colin with thanks marilyn
the wardrobe department is empty except for lucy who cradles her own gift from marilyn
colin comes in looking nervous
they look at each other awkwardly
arent you going to throw yours away
of course not
its from marilyn monroe
she shrugs and turns to leave
after a second lucy
she turns back to look at him
i was wondering if youre doing anything this saturday
im washing my hair
he nods accepting this as no more than he deserves
she goes but then stops to look back at him
did she break your heart
after a second a little
it needed breaking
there is no malice in her response just an awareness that he is older and wiser now and perhaps a better man for the experience
he nods accepting the rebuke
after a second i might be free on wednesday
she goes out
he looks down at marilyns present in his hands
colin walks down the hall
he notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre
as he goes towards it he sees roger coming the other way on his way out of the studio his job done
the two men smile an acknowledgment of everything theyve been through together
roger offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way
olivier sits on his own watching an edited version of the the coconut girl sequence scenes and
colin comes in
olivier glances at him
you do look my son in a moved sort as if you were dismayd be cheerful sir
our revels now are ended
these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air
we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep
colin sits down next to the great man
they watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them
the sequence shows marilyn improvising in the champagne and caviar scene
she serves herself food and drink before collapsing drunk
the endless retakes and fluffs gone what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty
after a second shes quite wonderful
no training no craft no guile just pure instinct
he seems almost lost in awe
colin gazes at him in surprise
you should tell her that
oh i will
but she wont believe me
thats probably what makes her great
its certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy
he smiles wryly
i tried my best to change her but she remains brilliant despite me
pause directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented but marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again
he signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up
and now im going back to the theatre
john osborne is writing a piece for me
i thought you hated all that royal court stuff
miller made me see things differently
pause you have to find new worlds to conquer if you want to be the best
and believe me most of the time i really am the best
he goes to the door and pauses
youve done a good job boy
pause welcome to the circus
he goes out
colin looks back up at the projection box
run it again please
the lights go down
marilyns face appears on the screen laughing and happy
it is another sequence the one where marilyn does her sweet uninhibited little dance scene a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent
hold on colin for a long moment gazing at her image in the darkness then the circus is leaving
the film is shutting down
not knowing his next job colin sits suitcase next to his chair wearing the marilyn experience on his face and in his soul
head down sipping a pint
he could be a regular here
barry behind the bar flitting around the dart players and regulars at play
and then as if a gust of wind invaded barry looks up and freezes
the dart player sensing something turns to look up as well
the regulars are frozen in mid action
colin is missing it all
of his attention is given to his woe and his pint
buy a girl a drink
colin doesnt turn
he recognizes the voice and smiles
can i get another one of those please barry
barry for once is silent pours a pint
the regulars try not to stare
i didnt want to leave without saying goodbye
marilyn hands colin a package
the first time you saw this all i had on was the radio
colin opens the package
its her copy of the script
on the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink to the dont forget me
as if i could
everyone else on the picture wishes they could
everyone else doesnt understand
she smiles touched
be a gentleman and walk me to my car
the ever faithful roger stands by the idling car
colin opens the car door for marilyn
marilyn beckons him closer
she kisses him gently
he smiles and says lightly whats that for
thats for being on my side and remember when you see me wink thats for you
roger walks around the car and looks over at colin
glancing at colin looking a couple of inches taller than when i first saw you
roger nods at colin a silent salute suggesting job well done
he gets into the car and we stay on colin as he watches it pull away
barry comes to the doorway of the pub
was that really marilyn monroe
no just a good friend of mine
barry walks back into the pub leaving colin alone staring at the vanishing car
and then the sun swallows it as it drives into the english countryside
colin walks along chatting to friends
dressed in a neat dark suit he looks older and more confident
there is little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and down the pavement outside sir laurence oliviers office
we see the caption six years later
colin walks into a small office
film cans are piled up all over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves
a secretary sits typing at her desk
colin goes to his own desk glances at his diary then looks up
the secretary pushes a piece of paper at him
its probably just someone having a joke
colin looks down at the message
there is a los angeles phone number and then the name marilyn monroe
after a moment did she say anything
she just asked you to call
pause it is a joke isnt it
colin stares down at the paper
pause book a call as soon as you can
los angeles california
it is late
colin stares at the number on the scrap of paper
the phone rings
he picks it up eagerly
your call to los angeles
we hear the crackle of the international line
he waits anxiously as the ringing continues
establish the luxurious exterior of marilyns comfortable brentwood house
the room is large and tasteful white sofas and cushions and deep rugs
picture windows look out onto the hollywood hills
a white phone rings on the table
it rings continuously insistently
it carries on ringing
no one comes
hold on the jangling phone
each time it rings we think marilyn might appear but she never does
it carries on ringing unanswered in the empty room
as the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet echo of marilyns voice singing the sleeping prince waltz
i found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through im yours no matter what others may say or do
be light of heart and fancy free thats the way to start there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart
the fragile voice hangs in the air for a second then slowly drifts away to nothing
colin sits with the phone to his ear
the sound of marilyn singing the sleeping prince waltz dies away and we realise has been revisiting it in his memory
he waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going to answer
in the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle in resignation
his gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans
he stands up and looks through them blowing dust away they have been here for a long time ignored
he finds the one he is looking for it says simply mm on the can
he takes the short reel of film and threads it through a movieola in the corner of the room
he turns it on and bends to look
the screen bursts into life with an image of marilyn at her most vital and captivating
it is a copy of some rushes from the prince and the showgirl perhaps given to colin by olivier or perhaps borrowed as a souvenir and long since forgotten
we see marilyn dancing happily exaggerating off camera looking playful and sexy
she is radiant and full of life
after a moment she turns and looks off camera perhaps to where colin himself would have been standing and winks happily
blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet and charming
there is something so completely natural about the gesture colin feels he has been swept back seven years in time and marilyn is standing in front of him again in
it moves and delights him perhaps he has never even really seen this clip before
at any rate he hasnt thought about it for years
it is marilyn as he will always remember her relaxed affectionate and vital a part of her however tiny forever his
she smiles laughs at something giggles in delight without sound
she says something to an unseen crew member then looks back smiling at the camera
her face fills the screen
beautiful timeless happy
