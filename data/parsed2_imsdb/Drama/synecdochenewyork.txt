the sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging fades in
caden opens his eyes in bed and groggily looks at himself in the bureau mirror
the bedside clock reads
adele in t shirt and sweats mixes a bowl of instant oatmeal puts it in the microwave
a labor day luncheon today mommy
at stuckey hall okay
in downtown schenectady adele leaves the kitchen
caden also enters as shes leaving
hes dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe
tried not to wake you
i was just as cadens voice goes under we follow adele into olive sits on the toilet
adele enters rips some toilet paper off the roll and proceeds to wipe olive
the phone rings in the kitchen
caden could you get that
i dont want to
looks at bright green smear on toilet paper thats weird
the phone stops ringing
is something wrong with my poop
its just green
hi its me

maybe you ate somethingill try you on your cell
whats wrong with me
a cellphone rings in the other room
honey i have to get this
youre going to be fine
but mommy adele runs into she rifles through her purse grabs her cellphone answers
oh wiping olives ass
caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee
he sips it and stares out the window
caden exits with his coffee annoyed about the phone call
i dont feel well
caden passes the bathroom
olive is staring into the toilet bowl
adele can be heard chatting in the background
daddy my poop is green
caden enters the bathroom looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet paper
he seems freaked out

of course honey
did you have green poop when you were little
im sure i did honey
am i going to die
of course not
you probablyi didnt
i didnt eat ate something green
itll be fine sweetie
ill be back in a minute
is poop alive
caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries down the driveway in the rain
he picks up the newspaper pulls the mail from the box
as he heads back inside he flips through the mail
theres a magazine called attending to your illness addressed to caden
a diseased person on the cover
across the street a gaunt man watches caden unseen
caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee reading the paper dated friday october
all right baby
see you then
adele clicks off her cellphone
harold pinter died
well he wasoh wait
he won the nobel old right
good for him
do you need to come look at my poop again
no olive its fine
justwhat if its alive
what if flush
i kill it
its not alive honey
god remember that production of the dumbwaiter i did at albanyfest
the toilet is flushed
everything grows big
thats how you know
i have your oatmeal honey
i want peanut butter and jelly
you told me i dont want oatmeal
this isnt a restaurant
adele growls grabs the oatmeal dumps it in the sink
looking at paper they found avian flu in turkey
in the country turkey not turkeys
its in chickens
adele is making a peanut butter sandwich for olive
can i watch tv till school
caden clicks the remote for olive and goes back to his paper
a cartoon cow talks to a cartoon sheep
there is a secret something at play under the surface growing like an invisible virus of thought
the sheep nods
caden pours himself some more coffee opens the milk carton to pour some in then sniffs at the spout
he checks the date on the carton
but you are being changed by it
second by second
every breath counts off time
caden goes back to his paper
adele puts a peanut butter sandwich in front of olive
now you better eat this
the first black graduate of the university of alabama died
vivian malone jones
adele stares out the window at the rain
caden is in the dentists chair a bloody bib around his neck
the dentist in surgical mask probes his open mouth calls out numbers to an assistant who records them
to caden family coming for thanksgiving
a faucet explodes and smacks him in the forehead
he is sent staggering backwards with a yelp into the far wall his razor flying and blood pouring from a jagged cut above his right eyebrow
off screen we hear the pounding footsteps of someone running toward us
half of cadens face is covered with shaving cream
rivulets of blood intermingle with it
water shoots out where the tap was spraying the mirror which is spattered with blood
adele dressed in heavily paint splattered clothes hurries in and takes in the scene the wet the mess the blood
what the fuck
olive in a nightgown stands quietly in the doorway her curled toes clenched
she holds a large stuffed owl
i was shaving and my god
look at your head
dumbly caden tries to look up at his forehead then squints nervously at himself in the mirror
to olive honey dont look
olive turns around
do i press above or below it
i dont know
caden sits on the toilet presses a towel to his head
adele squats goes into a spasmodic coughing fit finishes opens the cabinet under the sink pushes her arm through bottles of cleaning products old sponges old toothbrushes toilet paper rolls
and other junk to the shut off valves
i cant turn it
its gonna flood
olive hugs the owl tightly and it speaks
whooo arei cant oh wait got it
adele turns off the water
olive looks back into the room
mommy daddy has blood
caden sits on a metal table
the room has some meager christmas ornaments
a doctor stitches cadens forehead
caden squints into the bright light the doctor uses to see his work
in the background we hear another patient
please please please
caden sees a nurse shoving a tube far up into a mans nose
another nurse wipes away the blood leaking out his nostril
will there be a scar
it looks like a mudflap
i prefer there not be a scar
that fellow is annoying
hes in here every week
the off screen patient continues to whimper
the doctor finishes his work on caden
i think that should he looks at cadens eyes turns off the bright lamp and looks again
he turns the lamp back on and looks once more
the doctor feels cadens pulse then listens to his heart
he presses hard against the glands in cadens neck
changes in bowel movements
a little more yellow than usual
id like you to see an ophthalmologist
no an ophthalmologist
i said ophthalmologist
the doctor stares blankly at caden for a long moment then looks suspiciously in cadens ears
adele drives and coughs spasmodically
the car swerves a bit
caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand
olive in her car seat sings
caden sees revelers in winter coats and party hats outside a house
they blow noisemakers and yell happy new year
its a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow
and the world is too big to understand and today is tuesday and mom is today tuesday
no its friday honey
and today is friday and
olives singing continues but goes under
so what exactly did he say
my pupils werent properly dilating and um not doing the opposite
the bump to the head
he doesnt know
he said he doesnt think so
but he doesnt know
i got it
im a little anxious
did you have to get a shot daddy
to adele its the start of something awful
do i have to get a shot
of course not
pause to adele this is really fucked timing
did you tell him i have green poop
remind me to call the realizing plumber would you
i need ai have rehearsal
to do list
how many years till i have to get more shots
not for a long time honey
caden pulls out a cell phone and dials
a million years
woodman said dad whats a plumber
after the last vaccination hes the man who or woman dad
hes the man or woman who fixes sinks and toilets and
do you know what pipes are
into phone hey jim
i had an accident
no im okay
like to smoke out of
different kind of pipe
into phone just run lines
ill be there soon
hangs up houses have pipes
theyre like tubes and theyre behind walls and under the floor everywhere and olive begins to whimper in horror
whats wrong baby
hushed anxious whisper every single where
they just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets
its like in your body you have veins and
and theyre filled with blood
olive is crying in earnest now
i dont want blood
i have blood
to caden what are you doing
im trying to explain plumbing
well stop it
to olive its okay honey
i dont want blood
will it hurt
will it hurt daddy
no honey youre fine
i dont want blood
i dont holding head want blood
i dont wanti cant do this now
you dont have to worry baby
you dont have blood
well i dont think you should tell her she doesnt have blood
caden stop it
caden stares out the window
its dark but his pupils are pinpricks
an ophthalmologist examines cadens eyes
an eyeglass calendar on the wall is open to march
thanks for getting me in right away
the doctor touches cadens eye repeatedly with a small probe
is it the bump to the head
writes in chart then could be
but i think we need to get you to a neurologist
yes a brain expert
i know what a neurologist is
i just thought from the way you asked i thought maybe you said urologist
why do i need to see a neurologist
for a look see
the eyes are part of the brain after all
thats not true is it
why would i say it if it werent true
it just doesnt seem right
like morally correct
or right as in accurate
im not sure
accurate i guess
the doctor writes in cadens chart
caden sits in the almost empty theater
a few people with note pads are scattered around
centerstage a dodge business coupe
the car is surrounded by various rooms from that period a kitchen bedrooms etc
tom the actor playing willy loman stands center stage
claire the actress playing linda loman sits in the sets bedroom
davis the actor playing biff lies on the top bunk of a bunk bed upstage
a fourth actor playing happy lies on the bottom bunk
willy you coming up
tom climbs in the car
claire as linda contaaad willy
tom starts the car and guns the engine
a brick wall off stage speeds into the car accompanied by crashing and screeching sound effects
claire as linda contaaad no
the wall continues to be pulled past the car crashing into the rest of the set knocking walls over creating havoc
a lamp post falls and hits claire knocking her over
running to stage yeah yeah im fine
its no oh crap claire are youbig deal
david whats happening here
looking back from seat sorry caden
david runs on stage to deal with the mess
its too late in the game to be having these problems david
to claire youre sure youre okay
god yes it was funny
i know caden
well get it
tom emerges from the car covered with stage blood
caden contaaad please
to tom that was good tom
i was trying something different
i was crashing differently
i saw that
i like it
caden meets tom at the foot of the stage
behind them a group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re set it
claire primps in the bureau mirror
try to keep in mind that a young person playing willy loman thinks hes only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair
but the tragedy is that we know that you the young actor will end up in this very place of desolation
taking this in okay
lets try it again
how long david
i think fifteen
why dont you get cleaned up tom and well go again
caden rubs his temples then heads to the back of the house pulling out his cell phone
he exits the theater
caden passes the box office
hazel sits inside reading a novel
she looks up smiles warmly and waves
i just heard the death of the salesman
in more ways than one
holding up cell phone in search of elusive signal
signals good here oddly
she pats her lap in a friendly manner
that is odd
cell phones theyre crazy
chuckles back in her book see you in a few
caden has the phone to his ear
hes squinting in the bright sunlight pupils dilated
the gaunt man watches him unseen
heshborg said i should see dr
my pupils dont work
hazel reads the first page of swanns way
the other volumes of in search of lost time are stacked neatly nearby
she looks up and sees caden standing outside the box office window watching her
i keep reading the first line
its a good line i think
but i dont know much about literature
maybe you should read the first line of another series of books
im trying to better myself caden
recommend me something
youre a genius you mustve read nearly a dozen books
have you read kafka
um ive read his name
his whole name
okay not his entire name
you should read the trial maybe
if you say so i will
cant wait till wednesday
im so excited to see it
i hope you like it
its pretty impossible that i wont you know
she trails off shrugs
they smile at each other
hazel looks at her book re reads the first sentence
caden sits on the toilet
he finishes looks in the bowl
his bowel movement is dark and loose
adele lies in bed asleep
caden steps out of the bathroom and climbs into bed
i think i have blood in my stool
adele looks over half asleep
that stool in your office
caden and adele sit across from madeline s their therapist
adele has a coughing fit
then when i was pregnant with olive
what was it like
i dont know
hopeful or something
like something was going to change
something did no
yes of course
maybe not as much as i had hoped
thats a terrible thing to say
there are no terrible things to say in here
only true and false
i feel alone sometimes
i feel exhausted
can i say something awful
ive fantasized about caden dying and being able to start again
i know its terrible
caden sits sadly on the steps drinks coffee
he watches as hazel pulls into the parking lot gets out of her car
the gaunt man is behind the trash bin
she sits next to caden
its a nightmare in there
the car crash
so im reading the trial
im such an idiot for not knowing about this book
conspiratorial whisper its famous it turns out
youre not an idiot
then you say in fact youre very bright hazel
and i love your eyes
in fact youre very bright playing charmed hazel
and i love your eyes
oh am i
oh do you
then what do i say
i cant say what then you say
cause its dirty
a whistling noise turns their heads
in the distance a man with an unopened parachute is plummeting
oh my god
they watch as the man falls behind a building
a screech of brakes
hes gotta be dead
the plumber is working on the sink
ive seen boy parts
the studio is a mess the floor covered with paint
adele in her paint spattered clothing works on a tiny canvas an inch square
she paints with a single hair brush while looking through a magnifying glass
caden pokes his head in
can i piss in your sink
um yeah i guess
caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio
his urine is amber
he finishes and peeks over adeles shoulder through the magnifying glass at the painting
its an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair screaming to the heavens while standing in a field of flames
its gorgeous ad
how was rehearsal
we have five hundred and sixty lighting cues
i dont know why i made it so complicated
its what you do
anyway we got through it
i think youll be impressed
caden listen im really sorry
i just cant go tonight
off his look im sorry
ive got to get two canvases ready to ship
i know it sucks
but its opening night
i would go if i could
i have to get ready
ill go tomorrow
well makei mean i cant take a dump tomorrow like the premiere
in your sink
what am i supposed to do
i have to get ready
the theater is full
caden stands nervously in the back
the lights dim
hazel looks back from her seat at caden and mouths the word yay
the curtain rises on a dark stage
tom as willy gets out of the car parked center stage and walks into the kitchen
oh boy oh boy
its all right i came back
did something happen willy
no nothing happened
you didnt smash the car did you
i said nothing happened
didnt you hear me
dont you feel well
im tired to death
i couldnt make it
i just couldnt make it linda
where were you all day
you look terrible
i got as far as a little above yonkers
i stopped for a cup of coffee
maybe it was the coffee
i suddenly couldnt drive any more
the car kept going off onto the shoulder yknow
the audience is rapt
the cast party is in full swing
the opening was a success
lots of drinking
caden chats with claire
hazel watches from across the room
scrunching her nose ugh i hated myself tonight
plus im so bloated and enormous
you looked great
you i thought tom was amazing
i was very pleased
squints suddenly sorry
i have a bit of a headache
kisses his forehead i just want to thank you for everything
youve been absolutely brilliant and its going to be miserable going ahead without you
ill be around
ill check in
she gets teary gives him a kiss on the cheek
god im such a baby
she just looks at him and smiles and nods
im going to get drunk thats what
she backs away and gets lost in the crowd
caden massages his temples
suddenly hazel is next to him
i figured id better get in fast
i loved it
and by the way claire is trouble
and not terribly bright
just wanted you to know the word on the street
so you liked it
are you kidding
i cried for like fifteen minutes after
i loved every minute of it
i thought she was weak
easy on the eyes
oh caden not you too
what i want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue right after she had the line i cant cry for you willy
she felt very strongly that it was right
they sip their drinks
wheres el wife o

her berlin show is in two weeks
were going to spend like a month there
weve still got it
ill miss you
yeah me too
youre going to miss you
yeah thats it

i couldnt begin to guess
it must be that youre married
do you get high my friend

in my car
i dont know

i get kind of
something when im stoned
what does something mean
i dont know
what does bothered mean
and me with a station wagon and all
could be dangerous
yeah it really could
youre absolutely zero fun
you know i wish i could
jesus i like you
youre not staying for the reviews
i know its brilliant
i dont need some dope with elbow patches telling me
she smiles gives him a hug and heads toward the door
hazel drives down a dark street crying
people watch her passing car from various windows
theres a run over dog lit by a streetlight glistening on the side of the road
hazel studies the dog
its a bloody gutty mess squashed flat
against all odds its still alive
its head is lolling
she bends down to pet it
youre not going to make it baby
hazel takes off her make up hair back in a clip
she watches herself blankly in the mirror somewhat erased without eye make up
the run over dog is sleeping in a box on the floor
the party has thinned out
the remaining people are sitting around a table drinking
claire next to caden rests her head sleepily drunk against his shoulder
caden studies a series of lumps under the skin of his arm
what are you going to do now
im going to berlin for a month for my wifes show
then i dont know
i wish i was your wife or a wife or had a wife
or was german even
im so lonely with none of those things
a man walks in with a bunch of newspapers
yay or nay
hazel gets out of her car and walks up to a neat little house on a street of neat little houses
faint swirls of smoke escape from the windows
she rings the doorbell
the button is hot hazel pulls her finger away
the rooms are hazy
the realtor coughs a little
hazel surveys the scene
ive always loved this house
its a wonderful place
the truth is i never really imagined i could afford it
the sellers are very motivated now
its a scary decision
i never thought id buy a house alone
but yknow im and i wonder what im really waiting for
home buying is always scary
but i mean with the fire and all especially
its a good size though twenty two hundred square feet
not including the partially finished basement i dont know
im thinking iits a perfect size for should go
i like it i do
but im really concerned about dying in the fire
its a big decision how one prefers to die
would you like to meet my son
derek and scruffily handsome appears around a corner
dereks living in the basement since his divorce
if thats okay
adele sits at the table across from maria
they are drunk and eating nachos
howd it go
maria came over to keep me company and we lost track
im sorry i missed the play
but i got everything done here
howd it go

adele and maria laugh
jesus it is late

are you stoned
i dont know
i mean are you happy with it
love to know what you think
it doesnt matter what i think
its all about your artistic satisfaction caden
caden and olive walk along
caden holds a tax envelope
his face has pustules on it
the gaunt man follows
whats wrong with your face daddy
its called sycosis
spelled differently than psychosis but it sounds the same
i dont know what that means
well theres two different kinds of psychosis
theyre spelled differently
p s y is like if youre crazy and s y is like these things on my face
you could have both though
but i dont
okay pretend were fairies
im a girl fairy and my name is
and youre a boy fairy and your name is teeteree
whats my name again
la ru lee
la ru la
caden and olive are at the back of the long line of people
pretend we fight each other
and i say stop hitting me or ill die
and you say okay but youre fibbing
and you hit me again
they pretend to hit each other
olive makes hissing and roaring noises
you have to stop hitting me now or i will die
pretend youre fibbing
he mock hits her again
now i have to die
pretend you say you dont want me to die
i dont want you to die
compassionate whisper but i have to
but ill miss you
i have to
and youll have to wait a million years to see me again
caden tears up at this and tries to conceal it
and ill be put in a box
and all ill need is a tiny glass of water
and lots of tiny pieces of pizza
and the box will have wings like an airplane
where will it take you
performance in progress
there is now a cemetery on stage
linda biff and other characters stand around a gravesite
caden sits in the audience between adele and maria and his parents
he glances over at adeles stony face
maria is drunk and blurry
lets go mom
ill be with you in a minute
go on charley
i want to just a minute
the other characters exit the stage
claire as linda contaaad talking to the grave i never had a chance to say good bye

it seems to me that youre just on another trip
i keep expecting you

caden adele maria and his parents walk along
i just i dont know what it matters what i think
i loved the story
because your opinion is it was good
it was well done
it was very
oh i thought it was wonnnderful
why were the old people so young
it was a choice dad
pause to adele i cant get excited about but
your restaging someone elses old play
theres nothing personal in it
cadencadenaaas father i put my soul into thati mean they were younger thing

but what are you leaving behind
you act as if you have forever to figure it out
why are you being like this
adele has a coughing fit
im not being like anything
are you seeing someone else
is that your entire frame of reference for relationship problems
i dont know
its a stressful time
the whole health thing
oh youre fine
caden in shorts and t shirt tiptoes past his parents sleeping on the fold out couch
adele sits at the kitchen table with olive
she drinks coffee and talks on the phone
olive eats cereal and watches a cartoon
olive doesnt look away from her show
a cartoon jackal talks to a man who looks like caden
when you are dead there is no time
the world is a timeless rock
caden pours a cup of coffee sits down at the table
i think i might have arthritis
adele continues to talk on the phone
no i know
caden picks up the newspaper
its dated may th
he flips through finds the obituaries and starts to read
adele hangs up the phone looks at the paper
my joints are stiff
who was that
its been three hours since you spoke
caden i think i want to go to berlin with just olive
caden looks up
i think it would be good for us
cadens father appears in the doorway
to adele christ
is this about last night
cadens father smiles nods and exits
caden sits on the bed
can i ask you a question ad
she looks up at him
have i disappointed you somehow
she starts to cry hugs him
i dont know
i dont know what im doing
its just a little time apart
well talk when i get back
everyone is disappointing
the more you know someone
the whole romantic love thing is just projection
i dont know
i love you
i dont know what im doing
well talk when i get back
the room is long abandoned
caden slumps against a wall and stares into space
he starts to cry and cant stop
later caden watches a paint spattered tv
a commercial diffused images of people flying kites having picnics watching sunsets
a shot of caden among them
flurostatin tr allows you to live life when its your turn to face the challenges of chemotherapy
ask your doctor if its right for you
he feels the bumps on his arm which have grown
he writes down fluorostatin tr
he starts to clean adeles studio
later the room is sparkling
no more paint anywhere
caden is on his knees scrubbing the last bit of dirt
he is sweaty and focused
caden neatly groomed leans on the counter chatting with hazel
her crushed dog sleeps on the floor in a box
we should get a drink
i like weird
i like you
he doesnt say anything
i dont want to make you uncomfortable
i just thought it would be a fun diversion
okay i do want to make you uncomfortable
i wish i could

dont get all bent out of shape
the masked dentist probes cadens mouth
to caden some fives this time
keep with the flossing
well see in three months
caden sits across from madeline
caden notices madelines feet in too small shoes
there are visible blisters and band aids on her feet
i think adeles right whenwhat would be real
she says im not doing anything real
im afraid im going to die
they dont know whats wrong with me
i want to do something important
while im still here
that would be the time to do it yes
i have a book that might help you get better
its called getting better
who wrote it
goes to full bookcase looking at titles all of these
i never knew that
she hands caden the very thick book
he flips through it catching words and snippets here and there clairaudience vaginal juices
the echo began
cats eat rats
me who am as a raw nerve
thats forty five dollars
caden finds a website online for madeline gravis
she is touted as one of the foremost psychologists in the world a sought after public speaker advisor to world leaders
her book getting better has sold millions of copies and is translated into fifteen languages
in a box at the bottom is a photo of a smiling caden it reads theater director caden cotard says itll change my life
the dentist probes cadens mouth
the hygienist writes the numbers
to caden im going to recommend a periodontist
hell probably recommend gum surgery
caden is on the phone
his legs are elevated and his pant legs are rolled up revealing swollen discolored calves
im looking for
im sorry i dont speak german
im caden sits by himself in a booth reading the self help book
we must live in the present moment
caden tries to be in the present moment as a women sings about gingivitis on a small stage in the back
how do you know if youaaave got gingivitis
hereaaas an experiment go ahead try this brush your teeth then spit in the sink does it come out red

hazel plops down across from him
she has a smudge of soot on her nose
thanks for meeting me
he points to his nose
she wipes at the soot on hers
god im delighted
thought youd never ask
you did ask right
i didnt want to be alone
you dont look like you feel well
im going through some things

cutting out sugar
i cant really say any more
tell me something else
you tell me something
ive cut out wheat

hazel holds her arm out
caden touches it
what do we do with all this hazel
i dont know
we continue to sort of flirt
you divorce your wife and marry me and i make you happy for the very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear
we call it a day
dont choose the last one
i just said that one for effect

no i suppose not
choosing is not your strong suit
you want to come over to my place cotard
im wont let you off the hook by saying never mind this time
adele is only on vacation
she hasnt called you since she left
youve left countless messages
its been a year
its been a week
stares at him then im going to buy you a calendar
caden rips a cocktail napkin into little pieces
okay just for one drink
hazel smiles and stands
she scoops up the torn napkin pieces and puts them in her purse
scraps for my scrapbook
caden watches her ass as she turns to leave
caden follows in his car
we see him in her rearview mirror peering into her car
hazel hikes her skirt and causally begins to play with herself with her right hand
hazel fixes drinks mixes them with her right index finger
she hands caden one
i really cant drink very much because of my condition
cadens mysterious condition
well have one sip anyway
did you put something in it
would you like me to have
a little love potion perhaps
sure why not
if thats what it takes consider it done
love potion number
caden laughs and takes a sip
she takes a sip of her drink
caden drinks some more of his
does it make you want to kiss me

caden sits there looks at the tax form in front of him goes into convulsions
he manages to grab the phone his hand flopping all over the dial
whats the problem maam
were out of ambulances miss but well send a taxi
please wait in front of your house miss
caden waits on a plastic chair in a dimly lit hallway his beat up suitcase at his feet
he reads a very old vogue and opens to a spread about his wife
she seems glamorous
there are photos of her in berlin her work her flat
she is the toast of the art world
photos of her with two men and also with olive who seems somewhat nazi youth like now
he looks up having forgotten where he was
he grabs his suitcase and follows the nurse down a dismal hallway gurneys against dirty walls empty wheelchairs
skinny man takes a flash picture of caden
nurses drinking coffee out of paper cups eye him
puddles of vomit on the floor
they arrive at the end of the hall
a doctor pokes his head out of a room
he studies a file and doesnt look up
the doctor never looks up from the files
youve had a seizure of sorts
what does that mean
seems to be some synaptic degradation
fungal in origin
autonomic functions going haywire
we dont know but yes
they both sit there in silence for a long while
well get you enrolled a biofeedback program
maybe you can learn some sort of manual override
caden waits in line holding a big wrapped box addressed to olive in germany
caden sits on the couch wheezing and reading a dictionary entry for the word crease
the definition is n
he squirts artificial saliva in his mouth
caden is having periodontal surgery
caden with swollen lower face and bleeding mouth approaches the box office with a gift wrapped box
hazel looks up
the damaged dog barks
be quiet squishy
caden i wont be yet another woman you feel guilty about
thank you anyway
i got like five for christmas
she hands him a calendar
it features photos of adele
adele calender on wall open to march
caden reads getting now
be here now
adele feeds a piece of paper into a fax machine
a fax starts to come in
caden watches as the words appear fuzzy as if there is some interference in the process
olive wanted me to ask you not to read her diary
she left it under her pillow by mistake
glglf n mesr siy
caden lifts the bed pillow and finds a kids diary
he studies it puts it back
theres a knock at the front door
caden opens the front door
a man hands him an envelope
madelines feet are swollen and bloody
so i just got this macarthuroh caden
grant last night
a lot of money
do you know what youre going to do with it
a theater piece
something big and true and tough
yknow finally put my real self into something
what is your reali dont know yet
the self do you think
macarthur is called the genius grant
and i want to earn it
i guess youll have to discover your real self
yeah i mean yeah
oh i wanted to ask you how old are kids when they start to write
could a four year old keep a diary
listen theres an absolutely brilliant novel written by a four year old
by horace azpiazu
little winky is a virulent anti semite
the story follows his initiation into the klan his immersion in the pornographic snuff industry and his ultimate degradation at the hands of a black ex convict named eric washington
jefferson with whom he embarks on a brutal homosexual affair
written by a four year old
azpiazu killed himself at five
he wouldve written so much more had he lived
they developed a method some software to determine what he wouldve written had he lived to ten twenty thirty etcetera
is that possible
any of it
why did he kill himself
i dont know why did you
i said why would you
i dont know
caden paces nervously
he sits on olives bed and jimmies open her diary with a screwdriver
he reads deer diry
thank you for being my new best frend
my name is olive cotard
i am for yers old
i like choclit and caden looks at the toys
my favorite color is pink
can i help you
im looking for a christmas present for my daughter
how about this
the clerk holds up a pink box with a picture of a nose on it
caden sits with hazel
she seems somewhat distant
the idea is to do a massive theater piece
i dont know what it is yet or how to do it but itll come
itll reveal itself
hereaaas what i think theater is itaaas the beginning of thought
the truth not yet spoken
itaaas a blackbird in winter
the moment before death
itaaas what a man feels after heaaas been clocked in the jaw
in all its messiness
and i want all of us players and audience alike to soak in the communal bath of it the mikvah as the jews call it
weaaare all in the same water after all soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions
this is what i want to try to give people hazel
and i want your help
hazel just stares
the food arrives
caden looks at his plate and concentrates
what are you doing
i have to concentrate
so i was wondering if youll help
in your box office
like as my assistant
im not sure i can work with you caden
im kind of angry
i just want to normalize it hazel
i think wed have fun together
he swallows some food then concentrates
she watches him
i miss you
he concentrates some more
she stares at him
its really disturbing
caden beads of sweat on his forehead sits with a large group of actors tom claire and davis from salesman among them
no one speaks
finally caden clears his throat
well start by talking honestly
out of that a piece of theater will evolve
long pause ive been thinking a lot about dying lately
youre going to be fine sweetie
i appreciate that claire but well you are
you poor regardless of how this thing
particular thing works itself out i will be dying
so will you
so will everyone here
and i want to explore that unflinchingly
there is a long silence as everyone looks uncomfortable
we are all hurtling toward death
yet here we are for the moment alive
each of us knowing we will die each of us secretly believing we wont
nobody says anything for a long moment
caden is in bed reading olives diary
germany is wonderful
so many friends here
my new dads are great and handsome
and brilliant directors of theater
caden grimaces in pain for a moment
his mouth bleeds
he dials the phone
leave a message or dont
i havent heard from you so i thought id say hi
he giggles crazily coughs then hangs up embarrassed grimaces once more then dials again
hi claire its caden
i was just thinking about you
um i was calling to say hi chat about today maybe
here you are on my phone
do you maybe want to get a drink or something
its late so yeah
yeah yeah yeah
caden waits in a booth nursing a martini watching people walk in but not claire
after a bit hazel enters with derek from the burning house
shes laughing and doesnt see caden
he slinks back into the booth
they sit at a table not far from caden who can hear their conversation
giggly im just asking
you are so obnoxious
youre so obnoxious
yeah well you find it awfully charming
obnoxiousity is not a word
you dont want to cross me
because you like me so much
i like your obnoxiousity
and my use of the word obnoxiousity
youre delicious in your acquiescence
claire enters looks for caden
she spots hazel first
i knew that
the box office
yes im the box office
how are you
i was supposed to meet caden here
you know mr
yes i recall mr
hazel looks around now too
both spot caden at the same time
he smiles and waves and approaches
this is derek
hows everything haze
its good to see you
awkwardly reunion night
hazel contaaad yes
so well leave you be
derek and i no of course
it was nice take care
caden and claire go to cadens booth
that was awkward
yeah i guess
caden steals glances at hazel chatting animatedly throughout his conversation with claire
he hears occasional snippets
lets talk about our project
im so excited about it
i just think its
i feel like im going to be part of a revolution
i keep thinking artaud
i keep thinking krapps last tape
grotowski for christs sake
i dont know what im doing
but thats whats so
i mean how much prepackaged
theater can we take as a country
knowing that you dont know is the first and most essential step to knowing
i dont know
im proud of you
ptolemy was the first to divide the day into
so tell me what you want from me
from my character
well well build it over time together
find a real person maybe to model it after
that sounds fun
hairstyle called a beaver tail
its a loop of hair
that hazel girl is kind of interesting maybe
as a model
something to think about
although yknow why is she still i dont know
probably not working in a box office at that interesting
theres got to be a storyyeah
well talk there
did she want to be an about it
actress but lacked confidence
you seem distracted
i have these health issues
and the jet it exploded and she was sent plummeting
well we can talk more tomorrow maybe
when i get tired i have to remember to breathe
its a new thing
my autonomic functions are failing
grabbing his hand shh
claire leads caden past hazel and derek deep in conversation heads close together
whitrow says if a mind is regarded to be a memory based process of integration
caden and claire walk
its bitterly cold
they pass a store window advertising a presidents day sale
the female mannequins are dressed as lincoln and washington
caden glances at their star spangled bikini bottomed crotches
my mother died last night
im so sorry
what are you doing out
ugh i couldnt deal with my sisters
its like living in a heironymous bosch painting
well um what happened to your mother if i could ask
i mean god thats an awful thing to ask
i dont mean to its just that im oh this is me
no its okay
slipped in her bathroom
hit her head
it actually split in half
they stop at a small hatchback with a cow painted on it
well it was nice meeting you
did i say meeting
ugh im such an idiot
slip of the tongue is all
i dont know how its freudian
well im sorry about your mother
its claires face contorts into a horrifying paralyzed grimace
what is it
she weeps silently with gaping mouth
caden awkwardly embraces her
she remains stiff
do you want me to drive you home
she shakes her head no over and over
then she looks in at her reflection in the car window
sometimes when i cry i watch myself so i can remember how it looks for future roles
i hate myself
everyone does that
its is there anything i can do
caden sits with claire and a large congregation
she rests her hand on cadens
there she met ralph keene
they fell in love married and soon their first child claire was born
the ministers voice goes under
crying whisper to caden i used to be a baby
im so sorry
i was a baby girl with hair of spun gold the prettiest baby anyone had ever seen
one day the townsfolk who were jealous of my beauty decided to steal me away
curtains drawn the room glows with afternoon sunlight
caden sits on the bed
claire enters naked from the bathroom brushing her teeth and talking
there was a knock at thegod youre beautiful
sits on bed next to him it was a bearded old man
caden can hold out no longer
he kisses her
they fall back on the bed
he kisses her all over as she continues to tell the story
her voice becomes irresistibly melodious
he said to me young lady i have in my satchel a ring
whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the woodland sprites
eyes blurring head spreading her legs lolling breathing her you can have this ring if in you promise me one thing
i have to fuck you
i have anything i whispered in to
caden and claire are having sex now
he said there is one more thing
you must never tell anyone what you promised me
if you do you will die
claire sits on the toilet and pees
so i used my new power to kill all the townsfolk
horrible humiliating deaths
i was reunited with my family
and i lived happily ever after doing only good with my new powers
caden cries and rests his head on her thigh
why are you crying honey
im so in love with you
claire smiles strokes his hair
i have problems claire
im still attached to my wife
i have also i have also feelings for hazel
thats really interesting
i mustve picked that up unconsciously
ive left them behind
ive gone somewhere without them
im guilty of so much
well be fine
youre with me now
well be good
caden and claire get married
caden is saying his vows
there will be no other before you
caden stands in line with a gift wrapped box addressed to olive
the clerks at the counter wear santa hats and beards
actors piled in
claire sits at a makeshift box office
caden circles the action
there are ponderous pauses
id like to buy a ticket
thatll be forty dollars
forty dollars it is
heres your ticket
okay hold it
were not really i think we need to work on your characters individually
we need to investigate to really discover the essence of each being
davis ill start with you
caden walks off with davis
claire chops vegetables
caden feeds a baby
christmas decorations are up
davis ill start with you
theres a difference between favoring me and pretending weve never met
i mean we had ariel i think people know weve fucked
thats not the point
i wouldve guessed you were sleeping with davis
well talk about your maybe you are
i just want character after we get arielto feel what we used to feel
claire sits on the bed and seems almost in a trance
she looks haggard and her cheeks are tear stained
works in a theater box office
she had acting aspirations but lacked the confidence to pursue them
her life is passing by
she is alone
shes old and ugly i think you should pick another subject
other than hazel
i dont feel like theres enough there
claire thinks for a moment
i suppose not
she is limited
theres this single mother who lives downstairs
i find her really deep and sad
i have a small child and no husband
i work long hours as a cashier at a mini mart
sometimes i worry my child will not even recognize me when i come home claire cries like she did when her mother died
check on her
im arriving at something
ariel sleeps in a crib in the corner of the living room
caden sits on a tiny chair thumbing through a magazine
claire weeps off screen
caden sees an article entitled flower girl featuring a photo of a naked olive smiling her body covered from neck to ankle in tattoos of flowers
the article begins ten year old olive wittgart of berlin is the first child in human history with a full body tattoo
caden stares in disbelief
claire pokes her head in
her eyes are red
caden ive made ai have to go find my breakthrough
this woman is daughter
ive got your daughter is right here
my real daughter
my first daughter
ive got to find her
please dont do this to us
revealing massive tattoo on back everyones tattooed
ive never seen that before
you have responsibilities
ill be quick
ill do it quick
its dark most people are sleeping
caden reads getting better
redundancy is fluid
life moves to the south
there is only the now
he sees madeline sitting across the aisle
she is different sexier in make up and a tight dress
when you cancelled it freed me up
so im traveling too
im not sure im getting the book
but its getting you
youre almost non recognizable now
madeline spreads her legs a bit and smiles at caden
he nervously grins goes back to his book
he reads i offer my flower to you and you deny it
this book is over
he turns the page
the rest of the book is blank
he looks over at madeline
she is watching a movie
caden wanders a dirty store front street looking for an address
he finds it
an art gallery
the walls are hung with hundreds of adeles tiny paintings
i dont speak german
i was yes yes
i may help you mister
im looking for adele cotard
we must not give addresses or other personal informations
im her husband
you are not her husbands which is named gunther und heinz
caden sits nursing a coffee
maria approaches and sits down
youre here too
i live with adele and olive and gunther und heinz and uschi and britt
im everyones nanny
i want to see my daughter
they sent me
and who the fuck are they decided its not time to uschi and britt

maria i cant believe adele got her tattooed like that
i mean i did that
olives my project
shes a four year old
shes almost over eleven now
shes my muse
i love her
caden stares at her for a moment then lunges
he punches her repeatedly as she tries to get away
she throws a punch which connects with the side of his head and knocks him down
she hurries off
whatd you do to my family
whatd you do to my daughter
screw you caden
she turns down an alley
caden a half block behind hurries to the alley
he walks through looking for her
trash cans and garbage
he spots an unopened box next to the trash
its pink with a picture of a nose on it
caden drops to his knees and weeps
no tears come out
his eyes are dry and red
he pulls a vial of artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes
suddenly his breathing becomes wildly erratic
caden limps up to the hospital
german words painted on the walls
caden in his underwear lies on a metal table in a cold room while an old man in white military jacket examines him pressing on his body in various places
the man is silent except for slow long inhalations and exhalations through his nose
when he is through he leaves the room without saying a word
caden lies there not sure what heaaas supposed to do
after a while he gets up and opens the door looks both ways down the empty hall
he closes the door sits in a plastic chair and waits
a tube runs from his nostril to a small whirring machine on his lap
a frail old man sits next to him
death comes faster than you think
caden walking with a realtor approaches a warehouse in a very old decrepit and abandoned looking part of town
yeah i want to bring my production to new york
to get it seen
by people you know who matter
the sooner the better
well this theater is centrally located
heart of the theater district
great for plays
very much so
its massive empty old and dirty
caden inspects it while the agent watches from a distance
echoey and far away lots of room for seats over here
its been scrubbed
there are small squared off apartment areas with actors in each going about their days
a couple sleeps in a bed in one in another there is a conversation between people over dinner a man watches television alone in one etc
there are at least fifteen configurations of people with a reel to reel tape recorders in each set up
caden walks from one to the other eavesdropping followed by an assistant michael
to doctor and then he said he couldnt see me anymore
just like that
i dont understand
i mean he just told me two days before how much he loves me
everythings spinning out of control
he stops at claires apartment
she is ironing and watching a daytime soap which is a closed circuit tv
the actors in the soap are across the warehouse in another apartment
williams that was your last patient for the day
jennifer lets stop this charade
i dont know what youre talking about doctor
the chemistry between us is palpable
you and i both know that
its the way god made us
i cant because jerry came back last night
jerry but hes dead
im certain of that because
because what dennis
because im certain thats all
ariel sits in a highchair and plays with a bowl of cheerios
she is about two and a half
daddy is mine
daddy cant play now honey
daddy doesnt live with us anymore baby
he had to find himself
claire shoots daggers at caden and goes back to ironing
nearby tom and davis rehearse their scene in another apartment
i like it but its a little tight in the toe
dont you think
this is how theyre supposed to fit
caden sits in the fluorescent shelter
he looks at a poster for a movie called little winky and caden which features caden in an embrace with a muscular skinhead
the movie is posthumously written by the late horace azpiazu
cadens leg starts to twitch and he goes into convulsions
an old doctor examines cadens shaking leg
i cant argue with further testing
ok youre a doctor right
am i dying
can you tell me that
no you cant tell me
i cant tell you
doctor contaaad you cant tell me if you cant tell me
doctor contaaad no
caden walks along his leg shaking
he spots hazel looking in a store window
he just watches her for a while
she sees him in the store window reflection
i was wondering if i was going to bump into you
she gives him a hug notices his shaking leg
what are you doing here

i have a great job at lens shapers
you wear a lab coat
itaaas so good to see you
i should run
i want to get some shopping in
weaaare meeting back at the hotel at three
good seeing you hazel
hazel smiles and waves and turns to head into the store
caden watches after her
caden watches hazel and her family laughing and enjoying each other on the terrace
the gaunt man sits with them
when they head to the pool caden just continues without hesitation to the edge of the roof and begins to climb over
a passing lifeguard sees caden grabs him and wrestles him to the ground
caden pulls olives journal from under his pillow and reads from somewhere in the middle
with german accent how i love maria
she is so much more of a father than caden ever was with his drinking and unfortunate body odor and rotting teeth
i could only loathe him and perhaps pity him
caden blots his sopping brow and gums sniffs under his arms
caden now walking with a cane approaches an apartment door
theres a sad pilgrim cut out taped to it
i want to come back
i want to take care of you and olive
theres silence then the door opens
claire is crying
i just want you to love us
caden hugs her
ariel hugs cadens good leg
why does you have a canes daddy
caden and claire in bed having sex
the gaunt man stands on the fire escape peering in
ariel watches from the doorway
the phone rings
claire cranes her neck and looks at the clock
the gaunt man and ariel both step out of view
for crying out fuck
caden answers the phone
caden hangs up
claire kisses cadens neck
my father died
his body was riddled with cancer
he didnt even know
he went in because his finger hurt
its okay baby
its going to be okay
let me make you feel better
claire begins kissing her way down cadens chest
they said he suffered horribly
that he called out for me right before he died
they said he said he regretted his life
they said he said a lot of things
too many to recount
they said it was the longest and saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever heard
caden claire and ariel stand with cadens mother as a child sized coffin is lowered into the ground
there was so little left of him
they had to fill the coffin with cotton balls to keep him from rattling around
crowded with mourners
people chat and eat
claire and caden on the couch holding hands chat with a fat lady
excuse me i have to use the bathroom
caden dials his cell phone
hazel is on her phone
i had to talk to you
my father died
im so sorry

hazel please i cant bear it if you go
i have to
im going out
i have to get ready
i need to use a cane now
hazel hangs up
caden sits there
a rehearsal in progress
the shells of apartment buildings have been built
the actors who previously had been spread out on the floor of the warehouse are now perched on scaffolding in various apartment spaces
caden followed by michael surveys the scene by climbing up and down ladders
its difficult to manage with his cane
caden reads olives diary
today i felt a wetness between my legs
maria explained to me now i am a woman
and being a woman is wonderful with maria to guide me
walls are plastered with posters of flower girl
its olive early s very sexy and naked
there is an address and a date
seems to be some sort of concert
caden waits on a long line behind a bunch of men
caden sits by himself in a cramped space
a light switches on behind scarred plexiglas
olive dances naked
caden tries to get her attention by banging on the glass but she cant see him
a bouncer enters and beats caden up
caden bruised lies in bed while claire hurries past getting dressed
get out of bed
the cry of the north american caden
id just like a little sympathy
ill save my sympathy for the eighty million people with avian flu the tsunami victims in puerto rico the countless millennia dead from
how fucked it all is
and since when do you care about anything
i care every day about things
i care about us
why do daddy be sad now
the neighborhood seems abandoned and overgrown
caden is parked down the block and watches hazels house
soon hazel and derek walk by
derek says something and hazel laughs delightedly
caden is in agony
he rolls down his window
hazel and derek turn
caden what are you doing sorry
can i talk to you
hazel kisses derek whispers something in his ear
they share a giggle
derek waves at caden and heads into the burning house
hazel approaches cadens car
tell me what to do
caden everyone has to figure i want you to look at me like out their own life
you used to
oh honey i cant anymore
i screwed everything up
i dont have any courage
i dont want you to be okay
i mean i do but it rips my guts out
ill always be your friend
ill help you through any way i can
ill help you through too
caden im fine
i have derek
caden stands with his cane before the group of seated actors
the actors wait patiently as caden finishes a coughing fit
i wont settle for anything less than the brutal truth
each day ill hand you a scrap of paper
itll tell you what happened to you that day
you felt a lump in your breast
you looked at your wife and saw a stranger
caden when are we going to and im not excusing myself get an audience in here
from this either
i will its been seventeen years
have someone play me to delve into the murky cowardly depths of my lonely fucked up being
hell get notes too
and they will correspond to the notes i truly get each day from my god
the actors glance uncomfortably at claire
she smiles apologetically
hazel sits in her parked car and talks on her cellphone
little kids in costumes walk by
a little girl walks by in a nude body suit with olives tattoos all over it
they fired me
i caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis
i didnt wash my hands
i had pink eye hands
caden sits at his desk talking on his cell phone
i didnt wash my hands
im a stupid cow
i dont have anything to show for being on this planet
and this fucking private christian school is killing us
its not cheap
its dereks thing
i dont believe in that shit
try to be a good person
thats all there is
im talking too much
do you have anything for me caden
um i have an assistant please caden
everything is hazel
and theres no box falling apart
i miss you
there are problems at home
what am i going to do
nobody laughs at my jokes the way you did
the actors are in their apartments living their lives
caden is in the far corner of the space at a little sectioned off area
there are a half dozen actors sitting on folding chairs outside the partition
they all resemble caden except one very tall one
hazel steps around the partition
sammy barnathan stands
he is the gaunt man weve seen following caden
hazel leads him to caden
this is sammy barnathan
i dont have a resume or picture
ive never worked as an actor
tell me why youre here
ive been following you for twenty years
so i knew about this audition
because i follow you
caden hiding is nervousness nods
ive learned everything about you by following you
hire me and you will see who you truly are
caden stares at sammy
sammy stares back
theres fear in cadens eyes but he doesnt drop his gaze
peek a boo
sammy transforms effortlessly into caden
okay hazel i dont think we need to talk to anyone else
this guy has me down
im going to cast him right now
then maybe you and i can get a drink and we can try to figure out this thing between us
why i cried
ive never felt about anyone the way i feel about you
i want to fuck you until we merge into a chimera
a mythical beast with penis and vagina eternally fused two pair of eyes that look only at each other lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself
youve got the part
sammy nods and exits
hazel follows him with her eyes
hes good caden
please dont fall in love with him
i only have eyes for you dear
caden limps with his cane and a backpack toward the mens room door
his eyes are rheumy
he pushes open the door
the room is filthy
the urinals are covered with slime
caden enters a stall pulls down his pants and sits
when he is done he looks at his stool
he wipes and flushes pulls up his pants and exits the stall
sammy stands there
ive never seen your shit gray
sammy jots a note
caden places his backpack on a sink
he looks at himself in the mirror stalling
i know its pill time
you dont need to hide from me
caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills
he takes them one by one
sammy watches and counts
when its over he speaks
youre missing your fosonex
check your bag
caden pulls out books and notebooks and a sweater
the pill falls out of the sweater onto the grimy floor
caden picks the pill up off the floor
its got grime on it
swallow it anyway
go on sweetie
caden looks at sammy and swallows the pill
caden exits the warehouse with claire and ariel who is now five
sammy walks alongside
there is a long line of people waiting to find out about tickets for the show
when is it opening
when its ready
we need to get in
its bad out here
they move on passing poor people waiting in line for food distributed from a military truck
there are sick people being herded into a scary bus marked fun land
the guards wear surgical masks
i was thinking of calling it simulacrum
what do you think
i dont know what it means
can me have a nickel if i doesnt play with my pee pee no more
a hovercraft glides down the street with searchlights
how about the flawed light of love and grief
im not sure
sammy jots something in his book
caden and claire have sex
sammy watches from a chair in the corner
ariel sits on his lap
they finish and caden glances at sammy
caden and sammy watch the city fires in the distance
christmas decorations in windows across the way
claire pokes her head out
im going to work in my journal
you guys need anything
no thanks claire
i want you to drop your study of mrs
caden i want you to play yourself
sammys going to move into your apartment set as me
its just that ive made suchas the vision reveals itself enormous strides as jocelynwe all have to be willing to and adapt honey
itd be my honor to play your husband claire
youre an amazing actress
i saw you in bernarda alba last year at the roundabout
that was a fun play
emotionally tough but fucking fulfilling
and i loved working with so many strong female actresses
ugh lorcas a genius
im going to start thinking about myself
why did we leave adele caden
she left us
you know that better than anyone
amazing artist though
the best living artist
theres no one who stares the truth in the face like she does
a sweet pussy too
caden looks at sammy confused
how do you know that
i read it
anyway i dont know where she is
a strange dirigible flies very low overhead
maybe shes got a sublet in new york
maybe the mets doing a retrospective
he hands caden a slip of paper
why are you giving this to me
i want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself
for the part
dark deserted part of town
the wind blows wet leaves
a kid walks by in a halloween costume looking lost
caden finds the address an old narrow very tall very dark building
theres a piece of looseleaf paper with the handwritten note death in family
god relieve our grief
taped to the front door
he approaches the tenant buzzers and buzzes y
the name on the apartment is capgras
the door buzzes
the walls are panelled with ancient scarred wood
the doors close the elevator ascends swaying and creaking
the doors open on nobody gets on
as they begin to close hold it
hold it please
caden reaches for the door open button but doesnt press it
the doors close and the elevator continues its shaky ascent
the doors open on and caden exits
sound of the elevator descending
caden heads down the long hall looking at apartment numbers
he gets to the end and is only at j
he turns and heads back
the elevator is ascending again
as he passes the elevator door it opens and a very old feeble looking man or woman steps out
i asked you to hold the door
i pressed it butyou didnt press it
i think it was too late
caden continues to walk down the hall
the old person walks behind him
caden looks behind him and smiles awkwardly
have a good night
he picks up his pace trying to be casual about it
he arrives at y glances over and sees the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall
frances i need to go to the clinic
somethings terribly wrong with my nose
caden knocks on y
he knocks again
down the hall the door opens and another old person steps out into the hall
this person examines the first old persons nose
old person squints over at caden
are you ellen
are you ellen bascomb
im to give the key to y to ellen bascomb
yes im ellen
old person fishes a key out of the overcoat pocket
she said you should just go in and get started
she said dont forget to change the sheets
old person turns and heads back down the hall to old person whose nose has started to bleed
caden enters the apartment
an expansive well decorated place
someone was just here theres a steaming cup of coffee on the kitchen table
clothing strewn about
theres a handwritten note on the night table
he reads it hi ellen
be a doll and do the sheets and whatever is in the hamper
your money is under the toaster
bag of stuff in bedroom closet for goodwill
take what you want
caden scrubs the filthy toilet bowl
caden folds laundry and puts it away
he spots the bag of clothing and goes through it
there are several blouses and skirts a red beret and some lingerie
caden exits with bag of clothing
several latina and eastern european cleaning ladies are exiting buildings also
claire is in her bathrobe worried and angry
i went for a walk
i had to think
you smell weird
are you wearing lipstick
what do i smell like
like an old person
i dont know
i dont know
like mold and
like youre menstruating
i dont know
caden is scrubbing himself raw in the shower
the actors are in their apartments and rehearsal is in progress
caden walks along the scaffolding followed by hazel
he hands scraps of paper to each actor he passes then turns his attention to sammy and claire
shes in her underwear and getting dressed
sammy comes up behind her and rubs her ass
i dont like that guy you got to play you
you dont like sammy
i think hes good
i think you need to fire him
caden hands her a scrap of paper
reading then to caden oh fuck you
im forty five years old
i dont want to do this shit anymore
im not firing him claire
hes the best thing in the show
next to you
hes coming on to me
hes feeling my ass during rehearsal
hes your husband
claire turns to the real caden and screams
hes not my godamn husband
what is wrong with you
the actor underneath them pounds on his ceiling
to claire its for the play
were getting at something real here
im going to rehearsal
she grabs her coat tosses the note into the trash and storms out and down the stairs
thats great you guys
sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of paper
hazel hovers behind him watching
caden leaves the set and steps onto his platform
caden time out
i feel we need a hazel in here
theres a whole side of caden im not able to explore without a hazel
caden looks over at hazel
claire watches caden from the street corner
i guess yeah
claire walks off in a huff
i get to be a character
caden rides up
the elevator stops
old person gets on with a big bloody bandage covering his nose
they continue the ride in silence
caden looks at the unmade bed an imprint of a female form in the sheets
he touches it
he gets a melancholy look on his face
he lies on his back in the form
he sees a note on the night table hi ellen
crackerjack job last night
would you do sheets again
we had quite a fuck last night and its musky and gross
caden smells the sheets strips the bed
caden sips coffee at the kitchen table
hes writing a note hi adele
relined the cabinets
just wanted to let you know i won a macarthur grant and im mounting a play which i think is going to be pure and truthful
best caden hesitates for a moment then signs it ellen
caden and hazel watch as claire waits in her bathrobe in the kitchen and sammy enters the apartment
caden what are you doing at night
i have a right to fucking know
ive been going to adeles place
and cleaning it
caden rubs his eyes
do you know what ive given up for you
i i thought i wanted to be just a working stage actress
but yknow im watching all the young girls crowding me out and its theres a knock on the door
sammy just stands there
get the door
sammy opens it
tammy playing hazel stands there
this looks serious
am i interrupting
whats going on hazel
just wanted to tell you the girl playing me is able to start today
thats all we need around here two hazels
ill take that as my cue
tammy closes the door and leaves
maybe you can clean her toilet
maybe i will
its over caden
im not talking to you
claire turns to caden
i didnt say i was going to clean hazels toilet
but you thought it
theres a silence
hazel watches caden closely
i thought it
but i didnt say it
claire packs up her stuff
i got an offer to do needleman in a haystack and im going to take it
i want you out of the apartment
the real one
you can keep this one
claire heads down the stairs
already put out a call for a claire replacement
would you really clean my bathroom
beat sadly yeah
god caden its all so fucked
caden digs in his bag pulls out a sponge gets on his hands and knees and scrubs the floor
caden wearing a pair of magnifying glasses that flip up and down enters a crowded gallery of people wearing similar glasses
the paintings are microscopic
museum visitors use the special glasses to study the paintings
theres a wall inscribed small miracles the paintings of adele lack
biographical info is under
caden squeezes his way to the wall to look at paintings
he sees one of an african female genital mutilation ceremony a woman weeping over the grave of a child a man raping a woman
he comes to a wall titled women i love
he sees a self portrait of adele a portrait of maria a portrait of olive naked and covered in tattoos
then he comes to a portrait entitled ellen bascomb
he steps back for a second unable to look
the people behind him are impatient
finally he flips the glasses and studies the painting
ellen appears to be a chubby year old white woman her mousy brown hair tied back in a kerchief
she is naked and spreading her vulva for the viewer
she has a kind face and what appears to be an appendectomy scar
caden moves boxes
claire sits at the kitchen table with an actor
they are rehearsing lines from needleman in a haystack
oh needleman you had such potential
but iaaam afraid iaaam going to have to move on
just like that
you donaaat give a guy even a chance
iaaam not a chance giving girl
iaaam a fun loving girl
i try to be fun loving
needleman makes a funny face
reba doesnaaat react
my analyst says you have complexes
once you enjoyed needlemanaaas complexes
thataaas before my analyst taught me that my enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non enjoymnent of them
i hate your analyst
she told me your hatred of her is a sign of your latent homosexuality
this is the end of my stuff
caden heads out the apartment door
caden enters the apartment next door and closes the door
its filled with boxes
caden hears laughter coming from next door
he puts his ear against the wall to listen
caden exits crosses the street and looks up trying to see in claires window
he sees her walk by then nothing
caden sits with hazel at a table facing the giant open apartment building structure
an actress plays claire
she sits at the kitchen table of her apartment with an actor playing the actor
they both hold scripts and read from needleman in a haystack
sammy is in front of the building looking up
caden looks troubled
tammy sits to the side of hazel and studies her
every once in a while hazel self consciously glances over at tammy who does not avert her gaze
this is a lie
the actors stop what theyre doing sit with their legs dangling off the edge of their apartments wait for instructions
caden limps off to the set designers office
caden enters the office
will the production designer looks up from his drafting table
wall it up
sammy stands across the street from the walled up apartment building an exact replica of the real one
he looks up at claires lighted window
caden watches pleased
caden hooked up to pumps tries to sleep on the floor surrounded by boxes
he listens to claire having sex next door
he detaches his pumps gets dressed
caden sits on the bed and reads a note from adele good for you with your grant
listen i fixed up the walk in as a sort of bedroom if you want
wed love to have you and you wouldnt have to schlep all the way to queens
just a thought
caden sees an unmade cot in the corner and a few cardboard boxes marked stuff for olive
the olive is crossed out and replaced with caden
the boxes are empty as caden finishes making the bed
the room is decorated in a girly manner
girly lamps and furniture
girly prints on the walls
sammy walking with a cane exits his apartment building set and walks down the street
caden and hazel follow
sammy passes people nods hello to some
he stops at a newsstand and buys a paper
the set seems to go on forever
eventually sammy arrives at a warehouse that looks exactly like the warehouse they are in
inside it looks exactly like the warehouse including a duplicate city set
sammy hands little scraps of paper to people then dumps his pack on the table where tammy sits
hazel and caden watch
how was your night
philip was colicky
i was up all night
caden looks over at hazel for confirmation
she nods slightly freaked out
to tammy sorry
looking at clipboard sammys not here
jimmy called and said theres some subway problem
jimmy rushes into the warehouse
sorry sorry sorry
to tammy sammy likes you
caden looks at hazel
hazel could you get everyone situated
i need to speak to will about some new sets
sammy pulls some polaroids out of his backpack
well take it from june th
sammy nods heads toward the set designers office
i need to do that too
haze keep an eye on things
caden nods rushes out the door of the warehouse set
caden finds will up on some scaffolding working on the set
will i need you to build this
caden hands will shots of the exterior and interiors of adeles building and of apartment y
caden sits at his desk
there are several overweight women waiting on the other side of the partition
hazel ushers one in
shes a ringer for the painting of ellen
hazel what do you think of this title unknown unkissed and lost
caden this is millicent weems
have a seat
how are you at cleaning
im very very good at it
because this part requires a lot of it
youd play a cleaning lady
i played egga the cleaning lady in hedda gabler at the roundabout
dobson in scrub a dub at the pantages
youre weirdly close to what ive visualized for this character
glad to be weirdly close
millicent and caden study each other
caden heads to the warehouse set
he hands paper scraps to shopkeepers pedestrians a guy sweeping the street
good work everyone
nobody acknowledges him
caden enters the warehouse set
tammy sits alone at the card table
theres activity on the street and movement can be seen in various windows
wherere sammy and hazel
tammy jerks her head to the left
caden sees that sammy has hazel with her back against a wall
they are talking intimately
hey sammy what are you doing
sammy and hazel look over casually
im being you
you like hazel i like hazel
this hazel doesnt exist for you
if you want to like a hazel like that one
caden points indicates tammy
sammy squints over
thats what i tried to tellaw no harm no foul caden
its equity break anyway
ten minutes everybody
the actors playing the people on the street immediately stop what theyre doing
actors pour from apartment buildings and shops lighting cigarettes and talking on cell phones
sammy goes off
you dont like him do you
he reminds me of you
you dont need someone to remind you of me
dont worry caden
i like you more
sammys just fun
no youre not
cadens cell phone rings
he answers it
is this caden cotard
this is officer mark mellman of schnectady p
im sorry to inform you your mother has been the victim of a home invasion
a funeral is in progress
caden stands with tammy and his father as his mothers coffin is lowered into the ground
the coffin is banged up and crumbling
lots of mourners
caden sits on the couch with tammy
was my father standing with us
i dont know what he looks like
he looks dead i guess
probably wasnt him then
a little moustache
anyway thanks for coming with me
i asked hazel but she was busy tonight and youre the next best thing
i mean it isnt that youre the next best thing but because you play her it feels comforting
does that make sense
although the thing is offstage youre nothing like her
you play her very well though
did hazel mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasnt going to be back till late and i
thought that was weird because she told me philip was sick
shes going to dinner with sammy
hes supposed to like me
ill have another talk with him
can you excuse me
i need to use the bathroom
caden gets up and turns to leave
dont forget your phone
thank you yammy
caden takes the phone and limps off
caden talks on his cell
what you up to
hazels driving while talking on her cell
in my car
heading to dinner with sammy
why didnt you tell me that before
i dont want to say things that are going to make you sad
it mostly makes me sad that it doesnt make you sad
you want me to be sad that someones taking me out to dinner
i dont know how to do that
i want you to be sad that we had something really special and its going away
it just happened caden
i didnt plan it
you were with claire
this probably isnt going to go anywhere sweetie
im still your girl
its just dinner
hes got stories
it just seems fun
he has stories about me
caden i know everything about you and its all adorable
i love you and i always will
so dont worry
i gotta go im there
hazel hangs up
caden stands there for a minute
the house has emptied out
caden and tammy straighten
did you always want to be an actress
every girl wants to be an actress
is that true
so i figure everyone does
looks like theres been a horrible struggle
the bed is covered with blood
caden and tammy stare at it
i thought someone wouldve cleaned it up
i dont know
its a kids room
caden and tammy stand there
this is my room
you can sleep here
where will you sleep
the living room couch
dont you want to sleep with me
its just sex
if you think its okay
tammy laughs matter of factly gets undressed in front of caden
he just stands there uncomfortably
how can you be like that
i get undressed every day
in front of someone is different
i dont see why
maybe because you have a beautiful body
maybe that makes it easier
i suppose it might
do you want to fuck
itd be fine
caden starts to cry
im very lonely
i dont know whats wrong
i just im sorry
can you understand
do you understand loneliness
yeah i mean i dont know
i feel okay mostly
fucking might help
i dont mind
take your clothes off
youre very pretty
sometimes i wish i were pretty like that
you wish you were a chick
long pause sometimes i think i mightve been better at it
its kind of a drag in a lot of ways
you like guys
i like women
i only like women
well im getting cold
she climbs into bed
take off your clothes
caden does awkwardly and shyly
he then stands there naked
tammy smiles sweetly at him
thank you for saying that
come to bed pretty caden
caden turns off the lights and climbs into the twin bed with tammy
she looks at his face then kisses him
a residential street in schenectady
caden drives and tammy sits in the front passenger seat
what is attractive
how are attractive people treated how do they feel
how do unattractive people feel how are they treated
how do attractive people feel about unattractive people how do unattractive people feel about attractive people
how do unattractive people feel about other unattractive people
how do attractive people feel about other attractive people
how do unattractive men feel about unattractive women
how do unattractive men feel about attractive women
how do attractive men feel about unattractive women
how do attractive women feel about unattractive men
how do old people feel about attractive people
how do attractive people feel about old people
this is my study
caden slows down
thats hazels house
caden points to the house with smoke seeping out the windows
do you think we should have a hazels house on the set for me
it would be verisimilitudinous
i dont know
i have to speak to the fire marshal
it would be very verisimilitudinous if you could
hazel drives a golf cart along a fake highway
caden and tammy sit in back
hazel eyes them in the rearview mirror
they seem cozy
technicians are on the side of the road putting in plants and trees
i think both of you hazels are going to like this
turn off here
hazel rolls her eyes drives down an exit ramp
hazel drives the golf cart down the street in a state of near completion
she stops in front of a replica of her house
the house begins to smoke
tammy kisses caden on the cheek and runs into the house
is there no end to your pussy kissing
im thinking of that as a title
ive got work to do
tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back
shes not my girlfriend
give it a rest caden
i can smell her on your breath
we have to get back
sammy walks down the hall followed by tammy
he stops at various doorways and listens to conversations or other noises within the apartments
they are followed by caden and hazel
jeremy is playing to us
tell him he simply needs to talk to donna
well hear what we hear
tammy takes down the note
sammys explaining too much
needs to be shorthand like jeremy big
hazel writes that down
they all continue down the hall
can we stop for a second
if hazels in love with sammy and cadens in love with hazel there would be a dramatic confrontation where caden turns to me and says its obvious hes a substitute
i think then hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry
im not sure which yet but it feels dramatically sound
that didnt happen caden
i think hazel would do that hazel
but hazel hasnt done it tammy
what do you think
i think we could try it
im going out for a smoke
they watch her go
caden turns back to the others
lets try it
maybe it could happen at the directors table
caden and hazel sit at the directors table
the street life of the play is going on around them
tammy was right
i dont understand why youre with sammy
he fucks me without crying
that happened one time
you fucked him
and you and i only fucked one time thats why you only cried one time
i give you endless opportunities
what do you mean hes available
since when are you available
because of you
how come you never told me
i dont know caden
how come a lot of things
its not like we can start fresh like sammy and i can
theres all this pressure on us
were finally both free and theres all this fucking pressure
i have to let the actor who plays derek go
what is his name
thats such a romantic response
its not my response
it just crossed my mind
we have enormous budgetary concerns here
looking in book derek is played by joe stop okay
i dont like tammy and shes nothing like me
how can you like her
she looks like you
and no she does not
and she offered to have sex with me
was it good
i dont know
it was nice
im just trying to be honest
it was nice
not earth shattering
did you cry
youre making progress
okay i cried a little before
long pause hazel youve been part of me forever
dont you know that
i breathe your name in every exhalation
what the fuck are we doing
i dont know
hazel latches her pinky around cadens
sammy has been watching the whole thing from behind a pillar
caden glances at his watch
crap ellens october rd scene
millicent hazel and caden wait in the elevator
the elevator begins to ascend
instead of a motor the sound of grunting men is heard
the elevator stops short and sways a little bit
caden pulls off a wall panel and sticks his head through
caden looks down the shaft
five guys hold the elevator with a rope and pulley system
whats going on maurice
we have a couple of new guys on and were not in sync yet
are we good to go
caden replaces the panel
the elevator continues its ascent to the sound of grunting men
the elevator doors close
millicent old person caden and hazel walk down the hall
old person knocks on a door which is opened by old person actor version
to millicent are you ellen
are you ellen bascomb
im to give the key to y to ellen bascomb
yes im ellen
old person fishes a key out of the overcoat pocket
she said you should just go in and get started
she said dont forget to change the sheets
old person looks back to old person whose nose has started to bleed
millicent puts the key in the lock
it doesnaaat turn
itaaas the wrong key
it doesnaaat turn
fishes in pockets itaaas the one they gave me
adeleaaas voice iaaam jumping in the shower
make some coffee would ya
to hazel did you hear that
did we hire an adele
iaaam sure i wouldaaave remembered that
the shower turns on
caden grabs the key from millicent
caden youaaare breaking the fourth wall
i get to open the door
he tries to turn the key in the lock
it wonaaat budge
this is the wrong key sandy
caden bangs on the door
adele are you in there
maybe itaaas the wrong key
caden theres no one in there
youve got to let go of her
shes not here anymore
can we just get the right key so we can do the scene
yeah well get the right key
caden and hazel walk past the set of the hotel she had stayed at with her family
oh my god
its an exact replica of the tethered maiden terrace
derek and the kids and i had so much fun on that trip
listen i built this because i wanted to show you what happened after me caden theres no one left to watch you
they look up
sammy stands on the ledge above them
running off theres nothing to talk oh fuck
sammy just stay about hazel
this is not right where you are
no fair sammy
she wouldnt see you jump
she never saw me
youre not being authentic
this is where we part ways
this is authentic
this is what the real caden would do
this is what real love looks like
the actors below scatter
sammy hits hard breaks through the fake cement and is dead
sammy is buried
an enormous crowd there all the actors from the play caden and hazel in front
caden looks at the assembled group from face to face
i know how to do it now
there are nearly thirteen million people in the world
try to imagine that many people
none of those people is an extra
theyre all the leads of their own stories
they have to be given their due
the actor playing sammy is in the coffin
theres an enormous crowd
tammy plays hazel and weeps
a stand in for sammy as caden stands next to her
caden and hazel watch from the directors table
do you see what im saying
hazel has her head in her hands
she looks over at caden imploringly
come over tonight
the smoke is thick and there are flames
hazel in a robe walks around lighting candles
caden unpacks his pumps and monitors and places them next to the bed
we could get a place together
we could get a loft
god caden that sounds nice
i miss my daughter
maybe she could come live with us
i miss olive
and the other one
the retarded one
im a bad person
no youre not
im a badi am
i should never
gone out with sammy
i was just trying to get to you
you cant cause someone to kill himself
he was troubled
im so ashamed of myself
caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder
i wish we had this when we were young
and all the years in between
so many years so fast
what did we do
caden kisses hazels forehead
she coughs and smiles up at him then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips
my heart aches so much for you
were here caden
im aching for it being over
the end is built in to the beginning
what can you do
youre just perfect
im a mess
but we fit dont we
they kiss then hazel climbs into bed
it doesnt always happen for me now
because of the medication and everything
i take a lot of pills
i dont care
climbing into bed im embarrassed
i just want you to know its not you
and its not me
its the medication
they are tender and quiet and intensely focused
the smoke in the room is dense
when its over they lie there quietly with the occasional cough from both of them
caden cries quietly
its different crying this time
i can tell
im crying too
and i cried last time
after you left
i never told you
but i cried too
caden kisses her again
i have a title
the obscure moon lighting an obscure world
i think it might be too much
caden agitatedly paces through the dense smoke
he passes a scrapbook on the table
its open to a page with ripped up napkin pieces glued to it
hes crying hard
theres mumbling quiet conversation coming from somewhere
he walks into hazel lies in bed
a medic hovers over her swabs in her mouth and pulls out cotton black with soot
might be smoke inhalation
caden just nods his head for a long time
he stops at a school crossing as a group of young children are led across the street in front of his car
a young girl with red hair is among them
she looks at caden and he is struck by her resemblance to young olive
suddenly the passenger door opens and maria gets in the car
he glances over at her then looks back out the windshield
olive wants to see you
god knows why the way you abandoned her
oh shut up
shes had a fucked up life with issues thanks to you
shes dying asshole
is that insane enough for you
anyway she wants to say goodbye to you
god knows the fuck why
maria leads caden into the room
olive lies in bed emaciated and pale
maria and olive speak only in german
this is him
ive missed you so much
maria would you leave us
maria kisses olive again on the forehead
in heaven my darling
broken english forgive me but no longer remember english
i had hope you have learned
weakly olive points to a headset on her night table
she pantomimes putting it on
caden puts it on
olive puts on her own
there follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation in an accented male voice of everything olive says with a delay between what caden says and olives response as she listens
im dying as im sure maria told you
the flower tattoos have become infected and theyre dying
so i am as well
this is life
olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos
she did this
maria gave me reason to live once you left
the flowers defined me
your mother and maria took you away
i tried for years to find you
i didnt leave you
you did something
caden is affected by this
i want to talk to you about your homosexuality
im not a homosexual
maria said you would deny it
shes lying to you
i had the same struggle when i first fell in love with maria and we began to have dirty aching sex
maria is your lover
she introduced me to myself
to my vagina and to hers
you have no idea how evil she is
i need to forgive you before i die but i cant forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness
i have no time
i need you to ask for forgiveness
long pause can you ever forgive me
for abandoning you
for abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover eric
for abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover eric
long hesitation no
no im sorry i cannot
dead flower petals slip from her hospital gown
caden sits there
maria hurries rushes to olives side
i hope youre happy faggot
caden gets up and leaves
caden sits on his stoop holding some dead flower petals watching the world pass by
people are sick angry
some people wear gas masks
government vehicles with strange symbols and gun turrets drive by
a woman walks a naked man on a leash
he defecates on the sidewalk
a wild eyed man in a white t shirt and santa hat attacks caden
as he knocks caden to the ground and wrestles with him caden sees the t shirt has a little dot a painting from adeles show
its a moment in time a street scene very much like the one cadens in
in the painting a man in a white t shirt and santa hat beats up a man who looks like caden
the flower petals blow away
caden tries to limp after them
caden dials his cell phone
leave a message or dont
i know how to do the play
itll take place over the course of one day
the day will be the day before you died the happiest day of my life
ill be able to relive it forever
caden weeps inconsolably at the directors table michael the pre hazel assistant is back neat and efficient looking but old now
hazels dog squishy sleeps on the floor
the scene in the play is dull
people walk back and forth aimlessly
various passersby on the street have hacking coughs
tammy steps out of the bathroom meanders over to the directors table
hazels sweater is on michaels chair back
she casually pulls it off and tries it on
she looks so much like hazel now its unbearable
he looks away
millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket
i need a caden for my hazel
id very much like to play caden
tammy watches intently
millicent smiles at her
i know it would be non traditional casting but i think im right for it
i think i understand caden
i dont understand him
caden cotard is a man already dead living in a half world between stasis and antistasis
time is concentrated and chronology confused for him
up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation but now he has turned to stone
that sounds good
i didnt see that at all
i saw it all as more hopeful
caden and michael look at a wig called the director
any thoughts for todays rehearsal
i have a new title maybe
infectious diseases in cattle
the title is about a lot of things
its about a lot
are you gay michael
i dont see what that has to do with anything
do you know someone named eric
caden in director wig and michael watch millicent dressed caden esque sitting at the directors table
tammy in hazels sweater sits next to her
they watch the sammy funeral scene replayed with actors playing tammy playing hazel and an actor playing the stand in for sammy playing caden
tammy has her head in her hands
she looks over at millicent imploringly
come over tonight
id like that
ok take off the sweater
tammy takes off the sweater puts it on the chair back
yes you are
smile shyly at each other
millicent looks over at the funeral scene
its dull and static
this is tedious
this is nothing
millicent touches tammys hand heads over to the funeral scene
she whispers things to some actors has longer conversations with others
whats she doing
shes not getting the feel of you caden
you dont move around
you dont talk to people
its not okay folks lets run it
the scene comes alive with specific activity weeping hazel a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a
distance an old woman with parkinsons fiddling with rosary beads a well dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite
a minister addresses the mourners
everything is more complicated than you think
you only see a tenth of what is true
there are a million little strings attached to every choice you make you can destroy your life every time you choose
but maybe you wont know for twenty years
and youll never ever trace it to its source
and you only get one chance to play it out
just try and figure out your own divorce
and they say there is no fate but there is its what you create
even though the world goes on for eons and eons you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second
most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born
but while alive you wait in vain wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right
and it never comes or it seems to but doesnt really
and so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along
something to make you feel connected to make you feel whole to make you feel loved
and the truth is im so angry and the truth is im so fucking sad and the truth is ive been so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for
just as long have been pretending im ok just to get along just for i dont know why maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery because they have their own and their own is too overwhelming to allow them to listen to or care about mine
well fuck everybody
soon it starts to rain
people pull out umbrellas
caden looks up surprised that such a system is rigged here
caden sits with michael at the directors table and stares into space
the actors are doing what theyve always done milling walking to and fro
millicent holding hands with tammy heads up the walk to the hazels house set
he waves her over
tammy sits on the stoop
it really was
im out of ideas
could take over
for a bit
until you feel refreshed
caden looks sideways at michael remains silent
i think youre tired caden
i think you just need all these years of creative some time
i need to keep my hand in
well ellen needs to be filled
just for a bit
its a choice role
just until youre refreshed
i do like to clean
caden sits on the unmade bed and reads the note ellen olive has died
its a time of overwhelming grief so please forgive my mess i havent been able to get out of bed
much affection a
caden crosses to the window and looks up at the night sky even though its clearly the ceiling of the warehouse
a tiny plane flies by
caden walks down the hall carrying a bag of garbage to the incinerator chute dumps it in and turns back to apartment y
old person actor version is standing there
is your name ellen
caden asked me to give you this
youre to keep it in all the time
old person actor hands caden a small black button
caden examines it
old person actor points to his own ear in which he wears one
caden sticks it in his ear
touched by the sadness of adeles neighbor
so close to death
reminds me of granny
i should really call her
remember how granny bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie
i loved that so much
say thank you to adeles neighbor
pause listens then youre very welcome young lady
now say have a very good day
have a very good day
pause listens then i will indeed
caden lies in bed attached to his pumps
why did he have to get bored with me
everyone gets bored with me
im not very bright
and since i put on that weight i dont get the looks i used to
its not that bad
lots of people have it worse
ive got a job and place to stay
adele is nice to me
and so smart and talented
i dont understand her artwork but thats just me
i wish id gone to college
i feel stupid around educated people like adele
eric was too smart for me too
we didnt talk at all near the end
id try to tell him about my day and hed get this far away look in his eyes
i kind of felt sorry for him he seemed so miserable with me
i guess caden drifts off to sleep
a tenement apartment
ellen in a terrycloth robe is at the stove making scrambled eggs
toast pops from the toaster and ellen crosses to get it
she passes a mirror glances at herself seems momentarily surprised pushes a wisp of hair behind her ear and continues to the toaster
hes an unhealthily thin middle aged man
he doesnt acknowledge her nor she him
he pours himself coffee
im making eggs
is everything okay eric
ellen sits on the bed with a cup of coffee and stares out the window
theres a city park across the street and she watches kids play basketball
she begins to weep
its spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground
ellen why do you look so serious
im going to remember this moment for the rest of my life mama
and in exactly twenty years come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic
baby thats the loveliest thing ive ever heard
ellen lies in bed watching eric sleep next to her
there was supposed to be something else
i was to have something
a child at least
i am always on the verge never more than a tiny shove from tears
i can feel them in my chest now
that squeezing pressure
and it is so tempting to let go but i am afraid the next time maybe i will never stop crying
i miss my husband even though he is lying here
he hates me
i have disappointed him and he hates me
the one person who should be able to see me and he wont look
he will never look again
caden lies on his back and opens his eyes
his pumps drone
quietly mournfully eric
caden looks over
no note from adele
he gets out of bed glances in the mirror seems surprised by his reflection
caden sits on the toilet and pees
he wipes himself
caden vacuums the hall
my period is late this month
i wonder whats going on
i wish it would come
caden lies in bed reading a judith krantz novel
i cant believe she said that to him
shes a slut anyway
he sticks a bookmark in the book puts it on the night table turns off the light and lies on his back with his eyes open
maybe i can ask adele for a raise
its been three years
i do a good job
god im so tired tonight
im getting old
im lonely here
he switches off his pumps
look at the night table for a note from adele
caden gets up and glances at the night table
a type written adele died of lung cancer last night
you may stay on if you like
caden looks shocked then weeps
go into the kitchen and the voice stops
he takes out the earpiece and looks at it shakes it then slips it back in his ear
in the distance he hears wailing and gun shots
the lights are out
caden sits on the bed still waiting
caden sits on the bed his head slumped against the headboard sleeping
distant explosions wake him
he opens his eyes and sits up straight and waits
he taps his ear
the hall is very dark
caden exits apartment y
old person actor stands in the hallway and faces away unmoving
caden walks past and nods
old person does not respond
caden presses the elevator button
theres nobody running it anymore
caden looks at old person and nods
the unfinished back of a facade of the set is apparent
caden walks down endless plywood stairs
the bowels of the building fake water pipes electrical cords
vague daylight drifts in from high warehouse windows from which cardboard has fallen
deadly quiet abandoned
caden passes the occasional body on the street
fires smolder in buildings
the streets are flooded with sewer water
buildings are draped with massive tarps
behind a fence are piles of bodies
he passes the hazels house set burnt to the ground
he arrives at the warehouse set and enters
deserted here too
the same occasional fires flooding dead bodies
caden walks soon arriving at the warehouse set within the warehouse set
another dark deserted street more bodies fires floods
he pulls out his earpiece shakes it and puts it back
he arrives at the warehouse within the warehouse within the warehouse
he gets in a golf cart and drives through the deserted street sets
caden reaches the beach set and drives the cart on the sand
he sees footprints
he gets out and follows them spots a woman ahead walking with a suitcase
he hurries as much as he can with his limp his weakness his ancient body to catch up with her
the woman turns
shes middle aged face radiating kindness
where is everybody
some have left
would you sit with me for a moment
im very tired
the woman smiles at caden
they sit on a log
i feel like i know you
i was the mother in ellens dream
perhaps from there
you seem a bit older than i remember
that dream was quite a while ago
the woman touches his hand
i didnt mean to say you look old
everyones dreams in all those apartments
all those secrets well never know
thats the truth of it all the thoughts nobody will ever know
im sorry the experiment didnt work
i wanted it to with all my heart
i wanted to do that picnic with my daughter
i feel ive disappointed you terribly
i am so proud of you
caden starts to tear up
all i want is someone to see me someone to look at me with kindness
for me to be the most special person in the world to just one person
i know baby
he looks at her tentatively
shes looking into his eyes directly clearly kindly
youre going to be fine
caden starts to weep so hard he chokes
strings of snot pour from his nose
the woman holds him gently takes off his wig and strokes his sparse hair
he looks out over her shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the warehouse
his rheumy eyes light up
i know what to do with this play now
i have an idea
i think the screen goes black fast
