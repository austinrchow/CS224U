screenplay by david mamet shooting draft a working class funeral in progress
thirty people and an inexpensive bier seen from the back of the hall
a mans back fills the screen
he is dressed in a black suit his hands are clasped behind him
another man stands next to him
the second man reaches behind the first mans back and puts a discreetly folded ten dollar bill into his hands
these two men from the front
both somber in their early fifties
they begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor
a woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences
the two men approach her
the first man the recipient of the money speaks mrs
dee this is frank galvin a very good friend of ours and a very fine attorney
its a shame about your husband mrs
the widow nods
i knew him vaguely through the lodge
he was a wonderful man
shakes head in sympathy it was a crime what happened to him
if theres anything that i could do to help
galvin removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money
i want you to have it
she takes the card
thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time well
he shakes her hand and moves on
galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat
reading a section of the paper
he picks up his teacup drinks
lowers it to the table
galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea
his hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table
he moves his hand to the paper open at the obituary section
we see several names crossed out
he circles one funeral listing
galvin sitting raises cup of tea to his lips
looks around deserted coffee shop
galvin outside a second funeral home
working class people entering galvin enters the home
galvin coming down the aisle toward the front shrugging himself out of his overcoat he approaches the bereaved widow sitting by the front of the home he extracts his card
from his pocket starts to speak
he is stopped by the widows son a hefty man in his mid forties who interjects himself between galvin and the widow
of the card what is that
what the hell is that
i was a friend of your fa
you never knew my father
hits card out of galvins hand you get out of here who the hell do you think you are
the funeral manager hurries down the aisle and starts extricating galvin from the commotion
to funeral manager im talking to this man

he is manhandling galvin toward the back of the funeral parlor
the son calls after him who the hell do you think you are
the funeral manager and galvin standing in the cold
i dont want you coming back here

i was just talking to
those are bereaved people in there
the funeral manager gives galvin a small shove and goes back to his post at the door greeting the entering mourners
galvin the ground cut out from under him
standing watching the mourners enter
galvin walking down a residential street
he has been walking a while in the cold snowy night
he stops for a stoplight at a corner waits for the light although there is no traffic
lights a cigarette
the light changes
he looks both ways and irresolutely starts across the street
he checks his watch
he sighs and starts back in the opposite direction
galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking mans establishment three drinkers acquaintances standing around him appreciative
pat says mike

the bartender jimmy comes up to galvin
gestures to include group everybody
mike says pat you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer and then you go in the back and get laid
mike says pat

pat says no but my sister has
gestures to jimmy everyone

the seedy disorganized small office galvin in shirt sleeves opening a file cabinet
he takes out an armload of files carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in
he sits on his desk as if exhausted by his effort pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass downs the glass
he has been drinking for some time
he starts stumbling back to the file cabinet
on the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall
he stumbles to them picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in
he goes back to the file cabinet the phone starts ringing
galvin lets it ring continues emptying the files into the wastebasket tearing some of them up as he does so
he repeats softly to himself as a litany it doesnt make a bit of difference it doesnt make a bit of difference
he starts back to the desk for the bottle knocks the still ringing phone off the desk
he pours himself a drink
as he downs it we hear softly from the phone on the floor a mans voice
are you there
galvin pays no attention
drinks his drink and gazes at the wall now empty of degrees
the empty wall
the telephone heard voice over insisting frank
mickey morrissey a man in his late sixties dressed in suit and overcoat looking worried unlocks the door to the dark anteroom
sees something in the next room
galvin asleep on his couch clothed as before
covered in his overcoat the bottle and glass next to the couch on the floor the sound of the phone off the hook
mickey walks into the office

galvin surveys the anteroom opens door to corridor scotch tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the door
dark paneling clean simple
a drinkers bar
old bartender and three customers spaced widely galvin in his overcoat downing a shot the file open before him
he is reading
he checks his watch scoops the file together under his arm throws a dollar on the bar and heads for the door
galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home
he receives suspicious looks from the attendants
he is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file
he finds the correct door and enters
the door to the ward from the inside
galvin opening the door to the dark ward backlit tentative a little unsteadied from his drinking
he puts his back against the door puts down file and briefcase extracts a small cheap polaroid camera from the briefcase readies it to shoot picks up his paraphernalia and
starts off down the ward
as he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed
galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart
the chart held by galvin
deborah ann kaye various medical notations
he lowers the chart and we see in the bed beyond it a shriveled tiny form stuck with needles and tubes
galvin replaces the chart puts his file briefcase etc
on the foot of the bed takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed
takes another one
puts down camera sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form
he lights a cigarette and sits looking at her
a mousy woman in her forties is standing by a door on which is written frank p

the door to the corridor opens and dick doneghy a workingman in his forties comes into the room
sally and galvin stand

deborah ann kaye
they walk hurriedly through a hospital corridor to an exit door and down concrete stairs
they called theyre going to settle what i want to do is build up as much
the archdiocese called they want to settle
and youre going to do that
surprised of course yes
youre going to settle out of court
gruber stops at the bottom of the stairs beside an exit to the outside
its a meaningless question to him as if to a child uh
in the well in the interests of her family
gruber you know you can never tell what a jury is going to do
catherines a very well thought of institution
glances at watch impatient her doctors killed her
a beat im sorry
her doctors murdered her
they gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life
a beat her doctors murdered her
do you know who her doctors were
i read the file
marx and towler
i know who they were
the most respected
smiling whose side are you arguing
i thought that you wanted to do something
i dont have any interest in the womans estate no offense but we all know where the moneys going to
i have an interest in the hospital and i dont want those bozos working in the same shop as me
they gave her the wrong anesthetic
they turned the girl into a vegetable
they killed her and they killed her kid
you caught em
now how many others did they kill
gruber discards end of a cigar
takes a leather case from his suede jacket extracts a new cigar
offers one to galvin

galvin takes one absently
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of

the case with anyone
and ill meet you tuesday and well go over your testimony
they stop before a s very beautiful small mercedes sedan
gruber opens the door gets into the plush red leather interior starts car leaves door open still talking to galvin
galvin scribbles information in his appointment book
thats perfectly all right
beat uh why why are you doing this
thinks a second to do right
isnt that why youre doing it
galvin is at the bar smiling to himself
his drink is being refilled
to bartender i want to buy you a drink
galvin looks around
a very attractive self possessed young woman is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items with a felt
galvin speaks to her would you like a drink
she looks up
id like an apartment
settle for a drink
she gestures at her own full glass in front of her
i had a very good day today
beat smiles downs drink gets up off the stool sincerely im glad you did
youre very welcome
he watches her as she leaves the bar
he turns back to his drink
well well well
sighs its a long road that has no turning
thats for sure frank
a shoddy one and a half room bachelor apartment
galvin beer and cigarettes on the table beside him
he is sitting on an armchair in the bedroom
a yellow legal pad in his lap
he is talking on the phone softly soothingly
im going to the archdiocese tomorrow at two
i know you dont
i know you dont
no youre just following your life
you have a life too
you have to move out west
it doesnt help you to stay here
im sure she knows you care for her
his attention wanders to the legal pad in his lap
the legal pad
spread on it a couple of polaroids of deborah ann in the nursing home
below them written on the pad large dr
chief anesthesiology mass
they killed her
and they killed her kid her doctors murdered her
the following figures are written on the pad
written very large circled crossed out
similarly circled and crossed out
circled many times
voice over on phone well
finally were none of us protected
we just have to go on
to seek help where we can
and go on
i know that you love her
i know youre acting out of love
into phone as soon as i know
you give him my respects too
not at all
not at all
beat well bless you too
he hangs up phone sighs
lights a cigarette
rotates his neck to loosen it up
reaches to the table next to his bed for the bottle to pour a drink
his hand reaching for the bottle
on the table the photo of a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame
she is the same woman we saw earlier in the news clip
she is on the deck of a sailboat laughing
a pile of change on the table a money clip a rosary and the wedding ring in the pile of change
galvin looking at the photo in the silver frame next to his bed
he sighs deeply
reaches up to the lamp above his head and turns it off
he sits stiffly in the dark a moment then lets his head fall back to the chair
galvin spruced up a bit sitting on a bed his briefcase on his lap
gazing at the unseen deborah ann kaye in the dark ward
he looks in his briefcase takes out a file
the file labeled deborah ann kaye
galvin extracting the photo of the young mother romping with her two children he takes the yellow legal pad from his briefcase and puts it on top of the picture
the figures crossed out her doctors murdered her etc
we hear the door to the ward open and two irish women gossiping
jimmy i said dont you go in your pocket if theres nothing there
and what did he say
spies galvin her tone changes sir you arent allowed to be in here
galvin sitting on the bed looking at deborah ann
he looks up to the speaker
a slovenly irish nurse who has come into the room and is standing by him
the other nurse is framed in the doorway
galvin is lost in thought
you cant be in here
as if remembering something simply im her attorney
the bishop from the waist up sitting behind his beautiful desk
compassionately its a question of continuing values
catherines to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community
so we have a question of balance
on the one hand the reputation and so the effectiveness of our hospital and two of her important doctors and on the other hand the rights of your client
galvin seated across from the bishop
a young priest seated discreetly attentively across the room
sherry glasses in front of galvin and the bishop
galvin drinking from his
a young woman
in her prime
searches for a word life
its a tragic accident
galvin has been dreaming
nothing of course can begin to make it right
but we must do what we can
we must do all that we can
he gestures to the young priest who crosses the room extracts a sheet from a file folder and places it before galvin who is sitting as if in a dream
the bishop waits a beat not wanting to interrupt galvins reverie then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper
galvin glances down
the sheet i frank p
galvin duly appointed conservator for deborah ann kaye in consideration of two hundred ten thousand dollars
paid in hand to me this day by st
catherine laboure hospital do hereby release from any and all claims
galvin and the bishop as before
galvin finishes reading looks up
we must try to make it right
bishop nods discreetly to the young priest who extracts mount blanc fountain pen from his pocket holds it out to galvin
its a generous offer mr
beat nothing can make the woman well
but we try to compensate
to make a gesture
how did you settle on the amount
we thought it was just
you thought it was just
because it struck me how neatly three went into the amount
two hundred ten thousand
that would mean i keep seventy
that was our insurance companys recommendation
it would be
nothing that we can do can make that woman well
and no one will know the truth
what is the truth
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life shes in a coma her life is gone
she has no family she has no home shes tied to a machine she has no friends and the people who should care for her her doctors and you and
me have been bought off to look the other way
we have been paid to look the other way
i came in here to take your money
beat i brought snapshots to show you
so i could get your money
to young priest waving away document i cant take it
if i take it
if i take that money im lost
im just going to be a rich ambulance chaser
beat pleading for understanding i cant do it
i cant take it
if we may discuss money mr
how is your law practice

galvin determined coming down a corridor in the courthouse opens a door
camera follows him in
the lawyers room
ten or twelve ambulance chasers waiting for clients
they all look up as he enters then return to their reading phones card games
camera follows him to the corner of the room where mickey morrissey is playing gin with a crony
i have to talk to you
what do you want
dragging him up come on
lets get a drink
sighs to partner dont touch anything
galvin leads mickey out of the room
mickey and galvin silhouetted against a window at the end of the dark corridor arguing

a young attorney in shirt sleeves and vest racing through a huge ultra modern ultra successful legal office
the office is near empty
a couple of secretaries are at their desks a couple of lawyers in their cubicles
the camera follows the attorney tearing through the corridors of the office up a spiral staircase through yet more office space into a conference room
mahogany tinted glass a panoramic view of boston
twenty five attorneys male and female mostly young gaze at the young attorney as he enters the room
he stops running
he approaches the front of the room tentatively
standing at the blackboard in front of the conference room is edward concannon
senior partner of the firm late fifties imposing he radiates success
as the young attorney approaches concannon he is stopped with a gesture
concannon addresses the room
smiling anybody ever hear for want of a shoe a horse was lost
whos going on vacation tomorrow
a young man raises his hand
is that right
to secretary taking notes at the side of the room send mrs
friedman a dozen roses tomorrow morning please sal
i tell you what send her a sunlamp
smiles there is laughter from the room to friedman sympathetic im sorry but youll have to stay
no vacations till this thing is cleared
concannon motions to the young attorney who has run in
the young attorney goes to concannon and hands him a box of chalk
concannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard jan
he underlines it heavily
our court date is january twelfth
youre all acquainted with this case
its been scheduled for eighteen months
we have the attorney for the plaintiff frank galvin and i trust you are all familiar with his record and we have been expecting him to call us to negotiate
as he did not and five days before were supposed to go to court we made him a rather generous offer which he refused
five days before the trial
what does this mean
i want to find out
writes on the blackboard research writes homework acquaint yourselves again with the depositions
dont rely on the fact that we did it last year
do it again
were going to review them here and you do it at home

tuesday evening sir
concannon writes on blackboard public awareness
i want an article in the globe as soon as possible st
neighborhood giant serving the community etc
weve got it in the files
i want something in mondays herald our gallant doctors something
be inventive i want television
nods toward one of the young lawyers talk to our man at gbh
and to belabor the obvious for a moment
beat our clients are the archdiocese of boston st
catherine laboure hospital and drs
marx and towler two of the most respected men in their profession
the thrust of this defense will be to answer in court in the press and in the public mind to answer the accusation of negligence this completely not only that
we win the case but that we win the case so that its seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity
beat all right
lets get the cobwebs off
the young lawyer stands as concannon sits listening
please turn to your page four
all the lawyers in the office turn in their files to that page
were going to start with a review of the depositions of the operating room team the nurse anesthetist the scrub nurse the
galvin and mickey at a library table piled with books
a dingy dusty law library
they are smoking speak in undertones referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them
who have we got
weve got her sister
testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital
this is the point

admittance form is wrong

sisters testimony is no good
jury knows we win she gets the cash

they are both smoking cigarettes intent on each other
both a little drunk
the weak the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them
isnt that the truth

galvin motions another round to the bartender
beat thats why the court exists
the court doesnt exist to give them justice eh
but to give them a chance at justice
and are they going to get it
thats the point
is that they might
you see the jury wants to believe
theyre all cynics sure because they want to believe
i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case

and every one of them its written on their face this is a sham
there is no justice
but in their heart theyre saying maybe
beat maybe i can do something right
and is that what youre going to do
a beat is that what youre going to do
thats what im going to try to do
the bedroom dark sound of people moving the bedside light is flicked on
we see galvin in shirt sleeves holding a whiskey glass a little unsettled turning on the light laura with a glass also a bit unsteady standing beside him

the courthouse across the street
galvin glances at bar clock
the clock reads
galvin downs his drink picks his briefcase off of the bar and starts for the door
judge sweeney a florid man in his sixties sitting in shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on a tray talking conspiratorially with ed concannon who is

he enters the room
camera follows him as he sits next to concannon
why is that

concannon smiles and extends his hand
shaking his head frank galvin
weve met before
as the judge starts to speak galvin cannot help looking at concannon out of the corner of his eye
lets do some business
concannon brisk expensive looking tanned huge gold watch custom made suit
they tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal
concannon feels galvins eye on him half turns smiles
now have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother
this is a complicated case your honor
im sure it is frank and let me tell you something
if we find it so complex how in the hell you think youre going to make a jury understand it
smiles at galvin see my point

how can i be merciful and still be just
and i know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped
to judge correctly

two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us
and with those two respected men we have my client deborah ann kaye

you youre available for that
when youre paid to be there
when a thing is wrong
as in this case i am available
i am seventy four years old i am not board certified
i have been practicing medicine for forty six years and i know when an injustice has been done
do you indeed
ill bet you do
well save the court the time
we will admit the doctor as an expert witness fine
in undertone to bailiff do we have time this morning to
glances at watch bailiff nods to him all right
galvin you want to continue now or we can resume with dr
thompson this afternoon
rising thank you your honor ill continue
did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility
the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records
patronizing i believe thats the law
is it not mr
from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy six
in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye
during delivery her heart stopped
when the heart stops the brains deprived of oxygen
you get brain damage
that is why shes in the state shes in today
towlers testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes
in your opinion is his estimate correct
its my opinion it took him much longer
theres too much brain damage
the judge leans over
thompson are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice
he has shouted unconsciously the whole courtroom turns to look at him
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way
id just like to get to the point mr
lets not waste these peoples time
answer the question mr
would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence
in that small context i would have
i would have to say no
then youre saying theres no negligence based on my question
given the limits of your question thats correct
the doctors were not negligent
the judge shrugs meaning well then what in the hell are we doing here
the judge and witness
the witness starts to step down
galvin strides over to him and speaks to the judge
im not through with the witness your honor
with all due respect if you are going to try my case for me i would appreciate it if you wouldnt lose it
the judge stands furious
i think thats enough for this morning
ill see the plaintiffs counsel in my chambers
the courtroom rises
the bailiff is heard all rise court is adjourned until one oclock
galvin furious standing against the wall
the judge comes in from his own entrance shucking his robe
i got a letter from the judge advocates office on you today fella youre on your way out
they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case
now this is it today
im an attorney on trial before the bar
representing my client
my client do you understand
you open your mouth and youre losing my case for me

im going up there and im going to try it
let the jury decide
they told me sweeney hes a hard ass hes a defendants judge
i dont care
i said the hell with it

ill take my chances hell be fair
galvin is pacing
conciliatory galvin look many years ago
and dont give me this shit i was a lawyer too
cause i know who you were
you couldnt hack it as a lawyer
you were bag man for the boys and you still are
i know who you are
beat barely controlling anger are you done
damn right im done
im going to ask for a mistrial and im going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case
im going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass
you arent going to get a mistrial boy
were going back this afternoon were going to try this case to an end
now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail
galvin walking down the corridor having just come from the judges chambers
sally doneghy comes up to him
what does it mean
i mean we you have other tactics
they they present their side and i get the same chance
to cross examine
are we going to win
beat desperately needing to trust we have you know other tactics though
galvin turns to the open door to the courtroom through which the spectators are reentering for the afternoon session
mickey is standing by the door he catches galvins eye
they look at each other a moment
towler on the witness stand
concannon walking away from him
no further questions
galvin at the plaintiffs table hastily scribbling notes he looks up
gets to his feet walks over to dr
towler in the witness box the camera moves with him
you have a record of what happened in the operating room
yes thats correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
of the procedures
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop
consults notes four and one half minutes after deborah ann kayes
we we were rather busy
four and one half minutes after her heart stopped
beat and they resume seven minutes
as ive said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes
beat we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes
beat controls himself wed gone to code blue we were administering electro
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat
to get her heartbeat back
weve touched on this his own witness has said
overriding him almost nine minutes
causing brain damage
brain damage could have been
it didnt necessarily take nine minutes it could have been caused in two
wait wait wait youre saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes
and why is that
because she was anemic
beat its right there on her chart
her brain was getting less oxygen anyway
galvin is struck dumb
he has just made a terrible error
he looks at mickey
mickey looks at galvin
he shakes his head sadly
the last of the spectators coming out of the court
galvin and dr
thompson are standing there
i didnt do too well for you
no you did fine
im afraid thats not true
beat will you want me to stay on till monday
no thank you doctor
you go home
sometimes people can surprise you
sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
they shake hands
thompson walks off
you sure you dont want me to stay on
you go home
mickey walks out of the courtroom arranging papers in his briefcase
im going back to the office
he walks off leaving galvin standing there alone
laura comes out of the courtroom
tentatively she looks around
comes up to him
laura and galvin walking
is it over
what are you going to do
i dont have a goddamned idea
what do you do when you dont have a witness
reciting a catechism dispiritedly you use their witness
i think we tried that
the case is over
galvin continues pacing
he will not hear what was just said
and how the fuck
you broke the first law that they taught you in law school
you never ask a question you dont know the answer to
beat frankie wake up
you got your own expert witness says there was no negligence
therell be no other cases
galvin turns on him animal like
there are no other cases
this is the case
beat now you decide
beat are you in or out
soft dim lights
concannon sitting on a couch
he holds a red backed file document
his listener is unseen
i know how you feel
i know you dont believe me but i do
im going to tell you something i learned when i was your age
i had prepared a case
white asked me how did you do
beat i said ive done my best
he said they dont pay you to do your best
they pay you to win
beat thats what pays for this office
beat and thats what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor
and for the kind of law that you want to practice
and thats what pays for your clothes and my whiskey and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy
beat as were doing tonight
beat were paid to win the case
laura sitting across from him impassive
you finished your marriage
you wanted to come back and practice law
you wanted to come back to the world
he hands the red backed document to her
stamped concannon barker white
a lonely middle class hotel corridor
laura tired enters the corridor from the side and proceeds away from the camera
the camera follows her to her door
she stops takes out her key tiredly opens the door
laura opening the door looks down sees something bends down to pick it up
a hotel envelope the hotel lincoln boston mass
on the letterhead
lauras hands open the message take out a sheet of yellow legal paper
laura closes the door behind her she does not turn on the light walks over to a couch by the window sits down all the while reading the paper by
the outside light
she lowers the paper to her lap
the legal sheet
it reads handwritten laura
im going to try

mickey on his feet pacing
galvin at a blackboard on which is written dr
why doesnt mary rooney testify
mickey shakes his head
are you with me

rooneys protecting someone
who is she protecting
shes protecting the doctors shed be up there on the stand

galvin flips through his notes
you guys are a bunch of whores
you dont care who gets hurt
you dont have any loyalty
one of the other nurses
theyre all testifying
everybody who was in the o
s going to take the stand
who wasnt in the o
what difference can that make
he starts checking the charts
this is useless
the admitting nurse
what did she do
she didnt do anything
she took the patients history and signed the charts
looks in the notes for what the initials signify kathy costello
explaining how old are you how many children
when did you last eat
mary rooney and another nurse walking down the corridor carrying foil covered dishes of food chatting
galvin watching them from behind a corner
the nurses come to the corner galvin walks past
beat i understand what you are doing

he nods starts off in the direction he was going in

galvin turns confused
goes back to her
about kathy costello

mary rooney motions the other nurse to go away
she steps closer to galvin

credulous she did
i just saw her

it occurs to her that shes been duped as galvin starts off hurriedly down the hall
seen from the back walking down the corridor
camera follows her
she stops outside galvins door
we see she is carrying a tray of coffee containers
she opens door
camera follows her into the office
mickey is on the phone in the vestibule galvin is on the phone in his office
he is just hanging up
laura starts distributing coffee
galvin shouts to mickey in the far room

she nods to herself picks up her coat off the couch in the anteroom and starts down the hall
going through the door she turns looks back
galvin in the inner office on the phone
he looks up
sees laura gives her a half smile
near the cash register of an all night diner in the business district the deserted streets outside
laura standing next to a wall phone exhausted
she is handed a cardboard tray with three coffees on it and two packs of pall malls and some change by the proprietor
she takes the change and turns her head to look at the telephone

he hangs up
reaches for a bottle of whiskey on his desk
pours a shot into a glass
his attention is caught by something across the room
laura asleep on the couch covered in galvins overcoat
galvin looks gratefully at her
he begins dialing the phone
a small bundle of mail is pushed through the vertical slot and falls to the floor
galvin asleep with his head on his desk
mickey asleep in a chair
laura asleep on the couch covered with galvins overcoat
galvin wakes up startled by the sound of the mail dropping
he picks up the phone mechanically
he realizes it is morning and he has been asleep
he replaces phone
he surveys the office
he closes the phone book
he reaches in a pack of cigarettes on the desk
it is empty
he roots in the ashtray for a long butt
this disgusts him
he rejects it
rubs his eyes
goes to the window stares out
looks back at the scene in his office
it is over
he stands by laura and looks down at her he looks at mickey
he has let them down
he goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass
he walks into the anteroom
sighs sits on the couch near the door
glances at the several letters that have just fallen through the slot
he pours a half tumbler full of whiskey and drains it
he refills the tumbler
he absently picks up the mail and starts mechanically sorting through it
he stops at an official looking piece
the letter return address massachusetts bar association
he lethargically opens the letter
on bar association letterhead it reads you are directed to appear on january th to show cause why you should not be disbarred
you are permitted to be represented by counsel of your choice and
galvin reading the letter
he crumbles it and throws it into the wastebasket
he looks at the next letter and skims it into the wastebasket
he looks at the next letter and stops
it is a phone bill
galvin hurrying up the steps of the tenement
camera follows him into the vestibule
it is mary rooneys tenement
he stops by the mailboxes bends over to read the names
the mailboxes swoboda murch m

mickey has gone over to lauras purse
opens it rummaging
comes up with a pack of cigarettes
he sees something in the purse
the open purse
the red backed legal form
the letterhead reads concannon barker white stamped huge across it in black confidential
mickey takes out the form turns page
it reads report on joseph galvin lists haunts habits and is heavily notated in various types of pen and pencil

two very young children walk across a play area
the door to the play area opens and joe galvin in overcoat comes in
he looks around the room starts to walk across it
camera pans with him to reveal a woman kathy who is comforting a crying child
galvin walks over to her
stands a respectful distance away
she sees him watching her looks up

ive been meaning to come in a long time

gestures back at the office vaguely mrs
very serious correct i used to be a nurse
thats a wonderful profession
my daughter in laws a nurse
what did you do stop
kathy is lost in thought
this is obviously a very painful subject for her
galvin getting involved in a serious conversation takes off his overcoat he is going to stay awhile
how come you stopped
she is traumatized by the question
the casual conversation has become immediate and painful
she opens her mouth to speak then stops staring at galvin
he doesnt know what she is staring at
something on his jacket
he looks down
the shuttle ticket boston new york stuck in the lapel pocket of galvins suitcoat
kathy and galvin
she realizes why he is there
she starts to cry quietly
beat gently dropping his pretense will you help me
the restaurant fairly deserted after the lunch crowd
empty tables crisp linen laura alone at a table watching the door an untouched cup of coffee in front of her
the doorman opens the door of a cab
mickey morrissey standing in an alcove under the marquee looking out at the street
joe galvin comes walking hurriedly smiling down the street
mickey starting down the steps intercepts galvin
galvin looks up surprised
what the hell are you doing here
we got to talk
he is moving galvin off down the sidewalk away from the hotel
camera stays still and their voices get fainter as they move away
what are you doing in new york
come on well get a cup of coffee
they continue walking
we cannot hear them
galvin is becoming agitated
he stops mickey stands there mickey very sad galvin incredulous talking to him
galvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the hotel
long shot of laura seated at a table alone
galvin at the entrance to the restaurant looking at her
he walks over to her slowly
laura looks up sees him smiles
her smile fades she sees that he knows
laura getting up from the table
we see her back and galvin approaching
we see her shoulders droop beaten
he draws closer
galvin comes up to her his face a mask of pain and confusion
she sighs starts to speak
they look at each other he starts to speak cannot
he knocks her to the floor she upsets the table
a large man at the next table starts to restrain galvin
as if in shock its all right
its all right
its all right
its all right
galvin and mickey seated next to him flying home in silence
mickey smoking a cigarette
galvin stone faced beat
i talked to johnnie white at the bar association
beat the broad used to work for one of concannons partners in new york awhile ago
beat lamely she wanted to move to boston
beat how badly did she hurt us joe
i dont know
we got a mistrial you know
joe did you hear what i said
i dont want a mistrial
the doorway to his study
a basketball game dimly seen in the half light
hes not here
i dont know when
pause all right
sound of him hanging up a telephone
he enters the frame carrying a bottle of booze goes through door into study
the knicks are pressing hard
he sits on a sofa opposite the television
watches the game a beat
opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large shot into the almost empty glass in front of him
looks to his left
reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf takes one down pours drink into the new glass leans to his left camera moves with him and we see galvin
sitting in a deep leather armchair staring
mickey offers him the drink
galvin becomes aware of him shakes his head no
mickey moves back into his seat they both stare at the television
half full of spectators
galvin gets up from plaintiffs table takes up a large book as dr
towler takes the stands
he reads dr
towler page contraindications to general anesthetic
ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic
does that sound familiar
i wrote it
galvin shows the book
practice and methodology in anaesthesia
general textbook on the subject
is that correct
and you wrote that
reading page if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will
aspirate food particles into his mask
is that what happened to deborah ann kaye
she aspirated into her mask
she threw up in her mask yes
but she hadnt eaten one hour prior to admission
if she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anesthetic
the type you gave her
would have been negligent
it would have been criminal
but that was not the case
galvin signals he is done
the judge signals dr
towler to leave the stand which he does
nothing further your honor
to bailiff katherine price
the bailiff calls out her name
kathy at the back of the court coming down the aisle
as she passes the defendants table towler grabs marx and starts whispering frantically
concannon looks on ignorant of what is happening
we hear dr
towlers oh my god
galvin surveys the courtroom kathy crosses in front of him takes the stand we hear the bailiff administering the formula as we watch galvin turn and look at the jurors
state your name please
katherine lynn price
dyou swear that the evidence you are about to give will be the truth the
the bailiff swearing in kathy
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
kathy sits the bailiff retires galvin walks over to her
you were the admitting nurse at st
catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth nineteen seventy six the night deborah ann kaye was admitted
galvin holds up a form
you signed this form
she looks closely at it
these are your initials k
thats my maiden name
dyou ask the patient when did she last eat
what did she say
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital
and did you write the numeral one down on the record standing for one hour
a single hour
galvin walks away from the witness box
he looks at the jury
he turns to look at the spectators
his thoughts are a million miles away
unconsciously he straightens his tie
galvin in front of the dead still courtroom
he breaks his reverie
to concannon your witness
concannon is on his feet as galvin walks back to his table
concannon walks over to kathy and begins forcefully you are aware of the penalties for perjury
its a crime
beat it is a crime
a serious crime
i wouldnt do it
you would not
in fact youve just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury
youve just sworn to that
isnt that right
sworn before god you would tell the truth
id like to ask you something four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that drs
towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed
and wasnt that an oath
these are your initials here k
when you signed this chart you took an oath
no less important than that which you took today
beat isnt that right
beat isnt that right
then please which is correct
youve sworn today the patient ate one hour ago
four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago
which is the lie
when were you lying
you know these doctors could have settled out of court
they wanted a trial
they wanted to clear their names
and you would come here and on a slip of memory four years ago youd ruin their lives
when did they lie
and do you know what a lie is
holding chart you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
thats not my handwriting
youve just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes
but i i didnt write that figure
you didnt write that figure
and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
taking a paper out of her purse because i kept a copy
i have it right here
she looks toward galvin
galvin nods meaning you did it perfectly
concannon the judge kathy
this is ri
expect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right
ill rule on that presently
concannon is taken up short
amazed at the judges reaction he pauses an instant
concannon motions to billy the young lawyer who nods in response and starts whispering instructions to his colleagues at the defense table who start leafing through their lawbooks
concannon takes up the fight again
what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years
this is a
why would you do that
i thought i would need it
and why please tell us would you think that
after after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma
towler called me in
he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form
beat and he told me to change the form
he told me to change the one to a nine
beat or else or else he said
beat starts to cry he said hed fire me
he said id never work again
who were these men
who were these men
i wanted to be a nurse
she is weeping copiously
she starts to get herself under control
no further questions
you may step down
kathy starts to get down
she looks to galvin for assurance
galvin nods at her
kathy getting down from the stand
the judge addressing galvin
nothing further your honor
concannon is signalled by billy the young lawyer at the defense table who is gathering notes from his colleagues who have been researching during kathys speech
concannon walks over to the table and is quickly talked through the notes by billy
concannon cuts billy short meaning yes i understand im far ahead of you he takes the notes and returns to the bench
thank you your honor
we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana u
point and through of the uniform code the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed
and your honor having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now we object to the admission of the xerox form
one moment mr
the judge nods meaning i am considering
he is making some notations on a page in front of him
he nods to himself he has reached a decision
he looks up
the document is disallowed the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form
explains to them its unsubstantiated and we cant accept a copy in preference to the original
thank you your honor
costello is a rebuttal witness
as a surprise witness she may only serve to rebut direct testimony
as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard
her appearance here
im going to uphold that
galvin getting to his feet
i object your honor
to jury miss costello was a rebuttal witness
her sole rebuttal was the document which has been disallowed
galvin silent fuming sitting at the table
her entire testimony must be stricken from the record
you shouldnt have heard it but you did
now that was my mistake
and you must strike it from your minds give it no weight
galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on it
legally its over
concannon was brilliant
tell me about kaitlin costello
theres nothing to tell
its been stricken from the record
did you believe her
all looking slightly to their right
in front of the full jury box
you know so much of the time were lost
we say please god tell us what is right
tell us whats true
there is no justice
the rich win the poor are powerless
we become tired of hearing people lie
after a time we become dead
a little dead
we start thinking of ourselves as victims
pause and we become victims
pause and we become weak
and doubt ourselves and doubt our institutions
and doubt our beliefs
we say for example the law is a sham
there is no law
i was a fool for having believed there was
beat but today you are the law
you are the law
and not some book and not the lawyers or the marble statues and the trappings of the court
all that they are is symbols
beat of our desire to be just
beat all that they are in effect is a prayer
beat a fervent and a frightened prayer
in my religion we say act as if you had faith and faith will be given to you
if we would have faith in justice we must only believe in ourselves
beat and act with justice
beat and i believe that there is justice in our hearts
beat thank you
he stands still a moment then surveys the still courtroom
laura in the corridor watching him
the jurors filing in from the jury room
concannon young lawyer dr
marx at defense table
young lawyer scribbles a note passes it to concannon who ignores it
galvin looking at the jury mickey at the other end of the table
have you reached a verdict
we have your honor
the jury box
the jurors seated the foreman standing
your honor we have agreed to hold for the plaintiff
but on the size of the award are we bound
you are not bound by anything other than your good judgment based on the evidence
galvin totally defeated
nods his head sadly as if commiserating philosophically with himself
mickey looks at him in grief with sympathy
are we permitted to award an amount greater than the amount the plaintiff asked for
galvin slowly raises his head turns and looks at the jury mickey begins to smile
the courtroom commotion
please retire and
galvin and mickey standing near a back staircase cleaning equipment is lying all around
a large battered garbage can
mickey is lighting galvins cigarette
galvins hand shakes badly
something draws his attention at the end of the corridor
he turns his head
laura standing at the end of the corridor
tentative lost pleading silently she holds a sheet of yellow legal paper in her hand
im going to try
when this is over can we go away
joe thank you laura holding the paper
galvin and mickey looking at her
galvins face impassive
he turns his back on her
mickey does likewise
to galvin the jury might be out for awhile
beat tentatively you want to run across the street and get a drink
galvin puts his arm around mickeys shoulder
they push through the exit door turning up their collars to the cold
galvin hesitates a moment as mickey goes through the door
he looks back longingly
the deserted corridor
galvin standing framed in the doorway
he turns toward the door his back to the camera his shoulders slumped
he stands for a moment sighs straightens up and walks through the door
