screenplay by brian helgeland and eric roth based on the novel by david brin november early production draft jagged mountains defy a dark foreboding sky
we hear plodding hooves creaking leather
a lone wanderer appears
wearing a long coat and a battered hat he carries a bolt action carbine
his name forgotten history remembers him simply as the postman
his laden pack mule bill brays as they pass a battered sign the great salt lake marina
they start down a slope and begin to cross a
a bizarre wind swept sight
dozens of boats resting lee to on the dry cracked earth
its like god pulled the plug
rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two
the last of the great cities died when my father was a child
another victim of yet another war
the plagues followed
and the terrors
the living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained
the earth itself had fallen prey to chaos
for three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase
the ocean was barren
as the postman continues to cross the camera pulls back
hes soon lost in the massive vista
sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again
my father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief
a rumble of thunder
rain begins to fall
the earth just sucks it up at first but its coming hard
we begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again
track a rivulet as it runs filling up a depression in the sand
and then running to fill another in a series of depressions
they make a pattern we recognize as these tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water
then the sound of light padded footfalls
a lion enters frame
lean hungry and dangerous the big cat has been tracking this man
he lets out a low disappointed growl
the rain has foiled his dinner plans for now
a bullet ridden sign reads u
the postman leads bill down a barren lane
weeds poke up through the asphalt
the rusting hulk of a car rests in the median covered in a tangle of purple wisteria
the postman plucks a flower
he sticks it into a buttonhole and continues
bill brays woefully
in answer i dont know
and if you ask me again im going to slug you
they near a sign thank you for visiting utah
the postman waves shouts to the sign as he passes it
its been fun hasnt it kids
to the sign youre welcome
bill tugs up weeds as the postman is climbing up a ladder on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon
above the postman sands atop a billboard catwalk
he references a tattered road atlas scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens
he pauses at a union ball just visible above the tree line
a station and the remains of a howard johnsons
alert carbine in hand the postman leads in the mule
rusting cars sag on flattened tires
theres a stripped fire engine its cracked hoses leading to the hojo foundation which bristles with burned timbers
bill stops to drink out of a stream
the postman swats at him with his hat
damnit bill you know i need to check it first
bill hangs his head
the postman digs through his pack
he removes an old tupperware container and replaces its contents a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles with stream water
he adds a few drops from each bottle
swirls it around
then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water
the paper turns a vivid purple
the postman is dubious
better than turpentine
touches some to his lips tastes about the same
your call bill
you aint picky bill
i like that about you
the postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the station
an old extension ladder on the ground
the pole holding up the ball has a degree bend in it like someone once tried to pull it over
beyond the ball the sun sets but we here in the th century have never seen such a wild riot of color before
the postman tries the station door
smiling ironically he steps in through the blown out window
the postman kicks around the table
he finds a few beat up cds flips through them
reads the label
running on empty
tell me about it
tossing it he turns stops
there resting on a pile of trash is a bashed in portable tv
the postman smiles
we got tv
everything from jesus to jeopardy
he steps over switches on the set
nothing happens but the postman pretends just the same
he mimics static then like sands through the hour glass so are the days of our lives
switching channels michael shields come on down youre the next contestant on
the price is right
switching again ill take domestic nuclear disasters for two hundred thousand alex
the postman stops suddenly
we interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the second civil war
the postman stares at the blank screen a moment
theres a sudden panicked rustling from behind the service managers desk
the postman wheels around raises the carbine
i dont want any trouble
i bet you dont either
lets just call it a draw okay
the postman shouts in surprise as a doe dashes out from behind the desk
scared it bounds back and forth between the walls
then freezes in the corner
the postman sighs in relief lowers the carbine
look out bill
the doe bolts for the window and runs right into bill
bill has a conniption fit
investigating further the postman spots a cigarette machine
the front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty
but he looks down to the lock at the bottom
he pulls a crowbar from the sack crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls
the panel bursts open to reveal four half open cartons of cigarettes
he doesnt believe it for a second
then im rich
embers of a campfire glow
the postman is asleep the carbine in reach
bill brays and nervously stamps his hooves
the postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face
hard eyed and ugly
one barely is mostly just ugly
the postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun a rifle and a revolver
the lead bandit kicks the carbine out of reach
im just passing through
i dont mean anyone any harm
re stream waters good
the lead bandit pokes at the postmans shoulder with the muzzle of his rifle
the postman knows why
im not a holnist
the lead bandit pokes again
the postman opens his shirt reveals his bare left shoulder
they just stare at him none saying a word
im headed for a town called st
somewhere west of portland
portlands under twenty feet of water
well i heard different
you mouthin me
no its just that its hard to get good information
the third bandit a hulking brute has been quiet
he is mouthin you i say we kill him
dont be in such a rush martin
back to the postman now i see a pack mule over there but i dont see no packs
this is all i got
kill him martin
the hulking bandit raises his shotgun
the butt end
hes going to bludgeon the postman to death
my stuffs up there
the ball is twenty feet above the ground
in the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side
what do you got in there
the lead bandit swats bandit upside the head
to postman what do you got in there
theres the ladder
maybe hes got it booby trapped
the lead bandit is about to smack bandit again then he sees the logic out of it
the postman shakes his head but isnt that convincing
you go up and get it
the ladder set against the bent pole
prodded by a shotgun the postman climbs disappears through the hole and into the tilting ball
full of the postmans earthly possessions
trick is how to save them and his life at the same time
he spies an old wrench remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty bolts holding the ball in place
an idea begins to take shape
just you start tossing those cigarettes down
theres no answer
the bandits eye each other nervously
maybe he fell asleep
the postman grabs the wrench starts working one of the last two rusted bolts
as it starts to give
its going to take a second
i got my stuff bolted in
the lead bandit takes a cautious step back
put some buckshot through it martin
just to hurry him up
i only got three shells left
so use his gun
the hulking bandit picks up the carbine and aims
it isnt loaded
the hulking bandit tosses the gun aside pulls a knife from his boot
grimly he begins to climb
cramped the postmans busy at the base of the ball trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt
it wont budge
the hulking bandit has only a few more rungs to go
the postman starts rocking the pole
the hulking bandit has reached the opening feels the rocking motion
knife in hand the hulking bandit looks inside
at that instant the postman rocks the pole one more time
the rusty bolt is not enough to keep the balls full weight in place
the ball is frozen for an instant before going with the poles tilt
the ball drops off the pole rolling over the hulking bandits back and down the ladders incline
the other bandits dive clear as the ball hurtles past
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away
the ball launches off a dirt berm but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart
fighting the vertigo the postman staggers to his feet
bill bolts from the station as the lead bandit raises the rifle and fires at the postman
losing balance the postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head
wobbly he tries to gather his packs
the bandits charge quickly closing the ground but bill is there first
holding as much as he can the postman heaves himself over bills back
as the mule gallops away the lead bandit aims the rifle
hes got the postman in his sights
hes about to fire when bandit stands up into the shot
hes got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and hes laughing like a hyena
the postman sits on a rock holding bills halter so the mule must face him
they are in the midst of an argument
its true we havent done this in a while but its like riding a bicycle
now open your mouth
the postman pries his mouth open
taking a toothbrush he tends to bills teeth then gives him an appraising look
i know the rule
its my rule
avoid civilization at all costs
but we gotta eat dont we
as bill brays again what are you so worried about bill
all you gotta do is stand there
im the one with all the lines
the postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below
making his case all the while even as bill brays in protest
a patch of mud
in the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where the postman wraps up a performance of macbeth
he plays it with a mis remembered gusto the people enjoy
children especially are enamored
a heavily muscled man woody lingers on the fringe of the crowd watching the postman with inscrutable intensity
they said fear not macbeth til birnam wood comes to dunsinane
he looks off stage for someone but no one appears
i said birnam wood comes to dunsinane
bill trots on stage
covered with twigs bill is birnam wood
he brays lustily
the audience laughs in delight
the children clap
only woody seems unaffected
the postman grabs two wooden swords he knows its going well
arm arm yourselves
if the witchs words are true therell be no running or hiding here
shaking off the twigs bill takes one of the swords in his mouth
the two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack
finally the postman looks out at the audience remembers the words the best he can
tomorrow and tomorrow and the day after that
out brief candle
lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more
its a tale told by a moron
full of sound and fury signifying nothing
waves sword but blow wind
at least well die with the harness off our back
the audience erupts in applause
but woody stands still as stone
the postman takes a bow
even bill does a cross legged dip
knowing when to quit he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes
woody watches his every move
thompson one of the towns leaders steps up
shes accompanied by crotchety old curmudgeon larry
the children have never heard shakespeare before
grinning they still havent
the curmudgeon is still clapping
youre very nice
im clapping because you stink
i dont think you understand how it works
when i was young i tried to be an actor
i was awful
but now i wont die thinking i was the worst one
im glad i could help
larry stop it
to the postman you were very good
good enough to get something to eat
before she can answer a sentry cries
holnists are coming
all eyes look down the road leading into town
a raiding party of holnist cavalry are on their way in
thompson sees the postmans concern
we give them food and supplies
all the towns do
they hardly kill anyone lately
just take a woman sometimes
well id just as soon not give them anything of mine
lets find the back door bill
the postman gathers his stuff slings packs onto bill
the forty holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in
theyre armed with mostly pistols and rifles
some carry bows knives spear guns and swords
on their bare shoulders branded into the flesh the number
out front always leading by example is general bethlehem
tough smart merciless with style
commander of the united clans of holn
nothing escapes his eye
a little behind him is the mysteriously silent colonel getty second in command
the postman finished packing begins to move from building to building careful not to attract any attention
what are you doing there
the postman freezes turns is relieved to find bethlehems not talking to him at all
the general looks down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game of birnam wood
the children stop stare at their feet
bethlehem affects a kindly smile to accompany his gentler tone
i said what are you doing
meantime the postman continues his surreptitious escape
the mayor hurries forward to greet bethlehem
its just a game general bethlehem
something they saw in a play
no harm in it
to kids show me
its all right children show me
one brave boy finds his voice barely
arm arm yourselves
no running from the witches
surprised shakespeare is it
well im sorry i missed it
you should know sir we havent nearly stocked the game we thought we would
but you had time for a play
head down the postman makes for the back way
but its guarded by three daunting holnist soldiers
no getting by them
the postman does a quick goes back the way he came
bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk
im taking three conscripts from each town
they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army until such time as i see fit
to mayor three men
you suppose you could do that
the mayor nods in acquiescence
bethlehem looks to a holnist officer
the officer idaho steps up and addresses the town
all men between and and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now
the holnist soldiers fan out prodding any likely or unwilling candidates forward
the postman is now walking behind bethlehem
some of the townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way toward the open courtyard and ultimately the gate out of town
three conscripts are hustled before bethlehem
he looks over the first woody
not much of a decision here
the second a thin teenager
bethlehem feels his arm turns his head from side to side
youll need to put some meat on but i like an impressionable mind
the third an innocuous man
or so we think
bethlehem stares hard at his olive skin traces a finger over the bump on the mans nose
soldiers shove the man back into the crowd
the brave boy that was playing birnam wood allows himself a tiny smile when he sees that the postman might make it
i want pure blood
bethlehem notes the boy turns to see the object of his attention and spots the postman leaving out the front gate
idaho and another soldier are on it
the postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him
you dont understand
but idaho and the soldier arent programmed for explanations they grab him
you were required to show yourself
but im not with these people
im just passing through
i idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head
everything falls out of focus take the mule
spread out in the valley is general bethlehems holnist expeditionary force
a five hundred man army enjoying all the comforts a bivouac can offer
head shaved conscripts including woody and the postman are held in a cramped barbed wired pen
they watch as three more are shoved inside
one of them is bandit
he and the postman come face to face recognize each other
the postman steps toward him bandit backs off quickly
i mean we know each other kind of
looking around wow
so what did you guys do with my cigarettes
we traded them for a woman
what happened to your partners
they traded me to the holnists
general bethlehem approaches on horseback
colonel getty follows behind
bethlehem looks his new recruits over
dismounting he enters the pen and walks among them
welcome gentlemen to your new life
you have been born again as soldiers in the army of the united clans of holn
the strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak
men strong men have been denied their destiny
you men have been saved from that fate
redemption is within your grasp
he starts down the line looking the men over
he stops in front of a gangly recruit
the postman is alongside
what did you do before you were given this opportunity
i had a shovel
i digged holes
bethlehem regards him benevolently
you digged holes
well now youre going to fill them
turns to postman and you
is there any question in anyones mind that i was talking to you
you look like a dangerous man
im just a performer
stuff like that
he was a writer
he i know who shakespeare was
and let slip the dogs of war
bethlehem says the lines boldly encourages his men to clap for him
he looks at the postman expectantly
i um you want a line
the postman thinks a moment
to be or not to be that is the question
bethlehem looks at his men as if to say is this all this guys got
bethlehem eyes the postman he wants a contest
we few we happy few we band of brothers
the holnists clap they know their general can best this guy
gaining confidence now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york
bethlehem claps the postman on the back
youre pretty good
youre also a fighter
i see it in your eyes
the postman doesnt answer
hesitant he doesnt want to get into any more trouble than hes already in
dont you agree
come on a mans got to speak his mind
bethlehem sounds sincere
he seems like a good guy
i dont mean any disrespect sir but youd be better off just letting me go
a fighter is about the last thing i am
the postman doubles over as bethlehem hooks a fist into his gut
bethlehem clubs him in the head dropping him to his knees then digs a boot into his side
the postman goes down
dont you think i should be the judge of that soldier
the postman gasps to catch his breath
i said get up
the postman staggers to his feet
blood trickles from his nose as he stares across at bethlehem
put up your fists
bethlehem looks to getty
getty shoves a pistol is into the postmans ear
the postman reluctantly raises his fists
bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod
the postman takes a tentative step forward
bethlehem drives him back with a flurry of blows
the postman is dazed nearly out on his feet
bethlehem holds him up
youre not a fighter
but you will be
im giving you a chance at a life that means something
a life worth living
that said bethlehem delivers one last blow to the postmans face
everything goes black
a brutal reveille blasts the sleeping conscripts awake
lets move it
everybody up and at em
the postman comes to
he licks his dry blood caked lips
a sudden movement startles him its woody shoving him a battered cup of water
its like hes been keeping watch
the postman is surprised a little suspicious and very grateful as he gulps the water down
did i win
woody shakes his head no
i tried to tell him
say it again
the words you said in town
about the wind blowing
and the rest
say it again
at least well die with the harness off our back
whats it mean
live free or die
woody and the postman scramble to fall to with the other conscripts
idaho surveys the ranks
all right girls
were gonna run
you got three hours
everybody makes it
or nobody eats
a cook dumps a scoop of gristly gray meat into each mess pail as the conscripts wait in line
they fall to ravenously too hungry to taste how bad it is
you got meat tonight
the line has almost passed
just the postman left and bandit bringing up the rear
idaho looks at the postman addresses the cook
why dont you tell shakespeare what kind of meat that is
probably bill and the postman knows it
he stares in revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail
a godawful animal
the sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey
can you imagine that
theres no room in this new world for a bastard like that
bandit holds out his pail
but the cook wont fill it
loudly for all any man last in line aint hungry enough
you show up last you dont eat
bandit steps away in disbelief
not knowing what else to do he sits down beside the postman the only man with food who isnt eating
ill die before im last in line again
thats what theyre hoping for
he holds his pail out to bandit
this isnt bad
lost in despair the postman stares out at the skewed palette
these were supposed to be the best years of my life
the conscripts stand at attention under the guard of idaho and two other soldiers
to their right is a dead oak tree
behind them three rows of folding chairs
two figures approach
bethlehem and getty
getty carries a sheathed sword
bethlehem surveys the troops taking no more notice of the postman than anyone else
the laws of eight gentlemen
that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn
at the mention of this name the recruits shout as one
god rest his soul
low may he burn in hell
getty looks over at him
he heard him
the postman swallows hard
getty stares hard
then he turns away
hes not going to bust him on it
these are the laws that we live by
the eight is our symbol
each man will bear it with pride
bethlehem nods at idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded
only then will you be part of the clan
sit down gentlemen
the men move to sit in one of the three rows
only then does it become apparent that there are men and only chairs
one slow recruit is left standing
it doesnt take him long to realize that hes in trouble
you will obey orders without question
to slow recruit i told you to sit
scared there werent enough chairs
i didnt specify chairs
you couldve sat down on the ground
the slow recruit moves to do so
you disobeyed a direct order
you broke law one
idaho and another soldier step up beside the slow recruit
punishment shall be swift
they hustle the recruit to the tree
idaho unslings a coil of rope throws it over a tree limb
they quickly slip a loop over the slow recruits ankles and haul him upside down into the air
law three mercy is for the weak
four terror will defeat reason
five your allegiance is to the clan
six justice can be dictated
any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan
does any man here wish to challenge me
there are no takers
on your feet
the conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open
without a word without a look bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that getty holds
bethlehem steps to the slow recruit who slowly twists around
law eight there is only one penalty death
bethlehem raises the sword
please im begging you
as the sword finds its mark
bethlehem looks at him but addresses all
you will get out of this army what you put into it
work and youll be fed
fight and youll be respected
die and youll be remembered
its up to you
bethlehem turns and walks away
getty following behind
the postman watches as they go
idaho steps up to him
you thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan
im a follower not a leader
you see colonel getty
always following the general
hes the only man who ever challenged
fight lasted six seconds but the general didnt kill him
he cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old gettys been following him like a dog ever since
the postman looks back to see bethlehem and getty disappear into the gloom
idaho grins likes how this affects a new man
the postman moves on
idaho stops woody as he passes
the general dont see it but i say you got some nigger in you
woody clenches his jaw but wisely doesnt answer
rain as the army moves
boots suck at the mud
war wagons heave out of ruts
a monster gun is mounted on an old john deere semi pulled by a team of ten horses
the conscripts fill the middle ranks each bearing a heavy pack
marching beside woody the postman stares blankly ahead
the cry to halt
the conscripts unsling their packs catch their breath
idaho pulls the postman out of line
the general would like a word with you shakespeare
bethlehem stands before a painters easel palette in hand
hes got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection
hes doing a self portrait in the tradition of the great dutch masters but its a dismal failure
he continues painting even as idaho leads the postman in
idaho salutes steps back
for a moment the postman doesnt quite know what to do
re the book and binoculars on the table theyre yours
a solitary man arent you
to watch life from a distance
to read about it instead of living it
bethlehem wants an answer
the postman clears his throat
no offense general but you seem to have read some shakespeare yourself
if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery a military commandeer must be classically educated
even a sense of the dramatic
a beat do you know what i did before the war
do you think i was in the army
i sold copying machines
i was a salesman
the talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me
he picks up finding a way to win by nathan holn
a year old self help book
if nathan holn hadnt come along id still be selling copying machines
can you imagine the wasted life
can you imagine the magnitude of it
war gives men like me a chance
he turns to a dog eared page in the book
the prize is often left unclaimed
have the courage to grasp it
for fortune always favors the bold
moved it always inspires me
beat i have a design for the future
a master plan
ill need able officers to carry it out
you have the intelligence
if your heart matches youll go far
a beat well talk more in the weeks to come
the postman leaves
idaho stands at the ready
issue the binoculars to a scout
and the book sir
bethlehem goes back to his painting
he considers himself in the mirror
after a long stare down he shouts quit moving
the postman rejoins the conscripts
bandit slides over
troubled the postman doesnt answer
he heads for a corner where woody stands alone
relentless bandit follows
what did he say
did he say anything about me
they reach the quiet corner its just the three of them
we got to get out of here
what are you talking about
low you ever hear of st
its on the coast
they say its a paradise
theyve even got electric lights
bandit looks scared woody unreadable
between the three of us we could no no
i like it here
i like being a part of something
the postman cant believe what bandit just said
bandit turns hurries away
the postman looks to woody who doesnt tip his hand either way
he moves away as well
the conscripts break camp
glistening with sweat the postman stops to stretch
across the way he sees bandit talking to getty
getty glances at the postman who returns to work watches under his eyebrows as idaho joins the group
theres trouble brewing here
worried the postman looks to woody who watches the exchange as well
he is as usual inscrutable
the river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw
marching along the east ridge above it the army is given the order to halt
the postman looks ahead to where idaho confers with bethlehem
they look to where two carbine toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a thicket across the river
a rotten wood and rope bridge spans the space between the ridges
idaho rides to the conscripts one of you dogs has earned himself a treat
idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line
those men hunted themselves a lion this morning
mustve been a zoo around here before the war
anyhow they shot him and he crawled into that thicket
a third man went in after him
we dont know if hes dead or alive
i need a volunteer
someones gotta go in and get our boy out
no volunteers except the zealot bandit
idaho ignores him stops in front of woody
i guess size aint a measure of courage is it
the fix is in
the postman steps out of line
idahos about to hand the postman a carbine when i dont think so captain
bethlehem nods to getty
getty takes a hunting knife from a belt sheath and tosses it blade first into the ground between the postmans feet
come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak
hefting the knife the postman stares at the west ridge
winks maybe youll find your st
rose up there
the postman looks to bandit who stares back defiantly
what are you waiting for christmas
bandit cant contain his giggling so idaho backhands the sound out of him then looks back to the postman
grim the postman starts forward looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves
all eyes on him as he starts across
the postman steps lightly
far below the river rages
a knotty plank starts to crack underfoot
scooting off it he takes a last look around
continues across to
the soldiers greet him unholy smiles on their ugly mugs
they point him ahead prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket
stooping the postman enters
the soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket
thorns catch and tear at his clothes as the postman pushes his way through
ahead sprawled and twisted the mauled bloody corpse of a holnist soldier
why are you stopping
i found him
clearly he is not
bring him out
the postman heaves the corpse onto his back
rising steadying himself he looks back over his shoulders at a guttural growl
he hurries forward
everyone stares across the river straining to see as the postman emerges with the corpse on his back
the postman starts across hampered by his burden
he pauses at his feet the cracked knotty plank
across river hurry up
you still got a lion to bag
the postman decides deliberately steps on the plank
the postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down disappear in the river below
the corpse surfaces first floats in the water
then the postman
farther down the river
swimming downstream with powerful strokes
between his efforts and the current hes being quickly swept away from the holnists
as bethlehems eyes narrow in fury
a rifle barks a shell back after the postman but he disappears around a bend in the river
bethlehem signals to two soldiers
they start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend
two more start across the bridge to the west moving with military precision
bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts points out woody
in the water
come back without him and you and another man will die in his place
woody dives in the water
bethlehem looks to idaho who dives in as well
conscripts buzz with nervous excitement
caught up ill get him sir
he takes off running across the bridge
a fallen tree spans the river
as the postman is swept beneath he reaches up and catches hold
pulling himself out of the water he scrambles for the west shore
he disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear
they catch hold of the tree look to the west banking see footprints in the mud where the postman pulled himself out
they start after him
clothes in tatters his lungs ready to burst the postman stops
he takes cover as the two soldiers run past
breathing hard the postman steps out starts across the clearing
hes halfway when bandit steps out from the trees
they look at each other for a moment
just let me go
i dont want to be part of your army
bandit hesitates for a moment then breaks into a grin
i like the sound of that
the postman gestures with his knife
dont i got him
over the postman lunges digs into bandit s gut
he blinks in surprise then sags to the ground
the postman takes a step back
a shadow falls over him
staring down at the postman
they can hear others approaching from the river
they sent me to kill you
come with me
at that moment idaho and the second soldier come into the clearing
idaho grins relaxes his grip on his gun when he sees the mismatch between woody and the postman
its you or me
woody circles the postman until hes facing idaho and the soldier
woody takes a long look at the postman smiles
no harness on my back
as the postman realizes what hes doing woody flips his knife through the air and into the soldiers throat
as woody rushes him idaho raises his gun
idaho pumps two rounds into woody but the big man keeps coming
the third round finds his heart puts woody down
but not before he lands on top of idaho
as idaho struggles to get out from under woodys massive frame the postman heads for the trees
covered in woodys blood idaho fires a round as the postman disappears into the woods
idaho starts after him
he sees a dribble of fresh blood
he touches it with his fingers and smiles
he cocks his head at movement to his left
smiling hefting his pistol idaho moves in
hes got him now
you want your st
theres a rustle of brush just before a roar splits the air
idaho doesnt even have time to scream as the lion pounces down on top of him
the postman lungs heaving stops his climb long enough to take stock of the army waiting on the distant river edge
strength ebbing he heaves himself up and continues climbing
a chilling rain drills down washing across an old forest road
covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings nothings been down here in years
blue lipped and shivering his clothes torn and soaked the postman trudges along
he tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs but a coughing spell wracks his body
he trudges forward shoes heavy with freezing mud
hes made his escape but he wont last the night if he doesnt find some shelter
an unnatural shape ahead just off the road
he cautiously pulls back a few branches
an old rusted jeep with faded u
its hood buried under the dirt of an old mud slide
the postman stoops to look through the passenger side window comes face to face with death
a skeleton sits inside the skull grinning against the glass facing the postman
but the postman doesnt jump back
he just stares
the two heads meet halfway as the postmans face is reflected on the glass superimposed over the skull
a hypothermic shiver wracks his body
the postman tries the door but it wont budge
the other side of the jeep is buried
but seeing that the windshield is partly smashed he clears away the debris peels back the spider webbed safety glass and climbs inside
pulling the glass back down he looks almost shyly at the skeleton like two kids about to park for the first time
how ya doin
the back of the jeep is filled with bags marked u
the postman picks up a hat off the console
oddly respectful he runs a finger along the band over the horse rider emblem
the postman reaches touches the embroidered american flag patch on the skeletons jacket shoulder
a moment later the postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside
a sloshing sound
he pats down the jacket
finds a liquor
he gives the skeleton a you shouldnt have look
but the cap wont budge
he twists pries bangs the neck of the steering wheel
at last it gives
he takes a long hard swallow
the warming fire streams down his throat
the postman grabs a random letter reads it aloud
jerry ball pine view
he starts to open it looks at the skeleton and shrugs
so arrest me
reading heres a piece of good news
jerrys decided to go to school to get his contractors license
tossing it aside he takes a drink opens another
the words are in crayon a childs scrawl
smiles to skeleton little jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth
the postman turns the envelope over in his palm
a tiny tooth falls out
the postman considers it
this suddenly isnt so amusing
he puts it back in the envelope
shoving mail sacks aside he climbs in the back
burrowing in he pulls the sacks back covering himself with a blanket of mail
getting warmer already he regards the skeleton a beat as the rain drums on the roof
wearing the blue uniform the postman looks down at the fresh grave realizes a eulogy is in order
he takes off the hat holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of silence
thanks for being there for me
raising the flask heres to you
i consider my taxes very well spent
he swallows the last few drops then sets the flask down as a headstone
all dressed up
nowhere to go
his hair growing back nicely the postman has reached the proverbial fork in the road
he considers his two options pine view miles
or ridgemont miles
he looks the two roads over thinks
well thats easy
the town is protected by a tall long palisade
all is dark as the postman approaches
greetings pine view oregon
two sentries appears from the gate house
they aim arrows
just head back the way you came
pine view aint buying aint listening and dont give charity
a moment of truth is here
finally with authority civilian im on official business
i demand entry into the town of pine view
what the hell are you talking about
im through talking to you buddy boy
now get somebody with authority to open this gate
more silhouettes appear on the palisade
one is sheriff briscoe a big no nonsense man
im sheriff briscoe
who the hell are you
im a representative of the united states government an uproar
he makes himself heard above it
authorized by order of the restored congress to reestablish a communication route to idaho and lower oregon
now open that damn gate
what does that mean in english
im your postman
theres a silent hush
to someone on wall hand me your gun
understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense
furthermore the bolin act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment
starting forward now open that damn gate
you got three seconds to get your ass outta here
is jerry the contractor here
briscoe pumps his shotgun aims it at the postman
im going to get something out of my bag
the postman dumps the pack over frantically shuffles through the letters
never heard of him
he fumbles for the last letter
briscoe takes aim
theres an absolute stunned silence
like a switch was thrown
the crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at irene march
march in her late s is blind her eyes clouded by cataracts
did he say my name
the sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back
two townies hurry mrs
march out to meet the postman
theyre followed by a throng
as he sees shes blind
too late now
they stop mrs
march in front of him
she stares off just to his left a little afraid
im irene march
uncomfortable i have a letter for you
he presses it into her hands but she wont take it
would you read it
im sure its personal
someone has to
the postman has little choice
as he opens the envelope
were delivering the old stock piles but ill accept all new correspondence as well
just read it will ya
excited the people move closer
someone holds up a torch and the postman starts
sorry i havent written
everythings so crazy
the strange weather
the food shortages
that farmer nathan holn causing all that trouble
its hard to understand
davids home from the army
the war was over before he even got there
thank god for that
hes still my baby no matter how big he gets
were going to miss you for christmas but maybe next year
all our love
march reaches out a trembling hand to take the letter
my sister in denver
fifteen years ago
the populace erupts with excitement
march takes the postmans hand clasps it tightly
youre a godsend
the postman pulls his hand back rejects the title
an almost awesome silence
too much for the postman
ive been on the road a while
i could use a little something to eat
oh yes absolutely
is there anything else
the townspeople welcome him with cheers
the postman raises a silencing hand
as they quiet
yes there is
if there are dogs in this town you have to leash them while im here
only the postman laughs
no one else reacts
briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround the postman and sweep him through the gates and into town
one couple watches the postman closely as he makes his way into town
she is abby a sweet faced pretty woman
her husband michael is a decent looking sort tall and strong
a freestanding tub has been set up water bucketed in
the postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and sings a familiar tune to himself
oh yes wait a minute mr
waaa ait mr
ford crosses the parking lot of an abandoned motel
hes a black kid maybe too young to remember any other life but this
he carries the postmans uniform on a hanger
the postman looks up at a knock
ford steps in
like most kids he needs a hero
holding up the uniform he just found one
beaming cleaned and pressed sir
didnt somebody say something about dinner
yeah im supposed to take you to fosters
extending a hand my names ford
ford lincoln mercury
the postman just nods hoisting himself out of the tub and hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself
used to be john stevens but i changed it on account of i want to drive cars
hoping to impress ford reaches into a pocket pulls out a worn creased flyer for a ford lincoln mercury dealership
ford finds the postman just staring at him waiting for the uniform hes still got in his hand
embarrassed ford quickly hands it over
ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind
the postman looks good in his uniform
they cross a parking lot where five partly stripped cars have been sitting for years
theres a potted plant outside the drivers door of one
i live in that car
a pontiac sinatra
with a nine banger and a q eight
that means an eight banger
in awe of him were they fast
a buck seventy five on a strip
a buck seventy five
i thought maybe i could fix some of them up
its nothing compared to what you do
this is the last thing he expected to hear out of this kids mouth
a moment then
the important thing to remember about cars is you cant eat em
ahead people are gathered inside an old fosters freeze
the townspeople fill the booths line the walls
they talk excitedly amongst themselves break into spontaneous applause as ford and the postman enter
the postman is surprised uncomfortable at this display
but then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the counter
the centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew
the people clear a path for him
tell us about the government
yes tell us everything
startled the postman doesnt quite know what to say
they seat him at a table but the food looks miles away
is there a president
whats his name
you know im pretty hungry
but these people wont be denied
his name is uh
he has a saying
things are getting better getting better all the time
theres warm applause at that
several people try the expression out on each other
he a democrat or a republican
parties are over with
the individual is what counts
you vote for the best man
ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of the postman
famished he digs in
what about europe
the postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food
lady dis in charge
sixty years old and she still kicks ass
is nathan holn still alive
smiles at irony he died
thats sure good news to everyone
and the holnists
theyre still out there
whats the government going to do about them
the postman looks at the desperate faces hed rather get back to his meal but this may be the most important question of all
he doesnt want to lie
the governments just getting started
youre on your own for at least eighteen months
what about the marines corp
a clamor of holnist questions
be quiet everyone
cant we just let this man eat
the people nod and the postman finally gets to eat
he catches sight of briscoe watching him from the door
after a moment briscoe leaves
a band plays an odd array of instruments
the postman sits behind four empty bowls
people watch him eat like it was a religious experience
he pushes back the fifth bowl
never thought id hear myself say this but i cant eat anymore
hes cut off by the sight of a silent little boy
the kids looking up staring intently at something
the boy just stares
re the cap this
the boy nods
the postman shakes his head and smiles to himself
he takes off the cap sets it on the kids head
the boys eyes go wide with wonder
his stocks gone up
before he can rush off to impress his friends ellen his mother steps over and gently chides him
thats not a toy honey
thats very important
give it back
the boy carefully removes the cap hands it back to the postman
ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away
the postman shrugs turns to find abby the pretty woman we saw at the pine view gates
she smiles at the postman
would you like to dance
i dont know if i can i think im still on duty
abby says nothing
its been a long time
abby holds out her hand like a promise
all you got to do is hold on
abby and the postman dance
she keeps looking him over
is something wrong
how tall are you
about six feet
are you smart
smarter than some i guess
did you ever have the bad mumps
the postman smiles
shes odd but beautiful
never had the bad mumps
have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that
he shakes his head no
they continue to dance
so as far as you know you have good semen
is that a trick question
i dont mean to be nosy
im only asking because i want you to make me pregnant
stunned the postman stops dancing
abby takes this moment to grab michael
to himself its got to be the uniform
abby takes michaels arm introduces him proudly
this is my husband
michael smiles shakes hands with a grave diggers grip
the postman doesnt know what to think
weve been trying to have a baby for three years
we cant on account of michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve
so we need a body father
we could ask a man here but it could cause trouble
ive seen it happen
things go okay until the woman starts to show
then it can be bad
but youll only be around once in awhile with the mail
the postman just stares at them
abby looks to michael
he hasnt said no
undaunted what do you say mister
youd be doing us a favor
ill have to think about it
the postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world
but no rest for the wicked as soon as hes free from abby and michael hes running smack into another group of well wishing townies
march is among them
shes holding an envelope
march wants to give you something
march hes right here irene
re letter its to my daughter annie
she left five years ago
she was only fifteen
the last i heard she was living up north
the postman swallows hard looks from the envelope to the faces around him to mrs
she looks blindly back
how can he lie to her
march you should know that
but she stops him grabs for his hand
i have a feeling about you
i know youll do whats right
her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd
shes left him with her letter and no choice at all
i got to get out of here
the postman moves through town
the streets are deserted
hes got his pack on his mailbag
he passes a converted to a blacksmith shop
theres a horse tethered to the railing in front of it
he grins maybe hes going to make it out of here after all
as he starts to move toward the horse
its right around the corner
an old man sits on his porch across the street
freezes startled what is
what youre looking for
the old man winks knowingly then heads inside
as the postman turns the corner he finds himself in front of the post office
an old brick building
chiseled in the granite facing united states post office
long ago stripped it still has a proud official almost holy feel
the postman wanders in stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall
neither snow nor rain
he turns at a sound
ford is here leaning against a wall
i knew youd come here
you did huh
a sage sixteen year old
how do you get to be a postman anyhow
you have to be in the right place at the right time
how could i do it
i thought you wanted to drive cars
that was kids stuff
this is real
so wheres the right place
could be anywhere
only another postman can make you a postman
kinda like vampires right
something like that
you have to be sworn in
ford raises his right hand palm out ready to take the oath
it takes the postman a moment to realize
the organizations kinda shaky
it might not last
youd meet a lot of people who dont believe in you
ill set them straight
its a lonely job
ive been lonely all my life
this response strikes a chord
the postman sees how badly ford wants something to hold onto
he sees himself
so have i ford
so have i
the postman looks up at the creed on the wall
what the hell
repeat after me
repeating neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds
repeating okay then
no no no im saying that
you just listen
by my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail
extends a hand congratulations youre a postman
they shake hands
the postman doesnt realize but this is the most important moment in fords life
i want you to know id die to get a letter through
fords intensity takes the postman back
but the moment is broken when
johnny why dont you run along
i need to speak to this man
ford bristles at johnny looks to the postman
ill see you around
sure thing ford
johnnys real impressed with you
whole towns real impressed with you
i take it youre not
smarter than you look
what can i do for you sheriff
you can clear out
or i can throw you out
either way suits me fine
im afraid you dont understand sheriff
im a government employee
authorized by youre not authorized by shit
youre nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail
and i want you out of my town
this is going in my report
these people dont need dreams mr
they need something real
they need help with the goddamn holnists
are you going to bring them that
as the postman doesnt answer didnt think so
all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts
i aim to keep it that way
you can stay till morning
then i dont ever want to see you again
briscoe exits leaves the postman alone in the post office
the postman arrives home
he pushes open the door knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved under the door
he gathers them up flips through them
theyre written on scraps the backs of pictures on handkerchiefs and homemade paper
they arent old
theyre brand new
shaking his head he closes the door
the postman has no sooner done so when theres a knock on the window
he looks over at a woman
she shrugs smiles holds up a letter
the postman sighs hes trapped in here
camera starts on a man with a string tied package crossing the streets and drifts to the abandoned car where ford lives
concentrating ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which hes drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch
by moonlight he embroiders it in
not exactly work youd pay money for but not bad either
from the previous scene
its on the table with a growing stack of mail
the postman is in bed trying to sleep
but its hard coming
he laces his fingers behind his head stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall
a knock at the door
just leave it
theres a pause
and then another knock
i said leave it
the door opens
abby stands in the doorway her hair held up by an old red ribbon
he sits up
youll be leaving tomorrow
enters closes door everybodys up late writing letters for you to take
were not supposed to waste candles like that but theyre so excited
how about you
do you have a letter
i dont have anybody to write to
ill find you a pen pal
someone with interests similar to your own
dancing checking for mumps
the postman is charmed
hardly anyones funny around here
i guess no one feels much like laughing
the two of them just look at each other a moment
abby fingers the ribbon in her hair
have you decided yet
oh well ive been thinking about it
abby lets her shift drop to the floor then slides under the sheets alongside him
they lie there awkwardly for a moment
he looks at her
god youre beautiful
sorry i know youd probably like to keep things more clinical
beat you dont even know my name
she shushes him covers his mouth with her hand
i dont want to
he nods he understands
she stares into his eyes
it would be easier for me if you closed your eyes
the postman closes his eyes
abby slides her hand away from his mouth
and as they start to make love
the postman wakes reaches for the warm body that was there last night
but abby is gone
all thats left behind is her red ribbon
wistful he picks it up
the postman exits
in uniform his bag slung over his shoulder
he starts then stops short
only now do we see most of the townspeople have silently assembled here
theyve been waiting for him starving for him
ford steps up hands him another fresh packet of letters
the postman sees that ford hangs on to four or five
what about those
these are going to blue jay
about twenty miles east
i thought i could take them
the postman scans the crowd
looking for abby maybe
briscoe rides up regards the postman sternly
im your escort out of town
some of the towns citizens lead up a saddled mare
we took a vote mr
we want you to have this horse
now dont say no
a man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot
smiles at briscoe ill take it
he ties his mailbag to the saddle swings himself up
theres a bedroll some oats and a weeks rations
where do you figure youll go from here
ill head west then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight
everyones quiet a moment
they shift uncomfortably
the postman looks out at the crowd
they crave hope
he should probably just keep his mouth shut
times seem hard right now
but you have to believe its getting better
birds are migrating again
the rains are back
the people consider him and then each other
by god they do feel hopeful
suddenly ellen her little boy by her side begins to sing
its weak at first but one by one the others join in
soon the whole town is singing oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain
for purple mountains majesty above the fruited plain
the postman looks around
they sing their hearts out
the guilt is overwhelming
he digs his heels into the horses flanks and rides out of town
people line the top as the postman and briscoe ride out
the strains of america still in the background
you got a helluva nerve whoever you are
the postman doesnt rise to the bait
is abby around
she and michael are working the north meadow this morning
briscoe reins up hes gone as far as his duty commands
well youre on your own
the postman tips his cap and continues riding by pine view population
briscoe watches a moment then calls after him hey
are you really who you say you are
if i come back with some mail youll know
the postman continues
caught in an inner turmoil briscoe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a letter
he turns it over in his hands looks off at the postman
god damn it
briscoe urges his horse forward catches up
he hands the postman the letter then rides back for town
the postman watches briscoe
the people lining the wall
and he realizes just what effect hes had
theres nothing to do but shrug his shoulders and ride
strains of america still echo hauntingly over a green and lavender sunset
in the middle of nowhere the postman rides chewing a piece of jerked beef
he flips through some of the letters entrusted to him
stops short boston
rose paradise on the pacific
he considers the letter looks around as if someone may be watching
he just begins to tear the corner then stops
maybe one thing can still be sacred
to horse all in all not a bad gig huh
the horse snorts
smiling the postman shoves the envelope into his bag
as he does he finds something else
the red ribbon
he runs it through his fingers thinks wistfully of abby
then like a knight of old representing a ladys honor he ties it to his mailbag and rides on
abbys washing clothes with a tub and washboard
waging war on dirt
michael leans against a tree watches abby at work until she notices him
she wipes the sweat from her brow tries not to smile
what are you looking at
he steps over and theyre in each others arms
this is love
but as michael kisses her we hear a familiar alarm holnists
holnists are coming
led by bethlehem and getty the soldiers ride in
something about the citizens disturbs bethlehem
they dont usually look at me
bethlehem reins in across from the post office
someone has hung a tattered old american flag
whos responsible for that
no one answers
all heads are down now
ford is sweeping up
the place looks almost presentable
he stops when he hears bethlehem calling once more for the responsible party
ford starts forward
suddenly briscoe is blocking his way
you gotta stay out of sight
im a postman
and im not hiding from anyone
i briscoe grabs him by the shirt hauls him out the back way
you stay out of this or ill lock you up myself damnit
bethlehem picks michael out of the crowd
youll be responsible
to soldiers get him a torch
michael walks out into the square
one of the soldiers returns with a burning torch gives it to michael
bethlehem looks at the town then at michael
set that flag on fire
its killing him but michael sets the torch to the flag
now throw it through the window of your post office
the torch goes through the post office window
struggling to get out but briscoe blocks his way
as flames grow he takes one last look around
the united states doesnt exist
that flag is an abomination
briscoe steps forward attempts to diffuse the situation
as bethlehem turns were gathering the tribute sir
can i take your wagons
bethlehem decides not to kill anyone looks to getty
make sure that fire doesnt go out
the general joins briscoe
tears on his cheeks ford watches the post office burn
bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded
michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his shoulder when bethlehem looks across the street spies abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut
that gentlemen is a first rate piece of ass
he looks over as bethlehems men nod in agreement
michael sees that theyre talking about abby
tell the sheriff i want to be introduced
she does not belong in a mudhole like this
one of the men hurries off
its concern for abby not for his manhood that makes him step forward
looks over you again
thats my wife general
shes a married woman
do you know what system of government we have here son
as michael shrugs a feudal system
like the middle ages
with lords and vassals
thats you and me
those lords they had some ideas
if a vassal got married it was the lords right his right to sleep with the bride on the wedding night
me and abby have been married for three years
sorry but i wasnt invited to the wedding
now youve already done me one favor son
dont let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record
another woman has pointed out to her whats going on
she cant hear whats being said but she watches concerned
well be civilized about this
i want you to give me your blessing
sir i cant
im tired of cant
we had a great nation once
do you know what made it that way
till the weak came along
the i cants destroyed us
but im going to make us strong again
im going to be the father of a new nation
draws his sword do you know why it will be me
michael looks to abby as she starts across the street
because i can
the sword whistles down
accompanied by an anguished cry michael
abby rushes forward but shes blocked by getty and another man
she cries out again and again
filled with impotent fury briscoe squeezes out the words
you didnt have to didnt have to what sheriff
three holnist soldiers draw down on briscoe
bethlehem circles menacing on his horse
your people seem seditious
you seem seditious
briscoe stares down at michaels crumpled form
briscoe might go after bethlehem despite the odds
what am i seeing here
burying his anger man came through here
said he was a postman
said the government had been restored back east
from out of the crowd a voice
the united states government
bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise
who said that
not waiting for an answer getty charges the crowd knocks one of the onlookers down
a dead silence
bethlehem frowns thinks it over a minute
which way did he go
a beat do not make me ask again
to getty send a patrol east
send three more south north and west
to briscoe theyd better find him east
the holnist army rides out
overcome by grief tied at the wrists abby stumbles behind one of the wagons
before the smoking ruins ford pulls on a blue shirt his homemade postal flag on the shoulder
as briscoe steps up ford shows him a bundle of singed but intact letters
i managed to save these
re shirt take that thing off johnny
you want to die too
ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag then climbs onto his waiting pony
im headed south
with the mail
grabs harness dont be a damn fool
what kind should i be
ford digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash doing damn near a buck seventy five
the postman stands in front of the torn screen
hoping for glory by association the smiling mayor stands beside him
the ragged people of benning clamor in front
kids smile up at him as he calls out names rachel clark
as shes there charlie sykes
as hes there graham druitt
died last winter of flu
the postman nods sticks the letter back in his bag
thats it for now folks
therell be more once a real system is in place
as usual the postman is assaulted with questions
tell us about president starkey
what about new york city
did they survive the plague
they got broadway up and running again
theres a kid doing andrew lloyd webber like you wouldnt believe
an older woman sheds a happy tear this is wonderful news
how much is it to mail a letter
smiles a buck seventy five
that sounds awful cheap
the catch is the only currency recognized are silver american coins minted before and two dollar bills
look for thomas jefferson
of course food is always acceptable as barter
the moment is split by a siren
a long double line of holnist cavalry stand in formation in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed cars
on top a skinny sentry cranks the siren while a chubby sentry watches
bethlehem rides through them with abby in tow her wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of bethlehems saddle
her face is bruised her bottom lip split
bethlehem reins up puzzled by the apparent stall
rides up salutes they wont open the gates sir
they say they got a representative of the restored united states in there
they say this army is illegal
they say the chubby sentry answers from the top of the palisade
drop dead and go to hell
the chubby sentry disappears back behind cover
bethlehem remains controlled but his manner becomes deadly
the romans had an expression they used to scare their children
hannibal ad portas
hannibal is at the gates
do you know who hannibal was
as she doesnt answer of course not
a pretty girl like you wouldnt know a thing
to getty colonel getty get some men up there and open that gate
the mayor hurries over the postman following reluctantly behind
the mayor spots the sentries up on the parapet
what the hell are you doing
open the gates
we dont have to take their crap anymore
two holnists scale the gates
theyre near the top when the skinny sentry appears
he fires an arrow
hit through the shoulder one holnist falls
the other jumps
chubby and skinny duck down behind the safety of the walls trading high fives
bethlehem orders his men to pull back
he shakes his head a quiet rage building
but he knows theres no military threat here
its going to be a massacre
climbing an inside ladder the mayor slams the chubby sentry against the wall
realizing scared theyre gonna kill us all
the mayor peers out through an observation hole
the postman and several others join him
lets fight them
we got five guns maybe rounds of ammo in the whole town
how do we fight them with that
the postman watches the holnists prepare for attack
negotiate a settlement
give them extra supplies
the men look at each other
sounds reasonable enough
youre a government rep
you go tell them
the look on the postmans face says it all
they open enough to let the postman ride out then close behind him
he sits nervously on his horse waving a white flag
hes met dismounts and is led to a command post where bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town
make it quick
ive got an attack to coordinate
general um theyve asked me to negotiate a peace treaty
the last time he and bethlehem were face to face the postman had a shaved head was dressed in rags and was covered with cuts and bruises
bethlehem cant place him but theres something familiar all the same
do i know you
i dont think so sir
i scans uniform youre the postman arent you
watches from the flap of bethlehems tent
the guard sees and shoves her back inside
bethlehem flicks at the uniform flag shoulder patch
the restored united states
do these people really believe that shit
who are you really
although he wants to confess everything something tells the postman he has to try to brass it out
i am a united states postman
authorized by order of the restored congress to
i was at the battle of georgetown
i watched the white house burn to the ground
dont try to sell me on any restored u
the new capital is based in minneapolis
inside the hubert humphrey metrodome
you know where the vikings used to play
now what are the terms
theyll open the gate and give you double what they usually give
just dont hurt anybody
this was all a misunderstanding
bethlehem thinks this over
abby tracks the guards silhouette through the canvas
her eyes search the tent land on the cot in the corner and focus on its heavy wooden legs
bethlehem has decided
appreciate your offer postman
problem is youre in no position to negotiate
these people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter
but theyre not going to survive you
bethlehem looks to getty and nods
getty motions to a gunner
the monster gun is fired
just as a shell explodes against the gates abby brings the heavy wooden cot leg down on the unsuspecting guards head
the cavalry ride through roiling smoke into the open town
horrified the postman steps forward but rifles are on him
all he can do is watch
the mayor is the first to go down
law six justice can be dictated
to soldiers kill him
and kill the restored united states with him
bethlehem turns his attention to the battle
a captain steps forward with gun raised
by rote in accordance with law eight and by the authority of emergency order you are hereby a crack of rifle fire
the captains forehead explodes and he falls to the ground
shocked bethlehem whirls for the source of the gunfire
firing from a position behind a supply wagon
but even as bethlehem turns an arrow sings in and lodges in his arm
fired from a pocket of sentries up on the palisade
bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain
the postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab the fallen captains gun
he pulls a holnist rider from his horse and swings into the saddle
the unhorsed rider goes for his gun
but once more shots ring out and he goes down
bethlehem ducks as another bullet zings close
two soldiers move forward
suddenly the postmans horse comes thundering trampling the holnist nearest him
the other holnist hears looks back sees the postman coming and takes aim just as the postman brings his gun to bear
the holnist fires first
we dont see the hit
just watch as the postman fires an answering round
the holnist goes down
the postman reins up alongside the wagon
grunting with pain he reaches down takes abbys arm and swings her up behind him
then digs his heels in for all hes worth
more holnists come on the run
the horse snorts in pain
but the postman urges him on heading into the woods
bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts colonel getty
abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot
we cant stop now
theyll be coming after us
the postmans head lolls forward
she feels something on her hand pulls it back smeared with blood
the postmans shot in the belly
the horse is failing
we hear the sound of pursuing cavalry
abby urges the horse off the road
when the thicket grows too dense abby jumps down
she catches the postman as he slides off easing him to the ground
abby shushes him
she pulls on the horses bridle to force him farther along
but its no good the wounded horse goes down on its knees
and five riders thunder past
all but the sixth who pulls up to listen
in the deep b
flames lick at the billowing black smoke
the town is burning
the horse whinnies in its death throes
abby panics tries to quiet the horse
the sixth soldier has heard the suffering horse
he draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket
the postman lies unconscious on the ground
abby sits beside him rifle in hand
the sixth soldier appears
he hesitates at first
then dismounts and moves toward her
abby cocks the rifle
if youd had a bullet youd a used it by now
moving closer still he doesnt see the branch pulled back in the postmans hand until it snaps hard into his face
he stumbles back
abby dashes out rifle in hand
she swings for the bleachers
the butt catches the side of the sixth soldiers head
he falls hard
the postmans eyes flutter
dazed he watches as abby pilfers through the soldiers gear
she takes everything of value a knife bullets a canteen
his eyes flutter closed
abby lays a sapling travois beside the postman
he groans as she rolls him onto it tucks a blanket around him
using all the strength god gave her abby lifts one end gets it high enough to hitch it to the sixth soldiers horse
as abby leads the horse away
the snow has increased
a holnist patrol moves down the road disappears around a bend
abby appears leading the horse and travois
she crosses the road and disappears into the woods
a moment later she reappears with a pine branch which she uses to brush at the snow obscuring their tracks
riding into a blizzard abby leads the way up a zigzag path
a valley opens up below
the unconscious postman lies bundled on the travois
a little square shape just visible beyond a creek
abby leads the horse and travois bound postman to it
the windows rattle in the wind
snow falls through a hole in the roof
the wooden door bursts back and abby enters
half frozen she leads the horse and the travois right inside
a fire has been lit
the postman lies unconscious his shirt open as abby washes around his wound
she pulls the shirt back to clean his chest
the material falls away and abby stops short
there high on his biceps a branded
she stares in disbelief
the postman lies on a cot below the window
hes conscious but pale as a ghost
abby brings him a bowl of soup
very thin soup
stirring it with a spoon the postman smiles at abby
she turns her back on him without a word
the postman tries an exchange just the same
i dont think i ever had water soup before
maybe next time we could try it with a little sand
as she doesnt respond dirt
as she doesnt smile a twig garnish
she goes about her business in silence
you used to think i was funny
they killed michael
he takes a spoonful of soup and she comes to him
how sorry are you
whats that supposed to mean
her right hand flashes out holds a knife up under his chin
whats with you
you got the mark of eight on you
a long beat
finally he swallows the soup in his mouth
the action presses his adams apple against the blade
a mark doesnt mean im a youre a liar
i shouldve let you die
then why didnt you
if she knows shes not ready to say yet
you were with bethlehem
does that make you one of them
abby considers this the postmans gaze flickers down to the spoon he still holds in his hand
taking one last stab at a joke
re the spoon dont make me use this
abby doesnt laugh
but she does relent
she steps away
the hunting shack huddled against the south side of a low rise
beyond the rise a pass
but theres no negotiating it now
its completely snowed in
and another storm is on the way
wind howling in the b
the postman lies back on his cot
the little shack has been scoured clean
abby stares listlessly at the fire
the silence is torture
the postman tries to strike up a conversation
winds come up
no response from abby getting colder too
must be another storm abby gets up and throws a log on the fire
i didnt mean for you to your legs are going to rot off if you dont try to walk
i got a hole in my stomach
the two big meals around here are grass and snow
and were running out of grass
as the two of them glare at each other for a moment
abby starts to put on her coat
where are you going
abby doesnt answer
she picks up the rifle and starts to lead the horse outside
youre not leaving me here are you
abby is out the door without a word
hold on the postman in the window as she continues past
he watches a moment suddenly grimaces
the thud of a body slamming to the ground
abby has shot the horse
tiny tracks in the snow leading away from the shack
abby struggles to make the monumental climb from the shack to the top of the rise where she can get a clear view of the pass
pan past her up to the top of the rise
its a clear day but the pass is still snowed in
no sign of winter receding
abby ladles a meager portion of horse meat stew into a bowl
this is the last of it
she walks with the bowl past the postman who sits on his cot with arms outstretched and pointedly sets the bowl on the table
mumbled give me a break
abby starts putting on layer after layer of clothing
im going to check the pass
why are you in such a hurry to get out of here
i can think of worse places
and worse company to and with the slam of the door she is gone
a few flakes of snow have begun to drift down
the postman sits at the window starts to play tic tac toe in the frost
but then it dawns on him you cant play tic tac toe with yourself
disoriented abby stops to take stock of her surround ings
but she cant make anything out the snowfall is too thick
the fire is dying
the food untouched
the postman sits in bed staring anxiously out the window
the snow has turned into a blizzard
he runs abbys red ribbon through his hands
abby trudges along heavily
she stumbles as the ice covering the stream breaks beneath her feet
the postman hears her call
the door opens and out steps the postman
in pain he staggers around the back of the cabin in search of her
abby looks up sees him coming
the postman collapses across from her
both prone theyre also nearly nose to nose
i cant help you
finally he pulls himself to his knees
she does the same
they climb each other to a standing position
arm in arm they start for the cabin
abby sits huddled in blankets
the fire is blazing
the postman steps over sets the once again hot bowl of stew before her
she considers the food a moment
i told you thats all there was
thats why you should have it
i knew you could walk
youre weird you know that
the postman lies in bed stares through the hole in the roof
a full moon is on the rise
abby lies in her own makeshift bed also awake
after a long silence we walked on the moon once abby
what good is that now
obviously youve forgotten tang and microwave ovens
a beat your face looks pretty
abby looks up
not so bruised
look theres something youd better know
youre going to find out soon enough
a long beat its michaels baby
youre just the body father
how do you know its mine and not bethlehems
he tried with me almost every night
he couldnt do it
so he beat me
said it was my fault
abby stands atop the low rise looking out to the pass
spring has come to the mountains
at long last the snow is starting to recede
the postman kneels by the bank sharpening a knife to clean the fish hes caught
then he catches his reflection in the water
is that him
he suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed vigor
we get a sense hes not going to use it on the fish
plunge into the water pull splashfuls up
we start on the postmans back then arc around as he washes his face
hes just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting knife
hes nicked up but its a definite improvement and he smiles in satisfaction until he sees abby reflected in the water
the postman whips around to see her standing there
what is it
is it the baby
the pass is clear
its time to go
behind her he sees the cabin is on fire
takes off running
the fire is blazing
the hunting shack is too far gone to save
the postman turns around
hes nonplused to find abby standing beside a pile of their neatly packed gear
you got our stuff out
i dont understand
i set the fire
am i missing the point here
you didnt think wed stay here forever did you
the postman has no response id appreciate if youd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby
then we can split up
a beat you shaved
the postman has all but forgotten
it looks nice
before he can respond shes heading off toward the pass leaving the postman to shake his head at the absurdity of it all
he shouts after her
youre really weird you know that
carrying their gear abby and the postman walk across a meadow of wild flowers headed for an old road
have you ever heard of st
ive heard people talk
ive heard lots of names
sheriff briscoe says its a fantasy
rose is out there
and im going to find it
but youre the postman
look im nobody abby
before he can come clean they see a distant rider coming hard
the postman unslings the rifle slides a round into the chamber
this is what i hate
do you say hi or do you blow their head off
do they want to share what they got or take what you have
and if they want to take how far are you willing to go to stop them
to the rider all right
thats far enough
the rider pulls up short wearing a blue home made uniform
we dont want any trouble
me neither mister
the postman is taken aback
the rider a girl pulls off her cap mops it across her brow
maybe well always know her by her ponytail
abby registers the uniform first
what are you
got any mail
lowering the rifle the postman looks over at abby back to ponytail
aint you heard of the postman
no tell us
hes only the greatest man who ever lived
he crossed the wasteland shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of general bethlehem himself
hes back east with president starkey right now
who told you all this
postmaster ford lincoln mercury
hes in direct contact with the restored congress
i dont believe this
growing irritated do you have mail or dont you
you said carrier eighteen
that mean theres eighteen of you
as of midnight
oregons main post office
a silver airstream fifty mobile homes and rusty winnebagos resting on flat tires
flying from a pole the flag of the restored united states
a young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a winnebago
ford walks along an rv boulevard
hes joined by two young carriers red and chubby the sentry from benning
all wear hip personalized variations of the official uniform
you got another letter
they come around the corner to where seven young recruits wait
theyre joined by another twenty carriers
seven of them
theyre coming from everywhere
ford looks them over in satisfaction
did you get a letter or didnt you
ford smiles reaches into his pocket
he pulls out a creased sheet of paper
gather round everybody
got another letter here
came in last night
buzzing with excitement the carriers gather around ford
ponytail leads abby and the postman
they come up in the back of the crowd
flanked by red and chubby ford stands on the hood of a car letter in hand
the postman taps a clueless young carrier on the back
whats all this
postman sent ford another letter
hes gonna read it
reading hello all postal carriers
a ritual hello
im here in minneapolis with president starkey but my thoughts are with you
remember nothing worth doing can be done overnight
keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot
signed the postman
a buzz goes through the crowd
ponytail looks over
his letters are always kind of short
abby and the postman exchange a look
looks up hold on now
theres a p
anybody know what p
the postman raises his hand
ford looks his way
his mouth drops as he realizes
in silence he walks over to the postman
they embrace and all the weight fords been carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to the postman
the kid nearly collapses
that would be h
i seen him once when i lived in benning
its the postman
word goes through the crowd like a wave
the postman takes the letter reads
ford knows what to do
ford shrugs sheepishly
guess you want to talk about this
the postman takes ford by the elbow
they disappear into the tent
the carriers just staring after them awestruck
i found him
i found him
they clamor around her
the postman and ford
ford knows what to do
i thought you were dead
im not making the connection
whats all this then
i told people you were in contact with me
because i didnt want it to end
i dont know how long i can stay ford
president starkey will send word one day and ill have to move on
but youll stay till he sends word
the postman cant answer just turns and walks out of the tent
as the postman exits chubby leads the carriers in a salute
the postman actually turns a moment to see if someone else is standing behind him
he looks back sees the young shining faces
aw dont do that
their hands go down in one crisp military move
the postman looks at abby to ford as he exits the tent
the kid is craving reassurance
youll stay til president starkey sends word right
yeah till he sends word right
ford smiles gestures to the carriers
could you say a few words
the postman looks over at the carriers
they quiet under his gaze immediately respectful
the problem is he has no idea what to say
finally two plus two equals four
the cheering is tumultuous
the postman picks abby out of the cheering crowd the look on her face says it all
the guts of the operation
several carriers are busy sorting and bagging letters
it goes out pinned to a clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth
everyone follows as ford takes the postman on a tour
there are hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the first time
we bring all the mail here first
we sort it group it and then it goes out
so far we got thirty routes
ford leads the postman and abby into another winnebago
chubby and red and ponytail follow
those that cant fit just peer in through the windows
an old manual crank printing press is working away
ford proudly removes a sheet shows it to the postman
a caricature of eight evil holnists forming a figure eight
beneath unite against holnist tyrraney
you spelled tyranny wrong
low to red boy hes smart
the seven young recruits seen earlier stand in a line
theyre joined by old george every day of years old
ponytail holds up her hand swears them in
neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night
as they finish the postman and ford pass by
the recruits salute
shaking his head the postmans about to salute back when he spots old george
george has a faded purple airborne tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his eye
theres an old crow on his shoulder
how old are you
seventy five sir
the postman looks over at ford who shrugs
can you ride
cant walk too good either
why are you here
i know stuff
the postman looks at ford again
re tattoo when did you get that
a girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called saigon
carriers move items out of the trailer
the camp is buzzing as usual
the postman looks on sees abby passing by
hes got her attention just doesnt know what to do with it
ford wants me to have his trailer
said its the best one
im on the other side of town
i got plenty of room here
she shakes her head and then walks away
the postman watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp
so much for the uniform theory
the same sun sets on the holnist camp
bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand
hes trying another style impressionism and its worse than the last
he looks over as getty and gibbs approach with a prisoner
what do you think lieutenant
cant tell what it is if you stand too close
the colors all kinda run together dont they
bethlehem looks away from his painting to see gibbs and getty flanking a scared blue clad mail carrier
for an instant mistakes him for well if it isnt our old friend the u
we captured him on the oregon border
realizing bethlehem turns the face from side to side
who the hell are you
united states um postal service
getty sets some of the carriers anti holnist propaganda onto bethlehems field table
bethlehem picks it up
its hard to say what hes thinking
finally i want the camp struck at dawn
were moving north
bethlehem looks back to carrier twelve
chilling you spelled tyranny wrong
ten letter carriers are on horseback
among them red and ponytail
ford and the postman are also on horses
each rider salutes the postman then gets a sheaf of anti holnist propaganda from ford
i wish theyd stop saluting
its annoying him
as chubby rides up
the postman catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute
so chubby salutes with the left hand instead
as they line up just stay safe and remember
the mailmans more important than the mail
boy hes smart
the sun just peeks up over the horizon
at that signal the carriers thunder off the ground trembling under them
the look on their faces
the glory of it all
the postman hesitates watches after them a moment
what the hell
urging his horse forward he rides after them
and then like an exploding firework each postman shoots off in a separate direction
headed for all points of the compass and some in between
the postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his horse and smiles
for president starkey and the first congress of the restored united states i officially declare postal station
whats the name of this town
we never named it
thinks smiles i officially declare postal station in elvis oregon open for business
an eye blink of a town
ponytail stands on a crate reading names and handing letters to the grateful people massed around her
red and chubby finish mail call exchange an amazed look as theyre offered a platter of food
the moon hangs low over an interstate
a rider is silhouetted by the silvery orb looking like some post apocalyptic don quixote
its the postman
seen from the porch a rider gallops hard on the road beyond
a little boy comes rushing out letter in hand
the boy pulls up short realizes the rider is already too far gone
the boys shoulders sag hes crushed
i missed him
its an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around
a frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road
fearless the boy holds out the letter
the rider closes its the postman
the boy stretches out as far as he can
without breaking stride the postman leans out of the saddle snatches the letter as he passes
the boy watches after him knows what hes going to be when he grows up
sheriff briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the ladder and onto the top of the palisade
phil this better not be another of your u
he looks where the sentry points
the postman waits at the gate behind him on horseback ford and abby
and i got mail
amazed ill be damned
the postman rides with briscoe hurrying to stay alongside him
half the town jogs along behind them
bethlehem is offering a pounds of gold to whoever brings you in
dead or alive
thank god it wasnt a carton of cigarettes
id have shot you myself
pine view is throwing a party
its in full swing
a couple of guitars
a banjo and a trombone
the postman walks with briscoe sees mrs
march as her letter is read to her
catches a glimpse of abby dancing with ford
he seems for the first time truly happy
for that matter so does briscoe
things are getting better
getting better all the time
a beat i dont know who you are but i do know i was wrong about you
the postman smiles reaches in his bag for an envelope
got a letter for you sheriff
briscoe turns it over in his hands looks up in wonder
its from my sister
i thought she was dead
you thought wrong
briscoe has tears in his eyes
the postman continues on embarrassed but affected
the postman taps fords shoulder wants to cut in on him and abby
ford steps aside
a beat before abby decides its okay
her eyes are on her feet careful that she doesnt take a misstep
but his eyes are on her
and over it all bleeding in the sound of hoof beats
a mail carrier red rides like the devil himself was in pursuit
its getty and three holnists
they whirl as the tempo picks up
the postman pulls abby in closer
her eyes now move up to his
theyre closing in on the terrified red
abby and the postman
the chemistry is undeniable
shot in the back red throws back his arms
letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder he seems to glide along that way forever
the postman looks at abby shes so beautiful
like only a pregnant woman can be
tell me about the baby abby
i want to know
abby snaps out of the dream shes in
this isnt right
breaking away she heads off
as he watches her go red falls from his horse
one of the soldiers scoops up his mailbag
by lantern bethlehem and getty watch as gibbs sorts through the contents of the confiscated mailbag
births and deaths the weather gossip
theres nothing here
everything is here
am i the only one who sees that
to gibbs get out
gibbs hurries away leaving bethlehem and getty alone
give the people back their hope and their dreams wont be far behind
bethlehem sees getty waiting
what is it getty
getty hands bethlehem a sheet of paper something gibbs missed
its a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of the postman leading a few carriers against bethlehem and his army represented as hitler and the nazis
the caption underneath reads ride against the holnist tide
crumpling the paper a military man especially a commander should keep a journal
after hes gone its the only real defense against the slander that arises
old george sits hunched over a home made shortwave radio with a joint in his mouth
the postman sits beside him listening as static pours from an old car speaker
who do you talk to
not a soul in seven years of trying
but i will
the postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a hole in the trailer ceiling
take a look
offering joint want some
hey dont let the kids see that
george nods and goes on playing with the dials searching for a voice in the void
the postman focuses on the moon
i was an aerospace engineer
i helped design the galileo space station
scanning sky i dream its orbiting earth forever
with a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other
laughing at us down here
theres an urgent knocking on the trailer door
what is it
that makes five
all on southern routes
five dead mail carriers have been laid out on the asphalt
bethlehem walks the line looking for his elusive arch enemy
looks to soldiers children
i want a man and you bring me children
a beautiful day
ponytail rounds a bend at a lope and then her eyes widen in terror
she jerks the reins the horse rears in protest
ahead the truck stop
the five mail carriers hang upside down from the roofs overhang
a macabre sight
sighting on ponytail
a hand comes into frame and brings the rifle barrel down
its not yet
general wants the message to get back
pan up from the postmans dusty boots to his grimly determined face as he strides through camp and stops at old georges trailer
he moves out of frame revealing abby and ponytail in the b
as usual old george is hunkered down before his short wave
he looks as the door opens and the postman enters
tell me about the other stuff you know
george crosses the trailer opens a cabinet
inside twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more
the crow quiet
an old flag ruffles outside the post office the only new structure in town
old george sweeps the porch as a patrol of ten holnist soldiers ride into town
george makes no move to flee as they near
as they rein up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping
sensing it the holnist officer looks up
there on the roof stands the postman
ford and briscoe flank him along with twenty mailmen and locals armed with guns bows and rocks
as the soldiers raise their rifles the roofies open fire
george whips up a sawed off shotgun
caught in the storm the ten soldiers go down
grim the postman looks to ford as the locals cheer
george resumes sweeping
the mailmen climb down to strip the weapons off the dead
ford i want you to get rid of the bodies
i dont want these people blamed for what we did
two sentries guard the east
they peer into the gloom at the sound of a wagon approaching
it sounds like its coming fast
ford at the reins urging the horses to all possible speed
then he stands leaps to the ground
they raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out of the night
they each get off a shot before being forced to dive out of the way
the wagon continues on down to
a soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and brings the wagon to a stop
half dressed bethlehem steps up
a tarp covers the back upon which is written
reading postage due
bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the dead holnist soldiers
the men around bethlehem exchange looks cant believe it
bethlehem bellows in rage
ford hidden in the woods smiles at the sound
bethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the night
you want a war
ill give you a war
i was born for it
bethlehems words reach ford his smile fades
hes just a scared boy
he kicks his horse into a gallop and rides away
in the fog the sound of hollow hoof beats
the postman rides past the shapes of airplanes
the ghosts of the past
ford is swearing in four new recruits
as they repeat after him we realize theyve changed the oath a bit
neither snow nor heat nor gloom of night
through bandits hell through fire fight
through flood and plague we cannot fail
no holnist trash will stop the mail
riding his weary mount into town saddlebags bulging with mail
he pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words theyre saying
as he dismounts a fresh faced carrier takes the bridle
the postmans well past the point of fatigue
hes living on pure adrenaline
get this mail sorted
bring me a fresh horse
something to eat
as fresh face starts away the postman calls after him
and all the mail going south
the postman watches as ford shakes the hands of the new recruits
the postman reaches for his canteen
a tin cup filled with water appears from nowhere
the postman takes it too tired to acknowledge the gesture
they changed the oath
scoffs they dont think to ask who theyre replacing
he drains the cup and hands it back to her
just then one of the new recruits luke steps over
itd be an honor if i could shake your hand
a farmboy type luke looks like a younger version of woody
the postman sees this is lost in reverie
luke still holds his hand out
you look like
do i know you
well good luck to you
nodding in awe luke heads off
probably be dead in a week
ignores it youre exhausted
you need rest
theres food in the trailer ponytail rides by two sacks of mail hang from her saddle pommel
the postman grabs her horses halter stops her
where are you going
route twenty two
im already an hour late
get off the horse
you know the rule
twenty twos too far south
but theyre waiting on their mail down there
get off the goddamn horse
shocked she does
at the same time fresh face comes up leading a second horse laden with mail
re ponytails horse tie him off to this one
fresh face goes about tying the second horse to the first
you cant keep doing this
riding all the routes
youre not saving anyone
the postman climbs on ponytails horse looks at abby
did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman abby
doesnt give her time to answer i dont know if youd laugh or cry
the postman digs in his heels
the horse gallops away the second one following behind
a crowd of townsfolk are visible in deep b
beyond them the town of elvis burns to the ground
the camera circles around the bloodied carrier until were looking over his shoulder at a firing squad led by colonel getty and lieutenant gibbs
the only building not on fire is the post office
a soldier rides up carrying a torch meaning to burn it
the post office general
let it stand
all by itself
so it can remind them what it cost them
rifles are aimed
shock and dismay from the townsfolk as shots ring out
as he realizes hes still standing
pull back to reveal nine bodies lying on the ground
only the bloodied carrier is still standing
bethlehem points at the bloodied carrier crooks a finger for him
he staggers up
you think you can ride
as the carrier nods then todays your lucky day
abby tends to the bloodied carrier
he tries to salute as the postman enters the trailer
ford and chubby watch and wait as the postman goes to the boys side
the postman motions its okay as the carrier struggles
hes gonna kill ten people in every town
then burn it to the ground
for what you did
the postman is puzzled
but ford knows what and why
he said to tell you pine views on his way
he said hed wait there but not for long
breaking down i was so scared sir
i thought they were going to kill me too
i wish they would have
the postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the gruesome spectacle below
pine view in flames
the big john deere gun has blown several gaps into the palisade
bethlehem watches as his army sacks the town
the people have been rounded up
the selection of the ten has begun
the postman wheels his horse around
but ford ponytail chubby and luke are standing in his way
what are you going to do
im going to stop this
get out of my way ford
all of you
shaking his head theyll kill you
the postman starts to ride through them
luke chubby and ponytail move their horses to block
ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs the postmans harness
goddamnit the postman jumps off his horse
ford tackles him
the postman shoves him away continues on
luke and chubby pounce on him
with fords help they hold him down
you cant help them
theres still time ford
the postman struggles
theyre genuinely having trouble holding him down
re the postman youre hurting him
but theres no let up
no this is all my doing
i went against your orders
theres a moment of shocked surprise
the holnists we killed
you told me to bury them
but i didnt
i sent bethlehem the bodies
because bethlehem has to know that were not going to stop
god damn you ford
those people down there are dying because of us
because of what we did
theyre dying because of bethlehem
theyre dying because this is a shitty world
and if were ever going to change it then somebody might have to die
if i could make it be me down there i would
but i cant
a terrible scream gives them all pause
down below holnist soldiers hold back a screaming mother as her year old boy is pulled into the line
sheriff briscoe is among the ten he puts his hand on the boys shoulder the picture of grace under pressure
my god what have i done
beat we dont even know their names
his eyes wide and fearful
like a kittens
holding back the tears we know their names
the little ones my brother
his name is billy
a moment of stunned silence
what ford did was wrong
but it doesnt change anything for any of us
she looks to the other carriers its written all over their faces they stand with ponytail and ford
bethlehem looks the line up over
the firing squad stands at the ready
bethlehem looks to the trees feeling something
to getty hes out there somewhere
i can feel it
briscoe follows his gaze
he doesnt see anything but maybe gets the same feeling
bethlehem looks to briscoe
you feel it too dont you
didnt have to end like this sheriff
he knew where id be if he wanted to face me like a man
instead hes hiding like a rabbit
so much for your postman
rifles are raised
briscoe seems to grow as he throws his shoulders back and shouts
you hear me
i said ride
the words echo
nothing the postman can do but watch
bethlehems eyes go wild fire
the rifles bark
everyone falls dead
something in the postman breaks
he just lies there
the witnesses move back taking the postman with them
sheriff briscoe lies dead
the letter from his sister blows from his hand
the postman folds a letter shoves it into an envelope
he writes bethlehem across the front starts to write a second letter
the door opens and abby enters
ford thinks youre going to do something
the postman watches as outside the mail carriers begin to assemble
if i dont those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed
ford doesnt know what it means to be a kid
he doesnt have your memories
none of them do
all theyve got is the lousy world we gave them
and this is the only decent thing in it
being a postman
its all bullshit abby
all of it
beat i took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm
i made up the rest to stay fed
there is no restored united states
i knew it was something like that
the postman fingers the brim of the cap softens
weird thing is being a postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me
re red ribbon remember this
you left it behind that night
i always liked to think you left it on purpose
but maybe you just forgot it
abby doesnt answer
she leaves instead
twelve mail carriers including ford ponytail chubby luke and old george wait as the postman steps up before them
abbys off to the side
is this everybody
the rest are on the overdue list
this is everybody
for all got a letter from president starkey
an excited murmur among the carriers
only ford eyes the postman suspiciously
the postman reads greetings all carriers
greetings president starkey
reading ive been in contact with the postman
ive received all the reports
im proud of you all
he looks at them doesnt need to read whats in his heart
in dark days in a weary world you gave everything and asked for nothing
you beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you
but the price is too high
i wont see anymore of my bravest die
it is my duty to hereby disband the postal service of the restored united states
you are to burn your uniforms and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once
thank you and that is all
a hushed silence
the postman walks away
the carriers exchange tired defeated looks
abby just sighs knows hes not necessarily wrong
ford catches up with the postman
he stares at the postman the postman stares back
low fierce the president never wrote that letter
if he couldve thats what he would have said
ford gestures to the second letter
whos the other letter to
im taking it to him in the morning
what does it say
you know that
what does it say
stops turns it says its over
it says we quit
it says you quit
what about the oath
tell me something ford
how much mail can a dead postman deliver
the postman starts to walk away again
then ill take it
i cant trust you
ford gathers courage and confronts the postman
if this is the end
if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered
ill take it
whoever takes this letter probably dies for it
ford thrusts out his hand
im still a postman
you owe it to me
i owe it to me
the postman hesitates studies the intense young man
gives him the letter
the postman is packing bags onto a horse as abby approaches
im going to st
and im taking you with me
i know you dont want to hear it but thats my child inside you
i want to see it born somewhere safe
i have a right to that abby
whether you like it or not
abby walks away
the postman rests his head on his pack for a moment
the click of a gun causes the postman to lift his head and see luke standing there
thought i recognized you
general bethlehem said
raises the pistol you should be on your knees when i do it
i dont give a damn what that asshole said
the general is a great man
the general is a fucking lunatic
the postman steps forward
stops when the barrel of the pistol is right against his own chest
you dont own a thought in that goddamn head of yours do you
a beat you want to see a man
the postman turns to watch as ford starts out of camp
thats a man
the postman turns sees lukes face fraught with confusion and emotion
you dont understand do you
you never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it
luke stares back into the postmans eyes
a frozen beat
abby sits on her horse
shes witness to it all
luke is confused and ashamed
the postman mounts his horse and moves to abbys side
youre a better man than bethlehem luke
ive seen it
some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire
the postman and abby ride up on the ridge above the rv camp
they pause to look back one last time
across the way on the other side ford is doing the same thing
as though he senses it ford stops and looks back
ford raises his hand salutes
slowly the postman brings up his own hand
but he doesnt salute
as ford turns away so does the postman
watching as the postman and abby disappear from sight
guess minneapolis is that way
a sign prohibits pedestrians horses and bicycles
the postman and abby ride by
the postman no longer wears his uniform
their gear is packed behind their saddles
as a family of transients begin to rise from where theyre camped in the breakdown lane we cant help you
were just as lost as you are
the postman rides on
abby watches over her shoulder as they slowly begin to sit back down
bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table
behind him a finished painting
this time hes painted himself in the grand rococo style as part of the holy family with doves and flowers and glowing rays from heaven
getty and gibbs bring in a prisoner
good lord what do we have here
im a representative of the restored united states bethlehem backhands ford
hes got a letter
says the postman sent it
bethlehem tears open the letter and starts to read bethlehem
this letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored united states and there is no postal service
laugh grim then who the hell have we been fighting
reads on my carriers are returning home
in exchange im asking you to let them be
bethlehem eyes ford with undisguised contempt
he expects me to believe this
its true sir
i was there
he disbanded the carriers and rode west
ford turns blazing eyes to luke hes been standing there all along
it takes a moment for the news to sink in
but it does
then ive won
as the assembled holnists congratulate each other bethlehem looks at luke
you were supposed to kill him
i couldnt get close enough
re ford this ones his second in command
bethlehem looks ford over
why doesnt that surprise me
ford stares back
bethlehem looks to getty
bring out the one we found yesterday
they can die together
a frightened carrier is brought up
he wears a purple uniform with cali sewn on the shoulder
neither we nor ford have seen him before
as a firing squad assembles ford is shoved over with him
who are you
postal carrier of the restored republic of california
who are you
ford looks at him a second cant help but laugh
from gibbs the shout of ready
postmaster ford lincoln mercury
its an honor
bethlehem watches as clark holds out his hand
ford shakes it
wait a minute
wait a minute
hold your fire
you dont know each other
to himself quiet anger building this will never be over
itll go on except ill be fighting a goddamn ghost
should we fire sir
bethlehem crumples the letter tosses it
no i wont fight a ghost
tabula rasa gentlemen
a clean slate
i want all mail carriers hunted down
i want the postman found
i want him dealt with
to getty colonel organize the scouts
to luke he rode west
a pair of boots are walking through the water
its the postman
he turns over a body in the water
it wears a homemade postal uniform a bag of mail twisted around his arm
its a young face one we havent seen before
he looks up to abby on a ridge
i dont know him
shakes her head where do you think he came from
puzzled the postman shakes his head
he gently releases the body
the current takes it and they watch as it continues on its way to postal valhalla
the family of transients are grilled by three holnist scouts
one man points the way abby and bethlehem rode
littered with rubble
the wood brick steel and concrete of what was once a small town
amazingly one gray house still stands miraculously untouched by whatever disaster visited this place
a wild haired squatter steps out on the porch as abby and the postman ride by
he waves hello with a
welcome to sunny california
re the town what happened here
the ground started to shake big time and the hanford nuclear plant went
motions an explosion poof
destroyed everything for miles
but the sunsets are beautiful
you ever hear of a city called st
friend ive never heard of st
the squatter laughs and laughs like it was the funniest thing in the world
the postman and abby exchange a look continue on their way
hey dont go
i got monopoly in the house
boardwalk park place and the reading railroad
ponytail chubby and draw watching from afar
chubby has the telescope
you think thats president starkey
ponytail takes the telescope from chubby for a look
what makes you so sure
president lives in a white house
that guys place is gray
drew and chubby exchange a look
that makes sense
a lightning bolt shreds the sky
its day but the sky is black with rain
the useless towers cutting across a valley
rain beats down as the postman and abby trudge along
up ahead a rail road tunnel promises shelter from the storm
re the tunnel we can rest in there
abby is quick to agree
out of the corner of his eye the postman catches a blur of movement
he turns his head quickly but hes barely in time to see a wooden basket attached to one of the high wires swing from a distant tower
theres a sentry inside it
the basketed sentry whistles away at mph heading straight for an adjacent tower
in a matter of seconds hes lost from view
the postman looks back at abby
did you see that
shaking her head im hungry postman
the postman guides her toward the train tunnel
abby sleeps beside the fire
the postman silhouetted against the flames heads toward the far tunnel exit
the postman peers into the rain taking in the view of a distant bridge
abby comes to stand at his side
a town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge
the columbia river rushes far below
a sentry spots abby and the postman approaching blows a whistle
set the rifle on the ground
this old thing
it isnt even loaded
where are we
the bridge city mayor a middle aged retro hippie steps up
youre in bridge city
where we dont allow guns
the postman sets down the carbine
the guard steps over to scoop it up
sentry said you were coming
the postman stares at the mayor a beat
i know you
i was once
beat are you looking to cross
we will be
right now wed just appreciate some food
as the mayor nods his assent i got some kids behind me too
as the mayor agrees once more hey guys come on in
i know youre out there
boy is he smart
as they stand show themselves
fog rolls in
ponytail chubby and drew look up gratefully as one of the citizens of bridge city doles out bread
the mayor steps over hands the postman two loaves
for you and your wife
shes not my wife
the exchange cuts abby like a knife
she gets up and leaves
the mayor keeps his council not sure what to make of this arrangement
let me ask you something have you ever heard of a town with electric lights
but they say its a ways down on the coast
couple hundred miles at least
i couldnt say for sure
its the discovery of a lifetime
the postman looks to the west end of the bridge where abby stands alone
you seem like a decent man
and these seem like decent people
we try to be
and this seems like a safe place
intuitive you want to leave her
the postman looks back to the mayor then slowly nods
all of them
ill give you the horses and my gear
probably end up running the place
why dont you take the night to think
decide if thats what you really want
fog obscures the east end
a sentry squints at the muffled clop of hooves
the mist parts to reveal seventy yards away three holnist scouts on horseback
emissaries from hell
as the sentry blows a whistle
as word spreads folks move down the bridge for a look
eating their bread the postman abby and the carriers join them
the mayor stands across from the lead scout conferring
finally the mayor points him back the way he came
the lead scout doesnt budge spots the postman in the crowd
he and the postman seem to stare at each other forever
then with a flick of the reins hes gone
the other two follow
swallowed up by the misty evening gloom
the postmans head swims dizzily
its not over
the mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions
theyre looking for the postman
no such thing anymore
man on the horse says there is
says he thinks hes here
says hes coming back with friends
a little boy steps forward sings out
whats a postman
a silent moment
its been so long no ones sure how to answer
the postman looks down at the ground
the carriers exchange deflated looks
stepping forward you never heard of a postman
he shakes his head no
seems a shame
as the postman looks over at abby she takes a page from his book
there used to be a postman for every street in america
they wore uniforms
like this one
she goes to the postmans gear returns with his postal cap
sets it on the boys head
my postman knew the name of every kid on my street
he knew our birthdays
hed even find the baseballs youd hit down the street
i can still see the smile on his face
the tip of his cap when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it
mine always came just after school
you could set your watch by him
unless you were waiting on something special like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart
then it seemed like hed never come
i used to think they could make time stand still
several other listeners nod theyre completely with her
i dont think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone
getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself
no place was ever too far away for the postman
so nobody ever had to be alone
the postman was someone you could count on
things just made more sense when they were around
beat thats the kind of world we used to have
a world a lot of us took for granted
and now weve got this one
and it makes me wonder what kind of world do i want my child to live in
i want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams arent just lies you tell yourself to get through another day
i want my child and i want my friends i want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail
its a moment before anyone speaks
to the postman are you the postman
the postman takes the cap off the little boys head touches the emblem and answers
ive heard of you man
yeah i guess i am
and all of a sudden im not wearing the right clothes
and as he puts on his cap he accepts the mantle as well
lowered from the top of the bridge
hands reach up to steady it and bring it gently to the ground
its one of many
the postman and abby gasp as the mayor opens the lid to reveal well oiled rifles and pistols with ammo
the postman blinks over at the mayor
fact that we dont allow em doesnt mean we dont have em
were not stupid after all
im sorry ive brought this on you
no need to be sorry
long as we get our mail on time
ready for duty sir
the postman looks over to see ponytail drew and chubby ride up
like him they are back in uniform
the order was to burn all uniforms
the carriers look away sheepish
you know what to do then
talk to the people
gather whos willing
tell them its important
tell them we can make a difference
and tell em were going to kick ass
yeah tell them that too
at the edge of the gorge
the three carriers and the mounted locals thunder off the bridge and down the road
the mayor is in the b
helping one of the sentries prepare the basket for travel
this is hard for me
beat michael was the best man i ever knew
i never thought thered be another man i could love the way i loved him
searching for the words i dont know why ive been so blessed
and ive tried to find a way to be thankful but i swear if i lose you
her eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms
abby do you think a lie can become the truth
i dont know but i believe in you
you have a gift postman
i saw it back in pine view
you made mrs
march feel like she could see again
you made ford feel like he was part of the world
you give out hope like it was candy in your pocket
he starts to speak
she stops him taking his hand
when you come back well be waiting here for you
so you can take us to st
the postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket
the mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into the distance
theres three good sized towns up that way
enough folks to be a big help to you
if you can convince them to come
as the postman steps into the basket he makes the mistake of looking over the edge
its a long long way down
a lot higher than it looks huh
the postman looks at the contraption with more than a little trepidation
the mayor grins
dont tell anybody but i like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it
being a city official has its perks
he winks and as he reaches for the release pin
the postmans hand meets his there
trust me man
thisll get you there a lot faster
how do i stop but its too late
the mayor releases the pin
dont worry about it
good luck and godspeed
plummeting into the columbia river gorge
the mayor lets out a rebel yell
the postman is whipped along past the riders below
the speed exhilarating
the towns gone but the palisade remains
chubby rides along it exhorting the people who watch from above
but its the postman we hear all the magic back in his voice
once more into the breach dear friends once more
or close the wall with our dead
in peace nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility
but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger
a few makeshift structures are back up
carrying a torch ponytail gallops hard into town
people wake including mrs
as ponytail speaks to them
summon up the blood
disguise fair nature with rage and lend the eye a terrible aspect
captured by a holnist cavalry patrol old george and four other carriers are lined up hands bound before them
holnist soldiers force them to their knees as gibbs organizes an impromptu firing squad
old george looks down the line
the carriers are about to break down
steady boys steady
and as gibbs steps up all hope is gone
in accordance with law eight
get on with it you floppy eared sonuvabitch
we see the faces of the young carriers
but theres a sudden spark in old georges eyes
he starts to rise
the soldiers pick up their guns and thats when they see the postman
riding over the crest
galloping toward them
behind him forty new mail carriers
all riding like mad
one of them carries the flag of the restored united states
gibbs and his men run for their horses
shots are fired
four holnists go down
the rest gallop away
the postman and his carriers meet
the postman with his forty five coming from the west
drew chubby and a ragtag thirty coming from the north
and from the south ponytail leading a contingent of fifty
the forces converge and continue east
the army has gathered
three hundred strong
bethlehem and getty stand outside the command tent listening to a winded frightened gibbs
we follow bethlehems eyes over gibbs shoulders to the horizon where he sees the postman and his army of two hundred carriers cresting a distant rise
we were outnumbered sir
a least a hundred
feigning shock with guns
are you sure
looks more like two hundred to me
he steps away to get a better vantage point of the approaching army
he reaches out getty hands him a pair of binoculars
donning a pair of leather gloves only thing worse than a coward is one who cant count
lieutenant do yourself a favor
die well in this battle
in my army a deserters life is a brief and unpleasant one
bethlehem watches the postman through the binoculars a hint of a smile on his face
to himself at last someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me
a holnist soldier stands by with bethlehems horse
the general mounts the model of military calm and precision
getty reins up beside him
this is the day ive dreamed of
a sea of wildflowers separates the carriers from the holnists
the monster john deere gun is ready for battle
bethlehem stands with getty scanning the postal line with his binoculars
the carriers look just spoiling for a fight
bethlehem lowers his binoculars smiles grimly
theyre an eager looking bunch
morales a dangerous thing
to getty bring him up
i want this postman to see how the game is played
the postman chubby ponytail and old george and all the carriers have taken positions
the postman sights through a telescope
he scans further down the line then stops when he sees ford
bloody beaten within inches of his life
hes shackled surrounded by holnist guards
the postmans eyes turn to stone
to carriers stay here
no one moves until i give the orders
he clicks his horse forward toward the holnist line
bethlehem flanked by getty and the holnist sergeant watches as the postman makes his approach
he reaches into his pocket withdraws a white kerchief and holds it in the air
are they surrendering
god i hope not
he watches for a moment as the postman crosses the field moving well within range of holnist fire
then he coaxes his horse forward
bethlehem and the postman riding toward each other
they meet when the postman is almost three quarters of the way over to the holnists side
as they come face to face
my little shipping clerk
were both a couple of frauds
you know it i know it
great men are made by other great men
patton had rommel
grant had lee
but i get you
youre no fucking general
youre a copying machine salesman
youre not even a good painter
are you trying to goad me into a fight
wouldnt it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them
we could settle this thing right here
you and me
unfortunately it doesnt work that way
it does in your army
the postman kicks his horse up into a gallop and rides up the holnist line
no one least of all bethlehem is sure whats going on
i invoke law seven of the laws of eight
any man may challenge for leadership of the clan
the postman wheels his horse around
i challenge you
bethlehem is caught completely by surprise but recovers
youre not a holnist
youre not a member of the clan
you dont have the right
the postman rolls up his sleeve
he rides the holnist lines displaying his brand for all to see
the holnists murmur amongst themselves
i have every right
i invoke law seven
bethlehem cant believe his eyes
i challenge for leadership of the clan
the seed of doubt is planted
is bethlehem violating one of the laws of eight
the men look at one another
gibbs looks to getty
bethlehem looks from the postmans tattoo to his face
where do i know you from
and let slip the dogs of war
the one who didnt want to fight
i shouldve found a way to kill you then
but you seemed so strong
law seven it is
to all this war is settled here
as the postman nods in agreement
they take their positions and without a word they kick their horses into a charge
coming straight for each other like medieval jousters
bethlehem reaches for his sword
but before it clears the scabbard the postman lunges
the horses collide
bethlehem and the postman hit the ground hard
holnists and carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look
the fight is fierce
the postman and bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes
its more of a fight than any of the holnists especially getty expected
the spectators pull in tighter
both combatants have taken a beating and still they fight on trading bloody raw knuckled punches
one of bethlehems connects
the postman loses his footing hits the ground knocking his head on a rock with a resounding crack
dazed hes slow to rise
its just the moment bethlehem needs he straddles the fallen postman reaches for his knife with one hand grabs the postmans throat with the other
i study people
i know your problem
do you know why you cant fight
the postman cant answer
you have nothing to fight for
you dont care about anything
you dont value anything
you dont believe in anything
thats what makes me better
the postman grabs bethlehems knife hand using all his remaining strength to keep him at bay
barely audible i believe in the united states postal service
the postman lets go of bethlehems hands grabs his belt and pulls him over
as they roll to their feet the postman club fists bethlehem on the side of the head
nor gloom of night
will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds
bethlehem reels stumbling back
the postman pounces on top of him begins to strangle him
bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat but cant
hes going to die
the postman is urged on
by both sides
even holnist luke
he looks up at the faces and finally lets bethlehem go
the general gasps for breath
as ponytail and chubby move forward to untie ford the postman looks to both sides
it doesnt have to be this way
we dont have to kill each other
we can live together
we can ford takes chubbys pistol sets it against the side of bethlehems head
mercy is for the weak
bethlehem shakes his head doesnt want him to either
there is only one penalty and that penalty is death
fords going to shoot
he isnt worth it
im the head of the clan now
there are going to be new laws
to all law one
no more killing
theres going to be peace
the postman looks at carriers and holnists alike
who else has a law
everyone has to learn how to read
thats law two
liberty and justice for all
no more tattoos
give peace a chance
mercy is its okay sometimes
bring back vacations
the postman nods solemnly looks to ford
how about it ford lincoln mercury
you give us law eight
ford grits his teeth
close for ford be a leader ford
bethlehem flinches then sags as he realizes ford has fired into the ground
live and let live
the postman smiles in relief as ford lowers the revolver and starts to hand the weapon over
forgotten for an instant bethlehem makes a last wild lunge grabs fords gun
as bethlehem aims at the postman a shot rings out
hit in the chest bethlehem blinks in amazement before he falls to the ground dying
getty has shot him
would i had bestowed that time in the tongues that i have in fencing dancing and bear baiting
oh had i but followed the arts
grow like savages as soldiers will that nothing do but mediate on blood
getty throws his rifle on the ground
other weapons are laid down
the war at long last is over
somebody take a letter
abby in bed holding her new baby in her arms
shes reading a letter
what she reads makes her smile
she puts the letter down and cuddles her baby
your daddy wrote to tell you that hell be here as soon as he can
and that he loves you very much
abby looks up to see the postman standing at her door
she looks at him smiling with tears in her eyes
ill have to see about that
abby smiles down at the child in her arms
her name is hope
the postman takes the tiny child in his arms
and so my father returned home after the holnists were defeated
a beach town
no wall no sentries just cottages lining a dozen sand swept streets
a crowd has gathered to hear the postmans daughter hope mid thirties speak
beside her a bearded year old ford in his postmasters uniform
they stand before a large tarp draped statue
but he never did see st
there was too much to be done
hed made a promise and in keeping it he traded one dream for another
with no regrets
and so in honor of my father
she unveils the statue weve seen this before
its the postman on his horse low slung in the saddle leaning down to pluck the letter from the little boys hand
theres an older man in the audience who seems especially moved by the statue
theres a younger man beside him
that was me
