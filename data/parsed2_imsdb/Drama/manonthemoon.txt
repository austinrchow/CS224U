man on the moon man on the moon by scott alexander and larry karaszewski
standing in a nonexistent set is andy kaufman looking a bit nervous
wide eyed tentative he stares at us with a needy unsettling cuteness
his hair is slicked down and he wears the friendly world costume from the andy kaufman special
finally andy speaks in a peculiar foreign accent
i am andy
welcoom to my movie
beat he gets upset i hoped the story of my life would be nice
but it turned out terrible
it is all lies
tings are mixed up
real people i knew play different people
what a mess
so i broke into universal and cut out the junk
now its much shorter
in fact this is the end of the movie
so tanks for comink
andy puts a needle on a phonograph and swelling closing credits music starts to play
final credits roll
andy stands frozen awkwardly looking at the audience
every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music
he does that as many times as the credits require
finally credits end
and then a sly smile
he leans in
drops his accent and whispers
just my friends are left
i wanted to get rid of those other people
they would have laughed in the wrong places
beat i was only kidding about the movie
its actually pretty good
it shows everything
from me as a little boy until my death his eyes pop he covers his mouth oops
i wasnt supposed to talk about that
eh uh we better just begin
it starts back in great neck long island
andy turns to a primitive mm projector and turns it on
he smiles at the flickering light
i remember it well
we push into the white light
it fills our frame blazing whiter whiter
a black and white image slowly becomes color
an upper class jewish neighborhood
in the street crewcut boys play t ball laughing and shouting
a fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house and stanley kaufman gets out
still in his suit hes a well meaning slave to his job tired responsible
stanley goes over to admire the t ball game
at bat is his son michael a natural charmer
michael swings crack
and hits a solid single
thats my boy
good swingin kiddo
warm beat then a look hey michael
wheres your brother
instantly stanleys mood turns black
he frowns angrily then snatches his briefcase and marches in
baby carol is crying
mom janice quickly peels carrots trying to get dinner made
stanley marches past
is he in his room
of course hes in his room
aggravated all his friends are in there
he huffs upstairs
stanley hurries up to andys shut door
we hear little andy doing voices
as worried girl but professor why are the monsters growing so big
now as british its something in the jungle water
i need to crack the secret code
stanley rolls his eyes
he opens the door
revealing andy performing for the wall
andy is happy and enthusiastic
as long as hes acting
as british maybe i should talk to the natives
as dancing natives shoom boom boo ba
shoom boom boo ba andy
the boy suddenly turns off becoming introverted
frustrated stanley stares at his son
andy this has to stop
our house isnt a television station
there is not a camera in that wall
andy glances over at the wall
stanley contd trying to cope son
listen to me
it isnt healthy
you should be outside playing sports
but ive got a sports show
championship wrestling at five
he blows his top you know thats not what i meant
look im gonna put my foot down
no more playing alone
you wanna perform you gotta have an audience
he points at the wall b but i have them
that is not an audience
that is plaster
an audience is people made of flesh
they live and breathe
andy thinks considering his options
then he nods
baby carol sits in her crib
andys hands suddenly yank her out
andy hurries in and plops carol down on the floor
she dutifully sits there deadpan
andy returns to the center of the room
he resumes his show
as kiddie show and now boys and girls
its time for
tv fun house
he makes an hi everybody
are you ready for a singalong
ill say the animal and you make his sound
he starts to sing oh the cow goes
carol stares unblinking
he smiles pleased and the dog goes
and the cat says
tight on andy now grown up
years old still performing the song
wide its a small hip new york nightclub
and the bird says
and the lion goes
and thats the way it goes
he grins thank you
andy waves and bows
theres faint scattered applause
an irritated manager steps onstage
he shoots andy a disgruntled look then takes the mike
the comedy stylings of andy kaufman ladies and gentlemen
in the b
andy starts packing up his props hand puppets conga drums a phonograph
it all goes into a big bulky case
the club is empty
at the bar the manager cleans up
andy eagerly comes over
offstage his presence is soft placid his voice barely above a whisper
besserman same slot tomorrow
awkward eh i dunno
thinkin of letting you go
youre firing me
beat you dont even pay me
look i dont wanna seem insulting
your act is like amateur hour singalongs
a stunned beat
andy is hurt
what do you want

maybe a little blue material
i dont swear
i i dont do what everyone else does
well everyone else gets this place cookin
pal its hard for me to move the booze when youre singin pop goes the weasel
andy stares disheartened
manager contd im sorry
youre finished here
an uncomfortable beat and then andy starts crying
the manager is dumbfounded
he doesnt know what to do
tears are rolling pitifully down andys cheeks
the manager is confused totally disoriented
shamed andy covers his face then runs out
the manager stares after him
having no idea what just happened
sobbing andy bursts out the door
he steps onto the sidewalk and immediately stops crying
just like that
andy lifts his big case and starts walking
andy shakes his head angrily
he turns down a dark street hurrying alone through an unsavory new york neighborhood
two men appear
andy stops uncertainly debating whether to turn around
but in that second the thugs are upon him glaring menacingly
give us your wallet
andy stares fearfully
an anxious moment
considering his options
then he suddenly stammers in a thick foreign accent
i doo not unterstand
give us your money
i do not have mooney
the thugs glance at each other
andy as foreign man contd pleaze
i just move to america yezterday
i do not know
whats in the case
eeet eet is just perzonal trifles from my homeland shut up
gimme that thing
the guy snatches the case
he impulsively breaks the lock
and clothes congas and records fall out
the thugs are dismayed
this guys pathetic
they angrily turn and leave
andy takes a nervous breath then starts picking his things off the street
he shouts after the guys tank you veddy much
the improv the biggest comedy club around
people are lined up waiting
the man strides up george shapiro a hollywood talent manager
george is old school bronx accent shmooze and a hug
but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming
a doorman sees him grins and waves george in
the bar is packed with comics and show biz types
a few turn and smile george
george takes a couple hands whispers to someone else then drifts into the
where the shows in progress
owner budd friedman sees george and gives him a bear hug
then he hustles george to a table
george sits and gives the stage his undivided attention
up there is a wiseass comic
so im getting my mother in law a special christmas present a pre paid funeral
the mortician asked me if i wanted her buried embalmed or cremated
i said make it all three
im not takin any chances
the crowd laughs thank you
the comic waves and exits
george politely claps
a piano player jumps in with an upbeat show tune
we think theres a break
when andy suddenly awkwardly steps on stage
he is in character as foreign man
pink jacket tie hair slicked back frightened like a deer in headlights
he puts down his big case pulls out various junk and arranges it on chairs
the room hushes uncertain as to who the hell this guy is
andy tentatively grabs the mike
the stagefright is agony
looking around tank you veddy much
i am very happy to be here
i tink this is a very beautiful place
but one ting i do not like is too much traffic
tonight i had to come from eh and the freeway it was so much traffic
it took me an hour and a half to get here
andy chuckles as if this were a punchline
the crowd is baffled
andy as foreign man contd but talking about the terrible things my wife
take my wife please take her
a few nervous laughs
andy gestures as if they got the joke
andy as foreign man contd no really i am only foolink
i love my wife very much
but she dont know how to cook
you know one time she make a steak and mashed potato
ehh and the night before she make spaghetti and meatballs
her cooking is so bad
people are embarrassed
some avert their eyes
a couple hipsters laugh mockingly
george leans forward
andy wipes the sweat from his brow
andy as foreign man contd right now i would like to do for you some imitations

pleased he proudly bows now i would like to imitate jimmy carter the president of the united states
no change in his voice hello i am jimmy carter the president of the united states
some people boo and walk out
a few giggle getting into the groove
george is intrigued
andy as foreign man contd and now
i would like to imitate the elvis presley
a woman laughs caustically
andy grins stupidly then turns his back to us
he presses play on a cassette recorder
and the theme from starts playing
house lights dim dramatically
with a flourish andy pulls tape off his pants revealing rhinestones
he removes his pink coat putting on a white jeweled jacket
he combs his hair
then he brushes his hair
then he combs his hair some more
finally he picks up a guitar strikes a pose and spins around
he is elvis
dead on perfect
the crowd is blown away
vegas elvis intro music suddenly blasts
andy elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow
then he goes stage right and takes a bow
then he returns stage left for another bow
thank you very much
flabbergasted people applaud
this man is elvis
suddenly jailhouse rock guitar kicks in
andy as elvis contd warden threw a party in the county jail
prison band was there and they began to wail
he is astonished
george cannot quite figure out whats going on
but he wants in
he waves budd over
budd leans down and george whispers
whats the story with this guy
i think hes lithuanian
none of us can understand him
george nods admiringly
he does a hell of an elvis
andy is packing up his things
he very methodically folds each item of clothing then checks the creases
george strolls up
hey i really enjoyed your set
tank you veddy much
so i understand youre from lithuania
george is puzzled
i havent heard of that
its a veddy small island in de caspian sea
beat it sunk
im uh sorry
beat well look im probably out of my mind but i think youre very interesting
if you ever need representation
we should talk
george hands him a business card
andy reads it then his eyes pop
he drops the accent
shapiro its an honor
george realizes its all been an act
he laughs heartily
a bohemian health food restaurant staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals
andy and george sit together trying to get a sense of each other
you see i want to be the biggest star in the world
george is surprised at this hubris
im not a comedian
i have no talent
he shrugs im a song and dance man
george looks up at andy and inexplicably there is a giant moist booger hanging from andys nostril
he doesnt know what to say
a waitress brings over two plates of awful s health food seaweed beans stringy paste
andy contd mmm
i particularly recommend the lotus root
andy pulls out a little handi wipe and cleanses his hands
then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles beans in pinwheel shapes
sprouts in piles
george peers at the bizarre food behavior
you show a lot of promise
my concern is i dont know where to book you
youre not a stand up
your act doesnt exactly translate to films
where do you see yourself
bright ive always wanted to play carnegie hall
george is unsure if thats a joke
yeah ha ha
andy dips his silverware in the water glass
two dunks then he dries it with his napkin
george stares perplexed
he looks back up and andys booger has suddenly switched nostrils
see i dont want easy laughs
andys about to eat but first bows his head in silent prayer
george raises an eyebrow
andy snaps his head back up
andy contd i want gut reactions
i want that audience to go through an experience
they love me
they hate me
they walk out its all andy triumphantly eats a bean
george peers unable to take the booger anymore
he hands andy a napkin and points to his nose
andy nods removes the rubber booger and carefully puts it in a little box
andy contd after im famous i can sell these as worn by andy kaufman
and at that
george is won over
he smiles broadly
then sincere but you might also be brilliant
lets do it
george warmly extends his hand
andy slowly smiles then takes georges hand
the men shake
a moment of supreme importance
the glitz strip of los angeles
real working showbiz offices
no glamour at all
it looks more like an insurance agency
george sits in his office reassuring someone on the phone
sammy opening for david brenner is a fine gig
youll be on the road
get some exposure
a secretary shouts out
tony clifton on the phone
he says hes an associate of andy kaufmans
back to the phone sammy think about it
i gotta go
he punches a line hello
george shapiro here
on the phone a staccato abrasive nasal voice blares
is this george shapiro
beat er yes
reeking seeking creaking
george is baffled
can i help you with something
you stay away from that andy kaufman if you know whats good for you
stunned who is this
you you know damn straight who it is
a name to respect
a name to fear
i dont know what your problem is
kaufmans a lying bastard
if you sign him ill ruin you
clifton hangs up
george is bewildered
the light is magical
soothing sitar music plays
andy and fifteen other barefoot students sit on mats in a semi circle
eyes shut bodies in different yoga positions they are all meditating
facing them on a throne like chair sits a reverent indian yogi
at his feet is the class teacher little wendy a teeny lady with an absurdly high pitched voice
now while continuing your deep breathing slowly open your eyes
you should feel rested relaxed and alert
the students all open their eyes
do any thoughts come
my mind is clear
i feel great
all the tension is gone from my body
the yogis eyes go to andy
andy smiles sweetly
i want to thank you your holiness
my heart is radiating with pure energy
the yogi nods kindly
you always had a good heart
but im proud of the progress youve made in your discipline
tm got me focused
in fact my manager got me a tv gig
its just some new show with no budget but im still excited
the yogi peers intently
are you at peace with your family
i havent fought with them since i started here
goals are important
i stopped drinking
i gave up drugs
and im meditating three hours a day
its the center of my life
we are all impressed
andy smiles beatifically
this means a lot
i have a question
beat working up his nerve is there
is there a secret to being funny
the yogi thinks hard
squinching up his face
he finally speaks
an audience sits waiting for the commercial to end
techies tweak lights
cameramen get ready
sitting in vip seats are andys family
stanley and janice are in their late s michael and carol in their s
theyre all anxious
i still cant believe my brothers gonna be on tv
i hope he doesnt get nervous
whats the difference
this things on in the middle of the night no ones even gonna see it
the commercial ends and the applause sign blinks
the crowd applauds
an on the air sign lights up
welcome back to saturday night live
and now as a special treat on our first show
musical guest andy the snl orchestra starts the intro into a song
andy enters the stage with a boom box and positions himself in front of the microphone
when the vocals are supposed to start andy doesnt open his mouth
instead he looks around frightened
the band stops
and starts again
andy remains mute
the band stops again
the snl producer lorne michaels looks worried
whats happening to him
at that moment andy puts the boom box down and blares it loudly
the theme from mighty mouse plays but andy just blankly stands there
hes purposefully doing nothing
although we are in danger we never despair because we know where there is danger he is there
the audience is puzzled
the kaufmans are alarmed
lorne michaels is panicked
oh my god hes doing nothing
its dead air
were not worrying at all
were just listening for his call
then suddenly andy comes to life and triumphantly lip mighty mouse theme v
contd here i come to save the day
shocked the crowd howls with laughter
then instantly andy resumes his blank expression
mighty mouse theme v
contd that means that mighty mouse is on the way
the audience screams with glee
the tune ends and the audience applauds crazily
delighted andy grins and bows
the kaufmans clap the hardest
stanley locks eyes with andy
and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all
george jumps from his desk
andy is walking in
andy cmon in
thanks for flyin out here
the stewardess let me keep my headphones
but i got something better
this is big
giddy milking the moment you are getting a once in a lifetime unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on
a andys smile drops
he freezes up
and this is a class act
its the guys who did the mary tyler moore and bob newhart shows
it takes place in a taxi stand
and youre gonna be the fonzie
confused im fonzie
the crazy breakout character
the guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes
soft george i hate sitcoms
hang on you aint heard the best part
abc has seen your foreign man character and they want to turn him into he checks his notes latka a lovable goofy mechanic
then andy responds
no to which part
no to the whole thing
none of it sounds good
george is flummoxed
this is every comedians dream
i told you im not a comedian
and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment stupid jokes and canned laughter
shocked b but this is classy
they did bob newha im not interested
i want to create my own material
you have to do it
he explodes listen you arrogant putz
ive been in this business for twenty years
if you walk away from this opportunity you will never never see another one like it again
andy stares at george amazed at this passion
then andy gets up and looks around the office
he stares at the awards
the gold records
emblems of success and experience
andy thinks then nods
fine ill do it
beat but i have a few terms
relieved of course
thats what negotiations are for
andy starts to write on a piece of paper
george contd what are you doing
writing down my terms
george watches patiently
andy clicks his pen done
george smiles and takes the list
he scans it
then his face gets totally befuddled
are you makin fun of me
this is ridiculous
blas those are my terms
he points at one item i mean two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton
who is this tony clifton
hes a vegas entertainer
i used to do impressions of him
got in a fight over that
george gets a look
this clifton called me up
hes a loon
he hates you
nah he just talks tough
but i owe him one
andy smiles ingenuously then turns stern
andy contd if im the new fonz
abcs just gonna have to give me what i want
a sarcastic fonzie heyyyyyy
he stares at the list
george sits across a conference table from three network suits
he stoically reads the men his demands
kaufman will only appear in half the episodes
kaufman requires an undisturbed minutes of meditation prior to filming
kaufman wont rehearse
kaufman gets his own network special
the execs are stupefied
finally george delivers the clincher
george contd and taxi must guarantee two guest appearances to
who is he
solemn i dont know
the execs stare at george like hes lost his mind
george contd but andy says hes fabulous
awkward he also says these are the terms
the execs leader maynard smith shudders hopelessly
couldnt kaufman ask for more money like everyone else
george slowly sadly shakes his head no
maynard glances at his team then frowns
maynard contd george we dont book phantom performers
the deals off
george throws his attach case on the desk then slumps into his chair
he picks up the phone and dials
eh hi andy
look this tony clifton
is he performing anywhere
beat but only on monday nights
mama romas a dark italian restaurant with red booths wise guys and cigarette smoke
the maitred guides george to a booth
a small band fills the stage a six foot space in the back of the room
the lights dim
a blaring announcer speaks
and now mama romas is proud to present international singing sensation
a man who has sold more records than elvis and the beatles combined
george is skeptical
contd ladies and gentlemen mr
the drummer starts a drum roll
a light spot hits the entrance area
and nobody enters
the spot is waiting
until the drum roll slows down and stops
the announcer booms again
contd ladies and gentlemen out of respect for mr
cliftons vocal demands could everyone please extinguish your cigarettes and cigars
the crowd grumbles angrily then irritably complies
one angry guy thrusts his cigar into a water glass
goddamn i paid five dollars for this
a man who needs no introduction
the band starts playing lounge standard volare
and then obnoxious tony clifton swaggers out
tony has a rubbery face black wig and moustache sunglasses a padded belly and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping
tony stops smirks at the audience and sucks on a cigarette
he blows smoke rings at them
how ya all doin
the crowd is furious
people light back up and start talking
tony ignores the ruckus
he starts singing pinched and off key
cantare whoa whoa whoa whoa
tony clifton contd singing i got the wings of your love i got the wings of a dove
i got the
forgetting the words the chicken wings from eh kentucky fried
the band is lost
tony clifton contd oh

the band gives up and stops
tony clifton contd eh the hell with that song
one person claps
tony clifton contd so how ya doin
leering how ya doin over here

he approaches a hows that pasta carbonara

he spins around so you havin a good time sir
tony approaches a lonely sad sack sitting at the bar
tony thrusts his mike at the guy
whats your name
he reacts as if this is enormously funny bob
bob bob bob
beat bob what
what is that polish
tony gets indignant
are you tryin to do some of that polack humor
well if thats so you can just get the hell out of this restaurant

people are embarrassed
tony clifton contd i do a clean show
like i wouldnt do that one
oh you know it
what do you call a pretty girl in poland
he giggles stupidly a a tourist

ill give you a little humor
tony snatches bobs water glass and pours it over his head
george is appalled
the crowd is aghast
bob is wet
people boo and hurl things
bob starts weeping then bolts up and runs from the building
tony clifton contd and stay out fatso
the room erupts outraged
george covers his face looking ill
suddenly tony snaps at him
i wanna see you backstage
george is rattled
the kitchen staff is working
george wanders around
then finally spots tony back to us eating pasta at the employees table
aggravated george aggressively steps up
alright im here
what do you want
tony puts down his fork
slowly turns around
and is andy
his eyes bulge
andy smiles innocently
he gestures to an empty seat
are you hungry
george is breathing heavily like someone about to have a heart attack
his brain melting he shakily reaches for a chair and sits
george glances down
lying alongside the food is tonys rubber face
i i dont understand this act
in jolly spirits its good old fashioned entertainment
everyone loves a villain
well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated
beat then bob strolls over
his real name is bob zmuda
hey andy good show
oh george this is bob zmuda
bob and i have been buddies for years
on closer inspection bob is cocky aloof and conniving
he and andy grin naughtily at each other
that was a really hot house
so your names not gorsky
dont believe everything you hear
george thinks about this then laughs
maynard and the abc suits sit at the table mesmerized
george is confidentially whispering to them
this has to stay in the room
but heres the thing andy is tony
and tony is andy
theyll deny it up and down but i swear to god theyre the same person
with urgency its smart business
youll get two andy kaufmans for the price of one
maynard thinks about this quite methodically
a beat and then he cracks a smile
in the supermarket
just a few people linger
including andy whos at the space invaders videogame
andy stares intently at the screen eyes piercing fingers hammering the buttons while he blows up martians
andy is oblivious to all around him
in the b
george suddenly enters
he looks around the market then spots andy
he feverishly runs up
still playing the game whats up
george grins crazily ecstatically
they said yes
they agreed to it all
they thought your terms were a shining example of your irreverent wit and precisely why they want you
beat youre getting everything
andy looks up astonished
his space station explodes but he doesnt notice
he turns to george
and slowly smiles sweetly
well thank you very much
the first week of taxi
the cast rehearses on the taxi set
producers watch from the bleachers
the actual taxi scene will be determined
judd hirsch tony danza and marilu henner read their lines
a bored black stand in reads latkas line
the cast glances around
tony danza loses his temper
man this is bullshit
he marches up to the producer wheres kaufman
why isnt he here
one producer stands
this is tightly wound ed weinberger
youll see him on friday when we shoot
now run the lines with rodney
an angry beat
the actors resume
the audience is filtering in
they fill the studio bleachers
actors mingle outside the dressing rooms
im taking bets we do the show with the stand in
no i hear andy arrived
rumor is hes locked inside his dressing room
judd is surprised
andy is meditating
hes tranquil at total inner peace
silence until a little clock radio chirps
andy snaps his eyes open
he exhales a few calm breaths then sits upright
andy reaches for a sealed envelope rips it open and removes a script
andy sighs opens the script and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader
bleachers are full
theyre now filming taxi the same scene as earlier
on cue andy enters as latka wide eyed endearing in mechanics overalls
andy is hilarious
the crowd howls with laughter
in quick succession a series of andys best latka moments
the applause grows louder louder louder
taxi curtain calls
the whole cast takes bows then runs offstage
everyone is grinning except andy
he soberly strolls up to zmuda
im gonna quit
each show is worse than the next
are you nuts
million people watch you every week
what do they know
thats the beauty
he lowers his voice its credibility
you make them love you
and then later on your special youll screw with their heads
andy raises an eyebrow
the power office of maynard smith the powerful abc exec
he shouts into a phone
i dont care
travolta signed a contract hes a sweathog for life
just try to sue us
he hangs up
his assistant peeks her head in
sir theyre having a problem down on the kaufman special
they say hes not following the
maynard is baffled
andy is in a booth arguing with a heavyset technician
zmuda watches and eats a banana
its my show
now make it roll
maynard strolls up buttoning his suit jacket irritated as he walks around little wendy meditating in front of a ring of candles
andy i hear fabulous things about the special
a delicate pause eh i understand weve hit a teeny speedbump
harried yeah kid genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold
he wants the picture to roll
maynard doesnt exactly understand
the technician pushes a button
on the monitor andys image briefly appears
in her television debut the incredible chubby rosalie
at that moment andys image starts rolling across the screen until it disappears into a blur of static
happy itll be great
the viewer will think their tv is broken
theyll get out of their chair theyll twist the knobs theyll hit the tv but they wont be able to fix it
maynard stares at the monitor
the totally indecipherable picture still rolls
a glum pause
we dont want the viewer to get out of their chair
they might change the channel
but its funny
its a practical joke
theyll get frustrated
andy beams giddily
maynard gazes dully struggling to reason
this network has a long standing policy the viewer must be able to see the program
but its only for thirty seconds
both men quickly extend their hands and shake
maynard nods and leaves
then andy pulls out a handi wipe and cleans his palm
a studio page walks over
he has a huge mail bag
kaufman do you want your mail
andy looks up and his face lights up like christmas
andys crappy apartment which looks like a dorm room cheap furniture stained carpet and a framed photo of the maharishi
andy lies on his bed which is covered with thousands of letters
he happily chats on the phone
yes its andy kaufman
i got your fan letter
so you like the show
your letter said i was silly
did you think i was too silly
andy holds a letter which has a girls snapshot stapled to it
he is very nervous
andy contd it was real nice of you to send your picture mimi
cause you knew what i looked like
and now i know what you look like
andy flips the letter over
he glances at the return address
andy contd so um
beat thats just a couple hours away isnt it
the sun is setting
in an ugly shopping district andy walks along with sexy wholesome mimi
so after i finish junior college ill go to work for my dads accounting firm
unless i decide to live with my friend valerie but she wants to move to anaheim and i dont want to do that
a disinterested beat
andy contd so do you wanna wrestle
do you wanna wrestle
its a good way of breaking the ice
pause that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together
mimi is bewildered and offended
what are you talking about
we just met an hour ago
calm no no no its not sex
i mean it can lead to sex
but really its just wrestling
i dont wanna talk about it
an awkward silence
they continue walking
she points up
mimi contd the sunset is really beautiful
what do you mean
a bit offput i mean uh the colors in the sky are so vibrant
i love this time of day
he shrugs dully ive never understood that
pause but i like you
why dont we fill the car with gas drive to tijuana and get married
she shivers then hoarsely speaks
i think i wanna go home
george screens andys tv special for maynard and his team
the network execs look constipated
on the tv andy speaks tenderly lovingly to howdy doody
i was once in your gallery
i was just sitting there and i wanted to touch you
i was kind of depressed because i could see what everyone was like and i was wondering if now maybe i could
very gently andy touches howdys cheek and starts weeping
the execs are horrified
contd howdy ive been watching you ever since i was a little boy
choked up nervous youre the first friend from television i ever had
i always wanted to meet you
i finally am
this is not funny
ominous artsy fartsy shit
worried at this response no
eh the special isnt all like this
it will be hysterical
at that moment the picture turns to fuzzy snow
were the number one network cant we afford decent tvs
maynard angrily jumps and pounds on the tv
george winces then mutters awkwardly
its part of the snow
an awful beat
maynard is embarrassed
finally he explodes
tell kaufman we will never air this program
andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables
he stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food
two blue collar guys gesture from a booth
excuse me could i please have more coffee
yeah yeah in a sec
he lugs the dishes to the kitchen that was decaf right
the guy nods
andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring
you know you look just like andy kaufman
yeah i get that all the time
andy hurries off
the guys buddy leans in whispering
im telling you its him
you wanna bet
if that was him he wouldnt be workin here pouring my coffee
andy dumps out wet coffee grounds
he is sweating
in the b
george enters the restaurant
he sees andy sits at a table and yells out
could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake
they stare down each other
george contd andy this is ridiculous
take off that apron
id rather work here than at abc
theres no lying in a restaurant
they dont promise you a job as a cashier then suddenly make you a frycook
andy hurries off with a water pitcher
george chases him
look im sorry
but we work in a creative business
you cant predict what people are gonna like the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special
trying to calm him tell you what
ill book you on some concerts and meanwhile well show the special around
see if somebody wants to buy it bitter yeah we can have a garage sale
hey look i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents
a glum moment
andy fills water glasses
andy contd how long is left on my taxi contract
you signed for five years awkward so four years seven months
he looks up okay
ill go back
but just let them know first they aint gettin latka
theyre gettin tony
a marquee says texas a m presents andy kaufman inside a roar of applause surges
andy is walking onstage
the excited clapping swells
hes a gigantic presence to these people
andy smiles and bows
its great to be here
were going to have a very nice time
well sing some songs andy reacts perturbed
he struggles to stay composed
uh well play with puppets andy scowls
then he loses it
excuse me one moment
andy angrily hurries offstage
zmuda is with the congas and props
andy runs up
give me the book
andy dont do it theyre asking for it
andy fiercely grabs a small book from zmuda
andy strides back out
he gazes at the crowd
since youre such a special audience
im going to reveal for the first time ever the real me
he goes into a im actually british
i was raised in london and educated at oxford
and though i dabble in clowning i do find it so boorish
beat i prefer the fine arts
henceforth tonight id like to grace you with a reading of the greatest novel ever written
he holds up the book the great gatsby by f
the crowd isnt quite clear if this is good or bad
a confused murmur
he cracks open the book chapter one
he starts reading in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that ive been turning over in my mind ever since
whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages youve had
theres a little nervous laughter
is he really gonna read this
andy british contd he didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that
suddenly somebody from the audience screams the audience roars approvingly
andy stops reading and looks at the student
tank you veddy much
the audience applauds enthusiastically
andy waits until the applause dies and goes back to the book
when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever i wanted
no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart
people start booing
andy looks up
andy british contd please lets keep it down
we have a long way to go
he resumes reading only gatsby the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reaction gatsby who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn
the crowd is incredulous
the crowd is horribly bored
the clock says
the promoter glares at zmuda
is he ever going to stop
when he reaches the end
people are streaming out
maybe fifty are left
andy realizes this but is committed
he must continue
tom was evidently perturbed at daisys running around alone for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsbys party
perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness
a weak voice feebly shouts do latka
andy looks up shocked
insulted he blows his temper
i dont have to tolerate this impoliteness
forget it im gonna stop the show
he slams the book shut
andy starts to storm off then turns
andy british contd no no im only fooling
the audience groans
andy british contd ill tell you what
would you rather have me continue reading or would you like to hear the phonograph record
the audience roars for the record
andy smiles puts the needle on and to everyones horror more gatsby comes out
his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness it stands out in my memory from gatsbys other parties that summer
there are six people left in the audience
andy reads on
tomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms farther
and one fine morning so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
andy somberly shuts the book
andy british contd the end
a moment of quiet personal euphoria
andy looks enraptured the man who has just climbed everest
a pause but no applause
its dead silence
andy looks out
and realizes the few audience members are asleep
andy shrugs then shuffles off stage
in the wings zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair
andy and zmuda walk out zmuda squinting groggily
they drag the suitcase containing the props
they walk slowly towards their rental car the campus totally deserted
nobody likes anarchy more than me
but this is science fiction
andy nods uncomprehendingly
lets get some breakfast
george is yelling at andy and zmuda
they are seated on his couch heads bowed in shame
what kind of show was this
angrily reading off a list there were three hundred walkouts
the promoter wants a refund
andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper
im sorry george
youre damn right youre sorry
turning on zmuda and you youre the road manager
you should be watchin out for him
a guilty sigh we might have lost our focus
george paces furiously
when you play the midwest and south you dont mindfuck these people
its not postmodern its rude
beat if you wanna perform in texas you give em mighty mouse
you give em elvis
but george i like to push the boundaries
and thats great
but do it in la and new york
there you experiment
show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage
i dont care
how long would they let me sleep
i dont know
he composes himself and lowers his voice to a hush andy
you need to look inside who are you trying to entertain
he doesnt know the answer
andy is manically washing his hands
using liquid soap from the dispenser then rubbing his hands under the water
then more liquid soap
then more liquid soap
george sighs at zmuda
im worried about andy
his stress level is affecting his work
he thinks isnt tony clifton going on taxi soon
maybe thatll chill him out
bob andy needs to relax
see if you can get him away from all this
take him to hawaii or bali
find something special
zmuda mulls this over
a tattered sign says welcome to the mustang ranch
the world famous whorehouse sits behind a barb wire fence
dusty connected trailers sit in the sand
a car idles out front
zmuda and a scared andy sit inside
i dunno about this
worried what will my mother think
shell say now my son is a man
its so dirty
the girls sponge off between johns
the reception room wood paneling and black lite posters
music is playing
twenty deadpan hookers are lined up
andy nervous as a high school kid points at one
then the first
beat then andy becomes german with a monocle and stiff walk
i vill haf both
i vill haf dat fraulein
the vun vith the big strudels
the two chosen girls take andys hands and lead him off
he reaches the door then gives zmuda a nervous look
zmuda smiles reassuringly
andy gulps and goes in
zmuda turns to the older jaded madam
this is a big day
its my friends first time with a prostitute
mocking whatre you talking about
andy comes here almost every weekend
zmudas jaw drops stupefied
youre talking about
oh he doesnt always call himself that
sometimes hes tony and wears a tux
disbelief then zmuda laughs sharply
hes been conned
andy and the two hookers are wrestling
they grapple and roll around all three of them in their underwear
suddenly andy flips the girls over and pins them with his arms
breathing hard he stares down
you let me win
she giggles sexily what if we did
andy grins and leans down
if i give you three hundred dollars will you come to la and help me destroy a tv show
the taxi cast sits irritably around a big table holding scripts
ed weinberger enters
where is he
he just arrived
hes an hour late
look im told this clifton guy is a little eccentric
youre all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week
suddenly the door slams open
tony bounds in filthy drunk clutching a bottle in a brown bag
just the factsy maxie
thems all the words that rhyme with taxi
little wendy and the hooker sashay in dressed as tarts
tony feels them up and they squeal
the cast stares in horror
tony clifton contd eh why the blue faces
you musta read the script
he chuckles well dont worry
your pal tony stayed up all night writin some fixes on it
he pulls out some i added me a musical number cut out judd hirsch and changed the location to mardi gras
eds expression goes ashen
an attempted rehearsal
tony is tap dancing on top of a car hood
he does a fancy move and his booze bottle suddenly flies away and crashes against the wall
the cast watches pissed and bored
and now the new theme song
he starts singing oh yes we drive a taxi and were havin fun
yeah we work together and we get the freakin job done
beleaguered ed sits with george
george weve lost two days
filming is on friday
we have to let him go
worried im not sure how andys gonna take this
so well go downstairs and tell him
he points at tony swaggering around on the set
george shakes his head
but thats tony down there
thats not andy
trust me its like sybil andys nowhere on the premises
well whoever the fuck that is im firing him
he sighs okay
but well have to warn andy first
i think hes up in san francisco doing a concert
ed raises his eyebrows
george is on the phone
hi diane this is george
im trying to reach andy up in san francisco
a stilted pause yeah ill wait
ed glances down at the stage
and suddenly tony is no longer there
hes magically vanished
george turns on the speakerphone then click
andys happy voice pops on the line
good to hear from you
hows the weather up there
oh you know the bay area
ed looks totally off balance
george winks at him
im here with ed over at taxi
theres been some trouble with tony
did he get hurt
no no andy nothing like that
nervous beat but
tonys not fitting in
his style of performance is too
tony is on the phone
little wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea
he looks up insulted
andy im calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry
but i need your permission to fire him
upset george this is gonna kill tony
hes waited his whole life for this break
therell be other shots
andy i have to do it
hes a terrible actor
andy thinks about this
i guess i understand
but ed please

yes andy i will
andy hangs up
a relieved ed turns to george
ed contd thank you
tony screams insanely
ed is stupefied
the cast stands nervously behind him
we had a deal
i dont know what yer talkin about
you musta talked to someone else yeah
i talked to andy kaufman
i dont know nothin about no kaufman
hes been ridin my coattails smearing my reputation
been usin my good name to get places
ed is livid
he gazes harshly at tony tonys burning eyes piercing through the rubber features
get off my stage
i got a contract
im gonna take you to the department of labor
ed looks over
a reporter has a camera
im from the la times
were doing a little puff piece on mr
kaufman arranged it
up in the bleachers george enters
he looks down at the growing debacle and winces
onstage enraged ed blows up
escort this man off the lot
onstage studio security guards run over
they grab tony
getcher hands off me
the camera flashes
tony clifton contd in the bleachers george stares at this mess
and starts giggling
onstage two guards drag tony to the door
tony clifton contd youll be sorry
one day im gonna own this town
tony screams and gets removed
then i dont want those pictures getting out
to the reporter this is a closed set
youll have to give me the film in that camera
the guard reaches for the camera
an uncertain moment
until zmuda authoritatively cuts in from out of nowhere
ill take care of this
zmuda takes the camera
he casually starts to make his way for the exit
when ed suddenly hollers
wait hes one of them
two guards go running for him
zmuda barrels away trying to escape
the guards chase
zmuda races by george and suddenly palms off the camera into georges arms
the guards whip by oblivious
george grimaces unclear about his loyalties
he sweatily peers at the timebomb in his hands
and then george thrusts it under his jacket
he bolts for the door and feverishly scampers out
george runs for his life
he knocks aside a rack of costumes and serpentines between people
at the gate tonys being dragged kicking and screaming
you wouldnt do this to wayne newton the guards toss tony out the gate
he lands in a heap
in the b
george crazily flies by
he gets out the exit
george doubles over trying to catch his breath
he glances down
and tony is lying next to him
little wendy and zmuda run up out of breath
they all look at each other
theres a moment of understanding
george slowly smiles
ed storms in insanely angry
that fucking he slams the door behind him we had a fuckin deal and that ed is seething
his secretary timidly speaks
you have a phone call well um
its andy kaufman
shaking with fury ed stares at the telephone
then slowly picks it up
a long pause
then andys voice calmly speaks
you were brilliant
a flabbergasted beat
you were in the moment
you became a producer losing his mind
sincerely joyful it was the best improv ive ever seen
he thinks intently about this
amazingly a magnificent smiles comes over his face
well thank you
see you next week
andy hangs up
ed just sits there astounded
andy zmuda george and little wendy are squeezed in a booth laughing and celebrating
they eagerly read the la times
insert the headline says who is tony clifton
below is a photo of tony being thrown off the taxi set
they all howl
this is great
it makes tony real three dimensional
its very good for his career
zmuda reads one paragraph
was this in actuality andy kaufman
and if it was andy kaufman is andy kaufman crazy
he chortles boy they totally fell for it
im only acting crazy
a few awkward glances
then andy grins at his meal
andy contd boy this is tasty
he shouts to a hey can i please have some more seaweed
a slick booker sitting in a crowded office full of head shots
hes on the phone
hes reading the la times story
shapiro this is gene knight up at harrahs tahoe
wed like to book andy kaufman for our showroom
george on the phone
ehh andy doesnt really like playing casinos
the audiences dont work well for him
the booker thinks
contd what about tony clifton
you want tony clifton to headline harrahs tahoe
being tricky eh sure
were trying to expand our audience base and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman
look i gotta be clear with you
tony clifton is not andy kaufman
yeah yeah yeah
he laughs merrily wink wink
frustrated no im serious
if you book tony do not expect to get andy
laughing harder ill take my chances
george rolls his eyes in annoyance
finally he shrugs
fine be my guest
george is driving in his convertible
suddenly something catches his eye and in shock he hits the brakes
three cars behind him screech crazily trying not to hit each other
george is oblivious
hes staring up at a billboard
the billboard it says harrahs tahoe presents andy george is flabbergasted
george is shouting into a payphone
gene you misunderstood
youre not getting both of them
upset its physically impossible
you said over and over and over tony clifton is not andy kaufman yeah i know what i said
but trust me its not gonna happen
sure it is
tony called me himself
he yelled at me insisting that his dressing room be bigger than andys
theyre both going on tonight believe me
george is stupefied
he looks at his watch
magnificent harrahs dominates the skyline
the marquee blares tony clifton and andy kaufman
george screeches up in a rental car
he jumps out and runs inside
the showroom is packed
it hums with curiosity
waiters clean off the dinner tables
george rushes in and is seated in a far booth with some strangers
he overhears a heated conversation between a pushy man and his wife
youre not listenin
its a very simple concept
youre making no sense
how can they be the same person
youll never see them on stage at the same time
the onstage orchestra hits a fanfare
sharp spotlights meet at the foot of the stage
suddenly tony swaggers out hands over his head in a gesture of triumph
the music stops
george leans in curious as to how andy will wiggle out of this
tony bows theatrically turns back to face the orchestra and waits
the noise level slowly drops but not entirely
tony waits and waits and waits
until suddenly he turns towards the audience and screams everybody looks up alarmed
the general murmur almost dies
tony stands there eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people
as they quiet down
tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms
the musicians lift their instruments
silence is total except for the clank of china
waiters are serving coffee
tony spins back around livid
tony clifton contd people signal shh
the waiters realize tonys addressing them and they stare back in disbelief
this is their job
tony clifton contd yeah
im talkin to you
and you better freeze or ill get your asses fired
tonys outburst is so commanding that they all freeze
the waiters stand there like statues staring in terror
satisfied tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms
again the musicians lift their instruments
in anticipation of loud music the waiters start moving about
audience members start whispering
tony hears this and drops his arms and head in despair
the musicians lower their instruments
tony waits for absolute silence
only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again
and then at that precise moment somebody drops a spoon
tony jolts as if hit by a current
he drops his hands again turns and gives the perpetrator a murderous look
then he turns again lowers his head and waits
the man at georges table whispers to his wife
hes never gonna start
kaufman thinks this is funny
beat weve paid forty bucks for a show thats never gonna start
george grins stupidly
the silence is now deafening
slowly very slowly tony raises his arms
the musicians get their instruments ready
tony stands there and stands and stands waiting for something
to disturb the silence
the whole scene repeats itself
finally finally tony is surrounded by total silence
then only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable he begins to move
tony pivots around looks at the audience
and the entire room looks like tussauds wax museum
tony starts laughing hysterically
the audiences reaction is mixed some people laugh
some ask perplexed questions
some scream obscenities
some even applaud
tony is very happy
he turns to the orchestra raises his baton and commences the downbeat
the music begins
a spotlight hits the wings
and then andy strides out
georges jaw drops
i told you
theyre not the same person
the whole audience bursts into applause
life is back to normal
andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a prepared row of congas
he starts to play
tony clifton grabs the microphone
i wrote this tune for my friend frank sinatra
he had a nice little success with it
but forgot to thank me on the album
he starts to belt i gotta be me
george squints his eyes trying to figure out who this is
tony clifton contd whether im right or whether im wrong whether i find a place in this world or never belong
i gotta be me
i gotta be me
what else can i be but what i am
tonys singing is awful
andy happily accompanies on congas
the audience doesnt know what to think
tonys singing reaches the end
aggressive and off key
tony clifton contd lets bring it on home he hits his screeching climax the band ends with a brassy punch
the crowd responds with george wanders the corridor looking for the dressing rooms
he turns and finds a door marked kaufman
next to it is a door marked clifton
he thinks then opens the kaufman door
andy is inside alone gathering his things
hes pleasantly surprised to see george
george doesnt enter
he goes to the clifton door
george opens the mystery door
and inside taking off the rubber tony makeup is zmuda
george starts hyperventilating
shaking he tries to sit himself down
andy enters beaming
george is amazed
youre so proud
youre like some retarded kid comin home from school look dad i got an f
but wasnt it funny
perhaps headache inducing
softening like that moment when you both came onstage
andy excitedly jumps up and down
see with all these articles people think theyre insiders
they see tony clifton and they say ah thats really andy kaufman
but that spoils it
so now tony denying being me is the truth
tonys not me
but maybe he is
the audience will never know
giddy theyll think theyre laughin at me but actually ill be laughin at them because theyre wrong and im right
george is dazed
so youve got this big elaborate joke which is really only funny to two people in the universe
but we think its kickass
now i get to be tony
i get to dump the glass of water on someone elses head
he turns serious but whats the point
how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world
andy contemplates this
im at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them
but short of faking my death or setting the theater on fire i dont know what else to do
thoughtful cause ive always got to be one step ahead of them
but i feel youre extending this philosophy to real life
nothings ever on the level anymore
a perplexed beat
george it never was
pause didnt you know that
arnold schwarzenegger in his glory days as a body builder on the cover of a magazine
magazines are everywhere
andy is sifting through them
zmuda watches worried
look at this
an evil russian
ooo heres an evil nazi he likes to fight dirty
hey heres an evil japanese guy
what is this world war two
you know i always wanted to be a bad guy wrestler
no offense pal but i just dont think youre built for it
these he menll kick your ass
andys face drops
he realizes zmudas right
beat then andy notices an issue of sumo magazine with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiance on the cover
he slowly lifts it up intrigued
maybe ill pick on someone smaller than me
close up on andy and merv griffin
andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear
he is shouting like a wrestler
and i vow to continue wrestling until i am bea ten in a three minute match with my shoulders pinned to the mat
nonplussed by a woman
by a woman
emphatic im doing this because i feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling
even if they train with weights
it requires a certain mental ability a clumsy pause and uh i just dont feel they have that
the audience murmurs uncomfortably
andy laughs and backpedals
andy contd no no
women are superior in many ways
when it comes to cooking and cleaning washing the potatoes scrubbing the carrots raising the babies mopping the floors they have it all over men
i believe that
an appalled silence
some people start booing
we can tell andy is pleased
andy contd but when it comes to wrestling forget it
if theres a woman that can prove me wrong come up here
ill shut my mouth and pay her dollars
merv baitingly turns to the crowd
all the womens hands angrily shoot up
we move through the crowd finally picking out
a feisty woman lynne
she mutters half hateful half laughing i wanna kill that jerk
andy and lynne stand in the ring
she scornfully watches him preen about
zmuda is in a referees uniform
will you please shake hands go to your corners and come out wrestling
lynne extends her hand
andy fakes a shake then snidely refuses and struts away
the crowd hisses
its the bell
the match begins
lynne barrels at him craving a victory but terribly unprepared for this experience
andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over
andy has trained for this
zmuda gets on his knees watching trying to look official
lynne struggles and slithers away
she grabs andys arm and forces him down
his torso hits the mat
but suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair
her head snaps back
the crowd is incensed
zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning
andy nods and they separate
they do a little dance around the ring lynne looking for a hole
suddenly andy spins her into a half nelson
her arms are pinned
they struggle then he throws her down on her stomach
andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd
im the winner
ive got the he points at his head now baby dont fight nature
get back in the kitchen where you belong
out of the blue and old recording of bouncy piano music starts playing
a chicken clucks to the music and andy lip syncs along doing an obnoxious cock o the walk around the ring
lynne is escorted by a guest coordinator
lynne is dazed
the coordinator hands her a bunch of crap
heres your complimentary photo with merv
heres your turtle wax i dont need turtle wax
every guest of merv gets it
and heres your dinner for two voucher at red lobster
lynne takes her junk and hobbles off
she passes andy who sees her and grins
gosh you scored
look at all those goodies
go patronize somebody else
lynne coldly hurries away
andy chases after her
hey i hope you didnt take that stuff i said seriously
it was just part of the show
eager to impress its like the old days when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd
so you were just pretending to be an asshole
andy nods pleased
its what im good at
lynne stares then begrudgingly cracks a smile
jumbo sized beefy men work out sweating and groaning
in a corner andy lifts huge barbells
george stares pained
merv griffin has received pieces of hate mail
andy merv griffin doesnt get hate mail
that means it was a success
i woke up the audience like punk rock
he hands him a here take this
no im not gonna take it
if i take it ill break my back
he crosses his arms
andy frowns and lowers the weight
george contd buddyboy they detest you
next time you make an appearance women are gonna picket
theyre having a laugh
you havent given them any clues that its a parody
thats because theyve only seen it once
but ill do it again and again and again
a maniacal grin theyll catch on
match andy throws a fat woman to the ground
match andy squeezes a small woman in a headlock
match to match andy throws an italian lady from the ring
he then proudly waves a phony plastic belt over his head
i am the intergender wrestling champion of the world
the crowd boos in disgust
andy is at the box office buying tickets
two tickets jump out of the machine
andy is standing in front waiting
a cab stops and out steps lynne
am i late
no im sure well be fine
andy gives lynne her ticket
they enter the theater
andy hurries up to the candy counter
i really want one
at the counter one large tub of popcorn please extra butter
the candy girl makes andy his popcorn
then heads to the exit
andy contd okay
lynne is baffled
andy the theaters that way
hey i love movie theater popcorn
but that doesnt mean i have to sit through on golden pond
lynne stands in place
andy contd cmon
well go for a walk
beat then she laughs fine
she throws down her ticket and runs after him
they leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk
why did you call me
the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you
i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves
andy is standing in front waiting
a cab stops and out steps lynne
am i late
no im sure well be fine
andy gives lynne her ticket
they enter the theater
andy hurries up to the candy counter
i really want one
at the counter one large tub of popcorn please extra butter
the candy girl makes andy his popcorn
then heads to the exit
andy contd okay
lynne is baffled
andy the theaters that way
hey i love movie theater popcorn

lynne stands in place
andy contd cmon

she throws down her ticket and runs after him
they leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk
why did you call me
the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you
i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves
you were impressed with something
its pretty odd when a man sports a hard on that large on national television
andy is shocked
uh i hope i didnt offend you
im here aint i
a charged moment
andys eyes widen
his speech gets faster
do you wanna to go to memphis and get married
incredulous do i wanna go to memphis and get married
he speaks very because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world
ill go in the ring and ill announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me
then youll come up well wrestle and ill let you win
then youll scalp me and well get married on letterman like tiny tim did on carson
right there on the show
what do you say
lynne stares into his eyes
and all this will be for real
a soft smile if you want
the arena is filled with furious booing southern wrestling fans
ladies in hair nets
men clutching beer cans
this is a rougher crowd than weve seen before
andy stands in the ring unshaven in a torn green robe
hes screaming at them
screaming more boos shut up
show some respect
i want silence when i speak
people booo louder and throw debris
andy is pleased
andy contd if any woman can defeat me i will pay her dollars
then ill shave my head bald
and then as a bonus that lucky lady will get to marry me
screeching jeers and catcalls
lynne jumps up
look here andy kaufman
ill take you on sissy
the mob laughs harshly
ooo the little ladys upset
well i say get back in the kitchen
you get in the kitchen
im gonna make you dry my dishes
the crowd applauds
lynne grins and starts to climb in the ring
andys eyes are ablaze
but suddenly an oversized southern man jumps in and snatches the mike away
this womans a fake
shes nothing but kaufmans girlfriend
andy and lynne are startled
t thats not true its a set up
and i wont allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix
the crowd angrily starts to hiss
lynne whispers to andy
who is that
im jerry lawler the king of memphis wrestling
this gets huge so if kaufman wants to tangle ive brought a real wrestler
shes trained and shes ready
kaufman do you think you can handle
foxy at that a striking muscular black woman stands foxy
the coliseum screams with excitement
people pound their seats
the roar is deafening
lawler gleams cockily
lynne looks worriedly at andy hes concerned
the bell rings
foxy comes out ready to brawl
but andy remains in his corner running down the clock
he nonchalantly peels off his robe
foxy dances around impatiently
andy casually removes a towel from his neck
still stalling andy then takes off his watch
people scream so furiously theyre red faced
andy is tormenting them
a tattooed guy jumps up
are you scared
he cracks his knuckles finally walks over
and commences a windmill
absurdly he spins his arms around and around daring foxy to get near him
she rolls her eyes and waits
the ref jumps out of the way
a minute has counted down
finally andy stops and the real wrestling begins
foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke hold
the crowd cheers relieved
lawler motions signals
foxy yanks but andy jerks away
andy is intrigued
shes coming to play
andy gestures to the ref and points up
the ref looks away and andy slaps foxy
the crowd furiously jeers
the ref spins around and andy shrugs innocence
he then runs at foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes
she bounces off stumbles back and andy drops to his knees
she trips over him and hits the mat
andy aggressively jumps onto foxys shoulders and pins her
the ref counts one
but andy stays on her shaking his ass leering rudely
jerry lawler yells from the corner
alright you won
get off her
andy remains flapping his arms like a chicken
the booing grows
jerry help her
get in there
lawler hesitates then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts andy off
lawler angrily pushes andy down
andy is flabbergasted
w what are you doing
i dont fight men
lawler snickers and walks away
completely overreacting andy grabs the mike
andy contd im gonna sue you
he starts ranting berserkly let me tell you something lawler
i am not a hick im a national tv star
and i dont like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring
i never agreed to wrestle you
so you know what im gonna do
seething im gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent youve got

in a court of law im gonna kick your southern fried rump
lawler snatches the mike and bellows
well i got news for you andy kaufman
wrestling is a serious sport to me
i dont like anyone makin fun of it and i hate anyone insultin the south
so we can settle this two ways we can go to court
or you can get in the ring with a man and wrestle for andy watches fuming
he is infuriated
he cant get away with this

andy grabs back the mike
he sticks his face in shocked lawlers
andy contd sarcastic southern you wanna wraaastle me

back to his regular voice he points at his head im from hollywood
i have the brains

lawler im gonna make you cry mama
andy bears his teeth
enraged lawler tries to take a swing at him
handlers run in and separate the angry men
we hear noise from the main event above
andy and lynne hurry along
she is disgruntled
he swaggers arrogantly still in his fighting outfit
is this an act or are you addicted to causing trouble
he jokingly impersonates a drunk i can shtop whenever i want
then stop treating me like a fucking prop
he drops the act i im sorry
i got caught up in the action
she shoots him a stern look
im warning you kaufman one morning youre gonna wake up
and your heads gonna be shaved
george stares glumly at andy
andy is quite cheerful eating a big piece of chocolate cake
andy do you realize you dont do comedy anymore
wheres that sweet guy who used to do he sings mighty mouse here i come to save the day
long beat please enough with the wrestling
youve lost touch with reality
ingenuous what you dont think i can beat him
he is the southern heavyweight champion
hell kill you
very disapproving first you piss off women

andy shrugs lacking a response
he eats more cake
george contd andy look
theres a job i want you to take guest hosting the tv show fridays

but this is a great opportunity for you
the shows live theyll give you carte blanche and you can get back to the business of making people laugh
andy gets a strange gleam

the fridays cast prepares
in a corner andy is arguing with director jack burns
im not comfortable with the last sketch

andy storms off
eavesdropping cast shake their heads

up in the control booth is maynard
he smiles strangely
stanley sits in front of his tv
the fridays jingle and credits come on
we hear dishes being washed in the kitchen
janice its on
janice rushes in still holding some dishes
the following is intercut between the studio and the show on tv at andys parents
the show is going live
a sniggering narrator steps out front
during his monologue the camera pans the audience
in this next sketch two married couples are out to dinner
everybody has secretly brought along a joint crowd whoops he grins so when each person leaves the table they sneak into the restroom to get a little high
the crowd cheers rowdily

in the front row michael sits with a girl

the girl smiles excitedly
the sketch is on a french restaurant set
andy sits at a table with actor richards and actress melanie
another actress mary tiptoes back over giggling stupidly playing stoned
gee restaurants are amazing arent they
all these strangers sitting around
stuffing dead animals in their faces
its just incredible
she giggles more
the other three play baffled

andy stands and walks out
they sure didnt give andy much to do
he said hes coming back
actors read the menus
suddenly andy returns a strange grin on his face
hes swaying on his feet
the audience whoops yeah
andy awkwardly sits
he has a strange hesitancy
gee that bathroom is so colorf suddenly he stops
the actors glance up
andy purses his lips fretting
an endless pause
andy wont finish the line
the cast looks around worriedly
live tv is beaming out
finally melanie covers

andy shakes his head
the crowd laughs nervously
andy contd i cant play stoned
the tech director and his crew are bewildered
they flip through script pages

andy is torn up inside
whispering to andy just read the cue cards
he shakes his head i cant play stoned
i feel really stupid
the actors are trapped and upset

the tension is awful
unsure beat then fed up richards jumps up and storms off the set
a cameraman hesitantly pans confused what to do
mary is lost
she continues giggling stoned
with the cue cards
irked he dumps them over andys head
the crowd cheers stupidly
you didnt have to do that
andy gets enraged grabs his prop water glass and throws it in richards face
cut it out
melanie slaps her prop butter in andys hair
wide jack runs up from the floor
he gestures at the booth

he turns to andy get off the stage
i said i didnt want to do the sketch
he jabs him andy hits jack
jack recoils and slugs him
they start burly crewmen run in
the crowd whooooos
andy swings wildly
the brawl goes wild
crewmen struggle to separate andy and jack
everyone gets dragged in
in the audience michael tries to run up and help
a security guy blocks him
the tech crew is freaking out
maynard is oddly calm
go to three
eh go to four
stanley and janice are flabbergasted
on their tv fists are flying
suddenly the band kicks in and the show abruptly cuts to commercial
they stare at the tv
until i shoulda made him play outdoors
andy and jack are socking each other
a floor director screams at the top of his lungs
weve gone to commercial
i said andy turns
he notices the red lights are off and
instantly stops fighting
just like that
jack instantly stops too
they glance at each other hold a beat then break into guffaws
they laugh and joyously kid each other
in the audience michael is stunned
oh my god
all the commotion stops
the audience doesnt know whether to laugh or boo
the actors are flabbergasted then furious
melanie contd hes a fuckin psycho
why didnt someone tell us
suddenly maynard runs out of the booth beaming
people watch curiously
andy seems discombobulated
maynard shouts out to everybody assembled
i have an announcement to make
youve all just participated in a happening
to make it real some of you knew and some of you didnt
the audience laughs and applauds wildly
the actors stare in disbelief
one laughs hysterically
most are pissed
maynard contd but we dont want to upset the folks at home
so now andy is now going to apologize and explain that it was all a prank
very quiet right
so lets reset
crew members start moving things around
in the audience michael locks eyes with andy
an odd knowing moment between the brothers
michael whispers getting worried
stanley and janice feel as if the commercials are lasting forever
why is andy doing this
the fridays jingle starts and andys face fades in on the tv
he looks directly into the camera nervous stiff and serious
during the commercial the people at abc asked me to apologize
and to tell you the truth
they wanted me to explain that this whole fighting episode was staged
the sign above blinks applause
the audience obediently applauds
in the booth maynard grins
choking up i cant do this
beat i i cant say it
upset its a lie
a cover up
maynard is suddenly very confused
the crowd laughs nervously
andy contd why are you laughing
im not trying to be funny
they threatened to fire me from taxi unless i gave in to their demands
because what you saw was real
maynard looks like hes gonna faint
cue the commercial
these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks only you never see it because they cut to commercials
he talks extremely fast to get in as much information before hes cut off now for sure theyre gonna fire me so if you want to see me again youll
have to come to memphis
andy gets cut off
maynard jumps up furious
im gonna strangle george shapiro
the parents stare at the commercials
theyre totally disoriented
whats in memphis
that kid is totally meshuga
the announcer stands center ring booming into the mike
the main event of the evening
the match youve been waiting for the king jerry lawler versus hollywood andy kaufman
the theme from rocky plays and lawler enters from the tunnel wearing a shimmering heros cape
the crowd roars with approval
andy is meditating eyes shut at rest in his private oasis
suddenly desperate banging on the door
christ youre on
the theme from mighty mouse begins playing
then andy strides in a sneer on his grungy face
the crowd screams and boos pure pile
andy is euphoric loving the hatred
down in the front row sit stanley janice zmuda and lynne
several photographers take pictures of the parents
they squint unused to all this
andy prances into the ring
he takes the mike
before we begin this event i just wanna say a few things to you foul people
beat this city is filthy
you southerners live like pigs
so im going to teach you some lessons in hygiene
bring you out of your squalor
the crowd is flabbergasted
women in k mart dresses gape
ruddy men in trucker caps glare
andy contd are you listening
audience boos lynne snickers
but stanley and janice are ashen faced
why is he saying these things
theyre gonna lynch him
he shakes his head nah
hes just engaging a passive audience
andy reaches in his pocket and removes
a bar of soap
people this is a bar of soap
does it look familiar to you
if you wet it itll clean your hands
stanleys eyes bulge
the crowd is enraged rumblings of imminent violence
andy smiles helpfully
andy contd and now for your next lesson this is toilet paper
andy holds up a roll of tissue
the crowd goes nuts
jerry lawler races over and snatches the mike trying to maintain his dignity
kaufman weve had enough
lets you and me do what we came here for and ding
thats the bell
andy strikes a threatening pose
lawler takes a step forward and andy instantly cowardly runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring
andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain im smarter
and kaufmans left the ring
lawlers waiting for him to return
to zmuda is this a strategy
lawler disparagingly frowns
the ref checks his watch
andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring gauging his rival
then slowly climbs in until the second lawler moves
then andy leaps back out
and kaufmans left the ring again
he doesnt seem interested in actually making contact with his opponent
andy struts around the floor pointing to his brain
he smirks at various spectators
until he finds himself face to face with his parents
an unexpected moment
andys finger frozen on his brain
janice shakes her head despairingly
lets go home
the paparazzi love these moments
dont worry mom
ill make you proud
beat then andy gets hit in the head with a cup
disoriented andy returns to the ringside
lawler is losing his patience
did you come down here to wrestle or to act like an ass
andy paces around unsure of his next move
lawler contd look
if you get in here ill give you a free headlock
lawler leans down and offers his neck
andy peers skeptically
andy looks at waiting lawler
then tentatively climbs in
as promised lawler doesnt move
so andy crosses over and grabs lawlers head
andy grins triumphantly
he squeezes his arms tight muscles flexing riding high on this moment
until lawler stands and flips him over
andy slams down on his back
its a side suplex
andy lies on the mat unmoving
lawler doesnt care
he picks up andys prone body and grips it upside down
janice covers her eyes
stanley is worried
frantically gesturing lawler disregards the ref and slams andys head in a pile driver
a horrible thud
the bell immediately rings
janice opens her eyes and screams
why isnt he moving
andys parents reaction is a fiesta for photographers
lawler has committed a piledriver which is an automatic disqualification
match goes to kaufman by disqualification after two minutes twelve seconds
andy is splayed unconscious
raging lawler promenades around the ring arms over his head
the crowd shouts crazily rooting him on
lynne runs to the ropes screaming for help
frantic somebody get a doctor
yelling stanley totally numbed holds janice
theyre on the verge of collapsing
tons of commotion
cameras flash blindingly
a stretcher is lifted into the ring

andy is carried through the crowd followed by his entourage
a soft object hits stanley on the head
andy is being carried by the coliseum employees into the dressing room
the entourage follows
zmuda pushes out the crowd of reporters photographers and onlookers
he slams the door and locks it
janice runs to andys side

stanley has a blank expression
but janice starts to cry

she hugs andy tightly
andy is genuinely shocked
he looks at his quivering mother
and then his voice softens truly remorseful
geez im sorry
maybe i shouldnt have put you through all that
quiet well from now on youll always know the rule of thumb anything that happens to me
is not real
a crowd of reporters parts
they make way for andy who is carried out on the stretcher and loaded into a waiting ambulance
he is unconscious
cameras click and flash
the ambulance speeds away siren andy sits watching an old doctor examining a number of x rays clipped to light panels
i dont see any injury to your neck mr
are you sure
but my neck hurts
and i have a slight cough
its probably just a strained muscle
intent doctor i think i need a neck brace
the doctor gives up
if it makes you happy
andy in the ring andy outside the ring on the floor with his frightened parents in a neck brace on the stretcher etc
george zmuda and andy are looking through hundreds of clippings from the newspapers
has been rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis
his parents are at his bedside
fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on televisions taxi
its a rave
boy if i ever fake my death theyll really miss me
its working for elvis
sarcastic yeah hes just laying low waitin for his comeback
he sees an article and winces god listen to this
it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual
wow you cant buy this kind of publicity
george rolls his eyes
george lets not drop the ball on this
ive made some kind of cosmic career move
somebody knocks outside
andy jumps up puts on his neck brace and transforms himself into a shuffling invalid
a delivery boy drags in an enormous basket of flowers and goodies
andy takes the card
it reads andy were all praying for you
your friends at taxi
george is eating with the saturday night live producer lorne michaels
theyre eating lunch in an outdoor cafe
thanks for seeing me on such short notice
he takes a careful beat i
i wanted to talk to you about booking andy on saturday night live
lorne michaels squirms uncomfortably
he chooses his words
george i dont know if andy works for our show anymore
that wrestling stuff
is such a turnoff
we agree completely
tactfully begging andy has to reconnect with his core audience
so i got him on letterman tonight
hes gonna apologize to jerry lawler then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans
lorne michaels mulls this over
hes very sincere
quietly emphatic and he needs your show
lorne michaels nods
itd be good to have the old andy back
andy and jerry lawler are on david lettermans show
andy is pallid hair shaggy in a neckbrace and tweed jacket
husky lawler wears loud red pants and gold chains
andy speaks timidly seeming a bit dazed and regretful
i apologize for all the wrestling ive ever done
im sorry for all the abuse ive ever given
soft i was just playing bad guy wrestler
thats not me
its just a role
but jerry took it personally
lawler and letterman are unimpressed
you said some pretty inflammatory things
he thinks everythings a joke but its not

the crowd whoooos
angst flickers on andys sweaty face
t there wasnt a reason to purposely hurt me youre a wimp

andy jumps up crazed
andy contd lawler freezes in his seat
letterman hides behind his desk
andy storms over out of control
from a safe distance he starts screaming at lawler

andy contd you are full of shit lawler
i he pounds the desk freaked andy leaps up and storms out
the crowd cheers rowdily
an unsure moment
dave glances at lawler
until andy stumbles back in
he tries to calm himself
andy contd i am sorry
i am sorry to use those words on television
demented but you youre a motherfucking andy slams daves desk
dave jerks nervously
crazed andy looks down at daves coffee cup
suddenly andy grabs the coffee and dumps it on lawler
lawler jumps burned
a security guard runs in
andy screams and hurtles away
he slams open the stage door and barrels out of sight
lorne michaels is watching this at home
he gapes in disbelief
a smug comic stands on stage speaking into camera
the shows going out live
um we were supposed to have andy kaufman on our show this week but now our producers arent sure if its such a good idea
beat some of us at saturday night live think kaufmans a comic genius
but others disagree
they say hes just not funny anymore
beat so were putting the decision up to you
please call up and vote
to keep andy call
to dump him call
tight on andy staring at the la times
a small headline says jokester andy kaufman voted off saturday night live he is bothered
this is bad
i only got percent
im like mcgovern in
and this wasnt merv
this was the hippest audience on television
grim theyve turned on you
we reveal that someone else is sitting next to andy
but only the back of his head is visible
george contd its like you two guys wanted to destroy andys career
upsetting all those people
putting out that toxic venom
helpless what did you think would happen
guilty we were just trying to push the envelope youre blind
there is no envelope anymore
beat it hurts me to say this
but theres only one solution pained i dont want you two to ever work together again
and the other person is jerry lawler
he feels bad
we thought it was funny
jer its not your fault
you were terrific
sad but maybe george is right
but i wouldnt have traded it for anything
poignant because for one brief shining moment
the world thought that wrestling was real
andy gulps emotionally
well stay in touch
next time im in memphis ill stop by the house and noreen can make me her double chocolate cake
choked up stay good
andy and jerry hug
a touching beat
until andy gets a quixotic gleam
maybe i can turn it into a bit
i can go back on the show and say it was rigged
demand a recount
you dont get it
somber they dont want you back
andys face drops
the yogi slowly walks down the corridor deep in thought
a few disciples in turbans mill around
nine students sitting in the lotus position are listening to a teacher
the teacher is andy
open your eyes
close your eyes
open your eyes
close your eyes
open your eyes
close your eyes
andy is repeating this faster and faster the students are blinking their eyes faster and faster
the door opens
the yogi sticks his head in
excuse me andy
yes your holiness
the yogi signals andy to step out of the room
andy steps out
this is very difficult for me to say
but perhaps it would be best if you didnt attend the retreat
i attend every year
yes we do not doubt your devotion to tm
but we feel that perhaps
you and the program have grown apart philosophically
andy is stunned
he sighs the wrestling
the sexist remarks
the foul language
these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual
beat it seems you have no respect for anything
andy is stupefied
he doesnt know how to respond
of course i do
the yogi shakes his head
andy cant believe it
he looks around men in turbans staring at him
youve got to let me take the classes
its how i keep myself it is apparently not working
so help me
all i wanna do is pained andy dont raise your voice
we dont wish your presence here
andy is broken
he fights to bottle his rage then notices little wendy down the corridor peering helplessly
beaten andy waves goodbye to her
little wendy gulps then waves goodbye too
middle of the afternoon andy lies in bed
covers pulled up to his face expression glum hes like a tragic still life
suddenly ding dong
its the doorbell
andy ignores this
another ding dong
then go away
oh its open
the door opens
lynne enters holding a carton of ice cream
i brought you haagen dazs
mournful i dont deserve haagen daz
im a horrible person
andy youre not horrible
you dont know the real me
there is no real you
an astonished silence
he slowly smiles
youre probably right
they both giggle
andy studies her
looking at lynnes face body eyes
do you wanna move in together
lynne smiles slyly
she leans down and kisses him
a moving van outside a funky s house
movers carry boxes in
andy sits disoriented in the living room
movers bustle around him
mirrors get leaned against opposing walls and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself
in the b
lynne arranges some vases then hurries out
andy opens a box and pulls out his old howdy doody doll
he smiles then places howdy on the shelf next to the vases
suddenly a phone on the floor rings
our first phone call
he scrambles for the phone hello
ive got some crummy news
long beat taxis been canceled
andy has no response
contd do you want me to come over
talk about it
uh im sorta busy right now
well get together next week
andy hangs up
he just sits there
unsure how to react
andy scratches his head then feels something odd
he goes over to the mirror
on the back of his neck
is an inflamed red pimple
andy contd yuck
very late a clock says
a young comic is onstage performing to the dozen audience members left
in back walks
unshaven morose he quietly approaches paternal owner budd friedman
budd sees him grins and gives him a hearty hug
andy points at the stage and asks for something budd eagerly nods
budd is onstage
and now we have a treat for you late night diehards
the star of taxi here in person andy kaufman
the sparse crowd applauds
budd leaves and andy shuffles up
actually budd youre wrong
i found out today that taxis been canceled
the crowd awwwws sadly
andy contd yeah thats how i felt too
though i dont know why
cause for years all i wanted to do was get off that show
quiet very confessional but now that nobody will hire me and nobody thinks im funny
i guess it was probably a pretty good job
one guy laughs sharply
andy gives him a look thinks then continues
andy contd not to mention that my wife has left me
and she took the kids
he sighs i dont know what im gonna do with myself
my options are sorta limited
beat this morning i noticed ive got a cyst or some kind of boil on the back of my neck
its really disgusting
the red lump is bigger grosser
the crowd groans revolted
andy contd so i was thinking since im sort of a quasi celebrity that i could charge people to touch it
candid does anybody want to pay a buck to touch my cyst
a couple stoners giggle and clap
andy coughs then frowns
andy contd im serious
then a few curious people walk up to the stage
the first taker is a goofy blonde woman
she starts to reach for the cyst when andy stops her
andy contd no no you gotta pay first
she nods discomforted and reaches for her purse
a busboy sweeps up
budd counts money in the cash register
andy shuffles out of the showroom
he waves some bills
i made six bucks
thats good money
budd stares sadly
this is a comedy club not a medical sideshow
trying to be kind if you wanna perform here take a shower get some sleep and pull yourself together
come back and do the material that people love do the mighty mouse the foreign guy
andy you gotta snap out of this funk
if you can ill give you the headline spot tomorrow
the wheels are spinning
george is driving down melrose listening to the radio
he glances at the passing marquee then does a doubletake
it says andy kaufman p
puzzled george hurries inside
comics greet him hey george
george you got a second
george distractedly waves and moves through
at the showroom door he finds budd
hey whats going on here
george you wont believe it
i got andy to do all the old material
grinning and hes killin them
inside theres huge laughter
georges eyes widen
piqued he goes in
and its packed
andy is onstage playing struggling lovable foreign man
but one ting i do not like is too much traffic
tonight i had to come on de freeway and it was so much traffic
giggling it took me an hour and a half to get here
foreign man chuckles pathetically
the crowd howls
andy as foreign man contd but talking about the terrible things my wife
take my take my wife please take her
t take my wife please take her
the rhythm is thrown
a couple laughs
a flustered pause
andy glances down then continues
andy as foreign man contd no really i am only foolink
i love my wife very much
but she dont know how to cook her cooking is so bad is terrible
h her cooking
andy stumbles uncomfortably uh cooking is so bad is terrible
the laughs are weaker
the act is getting wrecked
in back george grimaces
who the hells doing this
angry george hurries down front looking for the loud jerk
he scans the tables
and its zmuda
andy as foreign man contd but right now but right now i would like to do for you some imitations
first the archie bunker
andy freezes up
the audience is embarrassed
a frazzled confusion then andy drops the accent
he glares at zmuda
sir do you have a problem
yeah my problem is youre tired
i i was asked to do this material sure because your new stuffs a bunch of crap
kaufman people are sick of you
defensive hey that stuff gets written up in the papers who gives a shit
its not funny
george is dumbfounded
to himself why
i used to think you were original
i was very original
yeah exactly was
but now youre creatively bankrupt
he gleams cruelly in fact ladies and gentlemen kaufmans so desperate he paid me to do this tonight
im a plant
its just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken down routine
back to andy isnt that true
the audience averts their eyes
a painful silence
andy kaufman has been destroyed
andy and george walk sadly down the street
there is a horrible gloom over them
the world thinks andy kaufman sucks
so i was just giving em what they want
sadly andy they dont think you suck
lost a reason to love you
the guys stop walking
george gently speaks
george contd youve gotta make the public embrace you again
you have to win back their sympathy
ill come up with something
the telephone wakes up lynne in the new bedroom
she looks over andys not there
she looks at the clock and its am
she picks up the phone
where are you
ive been worried sick
where do you want to meet
okay ill call them
late night hollywood weirdos mill about
andy sits with bleary lynne zmuda and george
zmuda admires the menu
look at that grand slam
two eggs two bacon two sausage two pancakes
how do they do it
they get you on the coffee
irritable excuse me but could andy tell us why were here
all heads turn
a long pause
then andy stiffly speaks
i have cancer
hey thats good
we can make that play
spitballing and well really drag it out
you get better you get worse
its in terrible taste
i want nothing to do with this
lynne is puzzled
andy are you serious
grinning serious like a heart attack
hey maybe i can push you around in some goofy wheelchair
andy softly shakes his head
no its true
i have lung cancer
you dont even smoke
emphatic i i got some freaky rare kind
its called large celled carcinoma
lynnes eyes tear up
she hugs onto andy
can they cure it
they dont know
theyve gotta run more tests
starting to cry have you told your family
i feel bad ive jerked em around so many times
george and zmuda glance skeptically at each other
confused george leans in to andy
you look me in the eye and tell me this is true
george its true
george confronts zmuda
if i find out youre behind this ill kill you
what are ya talkin about
i was the one saying i didnt believe it
thats the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up
andy is doing laundry
he empties the clean clothes puts them in a basket and carries them to the rug
then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns
focused impassive andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it
lynne enters emotionally wrecked
she stares in frustration at andys behavior
how can you be so casual
he shrugs even if im dying i still need clean socks
youre not dying
youre probably right
he keeps working
lynne loses it
god youre so detached
lynne storms out
andy finishes his socks
he turns on the tv
on the tv its lassie
little timmy is laid up in bed with a broken leg
suddenly lassie runs in holding a book
lassie places the book on his lap
the boy smiles gratefully
thank you girl
youre my best friend
timmy warmly embraces the dog
andy is terribly touched
tears start rolling down his face
terrible grief until he wipes his cheeks
andy collects himself then reaches for a phone
he dials a long number
on phone dad
andy lies under the machine
it bombards his body with powerful radiation
the whole kaufman family is gathered
stanley janice michael and carol listen to a bland doctor in a white coat
the cancer started in andys left arm and spread to his lungs
weve initiated an aggressive radiation program
see if we can eradicate the affected cells
his beeper goes off excuse me
ill be right back
the doctor leaves
a somber silence and then janice bursts into tears
stanley hugs her tightly
carol watches the doctor with great hostility
his old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention
he leaves and she frowns
what a crock
angered how dare you make light of this
dad i cried when he broke his neck
hes not gettin me again impassioned jesus
hes got lung cancer
a standoff moment
carol loses it
see thats exactly it
he picked lung cancer because he doesnt smoke
that makes it weird
if hed picked leukemia itd be totally believable and wed all be going poor andy hes really sick
so he chose lung cancer because he wants us to be scratching our heads saying is this real
trying to convince herself of course its real
were in a hospital
mom its cedars sinai
its a showbiz hospital
andys studio friends probably run this place
he plans these things out
he takes over hires actors
beat personally i didnt think that doctor was very convincing
did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes
he didnt have doctor shoes
a moment of total silence
all four of them look at each other
a glimmer of hope
we all know hes talked about faking his own death
sure but what if he isnt
sad poignant my son could be dying
and were actin like were on candid camera
george pulls up in his convertible
he jumps out
he walks to the door and starts to knock when suddenly it creeps open
its lynne putting her finger to her lips shh
the house is dark
lynne leads george into the shrouded living room
and andy is sitting in a lotus position concentrating
in front is a wild haired man in a purple robe
i want you to visualize
visualize big healthy white cells in your body
now visualize little cancer cells
now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells
i see them
i see the white cells
in the corner george stares
hes fighting his skepticism
the drapes are open
sunlight streams in
andy hugs the teacher goodbye and the man leaves
george has been waiting in back
what was that all about
its visualization therapy
hes helping me turn inward and fight the disease
hes an actor
i remember him in the in laws
andys eyes widen
his wheels are spinning fast
but hes also ordained in holistic medicine
on george he glares stewing
george is fed up
on andy an unspoken tension
then suddenly he breaks down
andy contd george what am i supposed to do
im sick and im tryin to get better
but everyones lookin at me funny
even you come to my home and act like im puttin on a skit
you must take a little pleasure in it
beat but that doesnt mean i dont need everyones support
i cant be surrounded by negative energy
george shakes his head
andy youre surrounded by what you create
you are the king of negative energy
thrown y yeah
well then it has to stop
because if these bad vibes get out
then everyone will be talkin about how sick i am and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and then im dead
andy struggles to remain composed
so how can i help you
i wanna go back to work and put on a happy show
bright eyed the best show anybodys ever seen
do you wanna tour the clubs
i wanna reach the top
beat carnegie hall
george gently smiles
a staff meeting at the national enquirer
im working on a great cover story ive got a guy in the lab at cedars
he says andy kaufman is dying of lung cancer
the room groans
no more kaufman stories
hes burned us too many times
yeah hes definitely not dying
hes playing carnegie hall next month
the reporter frowns
only kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt
a mm projector runs a scratchy s movie short on the wall
smiling fake cowboys and cowgirls dance the cowgirls straddling hobby horses
they all sing
ive got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
andy george and zmuda watch
andys face is enthralled like a kid
this is great
the crowds gonna love this
giddy thinking hey
do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive
if they were theyd be pushin
well call sag
itd be cool to get one on the show
excited i want the evening to build and build
its gonna have the most incredible ending singers dancers the hallelujah chorus then the sky opens and santa claus comes flying down
and you say santa what am i gettin for christmas
and he says cancer
no no no
none of that
i want this show to be positive
but this shows gonna cost a fortune
even if it sells out youll still lose eighty grand
i dont care about the money
i just want the show to deliver
so whos gonna pay for it
beat you know tony doesnt have that kind of money
then hell borrow it
i know tony better than you do
even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off hell do it
george considers this then slowly nods
andy silently sits
the doctor and two nurses administer a chemo drip into andys body
he stares at the needle in his arm
the chemo begins
a dressy new york crowd pushes into carnegie hall
the marquee says andy kaufman
the show is on
andy effusively plays his conga drum and sings nonsense words to allouette gentille alloutte
abbu daba abi abbu daba
abbu daba abu dabu do
to the crowd abbu dabbu da ba do
in the audience george sings along too
a ba du ba ti la ma na go
grinning abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi tabu la
the crowd hopelessly breaks out laughing
andy laughs along
theyre all having a good time
the corny jingle jangle cowboy movie is playing on a big screen
beaming andy grabs the mike
ladies and gentlemen
im pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that film eleanor cody gould
frail eleanor gould comes onstage
andy contd its such an honor to have you here
squinting into the lights andy
this is so overwhelming
well its gettin even better
cause we found one of the original hobby horses
do you do you think you could treat us to a few steps from jingle jangle jingle
eleanor starts to protest but andy hands her the hobby horse
andy turns away goes to the band and starts conducting
they begin to play jingle jangle jingle
eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles
andy gets excited and conducts faster
eleanor is sweating
she dances faster
andy impatiently speeds up the music more
eleanor desperately skips in circles trying to keep up
when suddenly she grabs her heart
eleanor stops and collapses
a horrified gasp from the crowd
the band stops playing
crew members run on from backstage
one checks her heart
shes not moving
zmuda runs out horrified
is there a doctor in the house
the crowd is stunned silent
pause then one man stands
straight faced he hurries out of his seat sprints down the aisle and goes on stage
michael checks her pulse and loosens her blouse
he presses eleanors chest trying to restart her heart
but then he shakes his head sadly
the crowd moans sadly
michael covers eleanor with a jacket
andy watches pleased
suddenly he coughs harshly
andy drinks some water
then he puts on a goofy indian headdress and runs back out
eleanor lies dead
andy skips over and starts doing an indian war dance around her body
the crowd is baffled
andy whoops he chants
and then eleanor starts to rise
he whoops triumphantly
she lives like frankenstein reborn
the crowd cheers surprised and giggling
ladies and gentlemen shes alive
ladies and gentlemen the mormon tabernacle choir
rear curtains part and the mormon tabernacle choir belts out the hallelujah chorus
the crowd goes nuts
andy contd oh my gosh its the rockettes
yes indeed two dozen rockettes rush in from the sides legs kicking high
the crowd whoos
andy contd girls and boys its santa claus
snow start falling and santa on his sleigh drops from above
the crowd screams with excitement
they leap to a standing ovation
in front are stanley and janice
they start crying
beaming andy embraces eleanor
then he takes the mike
andy contd and its not over yet
cause im taking you all out to milk and cookies
the crowd laughs
andy contd im serious
a thousand people file out and thirty five schoolbuses are parked up and down fifth avenue
the crowd is awed
andy euphorically marches out pushing his endurance
hes the pied piper
theres enough cookies for everyone
the schoolbuses pull up to a school
the disoriented passengers step out not sure what to expect
the audience crowds inside
and lady cafeteria workers in hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies
at a little kids table sit andy and lynne
andys face is pure joy
he watches all the adults munching on their cookies everyone giddy at the silliness of it all
andy smiles beautifully
he squeezes lynnes hand then whispers
i dont want this to ever end
a stucco spa resort sits in the middle of the rocky desert
a room with soft lighting and billowing curtains
a new age healer is laying crystals upon andys body
his hat is off revealing hes bald
now well place a blue crystal
very high vibrations
its wonderful for its healing powers
lets try two of those
and one of the pink ones
zmuda stands with a swarmy administrator
your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day but its just not helping
beat the cancers terminal
that wasnt made particularly clear to us when he checked in
irked look personally i think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit
but if it makes andy happy thats all that matters
the man purses his lips
im sorry to sound crass but we dont want to be that health resort in new mexico where andy kaufman died
beat im going to have to ask you to leave
zmuda is speechless
zmuda angrily packs andys bags
zmuda is seething
but andy is strangely calm and unaffected
its okay bob
it wasnt really working
a gentle smile well find something better
lynne and little wendy are cooking andy lunch
lynne mashes up strange unidentifiable plant products
what is this stuff
its all macrobiotic
millet burdock root kelp
andy says itll purify him
suddenly a sharp voice
what is that crap
looks like somethin my dog would puke up
the women turn
its andy dressed as tony clifton
a spooked moment
tonys wig peach tux and sunglasses are there
but andy is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude
how bout me and you dolls go get some real food french fries and a porterhouse steak
not sure what to say andy
little wendys eyes pop oh no she broke the rule
tony gets very indignant
i aint andy
andys sick pick chick kick lick
the doctor says hes a goner
rousing himself but tonys built like a mule
andy asked me to be his pallbearer
ill do it for him
im getting stronger and stronger
here watch this
tony picks up a chair and starts lifting it up down up down
worried the women rush to stop him
they take the chair
cmon put that down
yeah youre right
we better get movin
we dont wanna miss happy hour at kelbos all the mai tais you can drink for
tony jauntily turns to exit
he gestures to the ladies
tony clifton contd lets go
he starts singing new york new york these vagabond blues are washin away
ill make a brand new start of it
tony reaches the doorway and collapses
he clutches himself in pain
shocked they run over
tony lies huddled on the ground
he mutters sadly defeatedly
the sun is setting purple and orange over the hills
andy and george lie on chaise lounges serenely staring out
andy has a blank look on his face and has lost more weight
he is a shadow of himself
i cant move my arm
awkwardly youve got good days and bad days
andy softly sighs
my hair is coming out
george silently pats andy
andys energy is sapped but he forces himself to be upbeat
ive got an idea for a new tv show for me to star in
its called uncle andys fun house itll be a saturday morning thing where i can goof off with the kids
you know puppets magic tricks
george is choked up
he goes along with it
long pause i think we can sell that
george struggles not to shatter andys enthusiasm
andy smiles gratefully
thanks for always backin me
george clenches andys hand
did your doctor say its okay for you to go back to work
ehhh you know those guys
if he had his way id be stuck in the hospital running tests all day
beat and anyway ive found a new guy whos gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer
hes a psychic surgeon in the philippines and hes amazing
he rubs you and sucks the disease right out
george stares sadly
he sounds like one of your characters
his voice gets hushed
this guys special
very sincere he performs miracles
george doesnt know how to respond
andy looks up pleadingly
andy contd hes my last chance
baguio a tiny scratched in the dirt philippine city
suddenly a rattletrap commuter plane lurches out of the sky
it hits a dirt runway
chickens squawk and run
andy lynne and zmuda ride through the impoverished city
andy stares in amazement
they reach a brick building
a sign says clinic with an eye over a triangle
a nurse hurriedly helps weakened andy sign a bunch of forms
money is handed over
andys clothes are stripped off
theyre thrown in a locker
a large white tiled room
lynne and zmuda roll in pallid andy his limp body unmoving
andy looks up
and theres a long line of sickly people
primarily japanese emaciated all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand
they have a look of desperation and reverence
at the head of the line is jun roxas at his work station a bench a sink and attendants with clean towels
a sickly woman crawls onto the bench
jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach kneading searching
pause then he removes some bloody he flings them into a bucket
the woman cries out
the woman is helped away
jun turns to wash his hands
an attendant gives him a towel to dry with
then a sickly man crawls up
andy rolls closer
he stares at all this with fear
jun impassively presses his hand against the mans head
he concentrates searching
then pulls out some bloody guts
he flings them into a bucket
the man shakes
he is helped away
andy is wide eyed
he gets closer
more bloody guts
andys excitement builds
then he reaches the front
lynne and zmuda stare into andys eyes drawn in by his total belief
they are overcome
it feels like theyre saying goodbye
lynne gives andy a tender kiss
zmuda starts to shake his hand and instead hugs him tightly
andy smiles then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair
they help him up to the bench
andy lies down
fluorescent lights buzz overhead
he looks over and jun roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient
andy shivers anticipating the miracle
an attendant gives him a towel to dry off
andy relaxes readying for it all
he glances at juns hands
jun hands back the towel and under it the attendant quickly slips jun a sack of animal intestines
jun discreetly palms it
hes a fake
a moment of stunned disbelief
he is shocked
the faith is meaningless
the joke is cosmic
the con man has been conned
andys overpowering emotions coalesce
and he starts to its sidesplittingly funny
andy laughs and laughs and laughs like a crazy man with no salvation the joy releasing him the tears rolling down his cheeks
his face flushes with color
life sparkles in his eyes
andy laughs and guffaws until hes hoarse
this is the best gag of them all
andy lies in peace in a casket
he has died
his expression is pleasantly bland
almost latka like
but his face is caked with so much funeral home makeup it almost looks like a mask
we slowly widen
the casket is surrounded by beautiful flowers
we tilt up
and high above
is a movie screen
on the screen is a projection of andy silently staring at us
theres a gentle smile on his face
its the image from the opening of this film
andys pov the chapel is filled with grieving mourners
all are in black
everyones quiet in a state of shock
andys family is huddled
lynne sits alone in a pew crying
george gives zmuda a hug
little wendy comes over
and they comfort each other
everyone who ever knew andy is there taxi cast fridays cast tm followers hookers jerry lawler ed weinberger maynard smith budd friedman it goes on and on
and they all have odd discombobulated expressions
they stare up at the projected andy
my show is over
i did my best and i just want to say until we meet again
please remember he begins to sing in this friendly friendly world
with each day so full of joy
why should any heart be lonely
some gathered people tentatively join in the singing
andy on film contd so everybody
put your arm around the person next to you even if you dont like that person
he resumes singing the world is such a wonderful place to wander through when youve got someone to love to wander along with you
with the sky so full of stars and the river so full of songs every heart should be so thankful thankful for this friendly friendly world
the curtain behind the coffin opens and the casket with andys body slowly slides into the darkness
the curtain closes
the film ends
and all goes silent
some people cry
some begin to leave
most of them are just staying numbed
george and zmuda whisper
its a perfect kaufman audience
they dont know whether to be sad or angry
the taxi cast are flustered
why are people leaving
the curtains gonna open
andys gonna come out
i know it
sure the body was just made of wax
a very long beat wasnt it
they look to the front
the closed curtain wafts
then settles motionless
a super slowly appears exactly one year later on sunset two dudes come riding along on skateboards
suddenly they reach insanity
traffic on sunset is jammed
honking limousines jockey to squeeze by
confused one dude squints into the distance and his eyes pop
oh my god
stupefied thats the freakiest thing ive ever seen
his friend turns and gasps
at the comedy store the marquee says tony clifton live
man we were right
hes not dead
hes just been lyin low for a year
hysterical the guys race up to the club
but outside theres a crazed pulsing mob
people are screaming
police have barricades
everybody cries to get in
every square inch is filled with glittery hollywood vips
people make chit chat
but there is a squeamish excitement in the air
a brooding unease
nobody knows what to expect
suddenly the lights go black
a booming announcer
ladies and gentlemen
please put your hands together for
the theme from starts playing
daaaaa daaaaa a small spot appears on a peach tuxedo
the light grows bigger bigger
the tension magnifying
our view widening
until tony clifton is revealed onstage
its an extraordinary theatrical moment without response
the crowd has no idea what to do
how ya doin
tony struts downstage
he waves to the crowd
tony clifton contd how you doin back there
to the front rows how you doin up here
still no response
until a lone reckless voice
the crowd rustles nervously
dont know nothin about no andy
just some dead guy tryin to ride my coattails
to the band lets hit it boys
one two anda one two three four
the band kicks in with disco anthem i will survive
tony starts singing the schmaltzy opening tony clifton contd first i was afraid i was petrified
kept thinkin i could never live without you at my side
he wipes away a pretend tear were you the one that tried to hurt me with goodbye
did you think id crumble
did you think id lay down and die
we pan the room full of enthralled spectators
at a front table are george and lynne
tony attacks the chorus
tony clifton contd oh no not i
as long as i know how to love i know ill simply stay alive
in the crowd we pass face after face smiling
until we settle on a man in the very last row
enjoying the show more than anyone
tony clifton contd ive got all my life to live ive got all my life to give
i will survive
he hits his big finish the music crescendos and the song ends
zmuda grins and applauds proudly
