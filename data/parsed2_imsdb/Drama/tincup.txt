written by john norville and ron shelton december draft
tinny cheatin heart music the dull groan of a tractor crickets chirpin love songs sporadic zaps from bug lights and an occasional random thwock as we out west where the
sun descends gloriously over desolate mountains
a sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty if you ignore the twang of the music the sputter of the tractor the zaps the thwacks
and something else
garrulous with drink fraternity and amusement
we pan down to a man jose is on the roof wrestling with a rickety satellite dish stringing wire trying to get it to work
we get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation
four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of yellow into the gathering darkness
roy tin cup mcavoy stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest light hitting golf balls
launching them really into the deepening night
theres a beer between his legs
behind him a group of men forms a semicircle facing away from tin cup
these men are the range regulars curt clint earl and dewey
each man has money in one hand and his preferred libation in the other
theyre all looking back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back wall and muttering what sounds like bets to romeo posar a smaller man he stands at
the center of the group with a handful of cash
romeo is a part time bookie and full time driving range man
born across the river in mexico romeo is tin cups caddie confidante best friend
okay all bets are down
their eyes rivet on the bug lights edgy hopeful until
a bug is electrocuted
and dewey cheers triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about how they woulda coulda shoulda bet
number one is the winner
dewey has the winner
pays five to two
romeo quickly pays dewey and more quickly takes money from the losers
its fast paced inane time killing gambling
tin cup looks over
dont you shitheels ever get bored
the regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the negative as they turn back to romeo and the action at the bug lights
cuz i got a riddle
tin cup leads the regulars inside
tin cup holds court
takes about two ounces of brains to figure it out
anyone think they got a brain with two ounces of brains in it
the regulars silently look at each other reluctant to reveal the heft of their brains
for chrissakes boys
a little self confidence from the players gallery
we aint talking long division
timidly how much we gotta lose
you want to liven things up earl
thats a hell of an idea
say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the riddle
you going to get the riddle tin cup
im the one asking the riddle
i already know the answer
i dont getta guess
we could say if i get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle i get the pot
and i know what youre thinking
its an impossible riddle
well its not
its an easy riddle
and if somehow by the grace of fluke luck i win and you all dont agree it was an easy riddle hell ill refund your money
count us in
okay a mans driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash
two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals
son goes into the operating room the doctor looks at him and says i cant operate on this boy
hes my son
hows that possible
beat the clocks ticking boys
tin cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge
father didnt sneak back in right
hes still at the other hospital
it aint star trek earl
no one beamed him aboard
that eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds
the men think harder
if the father married the sons daughter its a family riddle earl
think clean thoughts
the regulars puzzle some more
give us a little hint
the doctors a woman
all heads turn to take in the arrival of standing just inside the door shes a fresh faced beauty in her early thirties and shes got all new everything the
sport of golf requires new bag new clubs new shoes new clothes new visor
she looks like she stepped out of an ad in golf digest
and all the men are asking themselves the same question whats she doing here
the silence invites molly to supply the riddles answer
the doctor is the sons mother
feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run
directly to tin cup i take it youre a feminist
tin cup misses the ball hes been bouncing breaking the spell
the regulars wait for tin cups response
maam ive been called a lot of things but no ones ever saddled me with that one
you might try being saddled sometime the smell of leather the sting of a whip
the regulars snicker enjoying her one upmanship
slightly taken aback im just a humble golf pro
youre roy mcavoy the golf pro
i pictured something
i have a seven oclock lesson
i thought i had a doctor griswold
they hurry out to the range tin cup oblivious to his gaffe
and the regulars gather to look out the window to the range where molly is stretching and tin cup is discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost
the lesson begins
tin cup can be slightly condescending in these situations though shes got him a little wary
the first thing you gotta learn about this game doc is it aint about hitting a little white ball into some yonder hole
its about inner demons and self doubt and human frailty and overcoming all that crap
what kinda doctord you say you were
im a psychologist in laymans terms call me a neo jungian post modern freudian holistic secularist
she begins unpacking one of her bags pulling out every golf gimmick on the market swing aid straps to pull your elbows together a ball pendulum that hangs from your
hat a metal contraption for your feet etc
inner demons and human frailty are my lifes work
i used to practice in el paso but ive moved here now
i ordered these from the golf channel
he stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some of this stuff
hes enchanted and dismayed
that stuffs a waste of money
im sure there are excesses and repetitions here but i believe in the gathering of knowledge and i figured well there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated
by these devices and that youd help me sort through it
she stands there with contraptions coming from every limb
i have dozens of golf videotapes too
and a golf watch
irritated impatient take it off
all of it
youre a smart woman for chrissakes dont you know the work of charlatans when you see it
she deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile
i can always tell when someone is lying to himself but im quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me
pointing to the pile of devices that stuff cost me over dollars then its dollars of shit
he tees a ball hands molly her driver and steps back
take a swing
molly takes a pitty pat swing and whiffs and mutters under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman
well you talk like a golfer molly unloads a mighty second swing
the club head bounces off the mat
the ball sits untouched
these are highly technical golf terms and youre using them on your first lesson this is promising
awright wise ass show me
tin cup takes the club from molly motions for her to step back tees up a ball and rockets a drive into the night
something like that
he hands her back the club and tees up another ball
molly just looks at him
yknow i tend to process things verbally
can you break down into words how you did that
tin cup takes a deep breath this is his speech
what is the golf swing
by roy mcavoy
beat the golf swing is a poem
sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a homerian epic it is organic and of a piece yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains
the critical opening phrase of this song is the grip in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger
displays grip held lightly a conductors
starts swing lowly and slowly the clubhead is pulled back led into position not by the hands but the body which turns away from the target shifting to the right
side without shifting balance
tempo is everything perfection unobtainable as the body coils now to the top of the swing in profound equilibrium
and then a slight hesitation a nod to the gods
a nod to the gods
to the gods yes
that he is fallible
as the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth its alive this swing a living sculpture and down through contact always down into terra
firma striking the ball crisply with character a tuning fork goes off in your heart your balls such a pure feeling is the well struck golf shot and then the follow through to finish always on line the reverse c of the golden bear the steelworkers power and brawn of carl sandburgs arnold palmer the da vinci of hogan the unfinished symphony of roy mcavoy
i have a short follow through my swing can look unfinished
some say its because thats the best way to play through the winds of west texas
and some say its because i never finish anything
you can decide
the point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist the warrior athlete who
finally and thereby has asserted his oneness with and power over the universe by willing a golf ball to go where he wants and how and when because that is
what the golf swing is about
finally it is about gaining control of your life and letting go at the same time
molly stares back exhausted and intrigued
there is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball
im afraid to ask
whats the other theory
grip it and rip it
while i appreciate your poetic sensibility mr
mcavoy call me roy molly
call me dr
but at this point i think im more of the grip it and rip it school
hand me the driver
tin cup does
she tees it up
waggle it doc dont forget to waggle
as she stares at him waggle
the club head
shows her its a little relaxing ritual
she waggles the club head then takes the club back
let the big dog eat
she stops lets the club fall
what big dog
the driver the number one wood its metal
yeah woods are metal dont worry about it and the drivers known as the big dog and im just saying to turn him loose let er rip let the big
tops the ball
it goes ten feet
this is without a doubt the stupidest silliest most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented
cheerfully yes maam thats why i love it
beat and if you hit one good shot if that tuning fork rings in your loin you cant wait to get back
she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night
it felt great and she knows it
i think the big dog ate something
did the tuning fork ring in your loin
i wouldnt go that far
always quit on a good shot
well call that lesson number one
confidentially and if ya wouldnt mind paying me in cash theres a little i
situation im dealing with if youre such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says then why are you at your age out here in the middle of
nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment ducking the i
collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack when youre capable of so much more
her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor so matter of factly that hes disarmed
perhaps im chocked full of inner demons
no youre chocked full of bullshit cheerily same time next week
she heads off to the parking lot
what did you mean i should try being saddled sometime
were you being literal or was that some kind of freudian type deal
beat what kind of saddle
as she walks into the west texas night
she smiles enjoying tin cups confusion
tin cup just stares into the night holding his cash until joses voice echoes down from the roof
i got it
the flag is up
tin cup enters cash in hand as the regulars all gather excitedly around the tv monitor now coming in
a class act there boys probably the first actual lady type female ever seen on these premises shut up boss we got the corpus christi dog track on the dish
this is yer dead mortal cinch lock bet with do reen
everyones glued to the set
a greyhound race comes on from a remote texas track on the gulf
free money boys what does doreen know about the fine art of greyhound breeding
all she knows is she likes the three dog cause his name is pride of odessa cause shes from odessa
get ready for oddessa lation boys
how deep we in
you gave her twenty to one its only fifteen to one on the toteboard yeah but i got every other dog in the race
im just getting even with doreen im not trying to clean her clock
so how much you stand to lose
you said to shoot the wad
i said get even pod
i didnt say shoot the wad
we better see that three dog rolling on his ass
all eyes on the monitor the dogs break
if he breaks slow he wont get creamed
the starting box opens there goes the rabbit the three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch
three dogs dying t
the one dog veers wide going into the escape turn annihilating the field
dogs fly ass over teakettle like bowling pins and uh oh
the three dog clears the pileup untouched hugging the rail
it has a ten length lead as it moves down the backstretch and past the toteboard
the race is over the three dog wins
somebody flips off the tv
finally in a lame attempt to lighten the moment romeo speaks so roy you were saying you felt a little flutter for this doctor lady
yes i was saying that
just before i was interrupted by
bankruptcy a development that the doctor lady as you call her
will consider utterly predictable
the marquee advertises exotic dancers steak
the parking lot is full of pickup trucks and beer cans
tin cup and romeo head toward the entrance
we lost everything boss
we owe doreen twelve thousand bucks
i think i been dating too many big haired blondes
them big haired blondes are a lot smarter n us
beat how we gonna pay her
you underestimate me romes
romeo doesnt realize the truth in his own response
its a bad habit i picked up from knowing you so long
hey tin cup doreens looking for ya im sure she is
they enter the strip joint
a nearly naked dancer on stage to a lot of whooping cowboys
tin cup moves in this world with ease and something that passes for grace
everyone knows him
hey tin cup havent seen ya in three days
busy man courtenay busy man as they pass the stage even the naked dancer interrupts her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills tin cup
hiya honey lookin sweet
and backstage they go easily waved through by another bouncer
they come up to a dressing room door
a voice from inside
that better be you roy
enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity
and there she is doreen at least the classic chesty hippie big wigged texas goddess
shes older than the other girls and more experienced in every way
shes smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her strippers outfit
tin cup and romeo stand at her beckoning
youre looking particularly lovely this evening this is nicer than the leopard suit cut the horseshit guys
the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow so i figure theres gonna be a big ol pile of fur at the turn
and the three dogs gonna tiptoe around it and walk on home
i was right
smiles you owe me twelve thousand dollars
we going to pay you
tin cup squirms as doreen babbles a bit
i know youre going to pay me
admiring her own outfit yknow i finally got rid of the leopard suit thing it was so retro yknow
its not easy being a post modern stripper
twelve big ones
tin cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces some official looking papers
he hands them to her
with equity and inventory its worth twelve grand
more or less
doreen leans forward to examine the papers
she looks at tin cup with surprise
this is how you think you can settle up
by deeding me your driving range
only on condition you dont sell right away and men romeo keep our jobs
what in the world would i want with your stupid driving range
equity inventory cash flow
not to mention an enhanced stature in the community and prepaid membership in the salome chamber of commerce
for a moment doreen can only stare dumbly at tin cup caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune
then she starts to consider the idea more seriously
what are your labor costs
off no response from tin cup payroll roy
what do you pay
the tractor kid gets five bucks an hour
romeo he gets ten cash what do you pay yourself
doreen nods in a way tin cup finds threatening
to hit golf balls all day
when youre not breaking for beers or corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next
youre referring to my managerial salary
im referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every bag of beer nuts you lift from the rack is what im referring to
beat ill say its worth ten and you still owe me two
she smiles he sighs
tin cup parks his big old red cadillac convertible out front
he goes around to the trunk opens it takes out his golf clubs and carries them into the pawn shop
tin cups domicile parked near a slow moving river
the red cadillac is parked out front next to romeos mercury comet
with horror inside
the winnebago you hocked your golf clubs
tin cup sits on the couch swigging maalox
i still got two grand to pay off
and i cant see my new salary of seven bucks an hour plus lessons getting it done
but your clubs are your livelihood
well the hood aint too lively at the moment
a car horn sounds from outside
whoever it is tell em im in houston on business
romeo opens the door and steps outside
what you doing in town
romeo steps outside to greet simms
romeo and simms under the awning
a spiffy new car parked nearby
david simms looking every bit like the successful tour pro he is
payne stewart to tin cups maynard g
its been awhile
is tin cup around
romeo is evasive
hes on business in houston
you supposed to be out playin on the golf tour
unfazed well you tell him im in town for my big charity best ball tournament and i got a spot for him when he comes back from
you got a spot for tin cup
i thought you hated him
you wound me
im fond of the guy going way back to our days at university of houston when we won all those titles together
he says he carried you on his back
simms wont be drawn into this adolescent competition hes too comfortable with himself and his success
i didnt have much craft back then just a little native ability
roys a great ball striker
why you here
i want to win my own tournament and he can help me if we can manage to behave like grownups together
tell him that
tin cup suddenly appears in the doorway
whats the catch
there is no catch
i put together a tournament with an elite field and a half million dollar purse and im tired of seeing all the money head out of town
then make more birdies
i need you on my team
you aint that friendly a guy
were playing cottonwood where you once shot fifty nine where you can shoot sixty five in your sleep cuz you know every bump on every fairway every subtle break on
every green warily you an me me an you like the old days
tin cup cant quite believe this offer from his old nemesis but there arent many options out there
he grabs simmss hand and starts pumping it gushing with enthusiasm
well put er there partner
these two homeboys are gonna show the world what golf in west texas is all about
i didnt mean i want you to play with me
i just want you to caddie for me read my putts club me that kinda stuff
tin cup wilts like a time lapsing daisy
his hand falls free of simmss
words fail him
you son of a bitch
to himself blankly caddie
i cant bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament
its a big time event corporate sponsors thirty dollar tickets
i got a network to cover interrupting
outraged this guy off the street he could kick your ass on that golf course
like he kicked your ass in junior golf
like he kicked your ass in college
like ill pay you a hundred for the loop five percent of any earnings get the hell outta here
take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here
okay okay just thought id offer you some work
simms heads to his car
ill take the job
well take the job
simms nods in agreement and exits
tin cup stands there with romeo feeling humiliated
drives away down the road
that man stands for everything i hate in life
you mean like
banners and galleries and concession tents create the atmosphere of a polite circus
billy mayfair putts out on the th green to polite applause
the two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow including tin cup
a leader board reads simms stadler mickelson a giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant green which is fronted by a lake as stadler hits a three wood
toward the green the ball plunks in the middle of the lake
the gallery groans
stadler just shrugs to simms as if to say i thought i had enough club
like i told you it was moren you had in the bag
i had to go for it after your caddy said he could get home from here
simms swivels his head around to look at tin cup
simms looks away at the shot hes facing a two hundred fifteen yard carry over water
he looks back at tin cup shaking his head
i gotta hand it to you roy
for fifteen holes youve seemed to grasp the concept here im trying to win and your job is to help me
five percent of your earnings does numb the gag reflex
give me the seven iron
im laying up
you can make that shot
the smart plays to lay up
these fans didnt pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five
im sitting on a two shot lead with three to go and my partners in his pocket
suddenly pars a good number
gimme the seven iron
youre going for the green
these fans paid good money to see golf shots they cant hit not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit
simms reaches for the seven iron
tin cup clamps a hand over the club
thirteen years on tour and youre still a pussy
hit the fucking one iron dave
thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this games about your testosterone count
simms removes tin cups hand from the seven iron and grabs the club stepping up to address the ball
tin cup mutters to the gallery
two fifteen to carry and the tour stars laying up
and the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging simms to go for the green
simms motions for tin cup as
but if youre gonna editorialize do it on the other side of the ropes
i got no qualms about firing your ass right here right now
hell i should fire you
simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron and stadlers still standing back where he hit the shot into the lake
mickelson and gary mccord the other team in the pairing are there with him
romeo stadlers caddie stands just behind them
mccord to mickelson i know you could knock it on from here im just saying that caddies been drinking muddy water if he thinks he can
all the players look at romeo as simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of the water to a smattering of polite applause
simms tosses the club back to his bag as tin cup retrieves the divot
and hey dave
we in a hurry
simms looks several yards back where stadler is still standing with mccord and mickelson
cause i just bet mccord and mickelson that your caddie could knock it on from here
were trying to win a tournament pardo
but im getting five to one
the announcer from the golf channel looks at the monitor where a hand held camera is picking up stadler motioning tin cup over
from two fifty from a snarly lie over water on national tv with no warmup
id give ten to one to a tour pro
stadler mccord and mickelson are smiling at the bet
this is golf
but simms snarls at being challenged
stadler drops a ball in the rough for tin cup to hit
here ya go
take a hack at it
balls versus brains roy
you hit that shot just keep walking cuz your ass is fired
tin cup mulls over the warning as stadler mccord mickelson come on roy
your fans are calling
stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery
tin cup puts down simmss golf bag
how you gonna fire me in front of all these people
especially when i knock it on the green
and he heads over to where stadler and the others stand waiting
peter kostis with a hand mike following the group begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding
on mike it seems like the charity tournament is taking a little
break for a side bet here gary mccord moves toward the camera and takes the microphone
mccord peter ive done a little background here this unfolding disasters a driving range pro named roy mcavoy who everyone calls tin cup
locals claim he he was a pretty good college lick and knocked around the mini tours
tin cup steps up to hit the shot
mccord lowers his voice
mccord but i guarantee you hes about to suffer brain arrest
hes thinking about the cameras and the gallery and the water and all that gray matter between his ears is turning to goo
and incidentally stadlers got it booked at ten to one
tin cup swings and the camera picks up the ball arching high and true off the club
it lands on the green
the crowd roars
and the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet from the pin
kostis and mccord hes not that good
hes definitely not that good
back to the course a scuffles breaking out
david simms helping some guy over the gallery rope
simms walks the guy back to his golf bag
and now tin cup understands whats happening and take a hike roy the loops over
you cant fire me
how can you fire me
i just knocked it stiff from two fifty
gimme that bag
tin cup reaches for the bag
the guy holds onto it
they wrestle briefly as simms sighs with fatigue and looks for a marshal
tin cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals approaching
he turns his anger on simms
what about my money
you just hit the shot that took you out of the money
welcome to life on the tour
tin cup goes after the bag again
the guy still hangs on
the marshals arrive and begin to wrestle with tin cup
he goes berserk
a wwf battle royal
introducing sports machine with george michaels
and finally sports machine brings you a bizarre incident
a brief highlight of tin cup going crazy wrestling with the marshals and replacement caddie
driving range pro roy tin cup mcavoy
male laughter greets the shot and hey tin cup
you made the news
the regulars crowd under the tv on the wall above the till hooting at what they just saw
tin cup is nowhere in sight
romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can of water where the balls are washing
tin cup sits on a bench alternately swigging cheap whiskey and maalox
if i had it all to do over id still hit that shot
nods with neither rancor nor irony the look comes over your face you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel
tin cup looks over at romeo for signs of an implied pejorative
but romeos just washing and scooping balls
and looking badly in need of perspective
you know why id still hit that shot
now romeo looks over
and he decides that tin cup is the one in need of perspective
cuz its the only way you can beat david simms
cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not
cuz you get that look on your face
pauses adding weight to his thoughts id hit it again because that shot was a defining moment
and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you
i did not shrink from the challenge
i rose to it
romeo nods holding his peace
fort washington golf club fresno california final round of the tour qualifying school
tin cup cringes at the memory then moves for the high ground
i was playing to win
a defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut
three wood into the wind from a hilly lie four in a row out of bounds until you finally pulled it off and tapped in for a thirteen
beat when a twelve woulda got you on the tour
that was a defining moment and the definition was shit
greatness courts failure romeo
thats why most people in their whole lives never ever reach for the brass ring never know when to dig deep and try for the impossible shot
youre right about that boss but sometimes
par is good enough to win
tin cup tosses down another maalox cocktail
parking lot full of the usual suspects as a bump and grind version of yellow rose of texas floods outside
doreen dances in a yellow rose outfit a more classic strip look than her protegees
held aloft by the eager locals in the front row
and then a handful of papers held aloft by one roy mcavoy also in the front row
doreen dances over and picks the papers from his hand reading them as she dances
the diehard west texas calcutta the duvall county boys club pro scratch woodys steak house one club scramble
what do i want with all these entry forms
its a business proposition
im offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer
in exchange for what
my driving range back
she dances away from him not exactly sold on the idea
she dances back to him reclines a leg on the partition and moves her face opposite his
roy im not as dumb as my hair makes me look
they aint all strictly minor league
one of em pays almost two grand
she twirls off
he chases her beer and entries in hand
now wait doreen
you gotta do the math and you gotta look at how good im playing
i hit the shot of the tournament at the best ball
they put it on national tv
and what does that tell you
the music comes to an end
the club is momentarily silent
shouting and what does that tell you
it tells me you took an unauthorized day off
next time it happens youre fired
in the meantime im putting in a time clock
im not punching in no time
clock like some working stiff
tin cup punches the new time clock which is located under the awning near the ball wash
kachunk goes the time clock as he hurries outside and there he finds molly waiting on the tee with her driver and a bucket of balls
am i early
mcavoy i can appreciate that you have a fairly laid back relaxed lifestyle but i have hours to keep
a former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of pisces something about floating through the universe he tees a ball for her
and steps back
shes staring at him half amused
you amuse me roy
but im the only woman in america born after world war ii who thinks astrology is a crock of shit
beat now lets see if the big dogll eat
set up to the ball like i showed you last time
molly addresses the shot
her stance is rigid overly
tin cup winces
but she looks terrific
quit trying to wring that clubs neck molly
show it a little warmth and compassion
he moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders
remember this games about trust and touch and letting go
so while im subtly enhancing your technical prospects why dont you tell me all about your personal life
its none of your fucking business roy
tin cups hands move down to square her hips
hes discreet and professional
your boyfriends a golfer thats my bet and hes why youre taking this game up
hell i probably even know him get your hands off her ass roy
and as tin cups hands recoil in alarm
david simms steps onto the range
to simms hi sweetie
crushed and bewildered
a killer smile
the man is absolutely at ease with his own success and charm
a shadow paces across the drape in the lighted window
hes taking her to miami for the fucking doral
how am i supposed to compete with that
romeo ponders tin cups dilemma from the couch
man you are having a bad week
she must think im such a nothing such a loser
a lousy driving range pro living in a winnebago making five bucks an hour plus lessons
she dont know you live in a winnebago
well she sure as hell knows i aint taking her to no doral for massages and mimosas all weekend
i gotta do something with my life
he reflects deeply while romeo shrugs
i gotta rise to a level worthy of the women that think im a joke
you could go out and win the open
pausing as if jarred romeo that idea has promise
i was joking
we talking about the same tournament
the biggest golf tournament in the world
not just the biggest golf tournament in the world the most democratic
what do you mean
i mean its open
anyones got a shot at it
you just gotta get past a local and a sectional qualifier and unlike doral or colonial or the a
they cant keep you out
they cant ask you if youre a garbageman or a bean picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper
you qualify youre in
and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated whos intimidated
i just told you im gonna win the damn thing
you dont got the game
i got every shot in the book
i said you dont got the game
the mental game
the head game
you suggesting i err on the side of excess
you always go out to shoot zero
sometimes you pull it off
but you cant play like that at the open
you win by taking what the course gives you
you win by being humble which you arent and patient which you never will
tin cup comes over to the couch sits down and puts an arm around romeo
well since youre the authority howd you like to teach me how to be what i aint and never will be
you dont ever listen to me
this timell be different
i dont know man
right now you dont even got the money to get your clubs out of hock
my sticks may be in a pawn shop but i got a rake and a hoe at the range
expensive cars in the parking lot a putting green in b
the trunk opens
a set of expensive golf clubs is removed by a wealthy looking guy boone s
he turns to face tin cup and romeo who is reaching into the trunk of roys cadillac
let me get this straight youre going to play me for four hundred dollars with those
romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk
it contains a rake a hoe a baseball bat and assorted garden tools
and ill give ya two a side
i got the title to my car as collateral
im not interested in that piece of shit
thats cuz you think of it as transportation boone
think of it as bragging rights
think of yourself sitting around the bar crowing to your buddies about the cadillac you won off tin cup mcavoy
the real kicker theyll forget all about the winnebago you lost to me
boone addresses the ball on the first tee
no mullies no gimmes no bumping the ball and he rips a drive down the fairway
tin cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag
romeo hands him a pink ball and tin cup shows it to boone
ill be playing a pink lady today
that little pink fag ball supposed to rattle me
tin cup moves over to the tee markers
not unless i knock it by you
and he tosses up the pink lady and fungoes it long and straight down the fairway
tin cup stops at his ball and looks twenty yards back to
where boone has arrived with his caddie at his drive
yep i caught this thing way the hell on the toe
boone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green
drive for show putt for dough big shot
did you hear that romeo
boone was being profound
he has revealed to me the essential mystery of golf
drive for show putt for dough
holds out a palm louisville slugger please
boones a little rattled by tin cups insouciance
you got boone shakin already studying the approach front left bunkers your best angle to the pin
calling his shot front left bunker plugged lie
he tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball
boone gazes with malicious delight at tin cups ball buried in the front left bunker
he watches tin cup take the hoe from romeo and move down into the trap
i want to see a legitimate swing
tin cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting silence
gallery please stand
he addresses the ball choking down on the hoe positioning the blade at an odd angle
he hacks at the ball with an unorthodox chopping motion
the ball pops up in the air lands on the green releases and rolls up a foot from the hole
boones jaw drops
tin cup hit an impossible shot with utter ease and facility
tin cup trades romeo the shovel for the rake takes the pin out of the hole and pool cues the putt home
boone looks at his own sixty foot putt and he knows hes just been had
utterly embarrassingly and thoroughly
without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his roll and drops it on the green
get the hell off my course
tin cup and romeo emerge romeo carrying t
listen swami your job is to teach me patience and humility not to advise me on my love life
my job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for the open much less win it
to get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady
they head up the street under a collonade toward tin cups waiting caddy
not all my thinking occurs below the belt
i actually stand for a few things beside where my next romantic interlude is coming from
then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you cant teach her no more till after the open
tin cup blinks silently a moment feeling slightly cornered
that would make an issue of something that aint an issue
besides im focused
romeo responds with a spanish curse
i mean this is my quest
this is where i stand up for all the little guys everywhere whove had their fill of soulless robots like david simms he may be a soulless robot but hes
a rich happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend whos got you by the huevos beat besides how is getting into the u
open gonna change what she thinks about you
itll prove to her that im not who she thinks i am
but you are who she thinks you are
look i dont bet on a horse with a hard on
here touch me feel as tin cup grabs himself i dont feel nothing
embarrassed hey hey
suddenly a convertible passes simms and molly laughing carefree enjoying each other
the couple in the car doesnt see tin cup grabbing his crotch making a fool of himself on the sidewalk but tin cup and romeo see them
the car disappears down the street
tin cup cools off chilled really and full of chagrin
maybe i got a semi
doreens on the phone between shows and is adamant
i cannot give you time off to win the open
i dont care if its your quest
listens or your destiny
listens or any of those terms you vaguely remember from your cliff notes
listens you shoulda treated me nicer when we were an item then maybe i wouldnt be such a nasty boss
gbye roy i have a business to run
she hangs up and heads out on stage as the music calls
tin cup hangs up the phone and turns to romeo
man ever since i let her dump my ass she just cant resist kicking me in it
maybe you should treat her more like a lady
after she ran off with that dallas banker
she did that after you let her dump you
it wouldnt kill you just once to tell her shes beautiful she can dance shes
are you sweet on doreen
no moren you are for that doctor lady
a couple of deep sighs
two losers with fluttering hearts
great romeo just great
just when i need you to be my friend and coach you go get all gooey about one of my ex girlfriends who just happens to be our boss
anybody comes to me for help on their love life about women is already too far gone
i dont recall asking you for advice
beat women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort zone
actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot shut up romeo
i wasnt really seeking golf tips
its all im good for but you can count on me for that at least
how far off the back foot
bout three balls
golf is so much easier than life
im ready to charge forth in pursuit of my mythic destiny and i cant get time off work to do it
im no expert but it seems to me that the pursuit of a persons mythic destiny is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a
five dollar an hour job in order to do
my lifes a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen
beat i need help
i need advice
i need counsel
beat i need a shrink
you dont know no shrinks
i know one
not the doctor lady
you cant ask advice about the woman youre trying to hose from the woman youre trying to hose
get your mouth outta the gutter
this is a matter of the heart
tin cups caddy pulls up and he gets out goes to the front of a store that is now a health services office
he looks around warily as if someone might see him entering such a place and ducks inside
its the exit cool down room not the waiting room
tin cup sits nervously hes slightly overdressed for the occasion
he looks childlike
the door to the inner office opens a woman comes out and sits down across from him
shes weeping uncontrollably
hes nervous out of place
finally molly enters through the same door because she hears the crying
she sees tin cup an awkward moment then i didnt do anything
wait in there
tin cup slips into the main office while molly consoles the weeping woman
tin cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he heard thats what you do
he stares at the ceiling
molly enters and sits down
are you okay
i need therapy
what do i do
to do it therapy
i mean how do i start doing
in parlance you might understand just kick back and let the big dog eat
he sighs and plunges in
okay okay let er rip
deep breath suppose theres this guy
hes standing on the shore of a big wide river
and the rivers fulla all manner of disaster like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies and most people wont even go down there to dip a toe
but on the other side of the rivers a million dollars and on this side of the river theres a rowboat
i guess my questions this what would possess the guy on shore to swim for it
hes an idiot
hes a hell of a swimmer see
his problems more like
whys he always gotta rise to the challenge
hes a juvenile idiot
you dont understand what i mean by the river
were talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons roy that human frailty you like to blather about not some mytho poetic metaphor you come up
with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit
ymean youre gonna make me feel lousy
i came here to feel better what kinda therapy is this
you dont have any inner demons
what you have is inner crapola inner debris garbage loose wires horseshit in staggering amounts
i aint just some jerk driving range pro who drinks too much booze and eats too few vegetables
youre being defensive cut to the chase and tell me why youre here
im smitten with a woman
is she smitten with you
have you asked her out
shes seeing a guy
i dont know how serious it is but the guys a real horses ass in my opinion
if you shared your heart with this woman maybe asked her out to dinner then it would force these issues out in the open
im afraid shell say no
so what youre saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game not about your personal life
christ i didnt know we were gonna get into my personal life
this is therapy
well jeez i know but i didnt think it was that kind of therapy
what were you expecting
look its rather simple
those risks that you love to take on the golf course the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about you need to apply those risks to your personal life
with the same passion
i should ask this woman out
i should risk coming right over the top and snap hooking it out of bounds left
risk hitting it a little thin and for godsakes roy thats enough
beat look just walk up to this woman wherever she is look her in the eye with those big beautiful green eyes of yours let down your guard and dont
try to be smooth or cool or whatever just be honest and take the risk you can do it
tin cup rises with new confidence
he does several deep breathing exercises trying to work up the courage
she stares at him
and he walks right up to her
griswold i think im in
love with you
molly is stunned
from the moment i first saw you i knew i was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks and when you started talking i was smitten and im
smitten more every day i think about you and the fact that you know im full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually i can bullshit people but i cant bullshit you and in addition most women im thinking about how to get into their pants from day one but with you im just thinking about how to get into your heart molly was clue less
she just stares
optimistically proudly stunned eh
so what about dinner and we can talk about us and if we have a future and how to drop that horses ass boyfriend of yours roy slow down hey
i just hit a eight degree driver off a cart path here im staring eagle in the face this is a terrible mistake
tin cup is knocked off his horse
into deep rough
im acting from the heart so i cant make a mistake
beat i am one horrible shrink
i didnt know you were talking about me
would your advice have been different
shes frustrated and at a loss for words
you better leave
crushed tin cup heads to the door stops and turns
im gonna qualify for the u
open and kick your boyfriends ass
whatever you think of me you should know that your boyfriend hates old people children and dogs
she just sits there
the lone figure of tin cup stands on a tee arching seven irons thwock
into the night serenaded by crickets and the occasional bug light zapping a fly
romeo and the regulars stand behind tin cup observing approvingly
tin cup mutters something with every swing
it sounds like hes saying just before swinging dollar bills
tin cup hits another shot totally focused
howd it go with the doctor lady boss
if she was a par three ida made a nine
stroke and distance eh
nods deep in concentration dollar bills
romeo backs off to let the man practice and clint asks whats he saying
his divots got to look like dollar bills
course moe norman hits divots like bacon strips cuz he come over the top but thats gettin too technical for you
clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the regulars
see that boys
hes hitting dollar bills
tightening his game
they murmur approval but earl catches clints eye and jerks his head at tin cup indicating clint isnt doing his job as group spokesman
clint takes a step forward
uh something us shitheels want you to know tin cup is uh well we been to see doreen and we told her wed stage a customers strike if she didnt
give you time off to win the open
this remark penetrates tin cups concentration
he turns with a smile to the regulars
you perverts did that for me
we believe in you man
and if you get past the local qualifier we gonna sponsor you
tin cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and smiles broadly
thanks boys a man couldnt have better friends
now move the hell back and shut the fuck up
youre messing up my concentration
and with big smiles they move each other back so as not to mess up tin cups concentration
and he pulls out another ball mutters dollar bills and hits another perfect shot
everyones gone home except tin cup who keeps drilling beautiful shots into the texas night
a car is parked unnoticed
a figure sits alone watching tin cup from a distance
with his elegant swing as graceful as he is crude a zen ritual
finally weary at last tin cup tosses his club in his bag and drags it toward his ever present winnebago which we see him enter
he drops his clubs on the couch
the place is a wreck and he collapses in a chair cracking a can of cheap a knock at the door
jesus im clean
disguises his voice who is it
the door opens molly enters
hes surprised but well settled into his bath of cynicism
god youve got a beautiful swing and big beautiful green eyes im a beautiful guy
i came here to apologize
well i counseled you you did exactly what i said and i just
poured cold water over your effort
quickly i didnt get it
im a terrible shrink probably
i shouldve never got out of real estate actually i should never have left ohio for that cowboy in armarillo have you ever been to amarillo
its not as romantic when youre actually with one a wrangler yknow so of course the oil man in dallas looked great after that i dont know what i was
thats when i went to the gulf and ended up in well trailer sales and then all those condos in corpus christi the bottom fell outta the market and i
needed a new gig a new gig
i took all the classes
im licensed yknow
suddenly dejected oh god
reaching into her purse mind if i smoke
lights up anyway im flattered you asked me out
i cant accept because i am involved with david and i havent seen any evidence that he treats old people kids or dogs badly
i got a little carried away i guess
i shoulda just layed up made my par and moved on
look i want to propose something as long as you understand this is professional were not going out together tee it up
i can help you with the mental aspects of the game
youve got romeo to be your swing doctor i can be your head doctor
but you said you were a lousy shrink
i got no money to pay for you
ill trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying
if you get into the open well youre on your own
youll be with david
its the best they can do
the first tee of the local open qualifier
and the voice of the starter
the next group
roy mcavoy salome texas
who will be playing with
the regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many you the mans
as tin cup steps onto the first tee followed by his sancho panza romeo
tin cup is feeling on top of the world at his cocky best
how ya feelin boss
im feelin like pars a bad score podnuh fifty eights within the realm
jesus the doctor ladys here standing not far from the regulars
didnt i tell ya
shes gonna be your guru partner
you handle my swing mechanics and she handles my brain mechanics
long as you keep your dick out of it me an the big guy have an understanding
hes gonna lie low till i get in the open then
the big dogll eat
the big dogll hunt thats for sure
tin cup steps up to the tee a couple quick limber
swings and he tees it up
as he does romeo slips over to molly
softly looks like we partners dr
molly i just have to help him keep his head on straight if you can you be the first
he does have the occasional tendency towards self destruction it seems
it aint occasional and it aint no tendency its a fact of life that he gonna blow sky high its just a matter of when and how fast can the
pieces be put back together
beat behind that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin
tin cup waves and motions to his team
quiet in the gallery
a mans trying to do his job
and tin cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant stroke fully confident and smooth
the gallery applauds
generally announcing got my a game with me today folks
youre in for a real treat
molly leans to romeo just before they all head down the fairway and confides i find him mildly attractive when hes obnoxious and arrogant like this
cause its his best side
and they head down the fairway a scruffy little gallery on a so so course
with a lot at stake
he hits a perfect wedge and says to himself romeo molly the gallery the universe dollar bills
he nails a two iron straight as a string
he rifles another drive into the stratosphere
putt after putt drains into the jar
close on the scoreboard the red numbers under par are going up quickly as every shot he hits is dead solid perfect
minus one two four five seven
tin cups in a zone talking to himself full of himself in a fabulous indomitable state of mind
molly and romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging tin cups on a roll and needs no help
a couple of the regulars shout out encouragement
you the man tin cup
you the man
they bugging you boss i can shut em up
the way im swinging today
nothing bugs me except insufficient applause
surveying the fairway gimme the lumber
but romeo is handing him a two iron
i think two irons safer
i said i want the big dog
romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg left par five
tight par five out of bounds left
you dont want to hit driver
im not going left of those trees
im going over those trees
with a little draw
that way i get home in two
that way im putting for eagle
you dont need eagle to qualify
you need to get used to playing smart no mistakes wins the open
i want the course record
now gimme the lumber
tin cup reaches for the driver
romeo shifts the golf bag beyond tin cups reach
you not going to listen to me
you dont care im trying to help
you think im full of shit
i think im gonna get penalized for slow play if you dont give me that fucking driver
you a head case boss always were always will be
then lets ask the head doctor
to molly dr
griswold should i hit the big dog or the two
suddenly an official steps forward
soliciting shot selection advice is a two stroke penalty
trust your feelings roy
to romeo ha
gimme the driver and shut up
romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over his knee
he tosses the two halves on the ground near tin cup
hit the driver
tin cup looks at the two halves of his driver curbing his anger not giving romeo the satisfaction of a reaction
i changed my mind
gimme the three wood
you cant clear the dogleg with a three wood
romeo pulls out the three wood snaps it over his knee and tosses the halves on the ground next to the driver halves
tin cup turns with amusement to his playing partners lest they think management has lost the upper hand with labor
guess im going with the safe shot boys
tin cup reaches for the two iron studies it a moment frowns and then he snaps it over his knee
he dumps these halves on the ground with the halves of the driver and three wood
romeo stares aghast
tin cup merely shrugs
sometimes i fan that two iron
better gimme the three
romeo warily hands tin cup the three iron
tin cup looks at it frowns then he snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground
molly leans over to the regulars
is this normal behavior for him
the word normal and him dont collide in the same sentence too often
she watches in amazement as sometimes i catch that three a little thin
he drops the three iron halves with the other halves and steps past romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag
he snaps them over his knee one by one citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire
and ive hooked my four iron
snap and hit flyers with the five
snap and shanked the six
snap and skulled the eight
snap and fatted the nine
snap and chili dipped the wedge
snap and bladed the sand wedge
snap then pauses to reflect contemptuously on his putter and then theres mister three putt
he snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of
broken clubs at his feet
then he reaches for the last club in his bag the seven iron
the regulars hold their breath thinking this is the end of tin cups open bid
tin cup smiles and caresses the seven iron affectionately
but the seven iron i never miss the seven iron
its the only truly safe club in my bag
he moves to the tee drops a ball and hits it down the middle with the seven iron
you happy romeo
no boss im tired
my lifes too short to spend it watching you fall apart
i done it too many times
romeo turns and starts walking away
first sign of adversity youre quitting
as romeo continues anyone want to bet me i cant par in with a seven iron
to molly doc
take the bet
roy just shut up and hit the ball
tin cups magic with a seven iron
he drives with a seven iron
he chips with a seven iron
he blasts out of sand with an open bladed seven iron
tin cup drains a ten foot putt also with the seven iron and left handed to boot
hes past the local qualifier
the regulars erupt in cheers
youd have thought he won the masters
and tin cup shrugs to the tiny gallery with insouciance and cockiness and pronounces an easy game this golf
tin cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much of the gallery
hes a local hero but mollys not impressed
a waitress delivers a tray of long neck beers
beer for everybody
you the man tin cup
a toast is raised to their king and tin cup eats it up
thanks boys whatya think was my best shot the seven iron on twelve the seven iron on fourteen or maybe it was the bunker shot on eighteen which to my
recollection was a seven iron
this is the tin cup they love
you definitely the man
howd i do doc
cheerfully you failed miserably
i parred the back nine with a seven iron i qualified for the regionals i your job is not just to qualify for the open its to prepare for the
my job is to help you prepare
you said to trust my feelings
i didnt know you felt like breaking all the clubs in your bag
he didnt break the seven
he smoked that seven brother from what i understand the u
open is the most difficult golf tournament in the world played under the most difficult circumstances with the greatest players winning it means controlling yourself managing your emotions staying cool
not getting in a pissing contest with your caddie who incidentally quit
he always quits he always comes back
nonetheless from the mental aspect which is my domain you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial
regression delusion denial
you gotta use all this psychological language
im a psychologist
tin cup turns to the regulars for support
have a bad day roy
everyone turns to see david simms enter the conversation
i shot parred the backside with a seven iron
thats the question why
cause he broke all his other clubs
snapped em in two even the putter
jesus roy im on your side here
we go way back
i hope you get into the open but if you dont play under control youll get slaughtered
good players shoot in the open
you cant always go for it
swear to god doc this guy is not who you think
its a well known fact that if a cameras not on him he treats old people and children like dirt
yeah dont forget the dogs
i think we should go david
i think so
tin cups worst characteristics flare up he wont let go
you ever shoot par with a seven iron
it never occurred to me to try
to molly cmon lets go
the cars over here
ill bet you a thousand dollars against my car that i can beat you in any game any game you name it with a seven iron
this is ridiculous
you a coward
you gonna lay up the way you did at the masters last year
taunting like children chickie chickie chickie
simms is a little drawn in not so much by the challenge as the desire to shut up tin cup
any game i name it
oh come on david i just want to teach him a lesson
why do men insist on measuring their dicks
tin cup takes her literally and rises starting to unbuckle his belt
for god sakes i wasnt being literal
beat david lets go
molly trust me on this one
call it part of his mental preparation for the open where the rough is deep the greens are slick and the nerves are shattered
to tin cup ill take the bet
the regulars cheer this is what they live for
simms hands a roll of cash to molly
tin cup hands her his car keys
whats the game
one swing each
who can hit the longest seven iron its a lock
i hit the seven like john daly hits a three
the regulars whoop it up
their mans a cinch
tin cup pulls a ball from his pocket drops it right on the ground in the middle of the patio
from right here okay
fine with me
you guys are really being childish molly leave this one to me
griswold i know what im doing
tin cup takes a couple of swings to limber up aiming out
onto an open area of the course
serious intent the look of eagles
to himself dollar bills
he takes a full back swing opens beautifully and launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some driving range markers
to oohs and ahhs from his faithful
the ball lands at a yard marker and bounces further
them signs are at least thirty yards farther that ball musta gone
that balls about
toed it a bit
but itll do
nearly with a seven
pureed it baby he pureed it
tin cup hands simms the seven iron
take a minute to limber up fine with me dont need to
simms is still in a sport jacket slacks no golf shoes
take your jacket off
no no im fine
simms drops a ball about where tin cups sat
he stands above the ball and addresses it
cockily youre gonna need to muscle up big guy give it the old steroid jerk
simms is cool as ice
he smiles then moves around to the other side of the ball suddenly facing away from the course
this baffles everyone
what the hell you doin
and david simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward the desert onto the lonely highway
and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces for about three miles forever
its probably still going
the hustlers been hustled
she shrugs and smiles
molly drives away in simms car followed by simms in tin cups cadillac convertible
tin cup and the regulars stand alone
weakly lamely a couple of the regulars speak
you the man roy
you definitely the man
a nearly nude dancer named sammantha on stage to a big saturday night crowd
tin cups in the front row sitting with doreen and a beer
bring out those bills boys if ya wanta see a little more of sammantha
guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper
to tin cup hey honey
tin cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster wave hes depressed or something
i heard you qualified for the regionals why you so down
i broke my clubs dont ask why my caddies pissed off at me i lost my wheels in a sucker bet and my shrink thinks im a fool cause i
youre seeing a therapist
yeah whats wrong with that
only way youd ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack youre so shallow
the good doctor and i are dealing with my regression and denial oh tin cup what a crock
you got a hard on
a guy from the next table leans over interrupting
you tin cup
won the local with a seven iron
the tin cup mcavoy
theres only one thank god
you looking for a game
no but id sure like to show you my grip
doreen cant keep his attention
neither can sammantha who writhes only a few feet away
how long have you been seeing this good doctor
excuse me dor the mans having trouble with his grip the guy slides over to tin cup quickly joined by his buddies
see i used to play a real weak grip
but you look at couples hes got a left hand way over here
tin cup glances at the guys grip
no grip it like this so youre holding on with the last two fingers of your left hand
the guy nudges the cowboy next to him
tin cup mcavoy says you grip a golf club like this with these two fingers
off no response roy
the grip and address are about percent of the golf swing so pay attention here
when youre done with him can i ask you about my club position at address
sammantha cant keep their attention either even though shes down to a g string inches away
at the height of the music she stops dancing and looks down at doreen
am i doing something wrong
no honey you aint but a healthy womans only got two choices in this world of ours
beat either fall in love with another woman or take up golf
and doreen heads to the dressing room disgusted but not at all surprised
she knows tin cup she knows men
now the stronger right hand grip can help ya draw the ball which i plan to do at the regionals next week in tulsa
just shift the hand over a little bit
blah blah blah
and naked women dance before them unnoticed
the winnebago chugs along in the middle of nowhere
tin cup drives as most of the regulars lounge all are there including turk the bouncer
but romeo is missing
we get through the next holes and we in the open
i got the yips and i aint even teeing it up
nothing to worry about boys but you aint got romeo
dont need him till the open hell be back
but you dont got the doctor lady
oh no i got her
he holds up a tape cassette
she cant travel to arizona for the regionals shes got a busy practice yknow
so she made me this tape to play while im out there
keep me calm cool and collected
whats on it
a little james taylor little george jones little kahlil gibran little this little that
and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick i ever met
the good doctor herself
can we hear it or is it personal
since when is therapy personal eh
he punches into his deck and the winnebago is filled with the sounds of mollys tape beginning with george jones
and the voice of george jones takes us into
the regional qualifier hole tournament pitting all the local winners
this is a much bigger deal than the local tournament more commercial bigger crowds tougher
accompanied by mollys voice and the music of jones
he puts the walkman headset over his ears on the first tee
we hear what he hears and on tape private victories precede public victories
you cannot harvest a crop before you plant it
he launches a tee shot down the middle
on tape how you view the problem is the problem
tin cup chips into the cup
tin cup drains putt after putt with confidence
on tape follow your bliss
tin cup takes a club from earl whos huffing and puffing a little too hard for a caddie and tin cup crisps a three iron over water to a tight
tin cup is carrying his own bag now earl is several paces behind dragging his body slowly exhausted
close on scoreboard even par even even one under
on tape say not that i have found the truth but that i have found a truth
close on tin cup still in a zone confident relaxed hitting lots of good shots
but the score is close the competition tougher
hes near the top but not first
tin cup lips out a fifteen foot putt heartbreak
he starts to lose it but
on tape you cant have the fruits without the roots
and tin cup just smiles and taps in
scoreboard tells us were down to the th final hole
whattya think earl
i think three under will qualify
you need birdie
i could shit
a little more confidence there earl
i wish romeo was here
i aint cut out to do this
im a spectator by nature
im a shut up and hand me the big dog
you got it
tin cup takes the driver and uncoils a beauty
the force is with me pods
tin cup hits a wedge approach the ball lands inches from the hole
the crowd gasps
but the backspin grabs it and the ball spins back and back and back ten twenty thirty feet before coming to a rest
the men head solemnly to the final green
tin cup surveys the thirty foot snake of a putt
earls of absolutely no use
we need this one big time earl whattya think
unsurely looks straight to me
things a roller coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole youre blind
actually i am blind
in one eye and thats the good eye
i got a blind caddie
just hold the stick earl and be sure to pull it out
tin cup studies the hell out of this putt
if it goes in hes in the open
he misses back to salome
on tape when the going gets tough the the the whirrrrrrrrrrr the the
tin cup shakes the walkman and pounds his ears
panicky earl earl the tapes jammed
shes abandoning me
are you okay
im flying solo now
i gotta make this putt
tin cup stares endlessly at the long putt
just pick the line feel the speed bad timing doc jesus
he steps up to the putt still talking to himself
like a million others you made in your life roy
just see it going in
just feel it
right in the back of the jar
just pull the goddamn trigger you pussy
he strokes the putt it starts right curls back left straightens out over the ridge back again endlessly
pull the stick earl pull it
earls having trouble with the flagstick shaking it panicking and finally he snaps it free but
the ball stops dead on the lip of the cup
tin cup contorts in anguished body english then falls to his back like a shot animal
choking dogs die
and the ball falls into the cup with a click and a tin cup takes a peek at the cup
the ball stays in the hole
the winnebago returns home a travelling party of beer boisterousness and celebration
we hear them all led by turk the bouncer and his guitar singing the double bogey blues
all the way back to texas
tin cup arrives fresh from the qualifier
romeo is shafting glubs
youve come back
no answer you shoulda been there romes i drained a foot snake to qualify
off no answer earl gave me a straight read the thing broke half a dozen times missed ya pods
romeo gives him the silent treatment
okay dont talk to me but youre still my guy
losing patience its a little late to be pissed off
were in the open
you and me
still nothing from romeo
awright be that way switches course say
has molly been around
i knew you had the hots for her
of course i have the hots for her and im doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till i kick simms ass and show her i
aint who she thinks i am because in fact i am who she thinks i am but if i win the open i wont be
romeo stares back at that curious logic
well i dont think her nor me nor the god of golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the open
i made it this far
i just got to hold it together for more
theres a lotta triple bogeys out there waiting to grab your ass
cheerily youre complaining again
whining bitching pissed off youre my man
you didnt fall in love with earl to be your caddie
he was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen cost me three strokes a side
beat i carried my bag the last four holes
i love ol earl but i need you
you dont love me
exasperated i love you too god damn it
as much as earl
i dont know
yes yes as much as earl beat more than earl
am i special
if you can remove the sexual connotations and overlay a golf theme romeo i am your juliet
romeo ponders it all
muy bien julietta
in that case i am your caddy once again
they shake hands
now that we got that bullshit outta the way im gonna hit me some balls and start oilin that sweet swing o mine for the big boys
romeo sits back in the shade still washing the thousands of golf balls in the rack watching as tin cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble ground pulls
out a club and limbers up
nobody heard from molly eh
you got it bad dont ya
somethin about that chick
tin cup addresses the ball and takes a swing
everything looks normal in his swing but
the ball squirls off to the side and rattles against a fence
little chili dipper there
be sure to do that in the open
unfazed tin cup steps up to hit again but
once more thwock
another horrible looking squib to the right
romeo stops washing balls and notices watching tin cup
somethings terribly wrong
concern crosses his face
it aint no chili dipper
yeah boss you got the s word
what am i doing wrong
shanks are like a virus they just show up
nobody can figure em out
thwock thwock thwock
three more chili dippers
our man definitely has the shanks
and hes panicking
somethings terribly wrong
whats your guess
its the woman
i thought you said it was a virus
a woman can have the same effect
what do i do
thwock thwock thwock
night has fallen and he still has the shanks
the regulars have gathered and are huddled murmuring
the word has spread like wildfire tin cup has the shanks
never thought it would happen
the shanks is for us mortals not
for the great ones
esta muy feo
muy muy feo
it is very ugly very very ugly
tin cup angrily throws his club out into the night and turns to the regulars
yknow why they named this game golf
cause the words fuck and shit were already taken
a car horn honks all heads turn to see pulls in doreen gets out carrying a big package
what is this
everybody like to watch a train wreck
doreen approaches the regulars and we notice for the first time that there are a number of bags and packages with the boys
hes in one of his pleasant moods i see hes got the shanks
we got the makings of a greek tragedy here
shouting to tin cup quit whining and get over here
weve got something for you
tin cup drags his sorry ass to the group
unless its a swing thought im not interested
ignoring his attitude were here to sponsor you in the
me an the boys have pooled our resources and come up with some cash so you can look and feel as spiffy as all them big name pros
but i got the shanks yeah and you obviously still have a hard on for the doctor chick your face is all screwed up and tight like you havent been
laid in awhile is it really that obvious
its not a good look for you
roy your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve
theres a certain vulgar appeal to your transparency
tin cup shrugs
she always has him outflanked
cmon tin cup were trying to make you a presentation awright awright
she unwraps a tour golf bag big gold and red lettering advertises the golden tassel
pastie tassels hang from all over the bag
doreen sets it down proudly
i got the golden tassel to sponsor you at the open
you expect me to pack that around
im carrying the bag
its worth four hundred dollars endorsement money to you earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn on patches and logos
see dewey got you first state banking of salome and clint got you short haul trucking and i got you brink and brown sanitation im being sponsored by a sewage
we call it human resources management roy please
jose steps forward with a golf cap also emblazoned
ive got wallys smokehouse for ya kind of a nice sign
and since i couldnt get the post office to come aboard me and my girl friend muriels gonna buy a fan club patch you can put anywhere you want
doreen and the regulars look at tin cup proudly
im supposed to wear this shit
this shit is us man
you cant win without us
youre the pride of salome
hell i wont even make the cut
what happened to your confidence
hes shanking his love life so hes shanking the golf ball
must be true love
hes a goner
tin cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot and starts loosening up
these are his people after all
and theyre behind him all the way
look everybody this is great
im sorry im acting so pathetic but my swings never abandoned me before
i just need a little time to work it out
anything you want give him some room boys to anyone wholl listen maybe its my grip
maybe im opening up too soon
coming over the top
no dropping underneath
beat oh sweet jesus why have you abandoned me
to the regulars hes trying to talk to god
its time for us to go
doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave tin cup with his newly sponsored gifts and more importantly his newly lost grip swing and confidence
you want me to stay boss
i need to be alone
you got it
and romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the lot
and as they drive away tin cup sits down his head in his hands
the winnebago sits forlornly in the parking lot next to the range which has never looked lonelier
tin cups caddy convertible pulls up to the winnebago
but roy isnt driving molly is
she gets out goes to the door
theres no answer so she tries the door and walks in on tin cup stands there caught like a deer in the headlights like a man caught cross dressing a
private confession made public he cant run and he cant hide
roy tin cup mcavoy is wearing every gimmick that molly first arrived with plus many more
he wears a pendulum cap his arms are strapped together a curious triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his elbows theres a neck brace an ankle anchor an arrow attachment
to his left hand a bucket for right foot he swings a collapsible club
and a beginners golf video projects loudly from his vcr so loudly that he never heard her knocking
a moment of pathetic silence then molly starts laughing he is destroyed
the therapist laughs at her patient
is that how it works
a man is laid bare before god and hes the butt of the cosmic joke
im sorry i just
some of this shit might actually
i mean i think theres something to this hat with the pendulum golf ball thing
may be on to something here
oh roy jesus
quoting yourself it is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls
tin cup lets down
the wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness
well god damn
a lost and desperate soul stands before you
beat i assume i have the confidentiality of doctor client privilege in regards to this outfit
of course you do
i got the shanks
are you taking penicillin
it cant be treated
its much worse than whatever you thought it was
beat theres a glitch in my swing
so its in romeos department
he thinks its your department says its a head thing
i just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car david says he doesnt want it just wanted to make a point with you beat but
i suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now
i dont want therapy
i want you
i gotta get some air look at me considering what that means well not right at the moment but listen to me
youre with the wrong guy
im the right guy
everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum cause ive been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and
the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet its also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people
beat such is life
so dump that phony bastard and come to the open in my corner you can delay your romantic urges which i know are lurking in there among the excess of
brain cells you possess until the appropriate time
beat tell me youre not at least moderately attracted to me
tin cup stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat the leather straps the bucket the arrows for the moment hes forgotten how stupid he looks
you have moments
tell me which ones are my moments and ill try to duplicate them
this is a moment
you look great
utterly exposed completely vulnerable the inner child trying to get out
my inner child needs spanking
you always liked that part about saddling up the smell of leather cmon lets have a drink
call it therapy
charge me an hour
little cuervo little freud
shes thinking about it
i gotta go
turns to leave oh i dont have a car i need a ride
tin cup and molly in his convertible
he works on her without pushing too hard
i know a spot along the rivers great to watch the sunset
not tonight means maybe some other night
i didnt mean it like that
consciously you didnt mean it like that but how about unconsciously youre the expert did you mean it unconsciously
unconsciously roy i dont have a clue what im talking about
i feel were making progress
i do too
but i have no idea what its progress towards
the caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new mall
she gets out
good luck in the open roy
put your money on me doc the odds are fabulous and god knows im overdue
he drives away and we stay watching tin cup careen away in his caddy
the intrepid winnebago on the way to the open
romeo drives tin cup stares out the window
you got to relax boss goin to the u
open with the shanks
gonna be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television
im gonna get rid of them shanks for ya
no hay problema
molly and i are circling each other
i can feel it
she the enemy boss
well she wakin up with the enemy same thing
tell me something romes the absolute truth you think i can go holes without falling apart
romeo keeps driving pretends not to hear
you heard me
i dont want no bullshit
do you think i can do it
i dont know boss i just dont know
and tin cup puts on his walkman and stares out the window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery to the music of george jones
the winnebago rumbles out of the country heading east and
the winnebago heads out of the high plains
the winnebago passes through a tunnel of tall old pines into a cathedral environment of old money and old golf
romeo and tin cup stare out into the trees the lushness a couple of wide eyed kids
i bet this is the first winnebago they ever saw here
and the first mexican
the winnebago pulls up to a guard gate a security guard comes to the window
a banner hangs above the entrance a few paces past the security gate proclaiming old pines u
como esta amigo
i have with me one of the legendary ball strikers in the history of golf the security guard strains to see in
tin cup leans across romeo to introduce himself
roy tin cup mcavoy
representing the great american southwest
the guard backs off quickly turns to his second
do we have a
on the list
mcavoy roy mcavoy hes a legend
we got over legends in this tournament
romeo starts cursing in spanish
the guard is unphased
call the police
the police quickly appear to take over the situation
tin cup leaps out of the winnebago to argue his point
theres a mistake here fellas
a cop grabs tin cup and roy is ready to fight
its getting ugly real fast
well throw your ass in jail right now pal theres a lotta lunatics here and we dont take chances
at that moment david simms pulls in driving a con vertible sponsors car
he sees the scuffle gets out
whats the problem here
this clown says hes in the open
simms spots tin cup a delicious moment for him
tin cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face
hes not on the list
simms takes the clipboard with the list
welcome to the big leagues
checks the list here ya go charlie his names right here
to tin cup they spelled your name wrong easy mistake with a total unknown
to cop let him in
simms smiles at tin cup the easy smile of a man on top
tin cup doesnt respond just asks the guard which way to the practice range
as tin cup tries to regain some dignity and climbs back into the winnebago
to simms he said he was a legend
oh he is
hes a very big name at a driving range in salome texas
they all have a good laugh and lots of the big names are there
romeo is like a kid at the ballpark
and ray floyd
romeo notices that tin cup is staring at the pile of practice balls lying there on the tee
look at these balls
brand new titleists
lookit em every one a brand new titleist
lowers his voice sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance
we swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco
tin cup limbers up trying not to be in awe of the real legends who line the practice range hitting beautiful shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease
you think it would be inappropriate to ask ray floyd for an autograph
i think its a dead giveaway romes
but if i still got the shanks were gonna be found out real fast
tin cup nudges a ball from the pile into address position
romeo hands him a different club
hit the seven iron
you never miss the seven
good thought pods
tin cup waggles shakes limbers addresses
and he swings
a hideous shank squirrels across line almost hitting a group of u
to anyone wholl listen who hit that shot
he addresses another one
a little thin boss
a little fucking thin
i still got the shanks
christ simms is here
simms has arrived and is watching tin cup with delight as he loosens up
maybe we should work on putting
ya cant shank a putt
tin cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to strike another ball
if youre the mexican mac ogrady romes you gotta figure out why im still shanking the ball
beat whats the problem
im catching it on the hosel right
moving my head
im laying off it im pronating im supinating im clearing too early im clearing too late im off plane i aint dropping in oh god my swing feels like an
unfolding lawn chair
you got a virus in your brain
got to kill the brain to kill the virus
kill me now
put all your change in your right pocket
tin cup follows orders not questioning the logic
now tie your left shoelace in a double knot
again tin cup dutifully follows orders
now turn your hat around backwards and put a blue tee behind your right ear
ill look like a fool
what you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up freddy couples ass eh
do what i say or i quit
now hit a seven iron into that tree over there
tin cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees
howd i do that
you aint thinking about shanking you aint thinking about the doctor lady you aint thinking period
you just lookin like a fool and hittin it pure your natural state
your brain was getting in the way
thats rarely been a problem
well i should recommend you go work on your short game but i think its better if you go get drunk instead
you always play better when youre wasted
tin cups stares at the swami and again to george jones on the cassette player tin cup is doing a slow dance with his driver
romeo sits on the couch stone cold sober pouring drink after drink for tin cup whos thoroughly plastered
its three in the morning romes what time i tee off
seven o five
first group off
keep drinking keep dancing
thats four hours from now
youre drinking till five
cmon cmon have another a tough coach get you in shape
tin cup tosses down yet another drink and staggers around the room with his driver until finally he collapses in a heap on the floor
romeo looks down at him coolly like horse trainer wayne lukas sizing up his derby entry
nothing like the sight of a finely tuned athlete on the verge of greatness
romeo tosses a blanket over tin cup lying on the floor
two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee
our intrepid don quixote and sancho panza
the first tee the early morning air is heavy and still
the course is quiet and wet with dew
the gallery is sparse
the silence is broken by the starters voice
with the honor in the pairing from salome texas mr
a half dozen people clap and tin cup and romeo stagger to the tee barely making it on time
tin cup is massively hung over and unshaven
no time for a bucket eh
almost missed the starting time trying to get you off the floor boss
you dont handle the hooch like you used to
tin cup tries to get warm quickly taking a few hurried practice swings
the early tee times are strictly for the longest of long shots and almost nobody is around
tin cups hand shakes as he closes the velcro flap on his glove
hes wearing the hat and shirt with the sew on patches as he stares down the first fairway
romeo hands him a driver
i seen this hole on tv
hit the big dog down the chute no ive learned my lesson
gonna play it safe smart conservative
fairways and greens
hand me the two iron
thought of the day is be humble
and tin cup launches a two iron down the first fairway
the scorer posts an eighty three next to tin cups name
tin cup stares shell shocked as his score is posted
well you humble now
eleven bogeys and seven pars
i didnt make a three
i didnt make one goddam three all day
you werent trying to make threes
you were trying to avoid making thirteen
i was hungover
maybe that was a coaching error on my part
david simms is interviewed
on the television im the last person who expected me to come out of the blocks with a sixty seven and lead the open
its been a long time since i played this game with the fire and determination you need to win
the anti christ shoots you believe it
ol anti christ got a hot putter
on television you see this game is all about integrity and tradition and honor
its about cheating and racism and bullshit
live coverage of the simms interview
molly is among a small crowd gathered to watch
he doesnt seem to know that shes there
live on mike so tomorrow ill just go out there and try to make some good swings and lord willing maybe i can put up another good number
thank you david simms a brilliant opening round to take the lead
simms walks away now off camera
fans call out
simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse away from the galleries
the marshals open a rope allowing him to avoid the crowds but an elderly couple with a young child are there
the lady has a tiny dog in her arms
excuse me mr
off no response can you sign an autograph for our grandson
snaps cant you see im busy
this is my office
do i come to your office and ask you for an autograph
he practically stiff arms them as he passes heading up to the clubhouse
they stand there in shock
muttering to himself who the fuck these people think they are
camera pans over to the edge of the tent
molly trying to get to david has seen the whole thing
she speaks to herself
old people children and dogs
simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials caddies other players
instantly in public he feigns humility with convincing flair
helluva round dave
got lucky out there
great start simmsy
simms stops when he sees tin cup and romeo drowning their sorrows
hey tin cup heard you put a monster number up there
coulda been worse
a small bar crowd is enjoying simms taunts
i played in the pro am with some asshole movie star shot here once
how did a great ball striker like you a legend manage to shoot an
i missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an thats how
it aint like playing some muni track in brownsville is it
a voice interrupts
does integrity tradition and honor include kicking a man when hes down
oh mol this is just guy stuff bar talk part of the game no offense right cup
tin cups about as low as one can go
defensively this man still has a lot of good golf shots in his system trying to hide molly its okay go away
i dont need any attention right
to tin cup you the guy shot
david ill bet you a hundred dollars right now that roy here can hit a ball looks around from right here to
through that door to the patio
she points to a double door forty feet away across the bar about an x foot opening
to bartender and give me a vodka tonic with a twist molly really this isnt
i wanta go back to texas
what about the river the piranha the immortality
all that bullshit
you gonna drag your ass home with an
looks around in fact two hundred says he can hit it through that door over the patio into the river and make that pelican fly off that post
everyone strains to look a pelican sits on a piling in the river
this is ridiculous
but romeos sizing it up
you got that shot pods hood the seven turn it over start it low right to left
molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on the bar
im not leaving till one of you men starts acting in a manly fashion
simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter
lets just get this over with
one ball one swing one gull
tin cup still sits head half buried at the bar
hes never passed up such an opportunity but hes pretty low
you the man
he turns from his bar stool glances at the situation
four to one odds
ill make it ten to one
stick it up your ass
im leading the open
now were talking
from the barside gallery
tin cup rises and someone hands him a club
suddenly theres a crowd including gary mccord whos been watching from the far end of the bar
he grabs a seltzer hose as if its a mike and begins announcing
mccord hes looking at thirty yards of bar and grill an opening through the french doors forty yards of patio umbrellas a
hundred yards of water and a lonely pelican sitting out there in a mile an hour breeze south by southwest
beat hell probably try to shut down a four iron no hes selected his trusty seven iron
tin cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet
kind of a thin lie
beats all that deep rough you were in today
fore in the grill
fore on the patio
youre the legend boss
tin cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to molly
what is this all about
shut up and hit the ball
mccord on mike the ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal ego sapping manhood robbing eighty three he buried himself under yesterday
i mean thats just an avalanche of golf swings a landslide a pyroclastic flow dollar bills
and he swings the ball rockets through the hall and clears the open door
the bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the patio to watch the flight of the ball as its carrying its hooking its carrying then thwack
it hits the piling
the seagull lifts off screeching angrily
stiff baby stiff
a whoop goes up and simms storms out
im outta here
youre all nuts
i musta been blind thinking you were worth a shit simmsy
raucously drinks on me boys
helluva shot roy
actually i thinned it a little or that pelicand be flying around with a titleist up his ass
this is the old tin cup and hes in the clubhouse with an eightyfuckingthree
pouring rain lightning and thunderstorms
it pours down on the club and the beat up rv
romeo stands outside with an umbrella dragging on a cigarette trying to stay warm
tin cup and molly in bed lit only by light spilling in from a parking lamp
they make love with enthusiasm finally wobbling to a stop
silence except for the rain
until i kinda shanked it eh
no no no
you were great
tempo is everything
mighta rushed it on the downswing
come over the top a little
well as walter hagen once said sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy
lets take a mulligan and tee it up again they embrace with enthusiasm and start thrashing again
romeos patience is getting thin
he pounds on the door
you guys done yet
this is no time for a marathon
the rain keeps coming down
galleries line fairways and fill stands
the course is wet the skies threatening but play is underway
jim nantz in the booth
the sun is struggling to come out the course is drying up and in case youre just joining us the leaders have just reached the ninth hole because of delayed
starting times beat david simms is clinging to a one shot lead over peter jacobsen
but the real story is out on sixteen where a driving range pro who shot an opening eighty three is making a run at perhaps the most legendary round of
golf in open history johnny millers sixty three at oakmont ben wright is in the tower at
we hear ben wrights voice as tin cup marks his ball on the green
a small gallery has begun to follow him
if anyone was ever to make a run at what is the most storied number in open history millers sixty three it would be today when the rain has softened
the greens enabling the players to take dead aim at the flags
still the unswerving courage of an unknown driving range pro from salome has raised that humble journeyman from the ashes of an ignominious eighty three to wave a mighty fist
at the pantheon of golfs immortals
this man this roy mcavoy has laid siege to the record book by birdieing the first seven holes
a brave par from the water at eight and a glorious birdie three at the daunting twelfth another at thirteen
tin cup gets his read and steps up to putt
this putt to go ten under for the day
tin cup putts when the ball is still two feet from the hole tin cup raises his putter in triumph
and sure enough the ball drops in the hole
golf fans stream from other fairways to catch up as tin cup knocks his approach to within six feet of the cup
the swelling gallery at the green roars
doreen is behind the till
the regulars and several customers crowd the counter staring up at the television as dewey rushes in from his job
they said on the radio he was ten under shhhh
silence everyone watching the tv everyone starting to contort in body english then a joyous roar tin cups putt went down
earl twirls with glee
hes shooting the lowest round ever
and eighteens a par five
a birdie there he shoots sixty
we gotta go boys
we gotta get us on a continental trailways and find this damn place
the monitor shows tin cup approaching his ball in the fairway
ken venturi is commentating
mcavoys hit another big drive but this is not a shot he wants to get aggressive with
tin cup and romeo survey the shot a long downhill carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green
a shot similar to the one he pulled off at the best ball
two sixty to carry roy
you got to lay up man
i dont care how good you swinging
you got to lay
tin cup looks at the iron romeo proffers
he looks back at the shot throws some grass in the air testing the wind
he looks at the gallery the lake the green the whole grand setting
and then he locates molly behind the gallery ropes watching
she makes a little charging gesture with her fist
and tin cup reaches defiantly past romeo and pulls out the three wood
venturi and nantz watch tin cup set up to play the shot
his adrenalins gotten the better of him jim
if he lays up he takes bogey out of play
but if he knocks this ball in the water he could make seven or eight
and he still has to think about making the cut
well every golf fan in america is pulling for him
wearing that look the look of eagles tin cup addresses his ball
and he swings the ball arches off his club the gallery roars and
tin cup drops the three wood on his bag even as carry honey
the ball plunks in the water inches short of dry land
the gallery groans
tin cup smiles at molly with chagrin but not defeat
he turns to romeo
what the hell
you ride er till she bucks you or you dont ride at all
i can save par from here
tin cup hits a wedge to within five feet
up an down
tin cup is on the dais fielding questions from how do you go from shooting an eighty three one day to a record breaking sixty two the next
well it wasnt from clean living
laughter from the reporters
reporter follows up
if you had to do it again would you still go for the green on eighteen
and ill go for it tomorrow and ill go for it sunday cuz i didnt come here to play for no second
tin cup molly romeo all asleep in the same bed
showing simms through twelve jacobsen through fourteen and mcavoy through seventeen
a huge gallery lines the fairway and girds the green as tin cup approaches his ball in the middle of the fairway
the fans holler you da man at tin cup
nantz and venturi in the booth
tin cup is on the monitor arriving at his ball
we hear shouts from the gallery encouraging him to go for the green
its the same shot he knocked in the water yesterday
and the thing for him to do right now is to tune out the gallery rein in his emotions and forget what he said in yesterdays interview
he has to lay up
romeo palms the seven iron waiting for tin cup to decide on his play
gimme the three wood
romeo picks up some grass and flips it in the air
it blows away from the green
theres wind up there
the announcers see tin cup taking out the three wood
well he hasnt shown an ounce of fear all day
this isnt courage jim
this is inexperience pure and simple
tin cup steps up to his shot
this is for venturi up there in the booth thinking i should lay up
addressing his ball dollar bills
he swings and holds the pose
he caught the ball perfectly it sails high and true into the luffing breeze the gallery roars and
the ball drops sploosh
into the water a couple feet short of dry land
the gallery groans
staring amazed almost betrayed that his ball didnt carry the water
thats a long fucking ways
holds out his hand gimme another ball
its a water hazard
you go up there and take a drop
try to save par like you did yesterday
tin cups eyes blink with thought as romeos words get through to him
what the hell was i thinking
and he starts down to the water
a thunderous ovation greets his approach and he raises his hat to salute the fans saluting him
tin cup snarls at the impudent question of reporter
i saved par didnt i
im just trying to understand your thinking
you were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you you dont think i can knock it on from there
it seemed like a low percentage shot
so am i
look at me
im playing for
points at his sew on patches rio grande short haul trucking brink and brown sanitation first state bank of salome wallys smokehouse
you think a guy like me bothers to think about the percentages
a low rent roadside cafe specializing in waffles
tin cup molly and romeo study the menu
ive got some money from the pelican bet why dont we go somewhere fancy and celebrate get ready for the final round
nothing to celebrate yet
plus these are my people
im a waffle house guy gotta stay in touch with that
plus he needs his carbohydrates
if the boys from salome was in town this is where theyd be
the boys from salome walk in with doreen all looking like hell from the long bus trip
theyre ecstatic to see tin cup and romeo
god damn we been driving for two days to help you in the last round saw the winnebago outside were starving

this is the waffle house doreen hell i been dreaming of waffles for miles
they got a waffle house in odessa just about like this
its in midland aint it

they all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening at the waffle house
tin cup leans back in his chair turns to molly
it just dont get much better than this

romeo leans over to doreen amidst the chaos and speaks with suave elegance
youre looking particularly lovely this evening
the coif is extraordinary
why thank you
all twelve of them are asleep or nearly so in the r
sprawled on and over every surface
her face close to tin cups

a stripper ex girlfriend on the floor
my caddie sleeping next to her
all of us damn near broke

she puts her finger over his mouth gently
yes it will

and its okay
tin cup slips out of the trailer romeo follows
tin cup hitting golf balls alone except for the faith ful romeo getting ready for the final round of the u
molly serves coffee to the regulars
which one of you is the bookie
we all are but earls the best
what are the odds that roy will win
vegas has him at ten to one
theyre sure hes gonna self destruct
those sound good to me i want you to place a bet for me
five thousand nine hundred dollars on tin cup to win
they stare nervously
thats your nestegg
thats a bad idea honey we love him but hes gonna fuck up i said put it all on roy
we cant let you boys silence
mollys in charge
she hands them a roll of cash
put it all on tin cup
earl reluctantly takes the money
tin cup hits putts intense focused
peter jacobsen works his way over to tin cup
looking a little tight ledge
musta got too much sleep last night
how you choking
just got one thought in my head
thats my number
tin cup looks up amused by the gamesmanship
no ones ever been ten under for the open not even nicklaus
thats right ledge
not even nicklaus
and he moves off to putt
tin cup drops a couple balls on the green to putt and a ball rolls past them and into a hole
tin cup looks over and sees simms
sorry roy cant believe i didnt see you with all that high priced endorsement crap youre flaunting
thats always been your problem dave
you dont think about winning you just want to look good
turns away to putt thing is this aint a beauty pageant
turns back getting in simms face and it aint a rain shortened quad cities or a greater greensboro you can back into
this is youn me pal
this is match play and this time you aint getting no three shots
a large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway as with the honor in the final pairing from salome texas mr
tin cup tips his cap and nods at
david simms his pairing in this the final twosome of the final round of the u
fairways and greens dave
and dont forget to wave as i blow by
you mean blow up
like you always do
and tin cup moves to the tee
his hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he tees his ball
stepping back to line up his shot he peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of faces
a daunting sight
he edges over to romeo and tautly whispers do me a favor
bet me a buck i dont put it in the fairway
i bet you a hundred
going to tee off puts things back in perspective
tin cup looks at his ball almost invisible in the deep rough
he tries to locate the green beyond the trees that surround him
in golf parlance hes in jail
he selects a club
which way you going
tin cup points over the trees
tin cup addresses the shot
then tin cup swings the ball flutters weakly out of the rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree dropping eventually next to its trunk and a scorer
changes the number beside tin cups name from
simms is still
tin cup arrives on the tee where simms now has the honor
nice double roy
just keep making pars asshole
ill take eighteen of em
and i will own you
molly and doreen stand together behind the big gallery
molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the gallery to the green
doreen is on her tip toes but all she can see are the backs of heads
a swell of cheers builds then turns to groans
oh no tin cup ran it five feet past
beat how did he get the name tin cup
he played catcher on the high school baseball team
the star pitcher had this big league curve and not all his pitches hit roy in the mitt
finally you gotta respect a mans doggedness
beat the team decided tin cup sounded better than clank
molly puts down the periscope at that remark and hands it to doreen
clanks not a good name for a man
doreen looks through the periscope
lining up a putt
she pans over to romeo helping him
tell me something molly
have you ever had a latin lover
the regulars study the board the scruffiest lot ever seen at an open
next to them stand a group of u
officials all in neat matching blazers
the contrast is thrilling
our boys in trouble
ya think hes chokin
our boy dont choke
he fucks up but he dont choke
the scorer changes the number beside tin cups name to
simms is and wright looks at the monitor where tin cup stands among some trees
this is disaster for mcavoy
after losing three shots to par in the first four holes he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play
does he have any shot at all gary mccord
tin cups ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree
he surveys his options
behind him wearing a headset mccord analyzes the situation for the tv viewers
mccord this is definite jail
this is life without parole
his only chance to stage a jail break is go at the ball left handed and hope he can somehow snake it back into the fairway and save par from
tin cup glares balefully back at mccord
then he walks over to a nearby tree and surveys the line to the green from it
he walks back for his ball turns to mccord
and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in tin cups eyes
fifty bucks says i knock it on
with a seven iron
and he selects the seven iron addresses the ball right handed and he swings the ball rockets low off his club and
it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree and
it bounces up the fairway skitters past a trap and trickles onto the green stopping ten feet from the pin
the gallery goes crazy as tin cup steps from the woods collecting his money from mccord while jabbing a taunting finger at simms
nantz and wright stare at the monitors
that took balls
simms ignores tin cups taunt and lines up his shot
to himself thats just roy being roy
just wait him out dave
just make pars
let him make the mistakes
and he hits his iron to the fat part of the green and beauty dave
par written all over it
the scorer posts a next to tin cups name
simms is still at and tin cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot as the ball lands near the front of the green bounces then rolls following the
contour of the green
it finally stops five feet from the pin
a swelling deafening roar from the gallery accompanies the unfolding shot and jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green
hes making his run
the scorer posts a next to tin cups name
simms is still at
molly and doreen watch tin cup drain a putt
still watching tin cup so whyd you leave him
you ever dated a guy who actually believes in soul mates
he thinks hes a tough guy but hes a hopeless romantic
and as the gallery falls silent she turns to watch tin cup
tin cups firmly struck putt spins out of the hole
the gallery groans sharing his agony and jacobsen pausing to watch sighs with relief before starting down the fairway
tin cup follows the flight of his approach and up ahead on peter jacobsen hears the gallery roar
he turns to his caddie incredulous
hes throwing darts back there
we gotta make birdies squeaky or we are playing for second
and he snatches his driver from the bag determined to make birdies
the scorer posts next to tin cups name
simms is still at as is jacobsen
jacobsen rolls a long putt into the hole and as the gallery cheers he points a finger of challenge back at tin cup waiting in the fairway
tin cup seems to enjoy the taunt
thats right peter
thats all there is
and he selects a club and
tin cups fans deeply into the beer by now contort with body english and holler at the tv screen
get in there
they explode with cheers
some twirl with glee
others exchange high fives
hes tied for the lead again
and theyre running outta holes
the leader board is superimposed on the monitor
mcavoy jacobsen simms
so its come down to the seventy second hole of this great championship and the skill and courage of three texans who have dueled throughout the day for the chance
to be crowned open champion
peter jacobsen is on the fairway at under mcavoy at the th tee is tied at minus and david simms trails by one
tin cup and romeo watch jacobsen hit his shot
jacobsens laying up
turning to simms you aint gonna have that luxury dave
not if you play to win
he moves to the tee and
the monitor shows tin cups drive bounding down the middle of the fairway
mcavoys hit a perfect drive ken
im not sure thats good news for mcavoy
with his inexperience the last thing he needs is an excuse to fool with that water again today
tin cup whispers to romeo as simms tees up
i didnt catch it all
then you got to lay up
simms rips a drive down the middle the ball landing a little short of roys
tin cup in the fairway studying his shot
so birdie wins it
he looks at simms ten yards across the fairway from him
you or me dave
simms points to himself
he has a wood in his hands but he puts the club back and reaches for an iron
tin cup edges closer to romeo
whispering hes laying up
birdie to tie eagle to win and that gutless wonders laying up
whispering par to tie birdie to win
you lay up too roy
you can make birdie laying up
they watch simms lay up
then romeo offers tin cup an iron hoping hell take it
you know something romeo
eagle puts me ten under
no ones ever finished an open ten under not even nicklaus
you dont need an eagle
birdie wins par ties
firmly hit the lay up
hole a wedge for goddamn eagle
tin cup throws some grass in the air looks back at the green the gallery the whole grand setting
and he seeks out mollys face in the crowd
he moves over so she can hear him
this is everything aint it
this is the choice it comes down to
this is our immortality
no time to be thinkin immortality cup
time to be thinkin iron
molly stands with doreen hearing tin cups words
thrilled and terrified and spellbound she finds herself nodding
doreen on the other is turning ash white
this is what always happens
hes going for it
go for it
he just needs par to tie
tell him to lay up
he listens to you
go for it roy
knock it on
this is why we split up he always went for it
my problem is ive never been with
a man who went for it
well honey hes your guy
he selects the three wood
good lord hes going for the green
this could be tragic
tin cups eyes focus with the look of eagles as he addresses the shot
one swing roy
one good swing
he swings the ball explodes off his club
tin cup holds the pose
suddenly a gust of wind blows out of nowhere and tin cups cap blows off provoking immediate concern
little gust there romes
picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery
the ball clears the water
and lands at the top of the slope fronting the elevated green
it pops up in the air lands just past where it hit and comes momentarily to rest
the gallery roars
and then the ball starts trickling back down the slope gaining speed moving towards the water even as the gallery screams for it to stop
until finally it disappears into the water with scarcely a ripple
he stares first with betrayal then with anger and looks at romeo who just shrugs then at molly
you can still make par from up there shes right pods a drop and a stroke up and down par well win it in sudden death
but tin cup still has the look of eagles
hes staring at the shot he just made still holding the three wood
i nutted that thing
little gust from the gods cost me
helluva move you put on that sucker now lets get up there take the drop and make our par tie peter
i can make this shot
tin cup throws another ball on the ground
im playing it from here
take your drop and make your par
tin cup addresses the ball
venturi nearly comes out of seat watching tin cup take a
drop from his original lie
i dont believe this
he just took himself out of the tournament with that drop
he could have walked up to the hazard line saved par with a wedge and forced a playoff with jacobsen
now he needs a miracle shot
ken im right behind mcavoy here
and all he said to his caddie was i can make it across
tin cup swings again the ball sails long and true once again and once again
it lands into the hill bounces once and trickles back into the water
this is tragic
holding his hand out to romeo as the gallery murmurs uncomfortably
gimme another ball
watching behind the ropes
i cant believe hes doing this
unfazed i can honey
he can blow the whole tournament
its a miracle he lasted this long
waiting at the green amidst the rest of the gallery whos in shock about tin cups decisions to keep going for it keep trying to prove a point
he done blew a gasket boys
the wheels is definitely falling off now
it was a miracle while it lasted
tin cup swings a third time
a ball lands sploosh
in the water and
tin cup holds out his hand for yet another ball saying nothing
romeo hands him another ball
tin cup unloads another wood
tin cup holds out his hand again
this is your last ball man
if this gets wet you disqualified
i can make it across
tin cup snatches the ball from romeos hand
venturi and nantz can barely look at the monitor
this is the most painful thing ive ever watched
jim this is the last ball he has in his bag
if he doesnt finish the hole with it he cant turn in a card
hell be disqualified
venturi and nantz cover their eyes
tin cup unloads another three wood another splash
he looks at molly
shes just laughing
romeo tosses down another ball tin cup launches his fifth attempt to clear the pond
youre right roy what the hell
let er rip
you two are made for each other
this is still all business to him
he sets his jaw addresses the shot and dollar bills
he swings another perfect shot
but this time the wind relents a knot and clears the water clears the slope hits the front of the green rolls up toward the pin and drops in the
the gallery goes berserk
raising his three wood aloft in triumph he looks over at molly and finally cracks a smile
and when she smiles back he takes his hat off and walks to the green to as great an ovation as the game has ever heard
venturi and nantz slump drained over their monitors
tin cup and simms sign their cards and get up to leave in unison
simms turns to tin cup and has to shake his head
i gotta hand it to you roy
when you go down you go down in flames
someday you can tell your grandchildren you finished second in the u
beat just dont tell em how
and he moves brusquely past simms and out of the tent congratulating tubbs the winner as he passes
good job tubbsy
you won it
and out of the scorers tent
a roar goes up from the milling fans as tin cup emerges
he tries to smile but its all dawning on him
i just gave away the open
and then mccord is there shoving a mike in tin cups face
mccord ledge i know its tough to talk right now but its not difficult to talk
its difficult to explain
i coulda laid up and still won
i made a twelve on the last hole of the u
you know how much money that cost me
mccord cost you a bundle
i gotta get outta here
mccord it was the greatest i ever saw
back to you jim
tin cup exits the scorers tent and runs into the regulars theyre beaming undyingly loyal
greatest i ever saw
you crunched that dog baby
gorgeous shot etc
he looks up and theres molly he stops short
molly im an idiot
i gave away the open
the one time in my life i know the play is to hit the lay up my whole life and future and career on the line and i still cant
make myself do it
i am a twisted human being and a cautionary tale
and i guess im a fool
a magnificent fool
mosquitoes pools of light the tractor chugs around picking up balls
romeo and doreen eye each other locked in a stare of longing and mystery
tango music comes from a boom box
they begin to move toward each other in a tango step
tin cup and molly are sitting feet up a couple lone star beers beside them just taking in the warm texas night
her head rests on his shoulder
the world at peace
some people dont like west texas but i think its the most beautiful place on earth
it has its charms
beat yknow by finishing in the top at the open you qualified to be in it next year damn i didnt know that
im thinking with your game you should go back to the qualifying school try to get out on tour
then i wouldnt see you
actually i picked up a whole bunch of new clients at the open
lotta guys on the tour said if i could do that much for you imagine what i could do for them
theres a lotta head cases out there you could make a bundle
and sleep in the winnebago at night
a man goes through what ive gone through hes supposed to learn something
beat im trying to figure out what i learned
did i learn anything
youre learning some discipline and self control
and that theres a time in life to play it safe
thats great roy
and im learning how to listen to the tuning fork throw caution to the wind and take crazy risks i never thought were possible
cmon molly when did you ever take a crazy risk
i fell for you
a desolate driving range outside of salome texas
bugs trucks passing in the night and a tiny radio sending george jones across the plains
