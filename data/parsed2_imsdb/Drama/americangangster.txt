this is whats wrong with america
the war footage multiplies by twenty a stack of tvs with price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window
its gotten so big you cant find your way
people on the sidewalk out of respect or fear part to let frank and bumpy and bumpys german shepherd pass
the corner grocerys a supermarket
candy stores a macdonalds
and this place
wheres the pride of ownership here
wheres the personal service
does anybody work here
inside the emporium is vast with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity
the tvs give way to a display window full of japanese stereo componentry
what right do they have cutting out the suppliers pushing all the middlemen out buying direct from the manufacturer sony this toshiba that all them chinks putting americans out of
hes not really asking frank so frank doesnt answer
what am i supposed to do with a place like this frank
who am i supposed to ask for the assistant manager
pause this is the problem
this is the way it is now you cant find the heart of anything to stick the knife
bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in
theyre all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees
frank kneels down
what is it
bumpy seems unable to speak looks to frank confused
somebody call an ambulance
but the store suddenly seems empty
frank yells into the emporium but cant be heard above the muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales bumpy will never see a piece of

white wine please
a white man who looks like a banker and is sits down next to frank
how you doing frank
what a loss
frank nods how are you otherwise
things okay financially
frank doesnt say
it feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here
he watches tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table
bumpy set something up for you
frank excuses himself without an answer crosses to where tango left the glass and sets it on a coaster
hey frank get me an ashtray while youre at it
bumpys german shepherd watches as frank reaches into his jacket revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster
he takes out a handkerchief wipes the condensation dry opens a drawer and removes an ashtray
he holds it out to tango who isnt sure its not a dare and decides to wander off
i know youre hurting frank
so am i
frank sits back down with charlie williams an older dope man

im sure bumpy never told you but he made me promise anything ever happened to him id make sure you didnt go without
ill be fine charlie
half the people here owed bumpy money when he died
a lot of money
if they think im going to forget to collect theyre wrong
thats the spirit
go get them
on the tv over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the s and s the opinion is offered that bumpys death marks the end of an era
a figure his back to us walks slowly toward a blackboard like a man to the gallows
i live in fear of hearing my name called
roberts give us u
meade of walking up there turning around knowing every one of them knows more than i do subject issues what the determination was and what it means to us today
richie roberts turns and faces his classmates all of them a decade or more younger than him
harlems jagged teeth skyline juts across the river at the other end of the george washington bridge
on this side a sledgehammer gripped in richies fist on the move suddenly fills the frame
you know the number fear of most people isnt dying its public speaking
they get physically ill
they throw up
and thats what you want to do for a living
i dont like being like that
i want to beat it
armed with the sledgehammer richie and his partner javy rivera come past a seedy motel office where a tv shows another report about bumpy johnson
legend new jersey a motel clerk looks up glimpses the sledgehammer
hey rivera flashes a new jersey detectives shield without breaking stride
takes a subpoena out of another pocket
whos going to do this
he knows me hell take it from me
ive known him since high school
just throw it in he doesnt take it
thats good service
they reach a particular motel room door
the door opens the length of a chain revealing a wise guy in an undershirt who when he sees the subpoena start to close the door throw it as richie
flings the subpoena in the door slams on his hand
he wails in agony tries to shoulder it open hears the dead bolt lock on the other side feels campizis teeth bite into his fingers watches his blood run down
down richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings past his head shattering the door the door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in
the wise guy campizi hurries for the bathroom slams the door
this ones hollow and the detectives more easily break through it campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window
richie grabs him throws him into the shower stall taking the plastic curtain down with them smearing it with blood as richie beats at him before rivera can pull him
a male paramedic attends to campizis bloodied face while a female paramedic cleans richies bloodied hand
i swear to god richie i didnt know it was you
i would never slam a door on your hand
you bit my fuckin hand richie lunges at him hits him again with his injured hand which hurts richie more than it does campizi
the paramedics manage to pull him away
what can we do richie
you dont want to do this
for old times sake what can we do
who do you want
who can i give you
you want big sals bookie
you want his accountant
ill give him to you
richie regards him a moment

he glances back to his paramedic dabbing at his bloody hand and notices shes not bad looking
she smiles back
four men in long black leather coats stride toward like they own the city
its impossible to tell if theyre cops or gangsters

voucher requesting evidence needed in court
he pushes the voucher under a sign all handguns and narcotics before am next window to a clerk who takes it past floor to ceiling shelves covered with files plastic

the other cops pull from the grocery bags a pyrex mixing bowl flour sifter boxes of milk sugar latex kitchen gloves a medical scale and yellow baggies
hands peel back the distinctive black and green evidence tape on the clear plastic bags
dump the heroin into twenty yellow baggies
a half kilo of lactose is poured into each of the now empty property room bags
now just enough for the reagent test
he removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the baggies and the now almost heroin free powder is mixed through the flour sifter poured back into the clear bags
the tape resealed the bags returned to the suitcase

the same dope popeye doyle and sonny grasso took from us
frank comes into an empty bar chairs up on tables
a middle aged man mopping up glances up at him as he crosses to a back room
they seize it arrest everybody whack it up and sell it back to us
they been living off it for years these new york cops
several ounces of the dope sits in foreground on a table
they basically control the market with it
what the fuck has happened to the world frank

sad about bumpy
behind frank a tv airs a report by walter cronkite on the heroin problem among gis in vietnam
things are never going to be the same in harlem

a street sign on a corner th and th avenue
as is his custom frank eats breakfast alone
a middle aged waitress appears when hes done picks up his plate and refills his coffee
thank you charlene
its all right with me frank you can stay all day if you want but i wouldnt
its nice outside
then maybe ill have to go for a walk
just cause you said so
she smiles and leaves
frank pours some sugar in his coffee
someone taps on the window and he looks up sees two servicemen one in uniform one he recognizes
frank leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building
corner apartment above the street
a girl sits smoking at a work table covered with drug cutting apparatus
another franks cutter and sometimes girlfriend red top sets a couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen
on the house for our men in uniform
why thank you sugar thats very kind
frank nods youre welcome before the man can thank him
the servicemen start cooking up the dope
you seen him
all the time
nate is everywhere
got himself a club now
i dont think hes ever coming home
regarding the dope as the servicemen shoot it up youre gonna have to boot it a couple times
cops keep cutting it selling it cutting it i dont want to say anything cause the price is right but the shit in nam is way way way way way
he begins to nod out before he can finish the sentence
across the river richie rivera and campizi sit in the car parked across from a closed social club
a man carrying a grocery bag comes out and campizi ducks lower in the seat
newsboy moriartys mob accountant puts the grocery bag in the trunk of a car climbs in behind the wheel
from the parked car they observe the accountant putting another bag in his trunk
he comes out of another place with another bag
to campizi all right
campizi slinks out of the car
richie and rivera follow after newsboy moriartys accountants car
they tail the car into a lot park and watch the accountant leave his car and get into another car thats parked there
we gonna stay with him or the car
whatever they do theyll have to decide quick
lets see who comes for the car
all the other cars are gone
rivera climbs into richies with coffee and a coke in a bag hands him the can
think he made us
richie doesnt know
glances at his watch
cranes in his seat to look behind them
you called for the warrant
where are they
i just called
i called and walked back here and ten seconds has gone by
richie watches an attendant lock up listens to the street lamps buzz grows impatient
indicating the other car we saw him with the slips javy
you saw policy slips
you saw grocery bags
you dont know whats in them
yes i do and so do you dont give me that bullshit whats the rush
half an hour the warrantll be here i got night school
guess youre going to miss it
rivera sips at his coffee then you know what you were saying before about throwing up in front of people money will take that feeling away
not when its less
less than what
than what i make now
no lawyer on earth makes less than a cop
they do in the prosecutors office
three thousand less
youre fuckin kidding me
richie isnt kidding
rivera stares at him like hes crazy
richie checks his watch
hes waited long enough
fuck this richie richie gets out opens the trunk grabs a slimjim and bolt cutters cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountants car rivera following
richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release and as he comes around back to search it
rivera may as well the damage to the case if there is one anymore is done
he crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment
richies staring into the trunk like theres a body inside
rivera comes over takes a look sees its money stacks of it rubber banded together spilling from grocery bags more than either of them has ever seen
as the trunk closes richie and rivera sit in their car in silence staring out at the car with the money in it
eventually this isnt a couple of bucks
its the same thing
were talking about principle
richie a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing hell turn in cops who take money
well be pariahs
were fucked either way
not if we keep it
only if we dont
then were fucked youre right
but not if we keep it
more to himself yes we are
goddamn it did we ask for this
did we put a gun to someones head and say give us your money
cops kill cops they cant trust
we cant turn it in
they regard each other again in silence
as a police captain counts the stacks of money lou toback richies superior from the prosecutors office walks in his night out interrupted by this emergency
he crossed to where richie and rivera sit alone in a corner
quietly how much
nine hundred and eighty thousand
what happened to the rest
its a joke but isnt funny not even to toback
he regards his men who turned it in then the other cops in the place who are watching them and the money being counted
toback walks over to the captain and quietly whatre you doing counting this in front of everybody
are you out of your fuckin mind
take it into a room
richies glance to rivera says youre right were fucked
as richie leaves alone hes aware of all the eyes on him knowing the other cops looks dont signify awe or respect but contempt and fear like rivera predicted
neither will ever be trusted again
he climbs into his car drives off
tango and his bodyguard come in and approach franks table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast
didnt you see the jar frank
i think you walked right past it
frank ignores him forks at his eggs eats
the money jar
on the corner
what i got to do put a sign on it
frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasnt full
he swallows finally but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip further irritating tango
bumpy dont own th street no more frank
bumpy dont own no real estate in harlem no more
im the landlord now and the lease is twenty percent
frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives tango a look that says that wont be happening
then dont sell dope frank
get a fuckin job
you need a job
you can be my driver drive me around open my door yes sir no sir where to sir right away massa johnson sir
right now tango is dead
no doubt about it
on the surface though frank remains cool
of every dollar
every vig every truckload every girl every ounce
in the jar
twenty percents my profit
if im giving it to you then what am i doing
twenty percent puts me and everyone you know out of business which puts you out of business
reaches for his breakfast check there are ways to make money legitimately and then theres this way
not even bumpy took twenty percent
bumpys fuckin dead
frank regards tango a moment gets up takes out his money clip covers the check on the table with a five peels off a bill from the clip tosses it
down in front of tango
thats twenty percent
as he turns and leaves tango watches after him
stitched up black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot put it on the stove
a pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures
but no matter how many times frank does the arithmetic theres not much left he calculates after he pays the italian suppliers and if he were to tango
richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law textbooks
he cracks one open to study for the new jersey bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in
above him on the wall is a framed photograph of joe louis standing over a sprawled on the mat billy conn
a bleak day
seagulls fighting over scraps on the sand as others hover overhead flapping and cawing
alone near the water frank tosses a stick for the german shepherd he inherited
richie opens a small wooden box in his bleak apartment revealing an ounce of marijuana rolling papers and clips
as he rolls a joint a leader is like a shepherd the sounds of the gulls and surf and roller coaster begin to fade as frank throws the stick again
sends the fast nimble sheep out front and the others follow as the shepherd walks quietly behind the dog retrieves the stick but this time somehow its to bumpys hand
he returns it
frank listens attentively
hes got the stick the cane and hell use if he has to
but most of the time he doesnt have to
he moves the whole herd quietly
bumpy smiles and tosses the stick
the smoke from the joint rises to the ceiling as richie studies
the dog trots back to bumpy and frank with the stick
hot dog stand
bumpy hands a hot dog to frank holds out another to the shepherd
to camera what right do they have cutting out the suppliers the middlemen buying direct putting americans out of work
this is the way it is now frank
the vender hands him a napkin
the shepherd is still with him but bumpy is gone and the gulls and the people on the roller coaster squeal as frank comes out of his meditative trance with
a needle pierces the crook of franks arm
a cotton ball is pushed onto the puncture
a strobe lights up franks face a passport photo
the photo and a duplicate are stapled to a passport application
keys turn the locks of a safety deposit box
the lid lifts revealing decks of cash
frank takes it all out slips one slender packet into bumpys bankers jacket pocket
get yourself a new suit
under portraits of bank vice presidents before him the man types out a chemical bank check for frank for
the sound of the plane growls and fades overhead as richies ex wife keeps an eye on their son playing on a grassy area
i dont know richie
it couldnt be avoided
next weekend ill be able to take him
she regards him with a weary look but hes looking over at one of the other better looking moms in the park
he looks back not sure he heard right
to the st
regis what do you care
pause my sisters
he glances away to a sound shattering glass
some teen agers breaking bottles on the ground
you cant move to vegas
not with michael anyway
what am i supposed to do with him
leave him with you
theres a picture
to the vandals hey you want to shut up over there
the teenagers ignore him
he tries to ignore them but its hard with the constant noise
no court will allow it for one thing
i wont allow it
when am i supposed to see my son
their son glances over at them
richie looks over at the teenagers again breaking bottles then back to laurie
laurie you cant raise a kid in las vegas
oh like this is a good environment
around your friends
there are less creeps in vegas
whats he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that
what are you thinking
im thinking richie of him
goddamn it the noise of the glass is driving him crazy
he strides over to the teenagers who look at him like what are you gonna do old man its four against one
i told you nice to shut the fuck up
now im gonna kill you
he pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them then the others
all instinctively try to cover their heads
pick up the fuckin glass
as they dive to their knees to do what theyre told laurie walks away with her son who looks back over his shoulder at his father with his gun out
frank sits in the back of a motor samlor
bicycles dart around it like flies
the clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on r r and asian women
a trio of ex gis plays authentic southern blues on a small stage
ham hocks and collard greens come out of the kitchen
smoke chokes the place
frank one of the few men not in uniform and not drunk or stoned sits alone at a table with a coca cola and surveys the activity dope being rolled
dope being smoked
dope being shot
gis and prostitutes climbing a staircase
his eyes follow an army master sergeant moving among the tables as if checking on the gis well being
but at some his hand takes money leaves in its place packets of powder
the sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up catching frank watching him from across the room
he squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows and in a kind of shock more to himself frank
frank half lifts his glass to wave and nate beams
frank has guests at his table now his cousin nate the sergeant and two young asian wise guys
they talk about him in thai subtitled he say how much he wants
he said a lot
what that means i dont know
four or five keys
the thais regard frank a moment size him up
hes your cousin
my cousin in law
my ex wifes cousin
ask him how much he wants
how much you gonna want frank
a hundred kilos
nate blinks like theres something in his eye
steam and neon
frank and nate at a crowded stand
no one i know can get that much
itd have to be pieced together from several suppliers and none of its gonna be percent pure
thats not what i want
i know that
but that means dealing with the chiu chou syndicates in cholon or saigon if theyll deal with you no even then its too late
its been chopped
i want to get it where they get it
from the source
nate stares at him
youre gonna go get it
youre gonna go into the fuckin jungle
ive lived in jungles all my life no
this is the jungle
the fuckin snakes alone will kill you
a room of student type desks and no character
richie and fifty others have been here for hours taking the exam less than half of them will pass
a motley bunch of thai thugs and black american soldiers with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle with nate and frank who armed with a pistol a rifle
and ammo bandolier like pancho villa is enjoying himself
from his pov the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy field the size of manhattan
frank stares down at it
on the ground now with their small private army nate speaks with one of the thais then translates for frank
he says this whole areas controlled by the kuomintang chiang kai sheks defeated army
some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm chinese soldiers with outdated weapons
frank tips his head to nate at some other figures below they aint chinese
a handful of better armed american sentries at the perimeter of the farm
frank nate and the others hang back as one of the thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas
the processing center for the entire region
the thai translator is with frank to negotiate with a vanquished chinese general
other americans and thais guard them while the chinese with their cia advisors guard them
the chinese general examines franks papers passport visa bank receipts and lots of cash then studies frank
how would you get it into the states
what do you care
who do you work for in there
what do you care
who are you really
it says right there
i mean who you represent
the man doesnt believe it but lets it go
you think youre going to take a hundred kilos of heroin into the us and you dont work for anyone
someone is going to allow that
the general regards one of his men
in chinese subtitled i dont believe a word of this
the general regards the cash and paperwork again for a moment
and to frank after this first purchase if youre not killed by marseilles importers or their people in the states then what
then thered be more
on a regular basis
though id rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time
the man regards frank for a long moment
glances back to the cash and paperwork again
finally of course not
torrential monsoon rains
nate and frank climb down from the huey
frank no longer wears the bandolier
now a press card dangles from his neck
stripes on the uniform of a black colonel with nate under a canopy
outside in the distance in the rain frank hangs out with some other black servicemen
wheres it now
i can bring it here or anywhere in between
a hundred kilos
nate nods i never seen that much dope in one place
its bigger than an amana refrigerator freezer
nate and frank watch the colonel emerge from the tent and cross through the rain on duck boards to another tent to speak with a white officer a star general
thatll cover them the pilots and the guys on the other end
give them a hundred
fifty to cover them all
and its all i got left
so if that dope doesnt arrive for whatever reason embraces nate and whispers cousin or no cousin dont let me down
he holds out a business envelope fat with money
nate hesitates knowing frank has just said hell kill him if things dont go right then takes it
ill let you know when its in the air
the nurse paramedic who stitched up his hand is in richies bed making so much noise hes worried someone will call the cops
the phone rings
and wont stop
neither will the nurse as richie answers it richie
richie im in trouble
this fuckin guy made me i dont know how but he did
he went for his gun
i had to do it i swear to god
now theyre going to kill me
richie can hear in sanders voice how serious it is and manages to disentangle himself from the woman
theres a hundred people out there heard the shots
you gotta help me
you gotta do something
is he dead
theyre gonna kill me
where are you
javy where are you
thats the problem
richie on his police radio which cuts in and out there are no cars in that area detective roberts
i got a man in trouble and i need back up
i missed that youre breaking up i said put the fucking call out again i just did
no one responded
ill try again but fuck you too
he slams the mic down
as richies car turns a corner the stephen crane projects the most foreboding place on earth rises up three dark floor towers planted on war torn grounds where a long
ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument
he parks and moves through an agitated all black crowd past an ambulance outside one of the towers through oppressive heat
its riot weather
drugs on a coffee table
body on the floor
rivera despondent on the couch
the male paramedics scared
richie on the phone sergeant im not asking im fuckin telling you get some patrolmen over here now
dial tone the police sergeant has hung up on him
richie throws the phone
the paramedics stare at him
you got no back up
why is that
the only other person who would know the answer to that is rivera who just shakes his head in despair
bandage his head
i know hes fucking dead
bandage his head clean him up put him on a gurney and prop it up so hes sitting
and open his eyes
richie comes out ahead of the gurney moving quickly like its a matter of life and death which it is motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the
step back injured man coming out
let them do their job and hell be all right
the people step back when they see the victim on the gurney tubes in his nostrils iv in his arm eyes open
before they can look any closer hes put in the ambulance
as it pulls out siren wailing richie leads rivera safely away they cross through an alley near the projects and rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief
thank you the words arent out of his mouth before richie shoves him up against a car
you robbed him didnt you
what are you talking about
richie rips riveras jacket pockets
money spills out
whered this come from
thats my money
ive never taken dirty money in my life
you lying piece of shit maybe the occasional gratuity
like anybody else
youre going to tell me thats wrong
no it isnt
its part of the salary for getting shot at
for that certain courtesies are shown
in gratitude richie disgusted with him lets go of him
rivera is embarrassed almost crying pleading a discount on a tv a doughboy in the backyard a new dress for your girlfriend maybe once a year
im talking about not living in fucking poverty
you want to call that wrong call it wrong
then goddamn it pay me fifty grand a year you son of a bitch
pay me what i deserve for getting shot at
next time four guys come into your place with sawed off shotguns you take care of it
you robbed him and then you shot him and i helped you get out of there
how many more you shot
rivera suddenly tries to get tough you know what richie
fuck you you make that kind of accusation against your own kind
and you know why
he takes out his car keys turns to leave
comes past richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a line of puncture scabs and scars
youre a disgrace
im a leper
because i listened to you and turned in a million fucking dollars
you know wholl work with me after that
same as you
richie squeezes riveras hand around the car key
dont look down there
at richies eyes you ever fuckin threaten me again ill kill you
richie squeezes sanders hand so hard the car key cuts through the skin drawing blood
a beat up chevy parked alongside a perimeter fence
frank waits by the car as a military jeep with its lights out comes across a firing range
it slows stops
in it the silhouettes of three servicemen black armed with m s
silence again before open the trunk
frank does it then stands aside as the other servicemen drag four large taped up duffel bags from the jeep to his car lift them into his trunk and slam
the duffel bags still closed on a table
frank regards them nursing a drink putting off the moment of discovery that he has perhaps spent his lifes savings on nothing
the german shepherd watches as frank removes the tape from one of the bags
he pulls it open has almost no reaction except to breathe again then opens the next and the next
and we see several brick like packages of no
heroin wrapped in paper marked with chinese writing stamped with a label two lions on their hind legs paws on a globe and in english double uoglobe brand
the duffel bags are elsewhere
the only evidence of any drugs is the small amount frank has given a chemist who looks like a harvard student to test
it responds instantly
the young man looks at frank
typically what i see is to percent pure
ive never seen anything like this
no alkaloids no adulterants no dilutents
its a hundred percent
the chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up but frank gives him some to take home instead
take it with you
i dont want to have to call the coroner
the chemist gathers his things to leave offering a last piece of advice store it in a cool dark place

richie im just trying to understand things your wife has said
if theyre not true tell me
yeah tonys one of them
is he also your sons godfather
sheila glances over to where richies ex wife sits with her own lawyer across the room
do you really care about this
or do you just not want her to win ever
how often do you see your son as it is
but she wants to make it never
yeah all right
give me a twenty
richie doesnt reach for his wallet well im not going to sit here all day
she takes a twenty from her purse and carries it up to the judges assistant clipped to their paperwork
all rise frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house
his neighbors those he can see are white
he hears a sound cars arriving and crosses toward the house where a sold for sale sign leans against a half built kennel
out front a caravan of cars and pickup trucks north carolina plates loaded with boxes and suitcases has just arrived
exhausted from the drive but excited to be here the travelers climb out franks five brothers their wives and kids and their mother
teddy thinks its the right place
the others arent as sure
the house is too nice
theres a new lincoln towncar parked outside the garage
theyll probably be shot for trespassing
the front door opens and frank comes out trailed by his dog
he first gathers his mother in an embrace then each of his startled brothers
the house is alive with the noise of family and scent of home cooked food as the extended lucas clan theres more than twenty of them sits around a big
dining room table passing the platters around
frank at the head of the table clearly loves having them all here
he got an arm on him
major league arm aint that right
everyone agrees as turners son franks nephew the year old boy seen pitching in the north carolina back yard tries to shrug
you show me after supper
you cant catch him
hell take your head off
were talking mile an hour
you know how fast that is
you see the ball leave his hand and thats the last you see it before it knocks you down
smiling happy is that right
the wonderful noise continues downstairs as frank leads his mother on a tour of the upstairs
the place is a showroom of traditional americana
this is your room
lucas is in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its furnishings
its unlike anything shes used ever seen not graceland exactly but not far off
her eyes settle on an old vanity dotted with french perfume bottles
how did you
i had it made
you were five when they took it away
how could you remember it
touches the reproduction of the vanity her son last saw more than thirty years ago
looks at the room its all perfect
she looks at him im so proud of you
the statue of liberty against the new york skyline
the man i worked for ran one of the biggest companies in new york city for almost fifty years
as frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk the towncar that was parked at the teaneck house driven by franks body guard doc follows alongside at the same pace they
i was with him every day for fifteen of them looking after him taking care of things protecting him learning from him
the brothers cant help but notice the storekeepers who wave to frank the women who smile the men who step out of his path like theres a red carpet under
his polished shoes
bumpy was rich but never white man rich
because he didnt own the company
he thought he did
he only managed it
someone else owned it
so they owned him
frank leads his brothers up the stairs and down the hall
nobody owns me
because i own my company
intercut feminine hands stamp small packets of blue cellophane with the words blue magic and my company sells a product thats better than the competitions at a price thats lower
frank stops outside an apartment door
what are we selling frank
frank pushes the door open revealing five naked women at work tables their faces veiled by surgical masks cutting heroin with lactose and quinine in a precise mixture of controlled
the lucas brothers stare as the supervisor of the activity clothed with red hair comes over
honey these are my brothers
tango strolls down the street like hes the godfather of harlem girl on his arm bodyguard at his side
as his brothers eat lunch frank who can see tango outside uncaps a glass sugar container
what matters in business is honesty integrity hard work loyalty and never forgetting where you came from
for reasons his brothers cant imagine frank empties all sugar from the container onto his plate
you are what you are and thats one of two things
or youre something
understand what im saying
the brothers nod tentatively stare at the now empty glass container
frank wipes his mouth with a napkin gets up
ill be right back
he comes out of the diner crosses the street toward tango whos buying fruit
greets him cheerfully hey tango whats up
i was just thinking about you
i was looking at the jar and you know what
i didnt see nothing in it
the fuck you want frank before the last word is out of tangos mouth franks got a gun pressed against his forehead
everyone backs away the bodyguard too
tangos girl pulls her arm from his and takes off
eventually whatre you going to do boy
shoot me in broad daylight
in front of everyone
its as if life on the street has stopped
no one moves everyone is looking at frank maybe thats what he wants
as tango laughs at the thought yeah thats right
frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board
frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest the shots echoing down the street
then its quiet again
everyones still looking him but frank doesnt run
instead he calmly reaches into tangos suit pocket takes out a money clip thick with cash drops it in the jar and sets it next to the body
for the cops
should be enough
frank returns to the diner and sits back down ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place
tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar
that basicallys the whole picture right there
a cadaver drawer slides open revealing not tango but rivera staring up lifeless his arms stomach legs and toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict
did you know his girlfriend
good looking girl
one of his informants
the medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer containing her body
richie stares at it
shouldve seen their place
like animals lived there
i have seen it
to the examiner chose a good night huh
grand central station in here
its been like this
im lucky i get home before midnight lots of careless ness
richie regards riveras personal effects resting on his chest in a plastic bag few bucks the corvette key a half empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane
richie takes the blue cellophane from the bag and as the drawer closes entombing sanders holds it in his hand
heroin addiction is no longer exclusive to big city neighborhoods its epidemic the reports shows lawmakers on capitol hill juxtaposed against images of inner cities junkies homicide victims and perhaps
most telling white suburbia
since law enforcement has watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime
now unaccountably it has exploded reaching into cities as a whole our suburbs and towns our schools
the tv is in a small police gym where richie lifts weights very much aware of his pariah status as out of shape cops come in only to leave again
when they see him
someone is finally saying enough
federal authorities have announced their intention to establish special narcotics bureaus in washington new york los angeles chicago boston newark and other major cities toback comes in watches richie alone
its a dog and pony show
its not being advertised as one
richies changing into his street clothes
but its federal
id have to answer to who
me and the u
no one else
hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope
too much temptation for the feeble minded
though hes not in much of a position to refuse the assignment richie still isnt convinced its a good idea
toback levels with him richie a detective who doesnt have the cooperation of his fellow detectives cant be effective
you know why i dont have it
no theyre all on the take and im not and it doesnt matter to anyone
instead of giving you a medal for turning in money they bury you
its fucked up
maybe thiss an opportunity away from all that
they regard each other
eventually ill do it but only like this i dont set foot in a police station again
i work out of a place of my own
and i pick my own guys
guys i know wouldnt take a nickel off the sidewalk
an old building that was once an episcopal church
the place has been long abandoned
the city maintenance worker who let richie in watches him move through the debris strewn church
a real estate broker watches frank consider the high ceilinged spaciousness of a grand unfurnished s modern upper east side penthouse richie regards the colored light thrown down by the
stained glass windows frank regards light streaming in from the garden terrace richie picks up a faded photograph of a priest in a broken frame
to the maintenance man this is the only floor well be using
frank distractedly opens and closes a high curtain in one of the rooms
no loan no contingencies
wet streets and neon
well dressed crowd behind a velvet rope outside the club
the apollo in the background james brown on the marquee
a still powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his chair to wild applause
from the stage mr
joe louis ladies and gentlemen
joe bows graciously gives a little wave to the crowd and sits back down as the band starts up again
at another table frank sits with charlie williams and rossi slightly older dope men
like frank they favor expensive tailored suits
their dates too are nicely dressed not too much make up or jewelry
franks glance moves from joe louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman at the table
whos the beauty queen
she is a beauty queen
miss puerto rico
her glance crosses franks briefly but is yanked to the entrance of the club when franks brothers come in with their wives and girlfriends
teddys in a parrot green suit gold chains hat acting like he owns the place
frank hustles teddy into an empty back room
what is this
he turns teddy so hes facing a mirror
these are clothes
this is a very nice suit
im wearing clothes
these are clothes
those teddys in the mirror are a costume
with a sign on it that says arrest me
you look like fuckin jackie fox
whats wrong with jackie
i like jackie
you like jackie
you want to be superfly
go work for him end up in a cell with him
teddy pulls himself from franks grasp
smooths his shirt adjusts his hat
frank tries to explain to him the guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one
thats not who you want to be
he wants to talk to you by the way
i told him id tell you
frank stares at his brothers reflection in the mirror
you and jackie were talking about me
not about you
we were talking
he said he wanted to talk to you about something
frank clearly wants nothing to do with jackie fox
im taking you shopping tomorrow
i went shopping today
you go shopping every day
like a girl
a creme bentley pulls up and out pour jackie fox and his entourage
hes got an armful of new york times magazines with him on the cover flaunting gangster chic
he starts handing them out to the crowd on his way into the club
joe louis has come over to speak to frank at his table
its a tax thing
its a mistake my lawyers will straighten out but for the time being its a headache how much you owe
its nothing like fifty grand
frank isnt sure if its an honor or a curse to have a celebrity like joe louis asking to borrow money but nods
dont worry about it
ill pay you back soon as joe
its a gift
not a loan
you dont owe me nothing
jackie glides into the club with his magazines and entourage
frank watches him make the rounds lingering at miss puerto ricos table and holding her hand longer than he should with his girlfriend on his arm
frank glances to teddy wearily then to doc alone at the next table like a sentry
frank doesnt have to say hes ready to leave
doc knows the look
frank comes into the coat check area where doc waits with his overcoat
as frank slips into it miss puerto rico returning from the ladies room comes through
youre frank and this is your place
he doesnt say whether it is or not whys it called smalls
why dont you call it franks
because i dont have to
he smiles and its hard to tell which is more enchanted with the other
a club across the river
not nearly as nice as smalls much louder but like smalls almost all black
richie shares a booth with a black undercover detective
im reluctant to bring anyone in i dont personally know
you know me and i vouch for them
richie nods yeah he knows that but remains unconvinced
richie we work together
you want me you got to take them too
where are they
spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor
with the skinny white woman
richies glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with his skinny white date
thats abruzzo with the fat black one
richie sees a young italian with tatoos the only other white man in the place dancing with a heavy black woman
both jones and abruzzo look more like criminals than cops
both are good with wires
have good informants
and theyre fearless
theyll do anything
theyre insane richie like you
frank sits in back alone
peers ahead through the windshield
his face relaxes as he sees ana waiting on a corner dressed nice handbag
the towncar pulls to the curb
i got it
frank gets out before doc can and escorts ana to the car
i hope you werent waiting long
a woman as beautiful as you shouldnt have to wait for anything
he opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman slides in after her
outside the house doc sits in the car reading a newspaper
ana considers some family photographs on a mantle
this is your father
frank shakes his head no
its a picture of bumpy
you really dont know who that is
she doesnt its martin luther king
it is not
he was as important as dr
whatd he do
a lot of things
he had a lot of friends
he served new york and it served him
what was he to you
frank has to think
bumpy was more than his employer
whatd he teach you
how to take my time
how if youre going to do something do it with care do it with love
and its working here
sudden bursts of violence guys beat up others shot one being poured with gasoline as bumpy looks on calmly the same calm benign face in the photograph
how be a gentleman
thats what you are
ana smiles like she knows better
any second now like every other guy shes ever met shes sure hell try to take her upstairs
i got five different apartments in the city i couldve taken you to
i brought you here instead
ana glances to the stairs which franks mother is coming down
to meet my mother
is this her
oh shes beautiful frank
look at her
shes an angel come down from heaven
lucas embraces ana like family
a single half empty packet of heroin the same one from the morgue in distinctive blue cellophane tacked to a bulletin board
richie perched on a desk in front of it
our mandate is to make major arrests
no street guys we want the suppliers the distributors
spearman jones and abruzzo sit in the back looking like delinquent students
of everyone in the open ground floor thats been only slightly renovated and there are about fifteen of them theyre the most disreputable looking
heroin cocaine amphetamines
no grass under a thousand pounds
less than that someone else can waste their time
jones nudges abruzzo to pay attention
abruzzo elbows him back
richie just waits like a teacher for their attention
well be handling big shipments big money big temptation
jones raises his hand yeah
theres a story about you
about turning in some money
a lot of money
is it true
jones isnt the only one here curious to know
its not true
abruzzo looking like a junkie dirty jeans wool cap approaches a dealer on the corner
the perspective shifts to richie spearman and jones in a car watching as abruzzo chats briefly with the dealer before the exchange takes place for a blue cellophane packet
richie and the others watch jones tests the heroin
stuffs ten percent pure
strong enough to smoke for all those suburban white kids afraid of needles
the other detectives are exchange a glance
none has ever heard of anything on the street that pure
you paid ten bucks for it
and its all thats out there
now how is that possible
who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much
richie glances to a table of organization surveillance photos haphazardly thumb tacked to a bulletin board known dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime families almost all of
an r b song begins and continues over a poppy bulb being pierced the white liquid oozing changing into filthy liquids in wooden bowls and finally a gray paste
frank sits with the bank vice president who wires a transfer to
where nate sits with the same thai bank president as before who converts the transfer to cash
nate slides cash across a table to a couple of chinese gangsters
a tent nate hands more cash the military brasss cut to the star general from before
an airstrip slicing propellers
wounded soldiers on stretchers helped onto a transport plane
nearby four large crates japanese tvs under cargo netting
the pilot stuffs more cash in a pouch and salutes nate
general westmoreland returns a salute archive
the same plane on the tarmac here taxiing
a pile of discarded tv boxes outside a supply warehouse
at the perimeter of the base black servicemen transfer heavy taped up duffel bags from an army jeep to a station wagon hoisting those that wont fit inside onto a
two lucas brothers tie them down with twine
the station wagon heading north on a rain slicked highway the canvas tarpaulin on top flapping
in the distance the spire of the washington monument glows
a black woman pushes a shopping cart containing a baby pampers and cases of milk sugar across a parking lot
empty milk sugar boxes
redtop and her five table workers clothed now the surgical masks dangling from their necks wiping down table surfaces scales and apparatus
tens of thousands of blue cellophane packets of heroin neatly cover two of the folding tables
kids wrench open a fire hydrant and with an empty soda can direct the water into a fountain
the water sprays down onto the windshield of a beat up chevy coming slowly through revealing when it clears frank behind the wheel
glances at his watch
clock on the wall of a locker area
cops in t shirts
fans blowing the humid air around
blue and whites arriving and leaving shirts coming off as the cops alight
the driver checks his watch
turns his almost empty bus up th avenue
air conditioner full blast
radio announcing the time oclock
frank glances out the wet windshield of the chevy and watches th street transform its as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls
junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys storefronts tenements and side streets from the street itself it seems snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware
small blue cellophane packets and only blue are pulled from pockets and change hands
in alleyways its cooked up and sucked into syringes and in dank grim indescribably filthy rooms plunged into veins and dollar bills changing hands decks of cash rubber banded together
put into envelopes and delivered to the lucas brothers to lester at his metal door shop
eugene at his dry cleaners
turner at his tire service shop
earl at his electrical shop
teddy at his body shop
piles of cash
the brothers try counting it all but its just too much
its actually tiring
were going to be here all night if we count every bill
time cut a money counting machine flips through the bills its counter flying
the brothers rubberband it all in decks
jot down the numbers
put the money in newly assembled file boxes
tape them shut
alone in the room frank transfers stacks of s from the file boxes into several open safety deposit boxes
the penthouse is now richly decorated
the r b music playing through a state of the art stereo system
its a kind of office party for franks brothers cousins wives and girlfriends distributors like rossi and other east harlem guys charlie williams couple of cops on franks payroll and
the chemical bank vice president
you got a stockbroker frank
i deal with enough crooks as it is
the banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of one of his business cards
this one couldnt be more honest
hes got a lot of clients in the business
you cant leave all your money in safety deposit boxes give him a call
the banker hands him the card and moves on
franks trying to have a good time but the level of noise and revelry is beginning to make him uncomfortable
this is mike sibota
sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels
what can i get you
a left hander from what charlie tells me
frank points to his nephew stevie across the room
its been his dream all his life to play for the yankees and hes good enough
so i hear
you have him come see me
well give him a try out
as the scout hands his card to frank we whip over to where teddy his driver jimmy racine and their girlfriends coked up are laughing as a black cop flashing
his detectives shield pretends to frisk jimmy
from jimmys pocket oh thats it im taking you in
joking you cant take me in for that i got a license for that motherfucker
gives the gun back this then the pile of coke on the coffee table but first the cop sucks up a line before pretending to cuff jimmy
all right now im arresting you
teddy peels s from a money clip
let him go
this is for you
what is that a bribe
oh now youre all under arrest
the cop pretends to arrest them all but what he doesnt pretend is the hand he puts on jimmys girlfriends breast as he frisks her
what is that
it was quick but jimmy saw it even though his girlfriend didnt react
the cop oblivious is cuffing teddy now
im taking you all in
i said what the fuck was that
what was what
the room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to the floor clutching at his leg blood running through his fingers onto the carpet
oh hes all right
i just shot him in the leg
you got a health plan what are you complaining about
here peels off some money five hundred all right
look hes feeling better all the time
suddenly frank grabs jimmy and throws him against the wall
as ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt and soda water frank sits with his five brothers in the debris strewn aftermath of the party
silence before i cant have this kind of stupidity
it was an accident
he feels terrible about it
he doesnt feel shit coked up all the time
get rid of him
hes your cousin
whats he gonna do
go back home
ill talk to him
ill straighten him out
frank looks at teddy in his tinted jackie fox like goggle glasses like hes going to straighten anybody out
gimme those glasses
frank pulls them from teddys face and crushes them
richie sifts through the morning mail at his desk
stops on an envelope from the new jersey bar association
as he works up the nerve to open it spearman jones and abruzzo organize the italian wise guys photos on the t
ice pick paul goes here no hes under benny two socks no youre thinking of benny the bishop
benny two socks is toscas deadbeat son in law
richie comes over studies the table of organization a moment then begins untacking the photos from the top down whatre you doing
we just for a cop the uppermost thing is the arrest
for a prosecutor the arrest is nothing without the evidence to convict
we dont have any real evidence on anyone on this board so theyre coming down
were starting over from the street
what are you a prosecutor all of a sudden
richie tacks his exam results onto the t
richie and the amigos observe a buy from a parked car the blue cellophane changing hands
ignoring the buyer as he walks away they keep watching the seller
the seller is observed coming out of a mechanics garage
richie ignores him as he walks away watching instead the garage
eventually a mechanic wiping his hands on a rag steps out and richie raises a camera
the image of the mechanic a supplier freezes a slightly blurred photo of the mechanic goes up on a new almost bare table of organization
atop of a telephone pole abruzzo dripping with lineman equipment works to attach a slave to the lines bare room
richie jones and spearman eating take out food as tape recorder reels turn
those snow tires you give me last time come in yet
im going to want some more of them gimme one and a half more of them
the detectives laugh
toback has richie sign a voucher for cash
this is more than a years salary richie
if it disappears i wont be able to get it for you again
itll never be out of my sight
jones tapes a tape recorder the size of a pack of cigarettes to richies bare chest
undercover in a wise guys cashmere sweater and slacks richie watches the mechanic count the hes given him
its got to be blue magic
yeah yeah its blue
you can pick it up here tomorrow
wheres the rest of the money
ill give you the other half tomorrow when you give no no no i dont do that
go fuck yourself
richie rather reluctantly hands over the rest of the k
spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic change lanes up ahead heading for the george washington bridge and glances over concerned to richie who is changing the cashmere
sweater for an old t shirt
hes going into new york
what are they going to do arrest us
new york cops
they can do worse than that
were not losing that money
as spearman follows the truck the george washington bridge linking jersey to manhattan looms in the windshield
the pickup pulls to the curb outside a pleasant avenue grocery store
as the guy enters the place spearmans car stops long enough for richie to climb out and continues on
richie crosses the street tries to see who the guy is talking to inside but hes just buying a cup of coffee to go
spearmans car turns the corner to circle around the block
as soon as its gone the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen richie
sees a delivery truck double parked guys unloading crates
hears a horn and knows its must be spearman stuck on the side street
the mechanic starts his truck
desperate not to lose him and his money richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light flashes his badge
get the fuck out of the car
the driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up
reaching in richie gets his arm stuck pulls at the lock yanks the door open drags the driver out breaking the cabbies arm and jumps in
he swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic screeches around the corner glimpses the truck far up ahead guns the engine flies through a red light glances
at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding the truck turns up ahead and richie barrels through another red light turns the corner and keeps the truck a couple car lengths ahead in sight
richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza parlor
richie climbs out crosses the street
coming past the place he tries to look inside without breaking stride
from around a corner striding toward him come four men looking like gestapo thugs in leather coats manicured hair the princes of the city
richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant
richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window
watches trupo and his siu detectives burst in guns drawn
they rough everybody up get some down on the floor
one detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag
another gathers the dope
the mechanic tries to protest and trupo slaps him down with his pistol
richie keeps watching as the ny cops arrest no one but take the dope and the money richies money and stride out as abruptly as they appeared like bandits
as they come past richie thats my money
the fuck are you
richie shows them his bureau of narcotics id
the bills are sequenced and registered with the essex county prosecutors office
all begin with cf
take a look
one of them checks some of the bills and sees hes right
goddamn it i thought we had a score
i thought i had a fucking chris craft sitting in my driveway
just give it back to me
three of the four cops laugh
its an affable gang of thieves
the one who doesnt laugh hangs back as the others start off
he examines richies new jersey id
whens the last time i was in jersey
let me think
whatre you doing coming over here without letting anybody know
you dont know you can get hurt doing that
trupo smiles richie smiles you got your money
now never ever come into the city again unannounced
you come in to see a fuckin broadway show you call ahead first to see if its okay with me
trupo pats him on the back and leaves with the others
what do we hate most
isnt it the transgressions of others we fear were capable of ourselves
its very late
richie and toback are alone
eventually richie cops are like yeah i know like everyone else
some of them will steal no matter what
there can be a camera on them theyll do it
somell never do it
the rest are capable of either depending how their department leans
only theirs isnt leaning its fallen over
the patrol cars dont even stop in harlem just roll down the window so the dealers can throw the money in
i saw drops made on precinct steps
what were you doing there
its where this dope is coming from
out of new york
what am i supposed to do ignore it
the cab drivers filed aggravated assault and grand theft charges he wouldnt stop
motherfucker almost ran me over
which he may reconsider depending on the amount the state of new jersey offers to settle i told him i was a cop
i showed him my identification
you stole his cab and broke his arm
i was chasing your thousand dollars
i dont want to hear about you going into new york anymore
then my investigations over
youre not listening to me
i said i dont want to hear about it
you do whatever you have to do go wherever you have to go to find out whos bringing this shit into the country
just dont tell me
turns to leave get some sleep
richie in robe and underwear opens the door to find a woman in the hall holding a briefcase
im here for our appointment
he has no idea who the black woman is
an old girlfriend hes forgotten maybe
behind him vida can see a stewardess buttoning up her uniform by a little travel case on wheels
the apartment itself she can also see is a mess
from child social services
barbecue after their sunday softball game
richie and his o
friends wise guys still in their brown and orange weequahie jerseys drinking beer cooking hamburgers
when you asked me to be your sons godfather i took it very seriously
richie and tony zaca relax in the den like pool house
i said yes id take on this responsibility take care of your son god forbid something happened to you tony the things shes telling child social services make me look
very bad out all night
lowlife informants hanging around
women old friends like me
richie feels horrible doing this
then its all right
they ask me ill tell them what you want me to tell them
ill lie for you
tony nods youre welcome
can tell theres something else on richies mind
you dont have to talk about it you dont want
what do you hear about blue magic
a lot of sorrow and misery from guys being put out of business
nothing about whos bringing it in
guys down south is all i heard
down south florida
i dont know
all i can tell you is whoever it is theyre upsetting the natural order of things
among the framed family photos around them is a picture of tonys uncle albert tosca
a napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a fountain outside a castle like mansion
next to it ride three others on marble horses a woman and two children
pull a clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden
a shotgun blast shatters it
the man with the gun albert tosca hands another to frank
as frank sets to shoot ana can seen behind them with toscas wife in the opulent house looking uncomfortable
the whole place was imported brick by brick from gloucestershire
its very nice
a strained silence thicker than the tapestries settles over them until pull the shotgun booms as servants stand by tosca and his wife and their only guests frank and ana
finished with lunch get up from the table in the formal formal dining room
tosca leads ana off to give her a tour of the house the men head off the other way
shes a lovely girl
you should marry her
too many things to look after right now to think about that
thats a mistake
if i may say
dont take her for granted girl like that
they enter a rich wood paneled study lined with books
you interested in history frank
the events that have brought us to where we are today
you know who was
bumpy was interested in a lot of things
i always wonder if people know when historys being made
and what theyre doing at the time
this for instance could be a historic moment and youre sipping a glass of ice water
droplets snake down franks glass
he senses tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here
bumpy and i did a lot of business together as you know
whatever he needed hed come to me and id do my best to provide it
he came to me i didnt go to him is the point im trying to make
you know why
he didnt have what you needed
you had what he needed
weve always had to come to you
tosca studies frank who is a study in inscrutability
monopolies are illegal in this country frank because no one can compete with a monopoly
if they let the dairy farmers do that half of them would go out of business tomorrow
im just trying to make a living
which is your right
because this is america
but not at the unreasonable expense of others
thats un american
he studies frank you know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesnt represent its true cost of production
i set a price i think is fair
its very unfair in fact
your customers are happy but what about your fellow dairy farmers
youre not thinking of them
very calmly im thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me
i can see youre getting excited
dont get excited
thats not why i invited you to my home
to get excited
frank doesnt look excited at all
hes the picture of calm
tosca smiles benignly and gets up
here i got something for you
tosca opens a humidor takes out a couple of cuban cigars
now what if im just thinking out loud you sold some of your inventory wholesale and i helped with the distribution
i dont need it
i already got everything from th street to yankee stadium river to river
which is a little mom and pop store compared to what im talking about
i could make you bigger than k mart
chicago detroit vegas
im speaking nationwide
and id guarantee you peace of mind
you know what i mean by that
its a backhanded threat
tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine frank
you can see im a renaissance man
unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened
ask them what is civil rights they dont know
theyre not as open to change from the way things are done and whos doing it
but i can talk to them so there wont be any misunderstanding
thats what i mean by peace of mind
frank knows in truth hes not being given any choice in this matter
still maybe its not so bad
you pay what a kilo now
and i can get you as much as you want
tosca slips on his best poker face
fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him
you see i was right
this is a historic moment
youre going to be bigger than bumpy himself
he hands frank one of the cigars expertly prepared
cant smoke it here unfortunately
grace doesnt like it
take it with you
doc waits by the car as frank and ana walk toward him
the toscas wave goodbye from the front step of the mansion
frank slips the cigar into his top pocket as they climb in
why would you trust these people the way they look at you
they look at me like its christmas and im santa claus
they looked at us like were the help
kisses her cheek no
theyre working for me now
a tv muhammad ali the black mans black man and joe frazier the white mans black man at their madison square garden press conference where ali says as much
most of the guys watching it
he comes over to table of organization
tacks his bar association notice to it
regards the photographs like tentacles of octopus yet to have a head
only the lowest section is made up of blacks including charlie williams and jackie fox but not frank lucas
the rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up
theyve hit a wall they cant get past
another tv here howard cosell ringside at the garden as the first early fans arrive pointing out that the fight because of the political stand alis taken is less about
boxers than war versus anti war
frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color coordinated racks of phil cromfeld suits as ana in her lingerie puts on make up at a vanity
he comes up behind her and sets down a small jewelry box
the tv in the background as richie puts a camera with a long lens in a sports bag and reaches for his coat
anas reflection in the vanity mirror as frank slips the engagement ring on her finger
she wipes at a tear then gets up and hugs him
she kisses him
admires the ring
and i bought you something too
she crosses past the tv takes a garment bag down from her side of the closet lays it on the bed next to franks suit jacket
she takes hold of the zipper but doesnt immediately pull it hoping perhaps to create some dramatic tension
what is it
she unzips the bag like shes unveiling great art
but instead of seeing whats inside were allowed only franks reaction his smile of anticipation slowly changing to chagrin
richie observes celebrities and gangsters arriving in limousines sammy davis jr
and his wife joe louis and his tosca and some of his guys then enters the arena as another limo pulls up
ana climbs out
you look great
no one else emerges you want to miss the fight
finally a patent leather shoe pokes out sets down on the curb
then its mate beside it
the shoes step away from the limo and pre fight
richie blended in with the a group of press photographers regards the organized crime figures ringside
he takes a few pictures with the long lens camera as
the owner of the gleaming patent leather shoes is shown to his second row ringside seat just behind the sports writers and we move up the full length chinchilla coat
to franks uneasy expression richies camera roams the faces of the prime ticket holders ringside organized crime figures celebrities politicians women with plunging necklines and platinum hair excuse me richie cant believe its joe louis brushing past him mr
louis joe looks back as richie approaches him im sorry but i just have to tell you sir you were a hero to me growing up
i still push elevator buttons eight times for the rounds you beat billy conn in
louis acknowledges richie only slightly more than not at all
turns away to join his friends
richie watches after him stung by louiss disregard
he snaps a picture of an italian wise guy he doesnt recognize
sifts the cameras view past frank in the chinchilla coat
then returns to him watches as tosca and his guys sit down behind frank
richie cant hear but can see their good natured exchange hey frank you keep that hat on im gonna miss the fight the odd thing to richie is chinchillas seat
is better than all the italians
detective trupo notices this too
richie focuses on the chincillas date a stunning girl a beauty queen then shifts back to her boyfriend whos now shaking the proffered hands of other italians then don king
joe louis himself who barely acknowledged richies existence comes over and playfully exchanges punches with the man in the chinchilla coat
a sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except for the spot on the ring
ali and frazier are coming down the steps through the crush of fans and reporters preceded by soldiers carrying flags
richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat but hes hidden by a flag
then he glimpses him again just as ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as robert goulet begins the national anthem
ali pointedly doesnt sing along
richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla coat focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light and snaps the shutter richie tacks the photograph of the man
in the chinchilla coat to his table of organization low and off to the side by other pieces of the puzzle that dont fit other new faces with no names
spearman holds a scrap of paper thats is the plate number on the limo
check with the company who rented it
hes a supplier at most
or just a pimp
wedve heard of him otherwise
no hes bigger than that
his seats were phenomenal better than al toscas
joe louis and ali shook his fuckin hand
they look from toscas high position on the board to franks low one and a wedding march played in traditional fashion on organ begins and carries over from above a
sea of ladies hats all coral and pink
below frank stands at the altar waiting for his bride
his name is frank lucas
toback sifts through documents richie has gathered limousine company records franks thin arrest record mug shots of him years younger the photograph from the fights and some more from subsequent
originally from greensboro north carolina
couple of arrests years ago
gambling robbery unlicensed firearm
for fifteen years he was bumpy johnsons collector bodyguard and driver
he was with him when he died
anas family and friends on one side of the aisle the extended lucas family on the other
franks mother looks at her eldest son at the altar with pride
five brothers hes the oldest lots of cousins all living here now spread out around the boroughs and jersey
the brothers are a lucas brother hands some dry cleaning to spearman eugene lucas in brooklyn another lucas brother examines a lamp with a frayed cord brought in by jones

turner lucas the bronx richie kicks a dent into the fender of his old car
as an appraiser writes up an estimate richie observes teddy attending to paperwork inside
and teddy lucas in bergen county
a photograph of teddy goes up on the t
next to frank and the other brothers and some cousins except for the chinchilla coat which no one can explain franks life seems orderly and legitimate
best man teddy standing next to frank at the altar as the bride is escorted down the aisle by her father
tight on frank in a beautiful tuxedo a light goes on in a penthouse window
down below by his parked car richie shivers in the early morning cold
he gets up early
has breakfast at a midtown place usually alone
richie tosses a glance inside a restaurant as he passes the window to where frank sits eating at a table doc nearby
then goes to work
meeting with his accountant or lawyer dropping in on one of the several office buildings he owns
nights he usually stays home
when he does go out its to a club or dinner with his new wife friends celebrities sports figures never o
richie sits in his car across from smalls where bouncers keep out people like him

franks mother tearfully watches her son slip a ring onto anas finger next to the fat engagement diamond before ana in turn puts a gold band on franks
the minister pronounces them husband and wife the veil is lifted and they kiss to great applause as a photographer takes the official photograph of the wedding party on the
steps of the church lou toback looks from a surveillance photo of the wedding party in his hands to richies table of organization the lucas brothers and cousins in the streets of new york and new jersey arranged in some imagined hierarchy
not your typical day in the life of a dope man richie
neither was bumpy johnsons and he owned harlem
you think frank lucas took over for bumpy johnson
thats a little far fetched
everything he does he does like bumpy
bumpy never wore a chinchilla coat in his life
we havent seen that again
that apparently has been retired to the closet
frank and charlie look on as ana throws the bouquet
shes the most beautiful bride i ever saw frank
i wish bumpy couldve met her
i wish she couldve met him
looking at the lucas table of organization what do you got on him you can use in court
because this isnt it
you try this without informants and powder no ones going to jail
wont get any informants
its like a sicilian family
like hes structured his own family the same way to protect himself
exactly like one like a scene from the godfather as frank dances with ana before the reception guests
being with bumpy long as he was he would have been around italians a lot
enough to learn that much
rice rains down on the bride and groom as they climb into the back of the towncar
doc comes around to the drivers side gets in and slowly pushes through the crush of guests waving and throwing kisses
but its not even frank lucas i want
i want to know who hes working for which italians are bringing the heroin in
flanked front and rear by franks security the marriage car moves along a rain slick street
the newlyweds cuddle in back
another car pulls up alongside trupos shelby and docs right hand instinctively comes off the steering wheel to settle on his holstered gun
trupo smiles and shakes his head no
the lincoln and security cars and trupos shelby parked
to ana stay in the car as frank and doc climb out frank motions to his other security men to remain calm hell handle this
if frank is surprised trupo knows his name he doesnt show it or anything else except an air of professional courtesy
trupo looks in at ana in the back seat smiles at her
she turns her head away and closes the door
trupo leads frank away for a private conversation
you sure you done the right thing
shes a beautiful girl theres no question but shes got an attitude on her listen to me
before you say another word about her or me remember that youre saying it on the most important fuckin day of my life
man walks around in a fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and he never even bought me a cup of coffee
something wrong there
i dont know what youre talking about
you pay your bills frank
you want to keep talking talk to my lawyer heres his card
you call him because were done here do you pay your bills i asked you
if youre not getting your share its not my fault go ask the chief of police
whats my share
you dont even know me
maybe im special
no youre all the fuckin same
shows his shield what does that say
frank ignores him special investigations unit
see that word there
he takes out a restaurant business card ten grand first of each month delivered here
frank ignores the card stares at trupo like hes a fool
there are some things you dont do
this is one of them
not on a mans wedding day
franks resolve throws trupo off his rhythm
he manages have a nice honeymoon
frank doesnt carry ana across the threshold
he strides in leaving her at the front door throws a match in the gas fireplace comes back from the bedroom a moment later with the chinchilla coat and throws
it on the flames
a march on washington protesting the war archive
the report continues on a tv here as teddys driver jimmy racine yells at his girlfriend where is it
fuck you im not telling you
she comes past the tv and into the kitchen past a table covered with dope paraphernalia
where is my fuckin dope
you and your girlfriends take it again
ill fuckin kill you
she yanks open a drawer grabs a knife and slashes it at him
he grabs a gun and she runs for the stairs he chases her into the street yelling raises the gun and fires and she goes down clutching at her butt
moaning here too
richies lawyer ex girlfriend in bed with him
richie yes fuck me like a cop not a lawyer the phone rings oh god richie no dont answer it he reaches to pick it up no no no yeah
newark just picked up one of the celebrities on our wall of fame teddys driver
for attempted murder
richies had jimmy racine brought over
sits with him as the three amigos watch from the shadows
just coming off his high and the attempted murder jimmy looks disoriented as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon like basement
because its an attempted homicide thats grand jury
now that grand jury could come in very favorably
might turn out to be attempted manslaughter
self defense even
she had a knife
depends on how i want to deal with you
you see where this is going
jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern
the fuck is this place
lets say you beat it somehow
what do you think cousin frankll think of that
he knows you had to sit here listening to something like this
and then you beat an attempted murder
is he stupid
hell assume you talked
jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him
you fucked up jimmy
but nobody knows
frank doesnt know
do you want him to read about it in the paper
or do you want to walk out of here no bail no trial just walk out now
jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the building into the chilly morning air
look at me jimmy looks over his shoulder as if richie just called to him from it which he didnt
theres no one in sight any time i want to change my mind
i dont like the quality of your work
i can find a witness saw you shoot your girlfriend
it just took me a while
i even know what hell look like
hell look just like you
teddys car comes around a corner and down the street
jimmy racine wired looks in the rear view mirror at teddy in the back seat and behind him richies car following
richie keeps teddys car in view ahead
glances in his mirror at the cars following him
the detectives cars parked behind a warehouse
richie peers into binoculars at teddys car parked by franks outside another warehouse loading dock
frank gets out discusses something with his brother comes past jimmy to some men in bloody white coats
he talks to them returns to his car takes a valise from the trunk
he snaps it open revealing stacks of cash hands it over and walks to a semi truck glancing once in richies direction
though he cant see anyone there he gives a wave to them or is it to the truck driver to pull out
like bumpy used to do every thanksgiving frank and his brothers from the back of the truck hand out hundreds of freshly butchered turkeys to the poor
frank in an apron carries in a huge cooked turkey as the extended lucas family gathers around the table
its like norman rockwell painting another thanksgiving picture addicts shooting up and nodding out in alleys and dingy rooms
tight on needles veins spoons filth richie alone at his kitchen table with a sandwich and a beer
the macys parade plays silently on his tv
a doorbell summons trupo
he comes through his entry
opens the front door
finds no one there except a large live turkey on the doorstep
he stares at it nonplussed then looks up to a sound a whoosh as flames engulf the interior and spit out the windows of his shelby mustang
the big knife in franks hand slices into the turkey and lifts meat onto a plate thats passed from hand to hand the family engaged in several conversations at once
jimmy racine shirt off wired changes the batteries of the little tape recorder
jimmy comes out tries to take a chair not too far from frank whos watching his nephew toss pop up flies for the younger kids to catch
come over here
the nephew comes over i heard you didnt show up
youre too busy to meet with billy martin
after i set it up
stevie shifts around not wanting to make frank mad
i dont want to play pro ball i decided
whatre you talking about
this is your dream since you were their age the younger kids maybe i can set it up again
stevie just stands there uncomfortable
finally its not what i want
i want to do what you do uncle frank
i want to be you
frank stares at him unhappily
teddy comes over but frank barely notices
we got a problem
jimmy racine behind the wheel
frank and teddy in back speaking quietly
hes been cutting it so much its down to two three percent pure
you tested it
frank notices jimmy looking at them in the rear view mirror
the fuck you looking at
the car pulls up in front of a building in the clothing district
jimmy stays while teddy and frank go inside
jackies club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film
frank and teddy led by a bodyguard come past some turkey carcasses and other remnants of thanksgiving to where jackie and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls
we need to talk
girls get out
the girls gather their things and leave
frank wipes at a modern leather chair with his handkerchief throws it away sits
jackie lays out a couple lines offers frank a rolled up hundred dollar straw
frank shakes his head no thanks
you talked to charlie
you want to hear more about my black coalition
let me explain it to you but first let me suck up a line of coke thats not why im here
jackie glances up from the powder
everybodys happy jackie
charlie baz the cops the italians everybody
everybody except you
then i dont understand
why do you have to take something thats perfectly good the way it is and wreck it
jackie doesnt seem to understand
brand names mean something jackie
consumers rely on them to know what theyre getting
they know the company isnt going to try to fool them with an inferior product
they buy a ford they know theyre gonna get a ford
not a fuckin datsun
his look says right
blue magic is a brand name as much a brand name as pepsi
i own it
i stand behind it
i guarantee it and people know that even if they dont know me any more than they know the chairman of general foods
what the fuck are you talking about frank
what youre doing as far as im concerned when you chop my dope down to five percent is trademark infringement
thats what this is about
jackie nods but with all due respect frank if i buy something i can do whatever i want with it
thats not true
thats where youre wrong
if i buy a car i can paint it god damn it
jackie you dont need to
you dont need to make more money than you can with blue the way it is
no one does
at a certain point its just greed
what do you want frank
you want me to call it something else
i have to insist
you call it blue magic thats misrepresentation
ill call it red magic even though it doesnt sound as good
thats all im saying
wrap it in red cellophane and
black magic whack it down to nothing tie a bow around it and call it blue dogshit if you want just dont let me catch you doing this again
jackie regards frank for a long moment
i dont like these words as much as please thank you sorry to bother you jackie
these are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation
jackie waits to hear a kinder word but frank doesnt offer one
jackie nods fine okay but its more like a warning
frank pulls a girl off teddys lap and points him toward the door
jackie watches them leave
they emerge from the building to where jimmy waits
give me the keys take a cab home
frank and teddy driving in silence
eventually you dont go over there any more
teddy doesnt like it but nods
suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror an unmarked police car behind them flashing its brights
its all right pull over what are they going to do
give us a ticket
but teddy isnt as calm as he begins to pull over
as trupo and his partner climb out of their car and approach teddys frank
some of its in the trunk
frank regards him with utter disbelief
teddy shies as if he expects to get hit
the siu detectives arrive
hows it going
you have a nice thanksgiving
i did not as a matter of fact
get out of the car
the lucases climb out
wheres the shelby
the shelbys gone frank
trupo reaches in the drivers side window takes the keys from the ignition and comes around to the trunk
frank and teddy exchange a glance as it opens
then want to come over here a minute frank
six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light
frank and trupo regard it in silence
then now what are we gonna do about this
were gonna shut the trunk and say good night forget you pulled us over
i got a better idea
trupo reaches into the trunk picks up two of the heroin bricks tucks them under his arm and looks at frank
or would you rather i took it all and threw you and your brother in the fuckin river
i dont know would you rather its your fuckin house blows up next time
they hold each others stare for a long moment
i loved that car
trupo closes the trunk and walks away with his cut of the heroin calling to his partner lets go
as the siu cops walk to their car the perspective shifts through binoculars richie watching
from outside the drivers side teddys head inside the car suddenly smashes against the window cracking it
his groan is interrupted by franks muffled voice dont you ever put me in a car with dope in it
richie comes in opens the fridge and stares in his mind elsewhere
a ringing phone pulls him out of it
hows it going
tonys wife and daughters can be seen in the suburban backyard
here in the kitchen tony and richie watch kernels of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first amana microwave oven
its noisier than modern ones
the fuck is a micro wave
its a scientific force like atomic energy
it rearranges the molecules
you dont want to put your head in there
tony rakes out the plain pre microwaveable popcorn using his hand
gives some to richie
half of its burnt
i can get you one of these
just like this brand new
ill have it delivered
i dont want one
tony hands richie some snapshots the zaca family on the slopes of a resort and in and outside a beautiful snow dotted cabin
this is nice wheres this
just got back
had a great time
id like to ski aspen some day
know who we met
im not kidding
lot of people from hollywood go up there now buying up everything
this is your place
are you kidding
you know what its worth
ski in ski out five bedrooms sauna everything
we were guests
no thats your place
everything seems to stop
richie becomes aware of the sounds around them the girls splashing around outside
isnt there something we can do about leaving the big guy alone
you know who i mean
what richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at this point hes got a problem
if i dont report what you just said to me you know i could be in a lot of trouble
if i do then its you
im hoping you wont do that
richie considers the room itself measuring the odds of microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere
im not taping it
how do you know
because were friends and im telling you
this is a real offer
from who your uncle
tony doesnt say why would you do this
why would you risk our friendship
because i care what happens to you
you shouldnt have done it
i had to
i had no choice
neither do you
leave frank lucas alone
hes not important enough for you to do this
yes he is
richie stares at tony then puts the pictures in his hand
tell marie im sorry i had to leave
you can tell her why
alone in the empty building he stares at the t
the higher echelon italians like tosca lower echelon harlem guys like charlie williams and frank lucas
he gets up then untacks franks photograph from its lowly position and moves it to a place no black has ever occupied to the top of the pyramid above the
toback regards franks picture at top of the lucas t
ins fbi irs i cant get anything out of them
nothing on his travel his bank accounts property holdings nothing
thats because they all think youre on the take and you think they are
they dont want this to stop
it employs too many people
cops lawyers judges probation officers prison guards
the day dope stops coming into this country a hundred thousand people lose their jobs
toback isnt as sure the corruption of the official world is that complete
spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to talk to him
richie and tobacke regard the two stone faced fbi agents who took it out
nothing from the agents if theres a contract on me it would be nice to know who took it out
we cant say without compromising our source
not when its my life
if you want we can assign someone to you
youre going to protect me
richie almost laughs at the thought looks to toback
in fact none of this is funny
walking toward his apartment down its dark street bag of groceries in arm richie becomes aware someone is following him
he slows to let the figure get closer closer then turns fast drops the guy and puts a gun to his head
for gods sake
richie keeps the gun pressed against the guys forehead
are you richard roberts
i got a subpoena
richie and laurie sit with their respective lawyers waiting for the judge to appear
he leans over laurie
im sorry i couldnt give you the kind of life you wanted
im sorry it was never enough
but dont punish me for being honest
dont take my son away
she stares at him in disbelief
then responds in a louder voice than his
what are you saying
that because you were honest and didnt take money like every other cop i left you
the bailiff looks over but she doesnt care
you dont take money for one reason to buy being dishonest about everything else
and thats worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about drug money gambling money nobodys gonna miss
more people look over id rather you took it and been honest with me
or dont take it i dont care
but dont then go cheat on me
dont cheat on your kid by never being around
dont go out and get laid by your snitches and secretaries and strippers
i can tell just by looking shes one of them
which is true
everyones watching them now
you think youre going to heaven because your honest
youre going to the same hell as the crooked cops you cant stand
all rise the same judge who sends a collection plate around sits before richie and laurie and their attorneys
your honor a lot has been said here today about how unsavory mr
roberts environment is for a child
how dangerous it is
im sorry but this is our world
this is where we live and we tell him protect us
we give him that responsibility and then say oh but we dont trust you to raise a child
we dont think youre fit for that
sheila looks at him but hes looking at laurie and speaks to her like theyre alone in the room youre right
this is no place for him
the further away the better
the lights on the rockefeller christmas tree blink on to applause
a carol begins and continues over seats covered with christmas presents
doc driving sees trupos car parked out front franks penthouse
frank yeah i see them
doc pulls to the curb outside franks building
as the doorman helps doc with the big christmas tree tied to the roof of the car frank crosses to trupos car with a couple of bottles of crystal tied
with holiday bows
here you go boys
charlie has come to visit
a christmas carol plays as frank strings the tree with some lights
paying cops is one thing i understand that
i been paying them since i was ten put more of their kids through college than the national merit award
this is different this special investigations unit
they think they are special
theyre fucking crooks
no code of ethics
frank plugs the cord in and the tree lights up
someones been following me
i see cars where they shouldnt be
guys i dont know me too
they regard each other
the carol continues over ana hangs tinsel on the tree as frank gives the shepherd some dog toy presents hes bought
more to himself bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain point
he stayed in read watched tv played chess
i thought he chose to lead a quiet life
he couldnt go out without something happening
we can still go out
everyone i know is under surveillance
i cant even be with my family at christmas anymore
he gets up pets the dog and looks out the window at christmas angels stretched across the street at people on the sidewalk wondering perhaps which of them are undercover
cops at trupos car still parked outside
why dont you just pay who you have to pay
i do pay them i pay them all
cops accountants lawyers who dont i pay
i pay them a fortune it doesnt matter
it doesnt satisfy them
the more you pay the more they expect
you cant start with them because they cant stop
its like dope
they always want more
ana looks vulnerable
frank almost feels bad that its his life and problems that have put them here
eventually to try to turn it around put on something nice were going out
frank and ana emerge from a service elevator come down a dark hall and out the back door to an alley to where doc waits with the car in the
franks car approaches smalls just as jackie with a santa claus hat on climbs out of a sky blue bentley with his entourage
frank groans to doc keep going
im not going to sneak into my own club
waiting for a take out order under harsh fluorescent lights im going to wait in the car
go ahead frank
ill wait for it
you can carry it all
we ordered a lot
doc nods go on go with ana
frank hands him a couple twenties
anas already outside
dont forget the yellow sauce
anas half a block ahead waiting outside the locked car by the time frank arrives and realizes docs got the keys
lets go back
the lights give me a headache you go
im not leaving you on the street
get the keys frank its cold
he starts back through cascading snow
notices a car coming slowly down the street the cook dumps sizzling vegetables into a take out container and puts it in a bag the car passes continues to the
end of the block turns the corner
doc hands over money waits for his change gimme some of that yellow sauce
frank sees the car again coming around the corner walks briskly back to where ana waits
the car is almost upon them as he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her hard along the sidewalk
the car guns its engine
as frank pushes in past the doors with ana the windows explode
they dive to the floor bullets ripping through the place
doc draws his two guns and fires back at the car hitting it a couple times as it screeches off
he gathers ana and frank off the floor like a presidential bodyguard hustles them out to the car
franks shoulder is bleeding
what the fuck was that
they pile in and doc screeches away from the curb
heavy security in the hallways franks own men and some cops hes got on the payroll
ana steps from the elevator and hurries past early edition new york paper in hand
the brothers watch as a private doctor attends franks wounds
he seems all right fine except for the fact that someone had the fucking nerve to take a shot at him and charlie he sees in the newspaper gunned down
dead lurid weegee like photo of him on the front page
was it jackie
frank doesnt say ill fuckin kill him whether it was or not you tell me to
nothing from frank what do you want us to do frank
we cant just sit here and who didnt like charlie
everybody liked charlie
who shot at us
frank cant tell her it doesnt matter
she pulls a drawer open
takes out their passports
the brothers watch not sure what to do or say
to them go home
go see your kids
he obviously wants to talk to ana alone
pulls away from the doctor
they all leave
ana keeps packing
what are you doing
whereve you been
were leaving from here
moneys in the car
everything from your mothers house
in your car
wheres the car
with ten million dollars in it
i didnt count it
are you crazy

what are you doing driving around without security
docll take you back
were not going there were going to the airport
were leaving the country
to go where
no were not
frank charlies dead
they tried to kill us
what else has to happen
he grabs her and holds her to calm her down
come on now
he holds her close waits for her breathing to slow before where are we going to go
which fuckin place is it going to be
we can go anywhere we want
we can live anywhere
we can run and hide is what youre saying
he slowly shakes his head thats something hell never do
this is where im from
this is where my family is
this is my place
this is my country
this is america
the statue of liberty in morning light and mist rises from the waters of the hudson river
richie at his desk looks up to see trupo walking through the squad room followed by spearman
said hell only talk to you
trupos attitude has completely changed from the first time they met
he talks to richie now like a fellow conspirator
from what i hear it was the corsicans
the french connection fernando rey the exporters frank has put out of business
now i can take care of him in new york but i dont want to have to worry every time he drives across the bridge to jersey someones gonna take
another shot at him
richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that trupo would speak to him this blatantly
we need to start working together
we need to step up our efforts
next time their aim could be better
we need to keep this cash cow alive
jimmy racine comes in sees trupo and leaves but not before trupo has seen him
and now he sees the lucas table of organization he didnt notice when he came in
gets up and walks over to it now and takes a closer look
sees franks picture at the top like enemy number
what the fuck you doing here
you actually going to arrest frank lucas
whats the matter with you
cant you tell that
im crazy enough to shoot someone and make it look like an accident next time he comes over the bridge without my permission
get the fuck out of new jersey
they regard each other a moment before trupo turns to leave
a large tv shows chaotic scenes in saigon
the us is pulling out of vietnam
tosca has come to see how frank is recovering and finds him agitated too long in bed even though its only been a day changing into a nice shirt putting
on his shoes i can guarantee you peace of mind you said
do i look like a man with peace of mind to you
they shot at my wife
who does that
who was it which one of your people
ill take that gun away and shove it up their ass
i dont know that it was any of them frank
neither do you
then maybe ill kill them all just to make a fuckin point
tosca seems more philosophical about it like bumpy might have been but it wasnt him who was shot at
you want to know who it was
i can tell you
it was a junkie
or a rival
or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself
or someone you forgot to pay off
or slighted without realizing it
or someone you put out of business by being too successful
pause success has a lot of enemies
your success is who took a shot at you
how you gonna kill it
by being unsuccessful
you can be successful and have enemies or unsuccessful and have friends
its the choice we make
a call has interrupted nates massage and later activities with a bevy of thai girls
he wraps himself in a robe takes the phone
frank on a pay phone in a comfortable alcove with a stack of quarters
other guests are gathered around a tv in the lounge that shows images of helicopters plucking diplomats off the roof of the american embassy in saigon
im watching the news
where the hells everyone going
the wars over
just like that
were going to leave the fuckin country to the communists
we been here since frank
frank and nate and their army of black servicemen and thai thugs wind through the jungle with pack mules
the same farm and hut as before
frank and the chinese general sip tea
the four million dollars in cash frank brought sits on the table
opium plants are hearty enough to outlive any war
theyll still be here long after the troops are gone
but what are you going to do for transportation when the last us plane goes home
ill figure something out
youll see me again
the general seems fond of frank and not only because of all the money on the table
its not in my best interest to say this frank
but quitting while youre ahead is not the same as quitting
thats what my wife thinks
but you dont think shes right
frank doesnt say
mules are loaded up with burlap bags containing kilos of heroin
the mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the opium farm
nates thai thugs left behind in sniper positions in the trees stand ready to open fire if they have to as frank nate the soldiers and mules pass below
they seem to have made it winding back down through the jungle with the mules
suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts from the trees a couple of nates men are hit as the rest dive for cover shouting vietcong and returning the fire
frank drops down from his mule gets a pistol out and shoots into the trees
bullet severed palm fronds rain down
give them half
nate pinned down by the mules cant hear him over the noise
cut half of them loose
nate cuts the mule train tether in the middle slaps at the animals
as the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees the shooting subsides then stops altogether
smoke from all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen thais and americans lying dead on the ground
teddy makes out with a girl in the back seat of his car
the pay phone just outside on the corner rings and he gets out steps past jimmy answers it a thai singer attempts otis redding on the little stage
frank at a table here with a drink and a phone
short term parking lot
when you need it
tomorrow will be fine
jimmy loiters close enough to the open pay phone to hear teddys side of the conversation
short term lot
this the mustang were talking about
whats the plate number
writes on a napkin yeah i got it
i got it frank
sighs reads from the napkin jimmys come over to share his news with the detectives
but richie isnt pleased with it or with jimmy
theres no short term lot at newark
theyre lettered a b c d im just telling you what i heard then you heard wrong
jimmy shies back a step in case abruzzo takes a swing
maybe he means the time
and this isnt a jersey plate
or new york
not with just two letters
its three and three not two and three its what he said then what the fuck is it the fuck should i know
youre fuckin lying its what he said
they all look at each other
after a moment none of you ever been in the service
its an air force tail number
the plane with that tail number descends through clouds
richies entire staff of detectives along with toback the da and several customs agents stand on the tarmac watching the military plane taxiing toward them quiet sounds of suburban domesticity
chirping birds a distant lawn mower the cabin door slides up the passengers begin emerging military officers embassy personnel and families
richies detectives and toback watch him with concern as the official passengers met by a bevy of assistants file past the kitchen
franks mother shows ana some old photographs of frank as a boy as they sip coffee
theres a tap on the glass french door
the women look up and see trupo just outside it and other police moving past
an army captain approaches richies law enforcement group
captain im richard roberts director of the essex county narcotics bureau
trupo sort of waves a search warrant at julie as invites himself in
the ny cops follow fan out
trupo and his detectives head upstairs the plane has been brought into a hangar where its being taken apart like a car stripped by thieves
inside the cabin seats are removed and inspected carpeting pulled up panels unscrewed lavatories dismantled
downstairs ana and franks mother guarded can hear trupo and his detectives upstairs ransacking a bedroom
upstairs the siu detectives pull open drawers throw clothes from the closets
trupo picks up an invitation to a united nations ball tosses it down again
finds a safety deposit box key in a sock drawer puts it in his pocket
the engines and landing gear are disassembled the tires opened up and searched
a nozzle plunges into a toilet and pumps out the contents into barrels detectives fish through with gloved hands ana is taken upstairs brought before the siu detectives who wait
for the nypd cops to leave the room
the place has been torn apart
your husbands illustrious career is over
the feds are going to come in and take it all
but not before i get my gratuity
wheres the money
there was some on that dresser but its gone now so i guess you took it the money
the getaway money frank and every other gangster keeps in his house
if you leave now theres a chance frank might not kill you trupo slaps her hard across the face richie off by himself watches with a growing sense of panic
as the mechanics detectives and customs agents begin removing the metal skin from the plane
coffins are being off loaded
downstairs mama lucas puts washcloth on anas swollen cheek
they can hear the search continuing upstairs things being ripped from the walls the walls themselves splintered apart with sledgehammers glass breaking
to mama lucas im sorry
theyve looked everywhere and found nothing
the plane in fact hardly resembles a plane anymore no panel left that hasnt been removed no cavity not probed except richies glance settles on the military caskets as theyre
loaded onto a truck armed soldiers standing guard franks bedroom has been destroyed
trupo standing at a window glances out at the sound of a barking of a dog to see franks german shepherd down in its kennel
richie gets up slowly and approaches the coffins as trupo crosses the lawn toward the kennel and barking dog richie stands over the nearest coffin open it
the army captain regards the detective for a long moment
the warrant permits me to search the plane and its cargo
the captain doesnt comply
richie moves to open the coffin himself and every soldiers shouldered rifle immediately comes into firing position aimed at him
but you dont have my permission
richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding them safeties off fingers on the triggers all theyre waiting for is their commanders order to fire
i dont need it
trupo regards the shepherd snarling at him from behind the kennel fence
comes around back
pushes at the frame
it moves a little like its levered with the rifles still pointed at him richie kneels down pulls the latches of the coffins half expecting to hear an accompanying barrage
he lifts the lid
sees a long black body bag inside trupo comes around to the front of the kennel again with his gun out and aims it at the dog
as he fires richie pulls at the zipper parting the plastic body bag revealing the remains of a young soldier thats enough
the dead dog slides against the fencing as trupo overturns the kennel to reveal franks stash of cash
richie and toback sit before the federal attorneys and customs agents
the us attorney hangs up a phone
then that was a military transport plane
if there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved
which means that even as it fights a war thats claimed americans lives the military is smuggling narcotics
richies in serious trouble and knows it
as does toback
thats how these events are being interpreted by general easton in that call to me
that someone employed by the this office believes the united states army is in the drug trafficking business and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young
men whove given their lives in the defence of democracy
there are drugs on that plane shut the fuck up
richie does but cant conceal the contempt he feels for these men whove never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him and who
are in the unfortunate organization of his world his superiors
is it any wonder then because of your actions the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic ally as that fucking transport
thats what youve accomplished mr
i had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane
and that target is
no one in the room except richie and toback has ever heard the name
the federal men regard one another blankly
whos frank lucas
no one seems to know whos he work for
hes not italian
now theres a longer even deeper silence before is that supposed to be some kind of joke
youre this close to the end of your career in law enforcement youre making jokes
i believe frank lucas is above the mafia in the dope business
i believe he buys direct from the source in southeast asia cuts out all the middlemen and uses us military planes and personnel to bring pure no
heroin into united states
richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory
toback tries to come to his defense richie has a lot of experience does he
and how many arrests has he made in his so called investigation
i was promised when i took this job it was about real arrests
does that mean none
i have cases against most of franks organization
more to the others franks organization thats right
no fucking nigger has accomplished what the american mafia hasnt in a hundred years
yeah youd know sitting here having never been on the street lou get this fucking kike out of here richie goes for him and lands several punches before toback and
the others can pull him off
richie and toback walk briskly across the lobby he was out of line richie
richie isnt really listening
strides past his detectives on his way out of the building
to spearman its over
youre shut down
toback watches as the detectives follow after richie striding toward his car
frank comes out with an airline representative to find doc waiting for him
he can tell immediately somethings wrong
frank slaps a cartridge into the butt of a pistol
ten million dollars means nothing to me
ana stares at the floor
it all just seems to get worse and worse
they had their chance to get out and missed it
this is his death warrant
he lightly touches his wifes bruised face and walks out
he comes down the stairs to where doc waits
as they head for the door frankie frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room
nods to doc to say get the car ill be out in a minute
goes over to his mother
she studies him in a way she hasnt since he was little
eventually if youd have been a preacher your brothers would be preachers
if youd been a soldier theyd be soldiers
do you know that
he doesnt say they all came here because of you
you called and they came running
they look up to you
they expect you to always know whats best
pause but even they know you dont shoot cops
even i know that
ana knows it
you seem to be the only one who doesnt
is that where im going
i never asked you where all this came from because i didnt want to hear you lie to me
dont lie to me
dont do that too
shes not pleading shes telling
do you really want to make things so bad for your family theyll leave you
because they will
she will points upstairs i know i will
frank has some trouble looking at her
but then gets up
walks toward the front door to leave
hesitates near it a long moment
then turns and walks upstairs
trupo will live at least for now because of her
down in the basement the body bags are lifted from the wooden coffins
set down on tables
the bags unzipped and the bodies removed
a rack of clean uniforms is brought in
the morticians begin dressing the corpses and applying make up on the dry gray skin
new white military caskets are trundled in
gold handles lifted
the bodies clothed and painted now are deposited on the silk linings
the lids of the coffins come down and cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top
the white caskets are taken to a loading dock put in a military truck
papers are signed copies exchanged
as the truck drives off two black privates on janitorial duty come into the room where the original plain wooden coffins have been discarded
they remove the lids then the finely crafted false bottoms revealing in inch cavities of each tightly packed bricks of double uo globe heroin
as they take them out a gospel choir begins and continues over a laundry truck idles
stevie the lucas nephew who could have played for yankees jumps down helps the two privates toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck
a minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which includes frank his mother and ana the laundry truck comes past a guard gate leaves the base drives past a stand
as it passes richie parked by his detectives cars recognizes the young driver whos wearing the same yankee baseball cap in his t
as richie and his detectives climb into their cars two lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck
the detectives follow at a distance the sea of ladies hats from above move in time with the gospel choir
as always no matter what else is going on in his complicated life frank sits with his mother and ana in their usual pew
the gospel music continues over frank emerges from the church kisses his mother and ana and put them in a car with a driver
he climbs into docs alone
his mother watches wondering perhaps if he intends to go kill trupo after all
as docs car leaves so does another
the laundry truck approaches a ramp leading to the george washington bridge
richie a couple of car lengths behind follows
the truck continues straight
from overhead the laundry truck the gun car and the van and the detectives cars following them all converge from different directions
red tops van makes a turn
as abruzzos makes the same turn behind it the infamous stephen crane projects rise up in his windshield
his foot comes off the gas
as the gun car passes he sees joness car slow
teddys car approaches from another direction into the projects and abruzzo sees spearman pull over
then the laundry truck turns in and richies slows to a stop like abruzzos outside the grounds of the foreboding towers
the gospel music ends
doc waits in the car while frank buys some flowers at a cemetery flower stand
the surveillance car cruises past
toback in his bathrobe glass of milk in one hand phone in the other
where is it
somewhere in the south tower
you know that its there
richie on a pay phone across down the street from the projects looks up at the dark south tower
were ready to go in there knowing theres a good chance we wont all come out
thats what were willing to do
all im asking you to do get me a warrant
silence on the other end of the line
we dont have a lot of time to fuck around
ill call in the warrant
and some backup
dont go in before either gets there
this call disconnects
the girls spread and tape plastic sheeting to tabletops then begin changing for work which means undressing
richie and his guys wait for the warrant by their cars
how long we gonna wait for it
pharmaceutical scales balance to their counterweights as the five naked masked women cut the heroin with quinine to franks exacting standards
red top puts on some coffee
richie stares down the street waiting for whatever it is theyre waiting for
spearman looks at his watch
itll be here
a paper cutter blade slices a sheet of blue cellophane
the girls at the tables with the expertise of cuban cigar makers wrap pieces of the cellophane like tobacco leaves around precisely measured ounce drifts of black magic
franks car winds up the road of the cemetery
the surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks
several black and white and undercover cars approach sirens off
toback himself climbs out of one of the cars and hands richie the search warrant
the tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below no matter how routine a woman pushing a stroller guys shooting hoops a couple arguing kids on bikes
old men resting on a graffiti covered bench
the unmarked cars drive slowly through it all
the place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers
richie removes the cover plate of an elevator cuts the wires disengaging it then leads the amigos followed by more detectives to a stairwell
the place is like beirut
debris strewn graffiti covered
frank walks past graves to bumpys
replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones
looks around for something to sit on
sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby
doc waits by the car in the distance
floor by floor they work their way up the tower like commandos the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go
reaching the th floor they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a big wheels pedalling straight at them
he passes and the sound fades
half the apartment doors are gone
tvs and radios echo voices argue infants wail
the detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it a couple of guys with a sawed off shotguns sitting outside a closed door
they step back
consider one other
spearman volunteers with a nod continues on alone as the others wait
he walks up to the guys with the guns
i got to talk to teddy
get the fuck out of here
what the fuck is that
i got business with teddy and its none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him
as the guy stands pumping the shotgun spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote forcing him to the floor
the shotgun explodes showering plaster and pellets
jones and abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as richie swings the sledgehammer into the door the door splinters the room already in chaos teddy panicked runs for
the bedroom the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down a shot from somewhere inside wings abruzzo jones and spearman firing back crawling across the floor like an infantrymen richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol
but teddys gone
he sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall
pulls at it finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment climbs through sees an open door as richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls echoing
in the stairwell
he starts down taking the stairs five at a time chases teddy down two flights teddy yanks open a door runs down a corridor bangs into an apartment
richie reaches the apartment just as teddy is goes out onto an exterior balcony richie continues along the interior corridor running parallel to teddy on the balcony who trips over
some debris and garbage looking over his shoulder for richie richie cuts through another apartment to head him off but the door to the balcony is nailed shut
so are the windows
richie looks around grabs a small portable television and just as teddy runs past hurls it through a window at him hitting him in the head
he falls hard dazed
richie hurries through the broken window
teddy comes to and fights back until richie breaks his femur with his bare hands
teddy howls in excruciating pain police cars outside
eugene lucas is cuffed and led away
more police outside lesters place
they cuff him
new jersey troopers cuff turner lucas and lead him away
cuffed earl lucas is put in the back of a patrol car
frank on a wooden folding chair at bumpys grave hears the gunning of engines and barking of cops
he turns to see doc being handcuffed on the ground by the towncar
glances to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise
richie arrives at the grave
regards the monument to ellsworth johnson and frank sitting calmly regarding him
richie glances around the peaceful surroundings
what kind of trees are these
frank looks at the trees then at richie with equal serenity
you think you got frank lucas
you got nothing
richie cuts the tags off a new inexpensive suit
slips the jacket on which seemed somehow to fit a little better at the store
cuts the tags off a tie
someone throwing up in a stall
the toilet flushes the door opens and richie steps up to a sink regards his face in the mirror
under the fluorescent lights maybe under any kind his skin is a shade of death
he splashes water on it and tries to gather himself
at the prosecutors table richie steals glances at the battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table
the courtroom doors swing open and richie sees frank lucas in a tailored suit escorted in without cuffs by an amiable looking federal marshal
as frank moves through the gallery richie sees its full of the gangsters friends many of them celebrities who smile and greet and fawn as if the pope has arrived
richie has evidence tables covered with cash weapons stocks bonds property deeds pictures of franks holdings heroin in blue cellophane
frank has celebrities community leaders joe louis himself who will testify to franks benevolent character
the champ hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and richie wonders if he should just give up now
richie sees it in slow motion the hands reaching out to frank the pats on his back lipsticked mouths of beautiful women offering kisses and words of encouragement his old
mother giving him a hug
he watches franks head turn slowly his eyes passing his phalanx of attorneys the jury finally settling on richie in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table
franks eyes smile as they regard richie and seem to ask can you see this can you see what youre up against can you see how insignificant you are
reaching the end of the welcoming line finally frank brushes by richie and disappears from view somewhere within the protective husk of his multi million dollar legal team
roberts richie slowly lifts himself from his chair steps forward turns to look at the jury thats studying him finally finds his voice thank you your honor
ladies and gentlemen wire mesh separates frank from his battalion of lawyers
he glances over them to richie being led through the large visiting room
here he is let me talk to him alone
the attorneys get up and leave
richie takes their place
frank regards him a moment offering the same knowing smile from the courtroom
richie offers nothing
i just heard something
i said it couldnt be true
you didnt really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car did you
richie doesnt say
frank searches his face for some clue to where on earth hes from
want me to tell you what happened to it
it ended up in cops pockets
all you did was give it to them for nothing in return
not nothing you got their contempt
frank studies him
whyd you do that
whatre you trying to prove youre better than them
youre not better than them
you are them
i dont have the time or interest to listen to this you did it because it was right
whys that hard to say
the question is would you do it again
that was a long time ago
itd be very easy to find out
tell me you want to find out tell me the address and a car will be there the trunk loaded
richie knows frank isnt kidding
frank suddenly explodes
who the fuck are you to say no to that
you think that impresses me
guards look over then glance away once its clear the outburst is through
richie remains serene
eventually let me ask you something
you think by putting me in jail youre going to stop even one junkie from dying
because you wont
if it isnt me itll be someone else
with me or without me nothings going to change
then thats the way it is
you have any sort of case
or just that idiot drives for my brother
is he your case
because if its just him and the powder its not enough
then you got nothing to worry about
but frank is worried most of all by this cop who doesnt take money sitting placidly in front of him
my brothers wont talk to you
none of my family
no one but that mother fucking driver
i got more than that
i got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block
tony the bug
benny two socks
who the fuck are they
i dont know them and they dont know me
they sell dope for the mazzano crime family
which you all but put out of business
this is who youre going to put on the stand
guys who dont know me
who got nothing to do with me
they have everything to do with you
and the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent
i dont represent nothing
black businessman like you
of course you do
but once youre gone things can return to normal
look at me
can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead
get in line
that one stretches around the block too
frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life
he wants to work something out with richie obviously but he cant figure out how
frank studies him
what can we do
you know what you have to do
frank does but doesnt like it and doesnt know if he can do it
i could give you cops but thats not who you want is it
you want organized crime names
ill take them too
i want them all
frank isnt sure he heard right
youll take them too
youd go after cops
are you serious
youd do that
lock up your own kind
not the ones in business with you
theyre not my kind any more than the italians are yours
they regard one another in silence
richie can tell frank sees daylight
what can you promise me
i can promise you if you lie to me about one name youll never get out of prison
lie about one dollar in one offshore account youll never get out
you can live rich in jail the rest of your life or poor outside it thats what i can promise
frank is silent for several moments
finally you know i dont care if the feds take all my buildings my stocks my off shore accounts
they can take it all i dont care use it to build battleships paint bridges whatever the fuck they want
fight another war
but those other motherfuckers the cops put my money in their pockets
i believe it
frank debates with himself the step hes about to take
i want to know everyone youve met for the last twenty years
everyone you sold to
every cop you ever paid off
every one who ever stole from you
every one you remember
oh i remember them all
thats not the problem
the jails arent big enough
surveillance photographs of cops seen earlier taking envelopes of money on th street and other drops go up on a new elaborate table of organization of cops
richie dismantles the lucas table of organization here taking down the photographs
as it collapses frank puts up photographs of detectives quick cuts of the same detectives in handcuffs led through police stations past other cops watching with dread like maybe theyre
next a surveillance photograph of the four princes of the city striding down a sidewalk goes up on the cell wall flashcut as three of the four siu cops are led away in cuffs from a golf course a surveillance photograph of trupo in a black hand you go up here
as frank tapes the picture of trupo at the top of the pyramid of corruption trupo coffee in hand comes into his garage from his kitchen
opens the garage door and sees two squad cars parked outside
a tv a report on the indictments handed down by the manhattan das office against nypd and siu detectives
frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in a box
stands with the box and waits for the cell door to open
the table of organization and files are gone
legend frank lucas was convicted of conspiracy to distribute narcotics and sentenced to years
he served of them
legend federal authorities confiscated over million dollars from him in real estate equities and cash in us and foreign banks
richie too is packing putting personal items into boxes
legend the day after he convicted frank lucas and of his country boy relatives richard roberts borrowed from his credit union to help pay for a day vacation to the
richie carrying the box switches off the lights and closes the door behind him on his way out
legend six months later he quit the prosecutors office to become a defense attorney
his first client was frank lucas
frank steps out into sunlight free but owning nothing but the cardboard box in his arms
looks out across the parking lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up
sees richie by his car hand raised above his head like a flag
the two of them stand outside richies car on the same corner frank shot tango
frank looks up at the street signs that used to say th street and th avenue
now they say th street and frederick douglass boulevard
frederick douglass boulevard
what was wrong with just plain th avenue
he considers the street itself
it too has changed
the corner groceries as bumpy prophesied really are gone now
i used to sit here with ana in my old car
she hated it
now i dont even have a car
frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be and across the street to where he shot tango
it isnt a fruit stand any more
just do what
the fuck is that
just do what
its a nike store with huge paintings of michael jordan and the admonition just do it
who the fuck would buy those
a car equipped with sub woofer bass comes booming past
frank stares at it with the same pained look bumpy had at the discount emporium
your brothers know youre out
i havent talked to them in years
its better that way
i dont know where they are
went back to greensboro when they got out i guess
frank looks back at the new storefronts
what am i going to do now be a janitor
what do i know how to do
how am i going to live
i told you i wouldnt let you starve
you told me but you can barely take care of yourself
glances to a pay phone on the corner you know one phone call richie i could be back in business
the look richie gives him calmly assures frank if he did that itd be the last phone he made outside prison ever
im just saying i could
he buttons the cuffs of the fake members only windbreaker richie bought him off the street
thanks for the clothes
frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them like they own the sidewalk and everything around it baggy pants bandanas tied around their heads
here come the gangsters
franks right in their path but doesnt move forcing one of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter
the gangsta looks back is about to say something or do something but examining the expression of quiet menace on franks face thinks better of it
the others stop
the first one is still staring at frank but finally has the good sense to let it go
they move on
frank glances to richie
every idiot gets to be young once
frank zips up his members only jacket props up the collar and points himself in the other direction
lets get out of here
