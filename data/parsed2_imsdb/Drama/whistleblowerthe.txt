written by eilis kirwan larysa kondracki august i cant see anything
are you there
are you there
luba dangerous flicks a lighter sparking a cigarette and grins in the flickering flame
god im drunk
wheres this damn door
she scans the space with the lighter
thats my hair
let me try
raya pretty guileless takes the lighter searching
she has it
they burst out the door laughing onto
rock music blares
drunk teens dance around burning barrels
groups lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans making out talking shit
a boy lights a molotov cocktail and hurls it off the roof
luba and raya join three guys
one of them pisses onto a cloth stuffs it in a bottle and tries to light it
everybody bursts out laughing
its ammonia not alcohol
drunk youre so smart
i love you
he lunges in for a kiss but she dodges him laughing
luba gives him the finger pulling raya toward the dancing into
teen mayhem raya lets herself go
she gets lost in
a whirl of drunk and happy teens
they dance silhouetted against the fire and the black sky their backs to the run down soviet buildings
tonight they dont want to think about what life holds in store
she looks at her watch suddenly aware of the time
yelling over to luba
i have to get home
mamas gonna kill me
no youre staying with me tonight
roman wants us there at in the morning
raya looks at luba
its just a few months working in a hotel
you want to work at copyshack like your mother
marry one of these assholes
theres nothing here
he said it was both of us or no go
raya sighs wanting to but unable to agree
luba hesitates she needs this so badly
fuck your mom
but raya shakes her head eyes apologetic
she pushes past luba who watches her disappear
raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when
the lights come on
raya turns back to see halyna
her face torn between anger and relief
i know im late
i tried to leave but its three in the morning
halyna shakes her head disappointed
then turns off the lights
raya stands alone as halyna goes into her bedroom
raya looks around the apartment its poverty its measly aspirations
the silver mist of dawn rises over the golden domes of kyiv
raya sits on a stool before a white wall
luba smokes a cigarette
roman smiley fixes a camera to a tripod
luba reads a swiss hotel brochure then looks up
practicing i am natalya verbova
i am going to budapest to buy carpets for re selling
i am staying two days
raya sees zenia peeking in the door
zenia nods demure
roman looks through the camera
no ones gonna believe we really did it
luba beams at raya who cant hide her own excitement
camera pov raya looks into the camera
her face lights up with hope
the image freezes
we burn to white
then the title of the film fades in
a flashlight cuts across
police officer leeds scans the side of a house
rounding to he shakes his head at his partner kathryn bolkovac
earthy and athletic
she is in great shape but her eyes tell of a life fully lived
shes looking at a husband and wife standing in the doorway
it just got a bit heated you know how it gets
ill apologize to the neighbors tomorrow
kathy nods humoring
a police radio buzzes
ready to go
kathy eyes the wife tries to see past them into the house
you sure everything is alright maam
the wife is still
kathy eyes her gently
it was nothing
the husband shifts his weight
kathy flits a look behind him noticing
jackets hanging from the wall
her gaze lowers to a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets
you all have any children
the wife looks down
the man stirs agitated
so if thats all officer
id like to take a quick walk through the house
you cant do that without a warrant
yes i can sir please step aside
the wife moves out of the way
the man panics
leeds heads up the porch
kathy steps over the threshold
youre not coming in my house
he blocks her but kathy pushes past him and then he
hurls her into a wall
kathy yells in three police officers linger
they peek through a door at
she sits up on a gurney
the doctor examines her shoulder
its bruised purple
captain hawk s african american walks in noticing her exposed shoulders and turns uncomfortable
im her captain
her collar bone is broken
and im going to have to set her arm in a cast
lookin for a route to the desk
yeah im gonna break every bone in my body until im captain
im sure you have a hotter date than this tonight
just when my self esteem was gettin so healthy
we found a boy locked in the basement
we charged the husband with domestic assault
you made the right call
but you shouldve waited for backup
i wish i didnt have to say this youre giving deke the gold shield
i have to kathy
he has seniority
kathy shakes her head deeply disappointed
you deserve the promotion
you should be a detective and if we had more openings that gold shield was the first one in four years
im going to have to resign and take that position overseas
i think thats a mistake
i want you on my team
kathy sighs touched
frank im nearly forty
i cant be on the streets much longer
not if i dont know theres something on the other end
she looks up at hawk but hes staring past her at
kathy turns seeing
a young scared girl
this is erin
shes heard everything
hawk eyes erin sympathetic
just think about it will you
he leaves passing erin who pushes down tears
kathy eyes erin full of love but not knowing what to say
erin stares out the window
kathy watches her concerned
i wish you could stay here
i mean its fine living at dads but
now i really wont see you for a while
im doing this for us
if i have a better job i can give you guys more
erin nods tearing again
when do you have to decide
erin moves over hesitant
kathy pulls her in to a hug wincing slightly in pain
but keeps a brave face
are you sure its not dangerous
its been four years
things are getting back to normal over there
a bombed out building sprayed with red graffiti
cyrillic letters sprayed across it in red turn around
a silhouette breaks the horizon and speeds towards us throwing up gravel a dented white bus emblazoned with large black letters un
a united states flag on it
kathy sits in a bus full of blue berets
she looks out the window her eyes drinking it all in
you come here today as a beacon of hope as representatives of humanitys highest aspirations
in the opposite direction a u
military tank rolls past
a soldier looks out from the hatch
kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus carmen s latina
she smiles cheekily giving kathy the peace sign
in the opposite direction two other un buses pass one flanked by a canadian flag the other with a french tricolor
the bus cranks around the corner entering
the final stretch into sarajevo
famous from so many war reports site of many deaths
the broad pock marked avenue is barren
shelled high rises lean like hungry faces gouged from their once solid structures
living rooms are exposed to the elements wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin
in the bus carmen taps kathy pointing out the window
see the bullet marks are at eye level
people just running to the store
all the walls are splattered at head level
kathy is overcome by the stark reality of war
worse than she ever imagined
move along rapt faces
young men middle aged men heads held high ready for anything
bill hynes paces before the assembled new recruits
hes in his s distinguished and seemingly in charge
you have been hired by dyncorp aerospace international to represent the us as monitors for the united nations which means you are the only national contingent coming from a private
so you people chose to come here
and for the next few weeks we will teach you how to protect the rule of law in a war zone how to rebuild a civil society brick by brick
moving over more recruits
on their laps dyncorp orientation folders
men listening determined
kathy and recruits receive training from a pakistani monitor shadowing him as he hands food packs to a line of refugees
to ensure the dignity equality and inalienable human rights of every single person in this devastated place
the refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of the new recruits
kathy extends a parcel to an old man
then she sees
he has no arms
shes unsure what to do
a young boy takes the package leading his grandfather away
kathy stands where am i
assembly hall bill hynes stands before a map of the balkans
the dayton peace accords of ended this war dictating that an international police task force you would smooth the transition from war to peace
kathy and three new recruits are led down a path along a mountainside
they move toward an underground bunker
children play at the edge of an overgrown field
a boy hops up on a post about to jump over when the leader todd myers s a seasoned pro yells at him points out
a sign closer to the barbed wire fringing the field
a but you will learn that peace is harder won than war
kathy watches the boy run back up the road
the recruits head down steep steps into
light sneaks through cracks catching on the oil black barrels of thousands of guns
todd hands out binders
we are still in the process of disarming the muslim croat and serb militias
you will be cataloguing these arms for decommissioning records
kathy eyes the unending stash of guns
kathy drives past a military base an italian flag flying
a few hundred yards up the street a bar
driving past a another bar
a sign berlin nights
kathy passes by amused
kathy and carmen are led by a monitor through a sparsely furnished unit
a poster of born in the usa on the wall
you will learn that every mornings hope
carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress
kathy inspects items on the shelves
a cluster of women in black burkas
they sway like reeds in the wind grief overcoming them as they watch is haunted by yesterdays nightmare
un blue helmets supervise the dig of a mass grave
bodies are revealed
a childs shoe is uncovered
a burly peacekeeper turns sickened
the bus arrives
the base is surrounded by barbed wire and overlook sights manned by armed military
meeting hall hynes looks out at the new batch
but today is a new day
as head of the united nations mission here i trust that we stake our highest values even our lives on the belief that we can rebuild we must renew we
will witness the rebirth of this country
the recruits are hyped the rhetoric is working
moving over them man by man we reveal in the back kathy
in her crisp navy blue iptf flack jacket
her blonde hair makes her stand out
she is one of the only women in the room
her eyes ablaze
she is completely fired up
kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread
carmen across from her
kathy takes a bite and grimaces
i thought this was peanut butter but its ass paste
i bought it too
lets get out of here
i need a drink
rock music echoes from several bars
carmen heads toward one when an american iptf monitor stops her
thats a military bar
you want the party in there
he points to big neon sign the international bar
tiki lights illuminate a broad patio
a pig roasts on a spit
kathy follows carmen through dozens of off duty iptf sfor and un workers who drink and trade stories with machismo
theres a palpable sexual tension in the air
bosnian waitresses flirt with officers
guys paw girls with trays
fuck me were outnumbered
hon theyre all yours
they make their way through the crowded bar feeling the officers double takes
carmen smiles coyly at kathy then zeroes in on jan van der velde handsome
he is surrounded by a group of iptf with dutch flags on their shoulders
carmen throws her arms around them jovial
okay fine if you insist
mines a jaegermeister
jan laughs at carmens forwardness his eye on kathy
but she spots todd myers across the bar and is on her way when
what about you
you dont have an order
im the polite one
i like polite
carmen turns his head toward her
im gonna be the drunk one
lets get toasted
kathy smiles a little too old for this game
carmen leans into kathys ear
she smiles and moves off
kathy moves to todd and the americans catching todds eye but is distracted by a waitress writhing on an italian soldiers lap
the waitress darts kathy a look contemptuous
and the soldiers notice
one leers at kathy
id pay double for a woman in uniform
kathy looks him over
sorry pal im not for sale
the soldier is stung
the italians laugh
were all for sale
todd puts his arm around kathy bringing her to a table of american iptf
they greet her friendly
look the basic lay of the land is we have to work with the other nationals but we dont mix with them at night
jim higgins and even younger looking
lucky those wops dont carry guns or wedve had ourselves a situation
fucking unarmed mission
i was hoping wed get to squeeze some off
better odds youll step on a land mine and what the hells a gun gonna do for you then
embarrassed id kill the fucker who buried it
todd turns to kathy
you ever had to take someone down
the others see shes the real deal
kathy feels good
kathy moves through the now hopping bar
shes ready to leave
she searches for
shes in a corner
still with the group of dutch officers
kathy approaches concerned when jan cuts her off
hes watching carmen whos teetering drunk
you should probably get her home
you probably shouldnt have let her drink that much
kathy moves past him irritated
but he grabs her
i know those guys
nothing was going to happen to her
kathy shrugs it doesnt mean much to her
i was hoping youd come back
well i did
and now were both leaving
early sun breaks through the fog over the valley
kathy tries to work the bosnian coffee maker a confusing relic
carmen comes in holding her head
what the hell happened last night
kathy smiles pouring her a cup of the tar like brew
they both look at it a little scared
kathy eyes the clock
were gonna be late
industrial plants dominate the skyline of this sarajevo suburb
kathy drives frantically past bombed out buildings
carmen studies a map beside her
they hit a red light
a group of muslim women cross the street
one questions kathy with a lingering gaze
carmen stares at her map
do you have any idea where we are
kathy shakes her head
a run down prefab office with dated s equipment
a couple of small offices off the open center
kathy and carmen rush in
an iptf officer stands waiting for them
jan van der velde
late night ladies
they eye him embarrassed
he hands them each a thick binder
im your duty officer
you check the duty roster
youre each assigned to monitor and instruct a group of bosnian local police
we work in six week shifts
you instruct in the mornings then go into the field with them in the afternoon
one of you needs to go now
he eyes an eager kathy
theyre waiting at the th canton
out the gate then left left park right
kathy rushes off then stops
jan tosses a set of keys
theres a map in front
she drops the keys grabs them and rushes out
a school sprayed with graffiti and bullets
an abandoned classroom
shabby corkboards with yellowing psa posters ragged kids drawings and tired sticky tape
kathy skims through the training binders
the door opens and a group of local police file in
they whisper exchanging lascivious glances
kathy straightens her uniform
feel free to sit wherever you like
kathy waits for them to take their seats
a bosnian woman pretty rushes in
sorry i am late
im your interpreter
i just asked them to sit
the interpreter shakes her head benignly
they take their seats
the interpreter looks at kathy
they like to be difficult
they understand if youre clear
mostly they have trouble speaking english
but lets see if you can get them to talk at all
kathy looks out suddenly daunted
she presses on opening her binder as authoritatively as she can
okay im going to be talking about crime scene investigation today
if we could an older officer danik stands defiant
where do we sign to say we came
actually you sign the attendance at the end of the session
its a un mandate or we sign now
full of malice
kathy puts the sheet away then
we sign later
the cop scoffs and sits
kathy stands in front of a blackboard with drawings on a crime scene
she crosses off two areas on the board
keeping the crime scene clean is number one
a weak smile
nothing from the crowd
she trundles on
remember you could be pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy stepping on the very evidence stavatu na scho nam pokazaye that could incriminate
you yaka bula nespodivanka
treba have to track anything you vcyo datu v torbu
we call that chain of evidence
kathy looks out
the cops are barely paying attention
one stubs out a cigarette
another closes the binder defiantly
we sign sheet now
kathy leans back disappointed
she hands him the sheet
they all sign apathetic
you will tell un we were cooperating
kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference stings
and just as theyre about to leave
we have to go to the hospital together
the cops eye her agitated
kathys suv pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars
iptf officer clarkson stands outside
he eyes his watch
kathy rushes to him but hes already a foot in the door
we got here as quick as we could
just try to get them here on time
clarkson leads kathy and the bosnian police through the hall
gurneys and ivs suggest its a hospital but you wouldnt want to be examined here
some windows are still covered with wood slats and paint barely covers old bullet holes
the floors still hold the stains of old blood
clarkson grabs a file and speaks without looking back
seems we have two stabbings one shooting and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who cant remember what happened
average night back in brighton
the cops stare at him lost
as they file into a small room filled with tightly drawn curtains
they all squeeze into the center together
kathy is pressed against the large cop
clarkson pulls back a curtain revealing
zlata sehik muslim
her face is covered with wounds
she avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt
she pulls her bed sheet up to her chin as
reading chart facial contusions from repeated beatings with fist lacerations on the eye caused by the edge of an iron
looking at zlata he moves her sheet up to expose her leg
zlatas eyes tear
the right hand was the first entry point of a large kitchen knife
the second entry point in the upper left thigh
it went through her hand and into her leg
whos going to take this report
kathy looks out at the bosnian cops but they stare at the ground
one cop peeks into the next cubicle
kathy looks at clarkson for a cue
he holds out the clipboard
clarkson looks to kathy to take control
she turns to her group but they have even less respect for her
she goes to speak when
viko looks up hesitant
i will take it
the cops turn
clarkson unclicks his pen
viko sees kathy hungry for support
but danik scoffs
at zlata tze ye yiyiy vuna
zlatas face tightens
viko turns to danik angry
kathy looks to clarkson who gives her nothing
what did he say
she is muslim
he said she deserved it
alright thats it
at clarkson isnt she filing a complaint
the other cops eye kathy defiant
this is our turf
clarkson ushers the cops out
kathy catches vikos eye
then follows the other out
kathy looks back at zlata who lies helpless
clarkson leads the group
kathy pushes up toward him
she has to file a complaint
a woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions
clarkson pulls kathy aside
you hear me
the local cops look over
we are not investigators
we are monitors
you dont know a serb from a croat or a bosniak
youve got ethnic hatreds that started a war
this isnt just policing its diplomacy
kathy blushes feeling like a chastened schoolgirl
we dont run the show we make sure the show runs smoothly
kathy sits up in bed reading from her dyncorp un manual
she flicks not finding what shes looking for
carmen comes out of her room dolled up for the evening
you cant solve this tonight
im not taking no for an answer
kathy has dinner with carmen who talks away
kathy watches the world go by
she notices an older large iptf monitor walking with his arm around a young girl dressed in a short skirt
kathy turns back to carmen who is still talking
chanting echoes from the sinanova house of the dervish order
viko comes in scanning over iptf monitors
viko lays down a pile of files
zlatas picture on top
zlata sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband
every time she try to file a complaint my bosses send her back
they always laugh at the woman
they laughed at my mother
they do not make prosecutions of domestic violence
i want to get enough evidence to do this
kathy isnt sure
she looks around almost guiltily
this is why you are here no
kathy looks at him struck by the truth of this
she takes the files flipping through them
with no police reports
maybe if you go back to the hospital
you can pull the records for every one of her visits
a hospital administrator who hands viko a stack of files
kathy sits in a un suv
viko watches as she goes through zlatas hospital files
okay now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her
they will have to testify on zlatas behalf
viko and kathy sit behind a pile of legal books
viko shows kathy a page a questioning look on his face
this is good
lets cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled
can you get something like that
viko turns to see a librarian at the main desk
because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault
viko sits behind zlata and counsel while a judge rules
if an attorney presents this properly referencing international standards you might be able to get a conviction
viko and zlata wait
then breathe relief
viko turns to the back of the courtroom kathy smiles at last feeling they can really accomplish something
kathy comes inside interrupting jan and franz dutch iptf
sorry you wanted to see me
franz excuses himself eyeing a tense kathy
jan closes the door behind franz turning to kathy
madeleine rees wants to see you
head of the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights
im sure its fine
you followed protocol right
kathy rushes out worried
jan smiles in on a secret
kathy sits alone in the office
degrees plaques and awards cover the walls
pictures of madeleine rees with kofi annan bill clinton nelson mandela
kathy is intimidated
madeleine rees s tall commanding short blonde hair british
she sashays in with a doberman on a leash
dont mind helen shes a total sap
kathy eyes the malevolent hound
rees i madeleine
youve been stirring things up
is this about zlata sehik
if ive overstepped protocol you have done in two months what weve been trying to do for years
all due respect to viko mezovic but you just facilitated the first conviction for domestic abuse in bosnian history
im bloody impressed
so is the dutch duty officer who recommended you
kathy takes it in
madeleine looks out the window at two glass towers that punctuate sarajevos skyline
the iptf has a gender affairs office at mission headquarters
dervla hughes the current head is leaving and i think youre the right person to take over
kathy is taken aback
youd be overseeing regional offices
any gender reports come through you
this involves anything from equality training to domestic and child abuse cases fallout from war crimes against women prostitution
women in bosnia are treated like second class citizens
you could have a real impact on their lives
what do you think
are you interested
this is everything kathy came to do
kathy paces phone to her ear
her suitcase open shes packing at the same time
i know hon its very exciting
if this works out
its a real opportunity for the future but it means i have to i have to extend my contract for another six months
kathy stops pacing
kathy pulls the phone close listening
carmen eyes her
no i didnt
ill look right now
kathy goes over to a computer clicking open an email
on the screen a picture of erin in a prom dress
kathy sits back flushed with emotion
her enthusiasm complicated by the realization of what shes missing back home
you look beautiful
carmen helps kathy load boxes and suitcases into an suv
i cant believe theyre moving you into the city
im so jealous
so wheres your office
but madeleine is unhchr right
smiling i know
i dont even know if im still iptf
well i dont give an f
all i know is im gonna miss you
stay in touch with the little people
kathy smiles and hops into the car
kathy drives into the city centre
kathy puts the last box down
she steps out onto the balcony
looks out at sarajevo city of survivors her new home
member nations flags slap in the wind
hundreds of un suvs
kathy drives up
she takes in the huge building
almost in disbelief that shes part of it at the center of it all
the modern lobby buzzes with un officials and diplomats
kathy follows rick jones s athletic crisp
im glad to have an american in the mix
youll be reporting to me
i i thought i was reporting to madeleine rees office
its a joint office
shes human rights
but youre police task force
so you go through me
but we all report to bill hynes anyhow
they walk through two large doors into
the inner sanctum
rick and kathy round a corner to a medium sized office boxes everywhere
rick eyes the
yeah your ah
were waiting for archives to get those out of here
ill put another call in
kathy nods taking in the disarray
dust sits on the stacks of boxes on papers and files strewn about
thanks for the tour
ill leave you to it
he leaves her
kathy runs her eye over the place
the reality of her office less exalted than she imagined
but shes raring to go
she eyes a name plate kathy stands in her office doorway glancing up the hall
the hall is empty
the exit door at the end swings shut in the flickering fluorescent light
merchants line the narrow pathways
open doored cafes serve coffee to unemployed youth
kathy and jan walk along
i was wondering when youd ask me out
its not a date
i know you had a lot to do with my promotion so i wanted to thank you
he grabs her by the hand ducking into a small archway
a narrow passage opens up onto a charming restaurant
kathy and jan sit at a table watching a waitress put down a carraffe of wine and cevapcici lamb dish
heres to not dating
listen to me
im not joking around
youre a nice guy
the waitress reaches across kathy with a plate
winks at jan
you are certain you have everything you need
the waitress eyes him coyly
kathy studies the exchange
were fine thank you
the waitress leaves
kathy shakes her head amused
you were saying im a nice guy kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table
you must be in heaven over here
the war left behind a lot of widows
you dont find that i find it uncomfortable
a lot of guys dont
i dont know what else to say about it
now finish your sentence im a nice guy but i cant afford to mess this up
its only dinner
how bad can it get
ask my two ex husbands
kathy looks at him unsettled by the chemistry between them
rick introduces kathy to various iptf and un colleagues
kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way
she organizes a big bulletin board into cantons
kathy follows an iptf monitor barry s irish past the front of a un bus
a dozen muslim women disembark and look up their hands over their mouths keening
this is the first time theyve seen their homes in years
iptf monitors help with unloading battered suitcases and belongings
three carry a couch up the steps of a building as a young brother and sister watch
standing back an elderly woman weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on makeshift storm windows on her aparment
kathy watches barry by her side
theyre all widows
thats why they were so frightened to come back
they couldnt believe theyd be safe
that what happened before wouldnt happen again
except now with nobody to protect them
kathy shakes her head
the women enter the building their past lives in shards at their feet
one woman s stands numb a bundle of books in her arms tears running down her face as her teenage son beckons her to come in the door
i always thought helping refugees get home would be one of the best parts of the job
but its so hard for them
kathy nods moved
thanks for taking me through this
fill me in when youre done and ill send my report to rick jones
another field officer rushes up
an urgent look on his face
the field officer leads barry and kathy round a corner to
a young girl nearly passed out on the couch
her face bloody and swollen
kathy runs up to the girl who can barely sit up
softly waking her
the girl comes to taking in her surroundings and
an unmistakable look in her eyes
kathy eyes the field worker
he shrugs lost
kathy turns back to the girl and slowly places a hand on her shoulder
the girl flinches then inches back
shaking her head
its okay its but the girl holds out her hands stopping kathy
she looks around completely disoriented
desperately searching for an exit
she eyes them all realizing shes surrounded and then
slapping at all of them
kathy moves to her trying gently to hold her tight
the girl sobs
hopelessness in her eyes
kathy and barry bend to catch her
at field worker call a medic
he rushes off
kathy and barry lay the girl down
she lies on the ground breathing slowly looking close to death
kathy holds her hand
who is she
i found her out in the woods
she was speaking i dont know shes not local
i think shes one of the girls from the bars
looking at the girl kathy pushes a strand of hair from her face
and as we stay a moment longer we realize this is
a long way from home
the doors open
a frantic human rights worker carries irka into the room
her clothes torn her body and face bruised
kathy looks up
she was further back in the woods
irka sees raya
six girl there
kathy looks to barry
its a bar in the hills
kathy shakes her head
she looks at raya and irka
ill take them to the womens shelter at zenica
kathy rummages through her files catching up
ill follow up at the bar
kathys mind is racing
where exactly is this bar
kathy drives up a winding mountain road checking directions on a hand drawn map
a local police car swerves by in the opposite direction
kathys suv throws up gravel
out her windscreen she sees the florida bar a dilapidated two story building painted a garish pink
crude palm trees painted on the side
kathy jumps out of her suv and moves towards
local police smoke by police cars
a local cop leads a cluster of young women out the door
they blink in the glaring light pale out of place lost
at the end of the line is luba
her eyes darting between kathy and the local cops helpless
kathy rushes towards the cop
he eyes her dubious
whats going on here
xo brovnic ce klety scey forzcic nay
he moves past her with the girls in tow
where are the iptf monitoring this raid
shouting echoes from inside the bar
two cops drag out tanjo zravbic s
he sees kathys uniform and shouts at her
zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny traba
the cops shove tanjo in a car and slam the door
kathy turns to the local cop standing with the group of girls
is that the owner
are you taking him into custody
xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky
kathy looks around frustrated
is there a translator on the scene
he stops impatient
kathy pulls out her walkie
this is kathy bolkovac
i need an interpreter
at the florida bar
the local cops watch her
kathys eyes rest on the girls
i need a time and date
we need advance notice for field calls
the local cop talks at the girls
they dont understand him but his tone is clear total disrespect
kathy moves toward them protectively then sees
two un suvs parked on the other side of the bar
two iptf monitors emerge from the bar
kathy approaches them
they seem surprised
im from gender affairs
he shakes her hand
tanjo bangs on the window inside the police car apopleptic with rage
kathy glances over her shoulder
is that the owner
off freds nod i tried to get an interpreter but no no
were pretty much done here anyway
we just had two girls come in to a human rights office saying they escaped from this place
fred seems confused
kathy pulls out a clipboard
local police have been watching the place for a while
this whole thing happened pretty fast
i guess those girls mustve run for it
kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van
well the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared
i should follow up with these ones
the local cops start to move stubbing out cigarettes getting in cars
the local cop shuts the doors of the van
you can see where theyre taking them but i cant intervene
you know the drill
he shrugs and smiles
kathy hears the police vans engine start
turning to it
ill look out for your report
she rushes after the van
fred eyes kathy confer with the van driver
he and the other monitor drive off
kathy is left alone in the silence
she turns to the bar
kathy moves inside
the place is rank and dingy
a small stage with a pole in the centre
tables fanned out around it
cut wires hang over the stage
is filled with photos young girls in various poses with men iptf soldiers
they range from the illicit to the obscene
kathy stops on a photo of a naked girl on stage holding the two open wires over her head
behind her soldiers applaud
kathy takes down the photo horrified
turns it over
scrawled in marker sarajevo firecracker
she turns to the stage
plugs in one of the wires
a huzz of electricity
tiny sparks fly
she turns and under the bar sees
a safe smashed open
a handful of u
bills scattered about
romanian ukrainian polish
all for young girls
she gathers them surprised and stuffs them into her file
her eyes are drawn to a back wall
she stops at a panelled door
it opens onto
steps she shines her flashlight up the dark passage
the beam of the flashlight finds a door
a glint off metal
at the door handle a large padlock smashed open
kathy darts the beam over the other two doors
both equipped with padlocks
kathy pushes through the first door into
kathys flashlight over hanging bedsheets separate the room into cubicles
condoms on the floor
her eye catches markings under a mattress
she pulls it away
and sees girls names scratched into the floor
under each name etched in a list of amounts
some kind of record
kathy pulls back other mattresses
some family photos
a ragged piece of paper crude drawings of sexual positions
a number by each one
the amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor
kathy looks around sickened
a run down community center nestled in a shabby area outside the city
its completely unassuming
from the outside you might think it was abandoned
the shelter is a converted gymnasium
long forgotten notices from before the war postcards
patchy linoleum curls at the edges
a soft hum
voices in rooms that kathy cant see
she walks down the hall with milena s bosnian down to earth forthright
these girls are told they have been bought and must repay the debt
they are told an outrageous sum thinking theyll be let go when they earn back that money
but they never are
kathy stares at her taken aback
sex trafficking is one of the worst things to happen after this war
milena hands over a medical report
raya has a severe internal infection
the doctor found reading intentionally placed foreign objects causing a disruption of the vaginal wall
shes not the first
men can feel deficient paying for sex so they find other ways to feel powerful
milena pushes through a door
to a dark hallway
hanging bulbs flicker intermittently
avoiding dripping leaks in the roof
we gave her penicillin but the doctor is worried there could be something more serious
when will he know
they pass an eating area
teen girls sit pick at food chain smoke and flip through magazines
they are clean but weak
unfortunately thats all we can do for her
were just a volunteer organization
kathy stares at the girls the sheer number of them
but if there are so many victims
we lost our funding because of those
she points at a basket of condoms near the coffee
its the u
department of state
they have their rules
ill do anything to give these girls some protection
but the department of state thinks condoms encourage prostitution
ngos caught giving them out no longer receive us funding
but these girls arent prostitutes
they dont realize the cycle they start
if there are no condoms in the bars
they pass a room divider
in their teens
the guys want to find ways of avoiding stds
pay more for virgins
kathy sees a girl sit in a corner
she couldnt be more than ten years old
she sits alone
so the traffickers bring more in
younger and younger
now its a global industry
if there is demand you supply
milena opens a door revealing
inside the room a volunteer nurse sits by rayas bed
she lies asleep
in another bed irka sleeps
where can they get help
try the global displacement agency
they have good medical care lots of funding
they might take them
whether theyll keep them or not
i dont know
where are the other girls from the florida bar
milena looks at her
the local police were bringing them here
those girls never arrived
unmhq stands over the crumbling red roofs of sarajevo
in the foreground a cemetery packed with crooked wooden crosses
kathy walks in
carmen sits behind a desk piled with files
hey whereve you been
ill tell you about it over a drink
could you just check something for me
i want to get a copy of the monitors report from a raid on the florida bar yesterday
carmen nods and clicks on her computer
your job is so exciting
the only thing i get to raid is the fridge
reading off the computer
you sure there was a raid
theres no record here
thats definitely it
there were six girls removed from the bar and i need to know where they were taken
no record of any raid
somethings not adding up
monitors greet her as she passes
she reaches an office and knocks
im looking for fred murray
five local men in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand held minesweepers
one man holds up his hand as his device beeps
at the edge of the field fred murray blows a whistle
everybody else stops
the man bends down as all wait
kathy approaches from the road behind a fence
we meet again
kathy looks out suddenly aware of the dangerous situation
is it okay for me to be here
youre fine here on the gravel
whats going on
i just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday
those girls didnt show up at the shelter and i wanted to locate them
yeah the whole thing was a bit of a mess
turned out it was a local police mistake
mix up with the tip off or something
thought they had a prostitution bust but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses
waitresses arent kept under lock and key
another whistle blows
fred turns to the field
can we go over this later
i got to get in there
before she can answer fred is moving down the field
she watches him go
kathy and milena lead raya and irka out to her suv
a stark contrast the gda is a new and shining edifice
kathys suv pulls up front
kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area
the place is modern western
in platinum base relief over the reception desk the lobby
magazines on a coffee table
the wall adorned with a huge framed poster of a young girl in a spiderweb
a caption traffiku zhinok ye sprav
kathy scans the hall
laura levin s american groomed business like comes around the corner
her assistant s leads the girls away
the new head of gender affairs
my assistant will take them to the medical center
as soon as they get medical clearance well know where we stand
what do you mean
well its yet to be determined if theyll cooperate with the repatriation program
thats the only way i can allow them to stay at the gda
witnesses for a situation im
ill need to speak with them when theyre ready
ill be in touch
will you be contacting their parents
something still on kathys mind
the other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the womens medica shelter but they never showed up
do you have any idea where else they might have been taken
i didnt know there were any others
kathy eyes the girls down the hall
raya turns a last look
kathy starts her car
she pulls out turning left
then cranks the wheel right
kathys un suv swerves along the serpentine mountain road
laura in her office
she works through her files
opening one with rayas photo on top
the phone is ringing
halyna rushes to it
out of breath
kochan im calling from the global displacement agency in sarajevo to confirm you have a daughter named rayisa
we have located her
halyna falls into a chair her chest heaving relief
kathy pulls up to a parking lot full of cars and un suvs
music spills out
back in business
she gets out of the suv moving inside
kathy in the doorway
the place is dark but lit by lamps along the walls
the place is hopping
a scantily clad girl dances on the stage her body writhing but her eyes dead
along the edges girls the very same girls kathy saw released at the raid socialize with customers
many of the customers
in iptf uniforms others with off duty iptf sweatshirts and internationals in civilian casuals
a few locals at the bar where
tanjo commands the scene cheery chatting with an iptf officer at the bar
kathy stands frozen until she catches the eye of
luba sitting on the knee of a middle aged iptf officer
kathy is filled with
kathy speeds up the mountain roads
past many bars
one after another after another
all filled with un suvs
groups of drunk officers spill out
she stops across from one seeing jan coming out of the bar
kathy watches stunned
jan helps a drunk friend pile into an suv
he looks up and sees kathy as a car beam slides over her
she pulls away
kathy stands on the balcony
taking in the cold air
kathy its jan
i dont understand
kathy stands quiet
let me in
kathy waits a moment breathing
kathy paces as jan struggles for words
how can you go up there when you know what happens to these girls
it was a good bye party
i was theyre thirteen fourteen fifteen i know
if you let me finish i got a call
some friends needed a lift home because they got drunk
but hey lady you better wake up
everywhere is a brothel
the coffee shop down the street
the post office
my corner store
thats how it is here
im not interested and i try and stay in clean places
and if you dont believe me then fuck you
he looks at her hurt he cares what she thinks
kathy sees this
something she hasnt felt in so long
are you okay
im not okay
what are these guys thinking
she looks at him fighting the urge to trust him
jan brushes a strand of hair from her face
she lets go
he pulls her in
can you tell me what you know
jan and kathy in front of her computer
theyre on an iptf message board flashes of various posts new girl at the berlin bar new twelve year old pussy at the old grill
they scroll down dozens of posts
kathy looks at jan shaken by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild
kathy watches jan asleep in her bed
fog hangs low over the waking valley of sarajevo
a doctor signs off on a final examination of a now much healthier looking raya
she signs a form
laura hovers in the background as raya dials the phone
her face raw with emotion
the phone in the hall rings
but no one is there to answer
halyna at the door
a kettle whistles
roman will be home soon
make your tea
ill be quick
zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle
her hands shake
halyna stares at a new dishwasher
then a microwave blender and small lcd tv
suspiciously out of context in kyiv
roman seems to be doing well
i need to borrow money
zenia looks up unsure
they found raya in sarajevo
i want to go and get her
i dont need much
zenia nods keeping still as possible
does he still hit you
zenia chokes on her tea
conflicted between love and guilt
she wants so badly to say
but she cant
you know i hate to ask
but shes my daughter
and your niece
please ill get you the money
but you have to go
roman will be home soon
he wont give it to me if he knows its for you
kathy watches rick flip through her report
there were other officers too
but the raid was not in the books
these girls were just sent back
they are clearly not waitresses
they are victims
i think iptf were paid off to turn a blind eye
thats a serious allegation
and you dont have any evidence
i cant open an investigation based on a hunch
he drops the papers
youre gonna need more than this
raya and irka sit across from laura levin
she slides a document over to each of them
if you sign here you confirm that you are voluntarily entering the repatriation program at the gda
raya eyes irka confused
laura softens slightly
this means we can get you out of bosnia
isnt that what you want
rayas eyes widen
irka is shocked but joyous
they never thought this moment would come
youll stay here for two weeks to continue medical treatment as well as psychological counselling
well give you a ticket home and a stipend of to get started when you return
suddenly irkas face drops
what do i do then
my parents were killed in kosovo
it was my brother who sold me here
cant i go somewhere else
we can only send you home but what you choose to do after that is up to you
but now angry tears well in rayas eyes
she looks up torn
what about the others the girls in the bar
my friend luba we ran she couldnt
i dont know where she is
i cant go without her
laura pauses taken aback
im sorry but my role here is to get you home
otherwise you stay in bosnia where you
could face charges for illegal prostitution
raya stares reeling
to be made to feel like a criminal
i will sign
raya looks at her but irka doesnt look back
kathy stares out across the central courtyard
into the adjoining building
through the glass she watches
fred murray leading new recruits through the halls
he jokes around as the officers eye him with respect
the phone rings
kathy stands in disbelief
laura is stern
raya and irka could be key witnesses in a un investigation
i thought we were all on the same team
irka can stay
but i cant keep raya here
she is refusing to cooperate in the repatriation program
please just let her stay two weeks
then we can take it from there
we only house fourteen girls
its a valuable spot
if shes going to testify shes not safe anywhere else
laura shrugs resigned
kathy sits across from raya
a translator to the side translates as raya speaks
we were supposed to work in a hotel
shaking her head now
i can be charged with prostitution
there is another option
i want to help you find your friends
but you need to help me do that
kathy takes out the photo of fred murray and lays it on the table
raya eyes it defiant no reason to trust her
none of this is your fault
i want to go after the people who hurt you
but i need to know exactly what happens
as a witness in un custody you will be protected and will not be charged for any crimes
raya stares still not convinced
the translator starts
raya stops her
turning to kathy
un will protect me
they dont protect me when they drink in bar and fuck me and my friends
kathy is humbled
she looks at raya open raw
i have a daughter just your age
i wouldnt stop until i found her
the two women stare at each other
a silent connection
raya looks down almost
struggling to get this out
i only left because
there was nothing no jobs no
i was good in school
but with no money
she is on her own
she works so hard
but nothing changes
i thought i could help her
he said we would work in a hotel
with good wages
tears gathering in her eyes
its terrifying to remember
when we got there
other girls were there
from ukraine moldova romania everywhere
we were in the middle of nowhere
nobody could hear us
one girl go crazy screaming
he shoots her
he shoots her right in the head
then we was
raya is stopped by a rush of tears
kathy reaches for her hand
looking at this girl so young
raya looks kathy squarely in the face
she slides the photo of murray toward her
do you know this man
he is not the only one
they come every month
tanjo give them money so they dont raid the bar
that day you come
tanjo did not want to pay
they want to punish him
take his money
raya sobs knowing she has betrayed the system
betting her life on the hope that this system wont betray her
milena leads kathy through the halls
i need to get evidence
how many girls do you have here
at least thirty five
kathy sits with girl after girl
listening to their stories
kathy interviews eva
she talks through grateful tears
many of them come in
uniforms like you
different flags on the shoulders
i will testify
i dont care anymore
one brings cigarette
his name is peter
kathy with a different girl fadila
sometimes if its a party a birthday they pay for a group of girls all together
do whatever they want
brian the irish guy said bosnia was better than thailand for girls
another girl jasmila stunning with haunted eyes
the soldier from italia say i was his girlfriend
i ask him to help me
but the bar owner pay him off
he has a tattoo of tiger on his arm
yet another nadia nodding
paolo come every week
he had a thin moustache the other
here i have a picture
kathy wasnt expecting that
nadia throws down a photo
he loved the firecracker
nadia lifts up her sweatshirt revealing a long scar
kathy inspects the photo nadia with a south american and u
iptf their arms around her
one licks her face
they burn me
then they laugh
kathy eyes nadia
silently in awe of her strength
do you have any more pictures
kathy pins nadias photo on a large bulletin board
the wall is covered in photos of girls
kathy reaches for the phone
what are you doing
its three in the morning ma
kathy sits back relieved
mom are you okay
i just was thinking about you
okay can i go back to bed now
of course i just
its great to hear your voice
kathy stands before ricks desk
he smiles at her convivial
i followed up on the florida bar
its worse than i thought
there was a protection racket
americans romanians were taking pay offs to make sure the place wasnt busted
that raid was a punishment bust because the owner stopped paying
but he mustve settled it because the girls are right back where they started
locked up in the hills
rick scrambles for words but kathys not finished
i talked to thirty five girls at the shelter
all this testimony cant be ignored
our guys are patronizing the bars in large numbers
rick serious abuses are taking place
its all in my reports
kathy lays her stack of files on the desk
okay lets back up a second here ive got two girls ready to testify about iptf taking pay offs testify where
a bosnian court
not gonna happen
all international personnel have immunity
kathy is stopped
but there must be some channel some exception look youve done really good work here
these are serious allegations
let me look into how to handle it
ill get back to you
the markets shut down
the catholic church bells ring
across the square the call to prayer echoes from old loudspeakers
jan stirs a pan
kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him
its different for us
were all military or police
every contingent except for the u
if someone does something wrong they have to answer to a military tribunal at home
with the americans
your dyncorp guys
i dont think you have that
so the americans arent legally accountable for anything
to be honest i think our superiors would keep it quiet too
i mean i havent seen a military tribunal
jan cant help noticing that kathy is making a mess of the vegetables
he takes the knife
she walks away preoccupied
you know my mission stay is up in a few weeks
you could come home with me
to do what
she turns glass of wine in hand leaning on the counter
i was just
this place yknow it gets to you
im im worried what will happen to you a year from now
she puts down her glass of wine irritated
you dont need to worry about me
she looks at him seeing
its not discouragement
so fred murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and hed never see the inside of a courtroom
in bosnia yes
i mean something that public could get him sent home
and tried in his own country
kathy gets an idea
a crumbling edifice once home to the worlds finest now a reminder of humanitys worst
kathy walks with madeleine who unleashes helen the hound
helen loves it here
i think she has olympic ambitions
kathy hands madeleine the files
she flips through
i wanted these girls to testify in a trial against the iptf officers
but the immunity problem
okay but if the girls testify in a bosnian court against their trafficker
theyd have to mention what else goes on in the brothels
the dog comes bounding back
it could work
if you make certain that in their testimony they mention every sordid detail of iptf involvement that is their testimony
then it would be on record
somebody would have to pay attention
the state department
madeleine grins proud
theyre gonna answer for this
kathy weaves around the corner of a dimly lit shabby hallway
she arrives at a doorway vehicle dispatch
kathy talks to lewis s american
and the two girls have to go to the hospital to get immunized or they cant stay in the country
i need an armored security vehicle
lewis looks at her almost laughing
youre lucky you have a car at all
were stretched to the limit
besides isnt this a local police matter
kathy parks her suv
kathy walks into the station drawing the attention of the local cops
danik rolls his eyes
im looking for danik turns away
your american girlfriend is here
kathy eyes danik
viko comes out smiling broadly at kathy
kathy and viko walk out energized with a sense of purpose
its no problem
the van is just sitting here
they arrive at a police van
kathy eyes it
its not exactly armored but it will do the trick
you follow me yes
he jumps in and starts it up
kathy follows in her un suv
across the street a local man watches from inside a car
kathy swerves up
viko has the van parked right up against the door
kathy jumps out
laura leads a very scared raya out
kathy smiles gentle
at laura wheres irka
laura takes a deep breath eyeing raya
i need to have a word with you
kathy looks at her watch at raya
viko taps her shoulder
ill take her
meet us when youre done
as viko and raya leave kathy stops her
ill be right behind you
are you okay
raya nods trusting in kathy
who turns angry back to
i was going to call you
there was a problem
during our repatriation procedures we realized irka had no passport
so we get her one
where is she
you dont get it
she was trafficked from belgrade
her parents were killed in kosovo
and she has no documentation
no embassy will recognize her
she is a girl without a country
she is a witness for a un investigation
gda employees peer
an intern betrays a twinge of complicity
we handed her over to the police a few hours ago
i couldnt keep her
ive already done every favour i could for you
this is not on me
you had no right to do that
i had every right
we have a system that works here
youre the one disrupting it
kathy stares at her
where did they take her
shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit
just then the door opens
disoriented emotion rising
look for laura levin
kathy holds her anger smiling respectfully at halyna
laura leads her away
kathy searches for an answer her eyes landing on
if you know anything this is on you
i think the cops leave them somewhere near the border so that with no papers the girls have to cross the border illegally
take the to visegrad
speeding down the
a two lane winding road
nothing but the feet her headlights show
viko steers the van around a corner
raya sits in the back
laura hands an excited halyna a cup of tea
shell be back in about an hour
kathys eyes glued on the road trying to make out a sign
then another sign
onto a gravel road
viko stops at a traffic light
raya peers out a crack in the van
young women in the streets
kathy slows her car
a border station a gravel road leads up to it
border guards smoke and play cards
one guard saunters over
im looking for a girl
she was dropped here a few hours ago
he shrugs shaking his head
can you check the border logs
shes about the police brought her here but she didnt have a passport
i know what youre looking for
those girls do not go through the border
they go through there
a thick forest
stretching for miles
kathy stares at the endless forest
a dirt road cuts through the middle
she jumps in her suv and hurtles down the road
viko turns down a narrow street
he glances in his rear view mirror
an old trabbant follows him
he veers down an alley
kathys suv crawls alongside the forest
highbeams off the top of the car
scanning all around
then in a clearing up ahead
viko eyes the mirror
turning onto a deserted kathy hurtles closer to the silhouette
kathy cranks the wheel driving off the road and onto
the suv is jolted by the uneven terrain
irka peers into the blinding light
viko drives up the deserted street
suddenly two battered mercedes fly out from side roads and block the way
viko brakes hard
raya is thrown to the side of the van
kathy stops the car jumps out and runs after irka
irkas legs start to give
kathy gains on her
viko reverses and turns but a mercedes roars round the other side bashing the side of the van
kathy feels irka slowing down
two men jump out of the cars
viko speeds forward
a tire blown out
the van skids to a halt
viko smashes against the window
raya tries the doors but they wont open
she wails slamming herself against the door
kathy raises her arms waving
kathy can see her clearly now disoriented beyond bearing
irka shields her face from the distant headlights
kathy steps out of their glare
irka recognizes her
she collapses releasing confused tears
kathy walks over careful slowly bending to help
let me die
kathy holds her
as the young girl cries
the men approach the van
rayas banging echoes from inside reverberating around the empty street
nobody can hear her
isolated stars peek through clouds drifting over dark hills stretching far into the horizon
kathy and viko sit silent
barry hangs up the phone
weve got a safe house in the mountains
nobody knows shes here so were clear to take her there now
kathy looks across the room to irka who sits hunched looking out the window
a middle aged couple lead irka inside a small home
in the middle of nowhere
shrouded in the black night
nobody will find her here
in the doorway irka turns to kathy and viko
where is raya
they stare back at her
the woman closes the door
kathy and viko stand in the dead silence
his face bruised
lets go back to the florida bar you think hed be that stupid
i dont care
i have nothing else to go on do i
adrenalin overtaking sadness
viko follows kathy to the car
kathy and viko pull up
its in full swing
they step inside and in one glance see
the whole set of girls is different
no luba no raya no tanjo
the iptf barely notice her
kathy steps out
they moved them already
at the end of her rope
laura at a total loss eyes
no no no
what will they do to her
a brown van snakes through the distant mountain roads
ivan s drives
tanjo is in the passenger seat
well stop soon
were far enough now
tanjo cranes into the back of the van
he turns on an overhead light revealing
huddled in the back
so you want to testify
all the girls turn to
their conscience paralyzed by the need to survive
terrified raya looks to
her eyes pleading for support
but luba turns away
we all move to a new bar now
somewhere no one will come look for you
then we have a conversation
the girls avoid rayas gaze
tanjo turns off the light
the van drives off into the unknown
kathy stands by her suv watching monitors set off for the day
then she sees
fred murray emerge with colleagues laughing
he stops when he sees kathy gazing over serious
kathy and fred walk between the parked cars
im begging you i dont know what youre talking about
if you know any of the other bars he owns anything
im appealing to hey
im gonna say this one more time
and you can put this down in your investigation on me
i dont know what youre talking about
kathy stands a black speck in the patchwork of white un suvs spread across the lot
ricks secretary shakes her head at kathy
ive called and paged
he says he cant get into this now
does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted
where is he
sorry kathy he really didnt tell me
its not your fault
kathy is downcast
she nods not totally convinced
irka wont testify now
its completely understandable
shes way too scared
i dont know what to do with her
the gda wont take her and her traffickers will find her if shes in this city
emotion taking over
these girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system thats supposed to help them spits them right back out
it barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though its a fucking epidemic and everyone knows it
are we supposed to wait around for that to change
maybe its time for a little diplomacy
do you have a nice frock
kathy stands in front of a mirror in a black dress her hair hanging down to her shoulders
she stands awkward
you think its okay
she turns to jan and carmen sitting on her bed
but carmen is tilting her head doubtful
you can stop standing like a farmers wife for starters
these people are dignitaries
you gotta up your game
she approaches her and sweeps her hair up into an elegant chignon
she takes off her own earrings and puts them on kathy
jan nods impressed
kathy eyes herself pleased
a white volkswagon rabbit speeds though the sarajevo hills
madeleine is elegant in a suit
kathy looks at her black dress self conscious
is there a specific way of addressing the high commissioner of the mission
i call him bill
kathy nods nervous
they pull into a circular drive
the house is incongruous in its context manicured gardens remodelled facade
and tonight its black tie and catering
an elegant woman comes to greet them
how do we do
we do what we can
great to see you madeleine
janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse
i hope you dont mind ive brought along a friend
this is kathy bolkovac
kathy holds out her hand a little nervous
i need as many gal pals as i can get
look at this place
she gestures toward the room
a haze of cigar smoke hovers over the gaggle of men
kathys eyes zero in on bill hynes surrounded by a group of japanese diplomats
bill notices her and madeleine
he waves familiar
madeleine nods humoring
ambassador john wells s slides his hand on janets back
what are your thoughts on dinner
i think people are still busy drinking
john shakes madeleines hand darting his eyes over kathy
speaking of what can i get you ladies
madeleine looks at kathy
thank you mr
ah ill have a wine please
nodding coming right up
madeleine white for you
kathy notices the respect he shows her
janet leads them in chatting with madeleine
kathy surveys the room full of dignitaries
a stunning view of sarajevo at night
kathy stands alone
a waiter offers her a convoluted hors doeuvre
she takes it gracious
trying to figure out what it is when
nice view no
kathy turns to
peter ward s smoking a cigarette
i just needed some air
trust me i know the feeling
i hate these stuffy events
you never know anyones agenda
he eyes her
she looks past him
at bill hynes
well thats a plan
actually i had a different one in mind
madeleine and janet come through the door
peter stubs out his cigarette and moves back inside
arm around janet behind every good man
janets eyes betray empathy
she shakes her head upset
they just left her there
at the border
just the psychological trauma
how can i help
shes very vulnerable to re trafficking
internationals got her in this situation
we owe her the chance to get out
janet is keen to follow but a little lost
we want to repatriate irka to the united states and find her a foster family
i was hoping you could use your influence janet holds up her hand nodding emphatically
were going to find her a home
kathy eyes madeleine
i also think the american embassy should be aware of some of the problems were having with our officers
your help with irkas case can really raise awareness in the mission around the issue of trafficking
madeleine gives her a reassuring glance
kathy sees the difference between a cop and a diplomat
still in her dress going through files
proud of the nights accomplishments but her eyes linger on the board of girls
on the picture of rayas apb
sun over the hills
a dog follows a young boy through a field
the boy stops seeing a brown van down the road
he runs waving as the van approaches
it slows to meet him
in the van
ivan rolls down the window
can i come with you
the boy looks down disappointed
tell your mother ill be home for dinner
then you and i will go for a walk
i have a present for you
what is it
ivan shrugs jokingly
then smiles as he drives away
the brown van pulls up
ivan comes around it and opens the back door
he reaches in and pulls out
an old bicycle
you couldnt buy him a new one
you have money now
ill fix this one up this afternoon
i had one like it
tanjo lights a cigarette moving to the destroyed building
i want to get them out today
ivan follows tanjo down rickety steps
cries and whimpers grow louder as they descend into a two men stand guard
tanjo walks past them
opens a door
ushering ivan inside where
girls are huddled together
luba and three others
they look up
offscreen the cries swell
we realize the sound is not coming from this room
tanjo waves his fingers methodically
cmon lets go
the girls stand helping one another
tentative but submissive they move toward him
he holds open the door
i want to show you what happens when you they jump back
his scream echoes
they move to a door on the other side
a guard opens the door onto a horrific site
luba closes her eyes
but tanjo pushes the girls in one by one they go through into a and see
held down by four men
spread eagle on her front
her face shows unimaginable pain
and we see that
two of the men holding her down are extinguishing lit ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
but we realize
this is not the greatest cause of her pain
lubas face whitens
eyeing one man at rayas backside
a flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from raya and drops
a pipe onto the ground
the men step away
collapsed into a ball
now the girls all understand
there is no hope at all
madeleine stands before a small group of reporters
the young woman who shall remain anonymous arrived in bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse
ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin
but because she is an orphan she finds herself without a home
im pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the united states
i want to thank janet wells for her assistance in making this happen
i believe this can stand as a signal that the international community in bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking a human rights
abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the international community to intervene in bosnia in the first place
now that the un is finally recognizing sex trafficking how are you going to monitor it
reporters flock with questions
kathy stands in the back proud
on the other side rick jones watches
kathy and madeleine emerge buzzing with their success
nothing on raya
kathy shakes her head saddened
ive sent an apb out to all police stations and un field offices
but im pushing ahead with the other girls in milenas shelter
im creating a photo line up using the un id database so they can identify all internationals involved
weve got to make them accountable
milena looks through a glass window into
kathy sits with girls including fadila nadia eva
she brings up id photos of iptf officers scrolling down the page
fadila points at one and nods speaking
another girl jasmila points at a picture of
an iptf officer
kathy brings up a new page of id photos
flicking through page after page
the girls identify several officers
kathy finds carmen behind a computer
i have a favour to ask
you have access to all transport vehicle checkouts right
im a fountain of useless knowledge
can you see how often fred murray has checked out raid vehicles
carmen looks at her surprised
fred was sent home
kathy stands back
why didnt anyone tell me
is he being disciplined because of my carmen shakes her head
hes just gone
meaning investigation over
they wanted him out of here
people are talking
come on lets get some lunch
kathy and carmen at a table in the corner
kath you gotta be careful
look i know youre doing your own thing and all but youre investigating your colleagues
youve seen what theyre doing
i just the stuff people are saying im catching snippets and im worried about you
think about your kids
kathy is silenced
a tap on her shoulder
looking for you in human resources
carmen eyes kathy concerned
kathy follows the monitor toward the exit
monitors and civilians buzz about talking
but all around kathy the air is silent
some iptf officers eye her coolly
is she paranoid
officer blakely smiles formally
kathy shifts in her seat
im john blakely human resources
kathy eyes him dubious
in going through your records i see youve got quite a case load
it must be stressful
deadpan a bit
would you say youre under extreme stress
there are concerns among some of your superiors that youve become impulsive reckless in your position
kathy sits shocked
wed like to suggest taking some time off
you have some leave time
kathy eyes him coolly
he slides over a booklet
you can consolidate your leave
well contact our head offices in the u
and ensure none of your pay would be deducted
take a little vacation
see your kids
were simply suggesting this out of concern for you
are you suggesting i take time off
or are you telling me
this is simply out of concern for you
kathy pushes her chair back and leaves
kathy sits at the table covered in photos of girls flipping through the dyncorp manual irritated
consolidate my leave
a fucking vacation
she shakes her head overwrought
flipping through the manual seeing
who are these people
stopping on a page and why does dyncorp a company that sends american peacekeepers have its corporate headquarters in england
she looks up at jan
he shrugs sympathetic wanting to help
of course i want to see my kids of course
not like this
not by being sent home like some hysterical woman
my god it wasnt that easy to up and leave them
if i go home like this
its like coming here this whole thing was a
she shakes her head lost in thought
maybe it was
jan sits beside her concerned
nobody who knows you could think that
im losing witnesses suspects
its one step forward two steps back
jan tries to jump in
but no seriously
im just a cop from nebraska
what do i know
jan shakes his head
its not what
you know them
he points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over the table
kathy eyes them torn between self doubt and something much more instinctive
laura sits across from halyna who is heartbroken
its been a few weeks now
i dont know if theres much point but we i must i have to do something
there has to be something i can do
laura takes a second
suddenly struck with an idea
a large wood house with a neon camel sits in the mountains above the city of tuzla
a van pulls up
raya luba follow ivan up stairs
ivan unlocks a he bangs on a wall
five girls wake in cots on the ground
he motions for them to go in
mara hands raya and luba a piece of paper with crude drawings of sexual positions
a price value by each
you work in two hours
ivan and mara leave locking the door behind him
the other girls go about their business barely noticing raya and luba
but julia and tanya come over
you sleep on whichever mattresses are available
the last two girls in have to share
they bring us food in the morning
you have to eat it all or you get fined
raya grabs her head
she looks for a place to sit
julia and tanya help her to the ground
dont let him see you like this
luba walks over to the other side of the room
finds a spot and sits
raya watches her hurt
julia pushes a mattress aside
underneath is a
counting system scratched into the floor
each girls name scratched with numbers beside it
im the closest
then i can go home
raya barely has the energy to hold herself up
whats your name
tanya scratches rayas name into the floor
then one mark
its all bullshit no
he sent a girl back three months ago
i was here
to luba what is your name
raya eyes luba whos conflicted between loyalty to her friend and her own sense of survival
luba tears up but turns away
softly her name is luba
kathy works angry urgent now
on her desk
closer report photo id line up
kathy matches circled id photos of iptf alongside testimony and polaroids of girls
she works fast
circling the photos slapping files closed
mail boy slides in a cart and places a stack of reports on kathys in box
she pulls the first one off the top
a sticky note on the first page insufficient evidence
kathy grabs another
sticky note unreliable witness
she sees the name nadia at the top of the statement
another unreliable witness
transferred to internal affairs
kathy flies through the rest of the files
one after another insufficient evidence insufficient evidence transferred to internal affairs unreliable witnesses insufficient a photo falls out of one of them raya
kathy stares at it
her eyes wander over the room and fall on her predecessors battered old file boxes still waiting for archives
she moves to them
cuts the string on the top box
rips the top off
slotted in tight
she grabs one
sticky note insufficient evidence
she starts ripping through them all yellow sticky notes on all of them
its jim higgins out of breath in the doorway
theyve called an assembly for all dyncorp personnel
kathy and jim walk into a room filled with dyncorp boys
anyone know what this is about
no one does
kathy sits amongst the guys
rick walks up to the front
i have some not so pleasant news but bear with me
off a prepared statement lately local police have raided some houses of ill repute and a number of ladies of the evening have been taken into custody
while the credibility of these witnesses is questionable apparently photo line ups have been made available to them
rick eyes kathy pointedly
this issue is currently receiving a lot of attention
guys you gotta be careful
kathryn bolkovac is heading up this investigation
if you have any questions refer them to her
all eyes on kathy
they disperse passing her camaraderie obliterated
kathy walks livid
youve given every officer time to create an alibi
im not going to subject my men to this witch hunt based on the testimony of some hookers
prostitution is illegal
your witnesses are criminals
kathy cant believe what hes saying
they are slaves
by any american or international law
these slaves are lying about their presence in bosnia
you are coming after american officers with baseless claims
you know theyre not baseless
if youve got a problem go call the ambassadors wife
elevator doors open
kathy comes out
all eyeing her
she hurries through them
kathy sits anxious
jan touches her back
they hired you to do a job they dont want done
its a p
she turns to him
rick publicly outed me jeopardizing those girls
i have to go over his head
i never thought id have to go into internal affairs
the guys back home would never understand this
i understand you
and how long do you plan on being around because the last two guys who said that arent here
its just i waited so long you know
i want my kids to know i did something to be proud
your kids are proud
you go on this mission and youre a big hero
i go and im a bad mother
tearing up i cant believe im gonna disappoint them again
he comes closer
she looks up
a blast of light through kathys windshield
the lot is empty
she looks at a pile of reports on the passenger seat
kathy reports in hand turns a corner and
bumps into an officer
she drops some files
he moves around her as she bends to pick them up
she walks the rest of the hall focused and stops at a brass plaque internal affairs
kathy marches in nervous
monitors turn and see her knowing who she is but trying not to show it
she approaches a male monitor at a desk in the front
what can i do for you
the monitor keeps typing as she talks
kathy hesitates then its i need to speak in camera with a senior ia official
i dont have a name but kathy recognizes peter ward working in a back office
he sees her then closes the door
just a moment please
kathy sits across from an ia official s
he skims through the reports nodding
i did a photo id line up with victims who testified to international patronizing of brothels as well as complicity in trafficking itself
he looks at her
all the cases i filed to my superiors have come back shut down
some of them were marked as referred to ia
i havent seen those
he shakes his head standing
its possible theyre still in the pipeline in preliminary processing
im sorry to have to rush this but i have to get to a meeting
thanks for coming in
he hands her a form
you need to sign here that youre asking for these investigations
kathy jogs along a ridge with a view high over sarajevo
she pushes past her fatigue
kathy comes in soaked in sweat
the phone rings
she rushes to it
caller id unknown number
she picks up breathless
sorry who is this
just one second
she grabs a pen and pad
writing the holiday inn
can i get your name
she looks at the phone spooked
kathy moves through the lobby scanning the scene of liquid lunches and diplomats
she keeps her head low focused ding
the doors open
kathy steps in
as they close
two diplomats slip in
the elevator ascends
kathy stares dead ahead
kathy stands at door
she takes a moment then knocks
kathy is led in by peter ward
she comes inside tentative unsure who shes dealing with
peter smokes furiously a burned out mission lifer whos bright intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world
he seems nervous
that was you today in ia
nodding would you like a drink
kathy eyes him dubious
he pours her a drink
i saw your files
peter slaps down a file
kathy looks at it
i dont understand
theyre investigating you
kathy stares at him
dont you get it
theyre circling the wagons
what did he tell you
he hadnt seen anything from you until today
top level dyncorp commanders are walking into ia and removing your files
ive been told to shut down all your investigations
there has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around the united nations
peter thinking about how to put this
dyncorps contract with the state department in bosnia alone is worth million dollars
were paid ninety a hundred grand right
but its a drop in the ocean compared to their profits
this is a global corporation top five defense contractors in the states after halliburton and kb r
you think theyre gonna let some sex scandal threaten that
i dont want a scandal
i just want nobody cares about you
its designed that way
no national or international accountability
dyncorps headquarters are in england exactly
nothing leads back to the state department
that includes you
so if something were to happen to you it wouldnt even make the news at home
no one would ever know
finally understanding the world shes in
peter moves to the door
through the eye hole a couple checks in across the room
peter turns back
sees a panic stricken kathy
if youre going to keep going youve got to stay under the radar
make copies of all your files keep them under lock and key
and know who youre up against
she crosses the labyrinth of white suvs
she looks up at the osce towers
two sfor soldiers walk toward her
she slips a car key between her fingers arming herself
watching them as
kathy picks up her pace
her pulse racing
she checks around
the lot is empty
she is alone
a row of international flags flap in the wind
kathy watches the flags
she shifts her gaze to the bulletin board
eyeing the picture of raya
she moves to
the file cabinet
she pulls out every file
opens the bottom filing cabinet pushes files to the front placing the copies in the back
she steps away
closes the cabinet
and locks it
knowing she is operating outside of protocol now
raya stares at herself in a mirror
dressed as a whore
its more of a medium sized hall
a bar some tables and a few home touches
maps of yugoslavia
pictures of tito
and full of iptf
raya walks through ogled
luba sitting on maras lap
surrounded by ten irish soldiers
the soldiers ply them with drinks winning them with charm
luba blends in with remarkable ease
you feel like a party
rory irish grabs rayas hand
he leads her to the back of the bar
raya looks to luba but realizes she is alone
they walk through a back door into a room full of beds separated with curtains
we barely make out the shapes of various soldiers with girls in each cubicle
until a curtain opens
and jim higgins walks out
his rite of passage complete
rory pulls raya to the cubicle as julia comes out
halyna boards a plane with passengers but without raya
kathy opens the door into the empty apartment seeing a rapidly blinking light on a digital display messages
each message a silence followed by a hang up
kathy stares at the blinking light as the clicks keep coming
click click click
she rips the machine out of the wall
we hear a dial up connection
kathys at her computer
she brings up a yahoo
types in rick jones matches for rick jones
she types again
close on rick jones colorado springs matches for rick jones colorado springs she scans down the page
none of the matches work
she shakes her head about to give up when
chief of police r
jones in law suit a picture of rick jones accompanies the article
close on words richard jones fired for sexual harassment kathy sits at the empty kitchen table looking at the picture of her kids
she holds her head in her hands
distant music echoes through the night
voices of guys hanging out on their balconies
kathy crosses the lot cutting through the dark night fog
the only vehicle on the road
kathy sits in the suv
staring at the station
through the window
jan works the late shift alone
jan and kathy sit
several empty coffee cups
i cant believe your timing
its a rotation
theyre sending us back a month early
i tried to get an extension but
kathy just stares ahead
a long time
im not even sure im staying
jan sits back
jones is a sexual offender
dyncorp hired him
these private militaries are a sham
theres no way around them
if thats what your instincts are telling you
i have children i have to think about them
a big iptf party
at the bar raya waits with an empty tray
luba pulls out a heavy crate of bottles
she hurts her back
here ill help you
luba slams two bottles on rayas tray
i earned this job
i was just trying to dont
youll get us in trouble
an iptf officer mike sears grabs raya from behind
shakes her jokingly
she laughs familiar
hows my favorite girl
i am good
she smiles hollow and takes the tray over to a table
julia and tanya sit with four men in suits
i wanna party all night
the girls smile nodding playing along
lets go out
i wanna take you home
he squeezes tanya tight to him kissing her sloppily
raya eyes julia
ivan comes over smiling a gregarious host
we wanna party on mate
how much to take them home for the day
ivan eyes the girls
ten times normal
and extra deposit
but you cannot take her
he points at raya
three thousand each
off their scoffing you bring back you get back deposit
the other two men are dubious
but suit and suit exchange glances
daring each other
ivan waves to follow him
they walk with julia and tanya
raya watches ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey
they pay him
julia catches rayas eye
a look of promise
the dutch contingent boards a bus
kathy stands aside with jan
franz pats jan on the back
ill keep an eye out
jan shakes his hand
franz winks at kathy
to kathy its finally our time
she smiles soft
drained of energy
get outta here
anything you need you call okay
hell kill both of us if you dont
franz moves away leaving the two alone
jan hugs kathy
you come to me
when youre done
he kisses her
the bus engines start
kathy watches out the window
diplomats walk the halls
whats this i hear about you leaving
kathy turns to madeleine in the doorway
howd you the dutch officer rang before he left
cmon i want to show you something
kathy follows downbeat
the girls clean
raya sweeps watching mara teach luba how to restock the bar
ivan comes out of the office
a bag in hand
madeleines un volkswagon pulls up
milena waits smiling
after we got irka repatriated i had some calls from other private parties that were interested in helping
weve gathered so far
ive applied for matching funds so that
we can completely rebuild this shelter
separate from the gda
we run it our way
the victims come first
things are changing kathy
kathy is moved seeing a light at the end of this
the three women stand united
a shelter volunteer comes out
theres an important call inside
the call is for kathy
ivan puts a bag in a car trunk
he turns to
mara remember i can bring you back here the second you fuck up
he shakes her hand
ivan hands her a passport
she jumps into the car
its an odd farewell
ivan heads back to he scans the room
his eyes land on luba
raya watches ivan nod to luba
a silent exchange luba accepts maras role
outside a car speeds up
the two suits from last night appear at the door
without the girls
seeing local police in the distance
kathy pulls up
through gathered local cops reveal
julia and tanya
still in last nights clothing
julia and tanya are frantic talking fast
they take us home
they were so drunk
there are more girls
you must to get them out
they appeal to kathy
kathy eyes viko
as the girls talk at her kathy knows she was never going home
this is where she needs to be
kathy brings julia and tanya in
an intern leads them down the hall
viko comes in
should i call for a raid
we have no proof they were trafficked
let me talk to them
see what else they know
laura watches video footage on a tv
halyna appears on the monitor
her assistant pauses it
thats their first cut
ill pass on your notes and they should have it ready for the grant proposal in time
a knock at the door
kathy stands curt now with laura
i have no options right now
the gda is more secure than milenas shelter
can they stay before you do the paperwork
theyll go on record
laura shrugs in assent
kathy listens to a tearful julia
ivan is good friends with the soldiers
they come all the time
and youre saying these soldiers brought you into bosnia
through the border
in a van
they both nod
they had uniforms
the girls nod again
i never forget
the day i leave my home
we come to bosnia some day later
i know because we stop at the border
we were six of us
men from the border they opened the doors
we give them our fake passports
my name was irena woycek
i thought they would see the fake passports i thought
she hesitates the memories flooding back
i thought they would save us
viko follows kathy out
if there are records showing those girls came through the border with iptf then you have conspiracy to traffick
and i can take it to bill hynes
thats enough to do a raid that will stick
the main border station keeps the logs
kathy heads to her suv
viko shakes his head points at an old trabbant a life size matchbox car
the ride is bumpy
viko shouts over the engine
best if it looks like a local matter
get more info
you be my un monitor okay
kathy smiles cramped but appreciative of his help
viko talks to a border cop sitting at an ancient mac computer
kathy notices a calendar of pamela anderson frolicking in foamy surf
so when a vehicle is stopped youll keep all this on file here
its our fucking job
and other stations up the border send all their files to you
some do some dont
fifty fifty chance
viko lights a smoke offers one to the cop
you say minutes outside sarajevo
you might be lucky
lanky guy in their archives loves to send files
kathy looks hopefully at viko who shrugs
big exciting to watch bosnian police do boring things
he turns back clicking
you owe me
un vehicle with girls in back
he turns proudly to them
what you think
all his little sisters come to visit from america
viko looks knowingly at kathy
conspiracy to traffick
he slaps a key
the file prints out on an old daisy wheel printer
kathy scans the pages
kathy and viko hurry to the car
we arrest the buyer first
the bar owner
the border log corroborates the victims testimony
once hes in custody we raid his place and get those girls out
kathy jumps inside the car
the raid has to be small
no one knows the bar till were on our way
kathy waits nervous holding the border logs
the receptionist eyes her
he shouldnt be long now
bill on the edge of his desk
kathy paces frantic
thats why i came straight to you
they were brought across the border by our guys
i need two back up security vans for a raid with well trained our resources are tight
i have to prioritize holding the border logs this is real evidence
and thats just a drop in the ocean
i have hundreds of files
photos corroborated statements
we can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission bill shakes his head
if i could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future
these girls are collateral damage
whores of war
its nothing new
every conflict produces them
you know as well as i do those girls arent a product of the war
theyre a product of the peace
for the peace keepers
kathy is repulsed
bill takes a seat
this is your first mission
but we work in a very grey area and that can get messy
everybody wants the un to take the gloves off but they dont want us to get our hands dirty
its a fucking catch
so what do we do
we do our best and we always look at the bigger picture
youre a mother
i see what youre doing with these girls
maybe thats why youre thinking with your heart not your head
but you have a chance at a career in the international sector
ride this out
get a promotion
human rights in liberia afghanistan
i dont give a shit
and then when youre running the show you can implement whatever changes you see fit
but right now be smart and shut this bullshit down
the veil is lifted
kathy stands frozen
the blunt workings of the machine are laid bare
kathy leans on a balcony overlooking the main plaza at hq
she observes the sleek facade of honor and power
she straightens and walks away without looking back
a raid team suits up five local cops and three iptf officers
viko turns and hands kathy a helmet
to viko and other cops try and get him outside first then arrest him
once youve got him outta there well go in
i want the girls to know theyre safe
a police vans speeds down the road
two un vans follow
kathy focuses in the cabin filled with suited iptf officers
viko pulls up to the bar
the un suv skids into the shadows
viko and danik go inside
kathy glances back at her iptf officers as they pull their visors down and wait quiet wind in the trees music echoing from inside as
viko and danik emerge chatting with ivan
ivan jolts back cops grab him hes yelling handcuffed kicking
punching they push him into the van viko slams the door turns to the un van and nods
kathy looks back to the iptf officers raises three fingers
the police van squeals away as
they slam open the doors of the bar and rush into
bursting in the doors clients scatter rush to the exits girls turn from the bar the stage the seating area disoriented eyes darting
local police spread around the bar slamming pushing clients outside
kathy pulls off her helmet and scans the room
we have a warrant to search this premises
the owner of this bar ivan bladzic has been arrested and taken into custody for human trafficking
the girls look at one another
is this for real
the barman steps forward
he looks like hes had a few drinks
kathy eyes the girls
their confusion their fear
danik hesitates confronted with the vulnerability of these girls
his face softens
he looks to kathy for direction
you do not have to be afraid of ivan bladzic
he cannot hurt you now
but the girls dont move
kathy looks out stunned because she sees
no idea who to trust anymore
one last shred left of the dream of escape
kathy goes to her
but rayas eyes dart to
then to kathy recognizing the last kind face she saw
these girls work here
they have all documents passports
you can fuck off
two local cops grab him
danik cuffs him
the girls are astounded
viko holds up passports
the barman is dragged outside
kathy scans the girls
ending on raya
her faith awakening
we want to get you out of here safely
that is my absolute priority
the girls exchange a flurry of looks speaking volumes
should we trust her
can we risk it
to viko get those blankets out of the vans
lets get these girls out
but the girls still dont move
fractured with despair
after all she has been through all the punishment all the pain
raya holds lubas gaze maybe even she could be convinced
and raya starts to step to kathy
behind kathy an iptf officer removes his helmet
he stares at raya
kathy sees it in her whips around
mike sears avoids her gaze
kathy turns back to raya
moving closer quietly out of earshot of the others
you just have to tell me you want to go
that you do not work here voluntarily
and we will get you to safety
raya wants so badly to answer
you can leave with me this second
all of you can
but i need you to say it
raya eyes mike sears he looks to luba
luba turns back to raya pleading dont do it
you know me
raya cant look at kathy
tears stream down her face
you can all leave with me
to raya lets go
with her heart breaking
kathy looks at the all girls
their eyes flitting between mike and kathy
and she understands
kathy reels around
grabs mike by the collar shoving him to the door slamming him against the wall
who the fuck are you
what have you done
whats wrong with you
whats wrong with you
mike pushes back
get off me you crazy bitch
theyre supposed to trust us
viko and danik pull them apart
she steps back catching her breath shaking her head not again
she looks at raya tears streaming down her terrified face
i know this girl
i know her
we cant leave them here
were supposed to if they wont come we cant force them
nothing will hold up in court
theyll be returned and punished
do you want blood on your hands
the girls all return to their positions behind the bar cleaning sitting around the edges
not one will catch
she glares at mike sears
kathy watches across the room devastated
as raya turns giving up her last chance to leave and exits to a back room
kathy paces frantically in the darkness
viko comes out the door as it hits her like a blunt kick in the face sheer helplessness
she turns fuck diplomacy fuck bureaucracy fuck protocol and rushes back towards the bar
viko stops her grabs her
kathys eyes filling with tears she cannot cry her heart breaking
viko holds her tight and pulls her away
kathy sits in total silence her face white staring ahead
raya crouches in a corner stifling her sobs
halyna pours water into a kettle
in the living room a tv shows footage of the gda documentary the gda logo spins
footage of halyna on screen it took me very long time to realize there was name for this of trafficking
that there are big organizations like gda who work for against this crime all these years
we see footage of the gda office
the place is busy the staff members look sharp and efficient
close on laura madeleine watches the same footage
close on screen laura
with renewed funding support from usaid the global displacement agency continues to be the pioneering leader in international counter trafficking
milena sits by madeleine
both saddened realizing
and our matching funds go to the gda
shaking her head the state department money monster
ironic isnt it
that the very people whose money we need to fund a shelter to protect these girls are the exact people they need protecting from
she turns up the tv onto
halyna puts tea leaves in a strainer
listening to a tv in the adjoining living room
where footage of the gda plays
my husband tell me i will be gone one month
his friend arrange for me a job
but his friend bought me for two thousand dollars
halyna pours water through the strainer
my sister arrange for my papers
her boyfriend did this for other girls
halyna puts down the kettle
an academic speaks on tv
more often than not traffickers prey on those they know
banking on the fact that a girl will trust them
traffickers are fathers brothers sisters uncles and aunts
halynas face whitens
it hits her
halyna glares at zenia who heaves tears
i wanted to tell you halyna silences her with her hand
she walks around the apartment taking it all in
the money is in the details
an lcd tv dvd player
halynas hand traces over the things
its how you pay for this
roman he does
im halyna stiffens
an anger she thought impossible
she grabs a vase
she wants to throw it at zenia but at the last minute she throws it into a wall
zenia falls as the vase smashes
sell your own blood
where is she
i dont know
where is she
where is she
whe roman walks in
halyna lunges at him
he knocks her onto the ground
zenia crawls to her sister
roman steps between them
she is no longer your sister
stay away from me
stay away from her
halyna spits in his face
he smacks her
she lifts her hand to punch him but he grabs it and pushes her out the door
halyna bends over heaving
she runs at the door banging on it
a lunatics rage in halynas eyes
kathy holds the phone
her hands shake
mom whats wrong
i just needed to
i needed to say im sorry
im sorry if you ever felt i wasnt there for you but
i love you
kathy cant keep it in anymore
she lets go and cries it all out to the one person she wanted to be so strong for
kathy stares at her computer
she presses new message
we see the following addresses un chief of she continues typing
close on the subject line kathy pours her heart into the keyboard
as she types
i am a police officer obligated to report crimes
i have taken statements from women describing their physical psychological and emotional torture
the girls sleep
raya lies awake crying
on arriving in bosnia these women are sold and forced to provide sexual services
an iptf van stops
the window rolls down its mike sears
their clientele consists of sfor iptf local police and international employees
worse they have become involved in the trade itself
halyna sits at an empty table
her face gaunt from worry
it is time each and every one of you realize this is a serious organized crime with enormous profits
the oasis barman dumps a stack of dollars on the counter
fills out a form
ivan bladzic is released by a cop
you are peace keepers who came to protect the innocent but now prey upon them in the worst ways possible
lines of young girls
a buyer approaches one of them
she closes her eyes too tired to fight
it is time to face the truth of what is happening
we can right our wrongs and move forward ashamed but accountable and transparent
kathy finishes typing
we may be accused of thinking with our hearts instead of our heads but we will have our integrity
we pull back as she sits in front of the computer
nothing but the screen illuminating her face
the girls cant sleep
the door opens
luba comes in quickly closing the door behind her
she rushes to raya
hes coming back in the morning
convinced you will talk
the other girls rally around supportive
luba looks into her eyes suddenly melting
but i didnt say anything
i wont say anything
sobbing luba holds her tight
their friendship not buried after all
luba unlocks a window and gives her some money
hes gonna kill you
rayas eyes widen
she jumps out into the unknown
kathy buttons up her uniform
logging into her email
in the inbox email after email
all with the same subject blakely rick and john morgan s state department stands behind a fuming bill hynes
he throws down kathys email
what is this
an email i wrote
bill suppresses his anger
he holds out his hand
blakely hands him a document
bill places it before kathy
the actions i am taking are for your own benefit
we are seeking your repatriation back to the united states
stunned you cant im doing this for your own good
kathy eyes him her gaze shifting to morgan
right now we are still willing to pay your way home
you need to sign this to start your check out procedure
you will be out of this mission by sunday
without signing anything
through the window kathy paces nervous telling all
madeleine stands resolved
kathy nods skeptical
madeleine picks up the phone
madeline slams the door having burst in
squaring off with bill
bill keeps calm
im starting to get a fucking headache
all your people do is gender
it is a core function of the gender office
he looks over unimpressed
about the memo the email
it seriously concerned me
the level of recklessness she used speaks volumes toward her mental state
this is for her own good
you cant just fire her without cause
you need a reason that would stand up in court
shes burned out madeleine
she is not burned out shes being burned
you hired her
you keep her under control
youve always wanted to run this your way
but im not going to let anyone interfere with the way i run my mission
then start running it with some integrity
its your people perpetrating crimes against humanity
she goes to the door furious
but before she leaves
its coming from above my head
this is coming from washington
they want her out
something up her sleeve
kathy approaches the building
the american flags hang from the windows
but its quiet
kathy moves quickly
something moves behind a car flash of a man kathy picks up her pace eyes forward but
comes up behind her
kathy flinches as
he grabs her
she turns quick
like nothings wrong
franz takes apart kathys phone
a small device
kathy stares alarmed
franz looks around frantic
he rushes over
turns it on
on screen a cursor flashes
he points to the ceiling
kathy eyes the walls
lingering over each corner and crack
franz grabs the keyboard
kathy watches the screen
franz lays talcum powder under a un suv
franz house is small a bit messy
kathys on the phone
hes powdering my car
jan shakes his head horrified hes not there
the door handles too
check thoroughly to see if there are any prints before you get in that car tomorrow
kathy are you listening
still grasping whats happening
so you know how we talked about living together
it may be a bit sooner than we planned
she offers a nervous laugh
kathy maybe its time to come home
she hangs her head
a knock at the door
she puts down the phone
eyes on the door
reaching it kathy looks through the eyehole
she opens the door to
kathy listens anxious as madeleine lays it out
absolute and total
you have signed a contract with dyncorp aerospace operations u
and there is no provision under english law for summary dismissal without due process or an investigation
seeing kathy is overwhelmed
but there was something else bill said
if this is coming from above
kathy you need to prove that they are dismissing you because you were uncovering wide spread corruption within this mission
if you can prove that this is indeed coming from washington that the state department is instructing dyncorp to fire you
then were talking about a conspiracy
they tell me
they bug my house
i mean im sitting here worried theres a bomb in my car we can fight this
this isnt just my career its my life
i dont know if im ready to be a scapegoat
thats exactly what you are
she eyes madeleine pointed
madeleine sits back
i dont know what to say to that
think about this
let me know what you want to do
ill support you either way
an aerial glide over the mountains of bosnia
the girls sleep in their cots when
ivan kicks open the door
he throws raya in
on the ground
the girls wake
he picks raya up by the neck
luba runs in
i didnt say anything
i never will
why are you doing this
i just want to go home
i want to see
but he kicks raya in the stomach
she roars in pain
he flips her over
he looks to the other girls
this all happened because of you
he pulls out a gun
raya looks to luba for help
but its too late
ivan presses the gun to rayas head
he glares into rayas eyes
a flash of ire
raya reaches again
luba steps forward when
rayas body falls
luba turns away
she cups her hand over her mouth
but a loud cry wails through
the sound of lubas scream fades over the morning
the wide horizon is calm
but a closer look reveals
police cordon off a river bank
through an opening we see
keeping local cops at bay
behind him is
in civilian clothes
standing over a
kathy stares expressionless
viko clears the cops out
kathy turns and retches
she pulls air into lungs then straightens
she looks up to the trees the apex of this leafy cathedral as if invoking some higher power
kathy comes in
madeleine looks up from a phone call
what do i do
hand in an appeal
keep reporting to work
watch how they respond
build your case
and catch them in their lies
kathy holds an envelope
hynes secretary looks at kathy
muffled screaming from his office
kathy leaves the letter
i me and the other secretaries
your email was the bravest thing anyones even done in this mission
kathy nods truly appreciating that
she walks away her silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall
the secretary takes kathys letter
walking into bill paces around rick jones ambassador wells and john morgan
hynes grabs kathys letter
get something on her
carmen listens to an anxious kathy
if you could just go into my office ill give you a key to the cabinets
but carmen cant even meet kathys eye
my parents really need the money i send home
its a lifesaver for them
my dad has medical bills
im so sorry
kathy nods understanding but disappointed
she is alone
out of date and under stocked the store is as spruce as a little post war tlc could make it
kathy stands at a counter where a clerk puts down a chunky portable cassette recorder
you dont have anything smaller
she holds a tape recorder to the phone
yes this is kathy bolkovac and ambassador wells in ushered toward a un plane
into a phone i can hardly hear you
can you yell the plane engines are roaring
kathy cant hear him
she slams down the phone
staring at the recorder
rips open a cassette tape
she looks at her personage this isnt fitting anywhere
rain hits the windshield
the glass becomes blurry in the haze of water
kathy grabs a un windbreaker from the back
sticks the recorder in its pocket
kathy flashes her un id
the guard eyes her
passers by also
kathy walks down the hall
feeling it close in on her
turning a corner to
peter ward stands in front
he cant look her in the eye
kathy slips her hand into her pocket
then looks up
shes got it
ecu of tape wheels turning
kathy moves forward
coming closer she sees behind peter
peter hands kathy an envelope
she reads stunned
they are firing me for time sheet violations
you should go
im not going anywhere
not without an investigation
madeleine rees is hynes has sent a delegate to vienna to have madeleine rees removed
kathy is stopped short
state department auditors are here
asking for files on trafficking prostitution and time sheets
can you repeat that
he looks around nervous
look this is between you and me but dyncorp and the state department
you know its a dual thing and this is the action they have taken whether right or wrong
im being told to do this
so youre saying the state department is instructing dyncorp to fire me
and kathy has what she needs
can i just go in for one minute get my personal belongings
she eyes him
knowing who he is inside
but peter opens the door
kathy goes in closes the door behind her
rushing to the file cabinet takes out her keys to the bottom drawer kathy pushes back front files takes files out looking around she grabs a gym bag stuffs in
as many files as she can
she zips up the bag
looks at the door
takes out her tape recorder
huddles down behind her desk
but all she hears is fuzz
peter stands over her
eyeing the tape recorder
she looks at him waiting for his next move
his eyes soften
it probably wont work in most of the rooms
get out of here
she smiles silently thanking him
she shoves the recorder in her pocket
grabs the bag
thrown by its heaviness
peter helps her get it on her shoulder
he ushers her out
locking the door behind them
they move when rick jones barrels after them
waving kathys appeal
iptf officers come out of their office
kathy rushes into quickly looking around the metal paneling
she drops the bag
an echo reverberates through the hollow shaft
again slipping her hand in her pocket
this time determined
im gonna tell you this in front of him and everybody else you no longer have a un id
you no longer have a un job
you do not have a job with the department of state
the department of state holds your contract
they are the ones who are pulling it
you will not have an appeal
you will not have a hearing
you will not have anything
do you understand
kathy lets the doors close without saying a word
the lights are off
the office sits untouched
move over the bulletin board still overflowing with faces of girls
no sense of the noise to come
suspected un involvement in international sex trafficking
rumors of these allegations began surfacing after an email was sent describing
bill hynes talks to tim sebastian
i can categorically state that not one united nations officer has been involved in the trafficking of a single woman
are you saying that you believe all these victims claims to be false
i dont want to make accusations about those girls
but i will assert over and over again i run a zero tolerance program for that type of activity
kathy watches footage of bill hynes on bbc
she stares in disbelief
then picks up
the gym bag full of files
an iptf swat team bursts down the door of a bar
they move in waving flashlights over girls running in all directions
on a tv girls in silk robes
no sign of torture
they smile at their saviours
knights in bullet proof vests
the screen pauses
an editor turns to rick jones
any unused footage
use it all
i want the press flooded with epks
madeleine speaks to reporters
what do you say to rumors that dyncorp are working to have you removed
these raids are for show and completely amateurish
this is the biggest cover up i have ever seen
kathy moves through tourists browsing for jewelry
holding the gym bag tight
she turns a corner down a narrow
two people wide
keeping her eyes to the ground
weve had a un inspection by senior investigators from new york
weve had inspectors from the state department
john morgan leads state department auditors into the lobby
kathy turns into a pizza shop
flanked by american families
she walks knowingly
into a back patio
small and dark
a woman in the back
kathy sits across from joanna paul smith
eyeing her gym bag
ive been working at human rights watch for fifteen years
weve been keeping close tabs on this
no one has come forward with anything solid before
i have everything you need
when i arrive in amsterdam safely i will go on record
joanna nods a glimmer of admiration
kathy stands shakes her hand and leaves
disappearing into the crowd
kathy drives alone
checking the rearview mirror
a car pulls up behind her
its bright light blinds kathy
the car closes in on her
she winces but
the car passes
its just kathy on the road
the gym bag on the seat beside her
the culmination of everything shes been fighting for
her red tail lights disappear into a dark mountain tunnel
fade up on reporters snap pictures of kathy
expecting a verdict today
two years ago ms
bolkovac took her case against her employer dyncorp to an industrial tribunal in southampton because the company is governed by uk employment law
a three judge panel in a hearing room
kathy and karen bailey her lawyer
across from them a team of dyncorp defense attorneys
rick jones in the seating area
luba walks through a crowd
she stops at a fountain and looks around nervous
then she spots
ivan let you go
this is what you do now
luba nods understanding
karen squeezes kathys hand
kathy looks to the back of the courtroom
erin smiles at kathy
judge swiss holds up kathys tape recorder
the judge reads from a verdict
karens face lights up
jan breathes relieved
mara and luba sit across from a young girl
the girl excitedly flips through a swiss hotel brochure
you both worked here
mara looks at luba a do or die look in her eye
hiding her shame she gathers her strength for this lie
it will change your life
flashbulbs pop as kathy stands
pleased but not elated
the dyncorp team files out
as the judges stand one of them eyes kathy
and they connect
as only true lawmen do
but in this moment the judge kathy and us
we all know
she never wanted to win
she just wanted to do her job
the sixty story high statue of mother ukraine guards kyiv
a priest delivers a sermon
his eyes on halyna
she sits holding a picture of raya
a sprinkling of mourners near her
worshippers kneel and pray
the member countries flags crack in the wind
white un vehicles are parked outside
the united nations stands watch
we end this film with footage of the real kathryn bolkovac in her bbc hardtalk interview with tim sebastian
we talked to bill hynes who was the senior un official in bosnia at the time we talked to him a year ago on this program about some of your
he said they werent true at all
he said weve had senior officials from new york weve had investigations from the state department
i can now categorically say that not a single un official was involved in trafficking
i think that mr
hynes knows this is a false statement
so youre accusing him of lying
that not a single word he said is true
i watched that
kathy sits calm
would you do it again
yes i would
no doubt about it
i would definitely do it again
im not the type of person who would
as a law enforcement officer i am held to a higher standard
