written by john glenn travis wright based on the movie clash of the titans written by beverly cross may gloomy last light
from out of the shadows comes a dog
a dog of war
big mangy muscular scary
as he moves down the alley the way becomes increasingly choked with fallen structures
and signs of tumult
tracking with the dog as he comes onto a battlefield
the hellish scene is revealed to us slowly as the dog traverses a landscape of bodies frozen in contorted death poses
this was furious hand to hand fighting between human soldiers and nightmare creatures their corpses now in piles to the horizon
the dog climbs a mound of casualties
at the top the dog looks back across the battlefield
the dogs eyes are sad his expression weary and disgusted
the entrance is patrolled by a dozen palace guards
they dont see the dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace wall and disappear inside
bloodied and battered the kings generals are disagreeing loudly about strategy
a loud banging sound pierces the hubbub and the officers quiet turning to king acrisius a striking man in his prime his handsome face marked by one crooked scar on
he commands the room now we end the debate about tactics
and begin to plan for victory
the dog stares at the king
then slips away
unseen by exhausted guards the dog bounds up the stairs
the dog approaches a doorway stops to watch from the shadows
in the dim bedchamber the silhouette of queen danae as a lady in waiting removes her gown revealing the queens perfect body as she slips into bed
the lady in waiting leaves
the dogs eyes
he moves forward
tracking with the dogs legs as they morph into human legs
the camera rises behind a towering male figure who roughly pulls a curtain aside
in the bed the queen is startled then pleased
has the strategy been set so quickly
the looming figure looks exactly like king acrisius including the distinctive scar
he regards her hungrily
come to your queen my king
the real king acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with aides and guards
suddenly the king stops
on the wall above is the huge shadow of a four legged creature and now it appears the dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the men
without fear its eyes blaze with a gods power
even acrisius who fears nothing steps back
the others raise their weapons
the dog comes down the steps eyes upon them and passes close by
no one dare move
the dog disappears into the shadows below
staring at queen danae pregnant now and weeping
her arms are bound
a royal entourage is gathered
the women weep the men agonize
palace guards lift the queen into a chest and chain it closed
on the kings signal the guards carry the chest to the edge and drop it into the rough sea
we hear a scream from within
some members of the royal entourage look with scorn at their king outraged by this double murder
acrisius registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to leave the promontory
we see in his face what the others do not shame and doubt
in the water below the chest rights itself and rides out on the tide
two horsemen gallop in the moonlight
the first rider sways in the saddle and falls from his mount
he staggers to his feet a skin of ale in his hands
it is king acrisius very drunk
the second rider the kings steward dismounts to give aid though hes also drunk
my own subjects condemn me
they dare judge me
and what emboldens this treachery
you are mistaken my king
none would risk your anger oblivious to him it is zeus who warps my kinadom
zeus the ungodly zeus the defiler
this talk sobers the steward instantly he looks about fearlessly
please speak not these things acrisius spins on him out of control he cuckolds me in my castle rapes my precious queen
this is a low conniving god
but i have bested him on this day and humbled the great prime
tell me panos who rivals zeus on olympos
who does the fearless one fear
i beg you your highness acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the stewards throat
tell me what the priests say
terrified halting tiamat
tiamat queen of the deep
those who dare whisper she covets zeus throne and schemes to achieve it the ambitious goddess of the dark oceans
and today i have honored her
the king whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune
ive taken zeus whore and the bastard she grows in her belly and thrown them to tiamat in her rough sea
toward the moonlit i honor zeus rival with all that was dear to me falters ashamed and commit double murder in her honor
about to go to pieces rage seizes him again so that zeus will know i despise and disdain him and spit on his foul name
the steward shrinks from this blasphemy eyes darting in fear
on the crest the king is silhouetted in the moonlight arms raised defiantly toward the heavens when suddenly his figure is seized by some violent force shaking his being
a horrible sound muscle tears bones crack and the kings body grows larger as it distorts in and thus king acrisius becomes
the steward sees what we now cannot
an inhuman roar and the shadow of this new being falls upon the steward
he screams but its too late the huge creature grabs him by the neck and lifts him out of frame
from the empty moonlit dunes we
queen danaes coffin chest tossing in the rough water
through the roar of the waves we hear a baby cry
a little boy leads a blind old man along a road
abruptly the old man halts
puzzled the boy scans ahead sees a spray of dust moving fast behind a blurred black in an instant the apparition blows past them wind and dust whip at them
in awe and fear thoth the quick
sensing the boys messenger of the gods
bound for olympos
the rushing black form crosses a field leaving a violent wave in the long grass and suddenly we are in that rushing pov the landscape is just a blur
but up ahead is a mountain olympos
we zoom up to the summit into the clouds above the peak
through the mist villas classical facades the abode of the gods
the polished stone of the grandest villa reflects thoths dark form touching down
thoth the quick enters the wide courtyard his cape billowing
he strides past the reflecting pool in the center of the courtyard gravely acknowledging each of the ten figures seated around the perimeter
apollo is here and bronze helmeted athena aphrodite and muscular vulcan we are dazzled and lose count
thoth bows deeply before the throne of zeus majestic bearded awe inspiring
an eagle is perched on his arm
rumbles like we have debated we have voted and it is decided
we offer the humans peace
thoth you will take them the terms of a treaty a treaty
zeus and his eagle turn their heads
the gods eyes are familiar the blazing orbs we saw in the dog
in the shadowed corner of the atrium stand two more olympians set the void whose countenance is death made visible and tiamat queen of the deep the only god fearless
enough to challenge zeus rule we dont negotiate with them
we dictate to them
their place is to beg
they have forgotten their role and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers
our mercy will give them reason to be grateful
they will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before
they will bow down when we snap their backs
we are gods
some of us remember that and are not afraid zeus has had enough furious arcs of lightning jump to the walls the eagle beats its wings in rage
or learn what it is to be afraid
the debate is over the votes cast
zeus points to a golden tray it bears ten chips of alabaster versus two shards of obsidian
we guarantee an armistice we shield the bridegroom and the joppan royal family
turning again on and we do not interfere in their actions
we leave them undisturbed unless invoked by name to enter their affairs
and if they refuse our terms
they have suffered terrible losses
they will not pass up a chance for peace
only tiamat and set now
tiamat regards zeus throne
this is your rightful place to take
soon enough set
zeus has grown weaker than i knew
set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the two black shards representing their votes
he hands one to tiamat
so have they all
they no longer see clearly
theyre beginning to think like men
but you and i shall not
set agrees his eyes searching her face
we will manage these thick witted humans to our own ends
off his look yes we will be bound by great zeus rules
until their fragile membranes tear
we dare not interfere with these insects
but we may be invited to intervene
tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool the whole pool darkens and choppy waves crash over the sides
a tiny tempest
the long war with the gods has wounded this city but life goes stubbornly on
among the war torn buildings is a bustling market
citizens eye the wares
merchants performers noise and music
suddenly the market falls silent
fear grips the crowd
an occurrence rare in the world of men an olympian the clouds stop dead
the crowd stops
a presence we do not see moves to the basilica the royal residence and assembly hall
king kepheus the aging worried ruler sits on his throne then stands paces sits again
flitting nearby is his queen cassiopeia a fading beauty fiercely intelligent but not wise she can be impulsive and vain
amoun stands calmly by he is special advisor or magi strategos to the king and will be central to our story
the emissary approaches
take your time in your responses debate nothing
ive received ambassadors before
none like this
im not cowed
if these arrogant gods are so powerful why are they the ones seeking a truce
i only recommend you take care with the tone of the conversation
a truce would benefit all
in my palace i decide how the discourse proceeds not some messenger sent on errands by zeus
you are correct your highness i do the bidding of zeus
to their astonishment the emissary is already in the throne room behind them
startled they turn to see thoth the quick messenger of the gods float forward
as do all gods
and all men
thoth removes his hood revealing his crystal skull
with an edge king kepheus as humble messenger of zeus ive come to talk of peace
thoth the quick i am amoun the kings magi strategos
we welcome you with humility honored by your visit from the realm of the gods
the king shoots amoun a look but he is still shaken by thoths sudden appearance
cassiopeia tries to recover her composure
i am a reasonable man
everyone wishes for the conflict to cease
zeus above all
he has so long desired the tragedy end he made a plan that began twenty five years ago
twenty five years
how is that possible
amoun winces at her tone
thoth sends a scary glance her way
icy beauteous queen let thoth limn for you the forethought and wisdom of zeus god of gods
the market now quiet tries to return to normalcy
but the crowd watches the basilica worried by the gods presence
kepheus and cassiopeia sit stunned
amoun watches without surprise
a treaty marriage
you have a daughter of age
surely zeus does not ask a mortal father to give his daughter to a god
such a union would be unclean
years ago zeus created a scion of mixed blood
half man half god
bred for just this union
that is how important zeus considers this truce
is my only daughter to marry a demigod not of this earth
a prince of both olympian and human royalty
a chosen one
zeus has given his son to the cause of peace
i have heard of no such demigod
majesty if i may the young man does exist
he lives in a small fishing village on the isle of seriphos
kepheus turns surprised at amouns foreknowledge
you knew about this and said nothing
just which king do you serve
my queen i serve only the great order of things
i was the boys tutor years ago
how haughty this boy must be who knows he is half god
he knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man
he has never left his village
he can be overconfident but it is from inexperience not arrogance
repheus and cassiopeia exchange wary looks
sharply what assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe
you have my word as ambassador of the gods
with our daughters future at stake we do not bestow trust easily
if any harm should come to her
amoun reacts but it is too late thoth has been suddenly the walls groan compressing with an awful shudder
the room tilts
kepheus and the queen grab for a solid handhold frightened
the golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and pile up in defiance of gravity
wine goblets tilt toward thoth
the princessa shall not be harmed
urgently to the your majesty
of course your word is unquestioned here
thoths demeanor changes
the marbles spill off the table rolling across the floor to kepheus feet
tilt up to his intimidated face where is the lucky young suitor
perfectly blue sunlight shafting from the surface
a great white shark appears ensnared in a fishermans net
panicked the shark is diving as fast as it can
as the net passes we see anteros a hapless young fisherman his legs entangled in the net desperately trying to hold his breath
when they have disappeared we see a figure appear through the blue in pursuit
as he passes we get our first look perseus wiry bronzed from the sun a stubbled jaw a knife in his teeth
he swims with the power and grace of a porpoise beyond the ability of any normal man
the shark thrashes about jaws snapping close to anteros
perseus swims into view and uses his knife to cut the net near the sharks snout
the shark tries to swim through the hole but instead drags the net upwards
perseus hangs on
one more slice and the shark zooms out of the net bumping the young hero as it swims away
perseus pulls anteros toward the surface
a crew of fishermen wait desperately at the rail
spyros the oldest and toughest watches in agony
perseus breaks the surface gasping his lifeless friend in his arms
five crewmen dive in to help but perseus is mad with despair
they have to pull him away
spyros watches sadly
but also relieved to see the one survivor
spyros makes his way to the bow where perseus sits alone downcast in pain
spyros watches in silence
then gruffly your grieving does anteros no good
it comforts only you
its my fault hes gone
he was careless with the net
perseus gives him a hard look
so its his fault
not mine not fate not the gods
the gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy while we act
we make our own history
breaks down crying now my history is i let my friend die in my arms
i made it back why couldnt he
what you do no other man can do
have you not noticed
to what purpose
i failed him
looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the superstition of the gods as surely as your friend was caught in that net
and all the searching leads down to the same place
the trawler is approaching its home island seriphos
perseus looks off at the rocky coast
collects himself you always say that my abilities are greater than other mens
but they were not enough to save him
you are still a man confined by mans limits
you are just as likely to fail as succeed
how is that greater than other men
ordinary men fail most of the time
the trawler rounds a point on the island
perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff
a closer a huntress a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe figure
flowers in her golden hair wilted dahlias
young yet ancient
the wilting girl
she watches perseus intently as the boat passes
he turns to see if spyros or his friends have seen her but no one has
when he looks back shes gone
perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his friend
tekla perseus adoptive sister runs up from the modest stone dwelling
she sees his mood and touches his arm gently
mother wants you to come in for supper
as he is perseus why are you so sad
this breaks his spell
he looks at tekla warmly gets up and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they head inside
perseus eats with his adoptive family spyros his wife marmara and tekla
spyros is patient and twinkly with his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs
i still dont understand
your mother can explain
she believes everything has an explanation even if we have to make it up
its one of the reasons i love you marmara
why is there war between man and the gods
marmara and tekla continue to bring out the food
at the beginning of time when man was young he prayed to the gods
his belief in the gods gave his life meaning
it was a good thing
if you consider superstition fear and darkness good things
but man grew as children do and he turned away from the gods
be began to put his faith in other things
perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes
those things that give man dignity and independence
but what of the gods who had protected and guided us so long
they must breathe our prayers to survive
they hunger for as lions hunger for blood
your fathers mind is closed on these matters
the gods were desperate to claim our awe again
yes even the gods
if they could not earn our faith with love they would demand it with fear
whatever was necessary to ensure l their continued existence
marmara and the wide eyed tekla sit down
and that is how war broke out between man and gods
turning to serve now eat your dinner which the gods and your father have provided
middle of the night
perseus lies wide awake in his tiny space
he stares thinking about his friend
suddenly a knock at the door
perseus opens the door to the wilting girl
her beauty electrifies him
she glows from within but her color is oddly faded washed out
i saw you watching our boat at the cliff
it was not the boat i was watching
can i be of service
yes of service
i need you to come with me on a journey
perseus gives her a look
as she nods it wouldnt take much persuading to get me to leave this village but tonight is impossible
my family cant wake and find me gone
where do you want me to go
its not what i want
i am in the service of others
perseus cant get over her beauty the dulcet sound of her voice
even so come back in the morning and we can talk about it
perseus doesnt notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet
then a centipede a scorpion
then a swarm racing toward him
he feels the first spider and looks down
the creatures climb his legs biting
weakening from the venom he stumbles back into the table loses his balance and falls
the wilting girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him
he blacks out
a white sail swollen with wind draws the small boat swiftly across the sea
the wilting girl alone sits quietly at the stern effortlessly steering
we see that she is also watching perseus who is sleeping in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat
her eyes slowly travel over his bronzed muscled frame
there are bite marks on his legs and arms but they seem to be healing as we look at them
perseus stirs and wakes squinting up at the wilting girl
how long have i been out
only a few hours
the time before almost a day
how was your rest
i had a dream
i fell into a dark pit
i thought i would never stop falling
but a beam of light formed a soft net caught me and tossed me back
thewilting girl watches him
when i came back up to the world a beautiful woman appeared and spoke to me
but as she spoke she would sometimes disappear into the whiteness with a strange sound
the wilting girl listens to his story
when i could hear her she spoke nonsense
she said that my father was a god and my mother a at that moment the blinding white sail swings between them as she tacks obscuring his view of her
for a moment
the wind makes a loud snapping sound in the cloth
then she reappears the sail on her other side
as he realizes she is his vision
you are special perseus
your birth was ordained for this very purpose
i am an ordinary man
do you ever lie awake during a storm and listen to the thunder
and it sounds as though it matches the beating of your heart
he doesnt have to answer its written on his face
how long can you hold your breath
longer than the others
are there times when you know you should feel pain but you dont
none of that means anything
look at your arms perseus
perseus watches the bites on his arm heal visibly
a good trick
you must be the demigod not me
im a chthonian
an earth goddess
the gods have a caste system just as men do
the olympians are our nobility few but cosmic
the chthonians are the peasants
our abode is this earth and we exist as long as men worship us
and when none worship you
sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes
we fade away
this touches perseus deeply
his tone changes
and demigods where do they stand in your hierarchy
if demigods rank so low why do you need me
for a marriage
zeus god of gods has proposed a treaty to end the war
at the center is the marriage of a mortal with a demigod
zeus himself has chosen you
a demigod may be less than a god but hes more than a man
one foot in humanity the other in divinity
your marriage will be a symbol of accord between our races
such a union could save millions of souls
perseus is struck by that
he looks off across the sea
and just who exactly am i supposed to marry
closeup a hot embrace
in the blur of movement our first good look is at the girl a beauty princessa the boy is agenor a kitchen helper ripped and sexy
its hard to tell whos the aggressor here
gasping andromeda holds him at bay
do you think you can manhandle a princess this way
as he kisses her as though she was hungry and needy as you a mere servant
another steamy kiss
in between liplocks she whispers very mistaken
a woman of my station
never be attracted
they go at it again
a nimble girl hurries past servants hanging laundry in the atrium
shes peshet handmaid to princessa andromeda
she has a feline quality eyes grace agility
she raps on the scullery door
muffled from inside the princess is not here
the queen approaches
i dont care
youll care enough if youre caught
remember last time
from inside we hear complaining more kissing and moaning
startled peshet spins to see the queen approach
where is the princess
andromeda freezes at her mothers voice stops agenor finger to her lips
he ignores her starts again
andromeda does something below the frame that jolts him off
the girl can take care of herself
peshet faces the queen
is she not in her chambers maam
she is not
you are expected to know her a squeal and whispering from the closet stops cassiopeia
she throws a perturbed glance at the door
peshet looks guilty
tell the princess should you find her her father and i want to see her at once
she stalks away
urgently through the door princess its the king as well
a lavish room
cassiopeia and kepheus sit in golden chairs looking off
andromeda enters frame furious
with conviction to please you i would submit to such a marriage
except i would rather die please let me know youre serious about this perverse plan so i can make arrangements to kill myself
she stomps out
their gaze follows until shes gone
it will take more than half a god to handle her
shell be a great ruler one day
perseus cant take his eyes off the wilting girl who steers
she tries not to be self conscious she would blush were she not so pale
youre looking in the wrong direction
i dont think so
perhaps you should give some thought to your immediate future
laughs flirtatious thats what im doing
maybe you should take another look
she indicates the view behind him
perseus turns jaw dropping
a breathtaking view of joppa a city in two parts
at sea level tangled hovels boats and docks crowd the working class area the lower wharf
above twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the acropolis with its gleaming villas temples statues and colonnaded towers hugging the precipice
the wilting girl leads perseus through the city
hes never seen anything like it
he rubbernecks awestruck as he passes a blacksmith who takes a dragon skin from the coals and fashions armor by pounding the white hot scales over a mold
all the goods armies and culture of mans dominion flow through this port
he who reigns in joppa rules the world
amidst the exotic chaos perseus is struck by the homeless refugees on the street and the ruins of once proud buildings
the war has badly scarred this place
it is the war you have the power to end
he throws her an angry look grim
dont joke about such things
id be useless before such a huge responsibility
perhaps you would be
as you are now
they pass an evangelist fantasos haranguing a crowd
one true god is not zeus but she called the deep tiamat
quoting from his before the first dawn the eyes of the deep watched the earth
to the crowd bow down to the goddess of chaos or know despair for tiamat will rule the heavens and the earth
perseus is mystified by this talk
he turns to vidalia for explanation but she seems disturbed by the preacher l and does not return perseus gaze
perseus and vidalia round a corner and see the regal basilica
workmen hang banners and decorations preparing for a big event
what are they celebrating
cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor
we follow to find kepheus speaking sternly to perseus before him
before i am a king or a peacemaker i am a father
do you know what that means
im not sure your highness
i did not know my father
it means i had no desire for my little girls carefree springtime to be cut to cassiopeia what is she
im sure shes preparing herself to make the best possible impression
perseus suppresses a smile amused by the royal couple
kepheus paces with mounting impatience
and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict
of which she knows nothing at all
shes not the only one sir
i dont know much about the events for which ive been drafted
disarmed but tough i take no comfort in that young man
in fact i find little to take comfort in here
you are a stranger from a distant place and i am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you
if you are not kind and patient with her if any harm of any kind should come her way i will have your head on a stake
kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on perseus face
he puts his hand on the hilt of his sword
is this amusing to you
not even a little my lord
its just that i myself was waylaid snatched also as you say from my happy springtime
kepheus studies him to see if hes making jest of him
ive been told im to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose
of which im not at all convinced
does a truce in the war between men and gods not strike you as a higher purpose
with all respect i have never seen a god
on my island theyre no more than a story
you will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island
this is supposed to be the son of a god yet he doubts their existence
they exist young man
but if you doubt their power i join you cassiopeia
we have agreed such talk has no place in this palace
i can only proceed based on what i have experienced not on a faith i do not possess
where does a young person get such ideas
perhaps from my adopted father sir
i admire him greatly and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand
is he a scholar
no your highness a fisherman
i know this mentor who so influences young perseus
amoun has silently entered the chamber
perseus reacts in amazement
he hurries over to the older man who embraces him warmly
youve grown tall and strong since my departure
perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds amoun at arms length
what are you doing here
i am honored to serve the king as an advisor
his magi strategos
from my village tutor to magi strategos
what a path
the kings patience is exhausted
to cassiopeia where is andromeda
at the least the two should meet before tomorrows ceremony
is the wedding so soon
the wedding comes later
tomorrow we will have the public announcement
and a celebration of the treaty
a page enters and whispers in kepheus ear
kepheus is irritated
it seems our andromeda has wandered away
cassiopeia reacts upset
perhaps the thought of her new life has made her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one
perseus if youre to take the wild girl for a wife this is a good time to start your training
go into the city and retrieve her
how will i know her
she is unmistakable
im a stranger here
follow the lights and the sound of profane music
the wilting girl slips into the dusk like a thief
the wilting girl steals down the dark narrow alley headed toward the outskirts of town
suddenly a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones blocking her way
she startles but does not stop
she goes up to the wall turns at an angle and slides right through the stone like a ghost
on the other side she emerges from the stone breathing hard
she looks around and hurries down an intersecting passageway
shes gone only a few steps when just ahead of her thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier
she takes a breath and dives into the surging growth
she almost makes it through but at the last moment vines wrap her arms and legs holding her prisoner
she gives up with a sigh
we hear the laughter of a god
zeus rumbling voice is held low talking to her in an intimate way a beautiful sound
why do we have to play these games my lovely girl
you know you cannot leave
the vines retract freeing her
she rubs where they gripped her
my part is finished
it has just begun
have you forgotten your place in this
as ive lost my believers the future has become dimmer to me
i still believe in you
close your eyes and see your tomorrow
she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath
a single tear runs along her cheek
she opens her eyes
its too painful
i cant involve myself
you you already involved
such is fate
we cannot hide from the trials of our future
no matter how dark the alleyway
she looks back at the basilica with profound sadness
perseus roams taking in the city with interest
rich and poor mix in the crowded streets
as always the poor have suffered the most from the conflict
perseus follows the music and the sound of laughter to a crowded terrace overlooking the sea
upper class young people are partying en masse
perseus moves through the revelry looking at every girl testing his instincts
suddenly he stops in his tracks looking off
andromeda is dancing at the center of attention her sheer gown enhancing her sensuality
the music ends
andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane
a handsome young nobleman embraces her
she gives him a deep kiss causing a sensation then breaks away into the crush
andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset
the young nobleman approaches but her imperious gesture stops him cold
andromeda spins petulant
will you please give me some the sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause
what did you say
i said very beautiful
do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family
i meant the sunset
she regards perseus over her glistening bare shoulder
do you always start a seduction with an insult
perseus moves to the rail very close to her and looks at the sea
i know nothing of seduction
im a simple fisherman
my home is across that water
what brings you here
i was kidnapped
i mean here tonight
he looks over at her a long moment
ive come to see my future wife
startled andromeda suddenly realizes who he is
a mad mix of emotions crosses her face
perseus and andromeda walk in moonlit gardens
she stays close attracted to him
its not personal
youre not a bad looking boy
as perseus laughs im too young
i dont want to be married
then why are you doing it
no one asked me
and now that ive met you i dont know if i can go through with it
off her look its not personal
seeing you makes it real
i think a man should make his own decisions
i wont be the pawn of a king or a god
she looks at him with new interest
since we agree its settled
i dont think its going to be that simple
ignoring that she takes his arm moving even closer
that doesnt mean we cant be friends
get to know each other
i want to show you something
she leads him into a tall hedged garden maze
beautiful in the moonlight
she hurries him quickly around one turn then another and another
he laughs at her excitement
im already lost
ill take care of you
they take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber
soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed
this is my special place
no one can see or hear or even find us now
looks around the i dont suppose i could escape without your aid
do you want to
when he turns back to her she melts into his arms and gives him a long deep kiss
hes surprised but handles it well
when she tries to continue he slows things down holding her at bay
do you not find me attractive
one of the most beautiful women ive ever seen
of course you havent been much in the world
maybe a lot of girls look like you
dont you want to make love to your almost wife
maybe well find were not compatible
what if we find were very compat she stops him with another kiss
he starts to surrender to his desire but again he stops
her voice is a low is it true youre a demigod
makes a face it seems what everyone wants to believe
her face is inches from his
she looks into his eyes
i dont see it
as perseus laughs but lets find out for sure
she kisses him yet again pulling him toward the bed of foliage
he can no longer resist
together they fall into the softness
he kisses her passionately as their bodies begin to move together
she breaks the kiss for only a moment her voice husky i think im becoming a believer
they start to make love
speeding over moonlit ocean toward a dark castle on a cliff
we begin to hear the voices of tiamat and set
tiamat i know this place but i know not why
the chamber deserted for years is in decay dead vermin everywhere
in this chamber zeus defiled the queen danae and begat the anointed demigod who would facilitate this foul truce
pov descending the great stairs
the skeletons of dead guards and soldiers litter the stairs
ah the former palace of the cursed acrisius
the king who stood against zeus and was crushed for it though he was not the offender
but this is not his former home
moving pov across the stones of the hall where we first saw king acrisius and his generals
now only bones and rotting things
still he dwells in rancid hate having killed his generals and sucked their bones
we cannot break the rules of zeus and interfere with the humans
but this poor creature can do our work and visit the would be groom
what form of monster do you visit upon perseus
there is an awful sound from the darkness of an archway
what form dear set
in the half light appears the huge deformed changeling to the monster my servant your lonely solitude now ends
its time to leave
perseus wakes on the bed of foliage looks around
andromeda is gone
he thinks smiles
then he remembers his situation
the smile fades
perseus in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor moves through the crowd of revelers
the grandiose room is hemmed by columns and statues
the royal family sits on the dais
andromeda motions perseus up beside her
i didnt know how to get this outfit on
i want to thank you for seeing me home
i was so flushed with wine i cant recall much of the evening
perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd
watches from the back of the hall
when they make eye contact she quickly looks away
perseus is surprised by his feelings
andromeda has seen her too
he has a guilty moment and averts his eyes
at what point do you plan to tell them were not getting married
a sweeping gesture them
we see the ecstatic crowd of thousands all celebrating the union
music stops and the crowd begins to settle
the queen will speak
the room quiets as cassiopeia moves front and center of the dais with a cup of wine not her first
i wont be long winded
you all know i am a modest person no matter my rank
some of the crowd react silently
andromeda watches her mother with trepidation but not as much as kepheus watching from his throne
this is not a celebration of a betrothal
as kepheus is on not the celebration of the happiness of two parents or of our good people
mild confusion in the hall concern from the royal entourage
this union represents new hope for a lasting peace
that is the only cause for celebration
the crowd reacts with exclamations and applause
amoun wills her to stop
cassiopeia takes another drink looks over at the princess
my sweet andromeda
grown into a fine young woman confident and sure
look at her
isnt she beautiful
her subjects agree loudly
andromeda wishes this would end
cassiopeia raises her glass
to my beautiful daughter
more beautiful than all the women of joppa
more beautiful than the gardens of nineveh
kepheus is about to pull her away
she throws him a spiteful glance
more beautiful than the turquoise ocean and its sublime goddess of the deep
my daughter is a beauty even a goddess must envy
amoun reacts in dismay
a distressed murmur roils the crowd
andromeda goes to her mother
ive gone on too long she stops with a look of sudden dread
the great hall darkens
the torch flames turn black
the temperature drops
the statues lining the hall shut their eyes and the doors burst open
tiamat queen of the deep floats forward parting the terrified celebrants
perseus sees his first olympian
tiamat arrives at the dais
cassiopeia drops to her knees
you have blasphemed powers beyond understanding
you a stupid braying goat before the unfathomable galaxies
you dare put this frivolous scrawny slut
above the infinite goddess of the deep
tiamat tears off her cloak and stands naked
her body made from the elements of the sea is magnificent sexy and terrifying
fantasos the priest who proselytizes for tiamat in the streets is in the throng
his reaction is a mix of religious ecstasy and outright lust
the celebrants shield their eyes but cassiopeia cant
she crumples aging before our eyes
every word shakes her frame look upon the sublime and know your error
youll not blink
tell me now mortal how bright your preening urchin shines
no one dare look long at the goddess
no one but perseus
tiamat notices perseus
and his boldness
people of joppa hear me
for the sacrilege of this arrogant creature i will loose leviathan upon you
the people react in terror
cassiopeia starts to faint but tiamat snaps her back to consciousness im not finished
hold your gaze
to the people for thirty days joppa shall suffer the scorn of leviathan
and on the final day you will be wiped from the earth
as the crowd quakes unless
unless you sacrifice that body so impertinently compared to this your beloved worthless princessa
this is my will joppa
desolation or sacrifice
choose your penance
you can thank your
looks at cassiopeia sickly aged queen
clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow tiamat then implode
tiamat is gone
cassiopeia palsied and withered collapses
kepheus and royal aides rush to her
an immense school of fish is suddenly spooked
an eerie glow swells in the gloom tiamat glides toward us stops and raises her palm
the silt swirls and ripples
a vast primordial shape slowly rises in clouds of ocean mud
its impossible to see what this creature looks like but it is big
we hear a deafening roar which drives a shockwave across the silt
the sea bulges and a tsunami rolls toward the shores of joppa
dark docks and shanties under the cliffs populace asleep
a lone fisherman unloads nets from his boat
suddenly the water under his boat is sucked out to sea
a deep rumble shakes the ground
the fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon climbs higher and higher a wall of water
in seconds the colossal wave breaks and falls obliterating the boat the docks and the low lying shanties
cassiopeia lies blank and wan
a low drone grows
kepheus rushes to the window
and then a deep earth shattering bellow from the creature
the room shudders
a figure passes by a window in silhouette andromeda steals through the shadows toward the throne room
andromeda edges into position to see the room below
leviathan first dweller of the deep
hewn by tiamat from the dark blood of the earth
a council of viceroys and ministers gathered before kepheus who seems lost in thought head down
perseus stands off to the side
amoun reads from a scroll
all monsters of the sea are but shadows of leviathan the kraken colossal rapacious and nigh indestructible
the men turn to kepheus when he raises his face he looks exhausted
my queen lies near death
am i now to choose between the survival of our state
and the life of andromeda my only child
amoun watches perseus at the fringe of the group expectantly
but perseus looks only perplexed an observer
i beg you do not even consider such a sacrifice do you tell me only what you think i wish to hear
the citizens of joppa are fighting for their lives
would you have me gamble the city to save one girl
again amoun looks to perseus
you need make no such choice your highness
be saved and the city too
we need only the will to do it
you spoke the words the monster is indestructible
how can that be
amoun alone takes notice he spins toward perseus with relief
you had something you wanted to say to the king
all eyes turn to perseus who shrinks before them self conscious
no master amoun
were talking about the precious life of your betrothed
perseus meets his gaze confused
im a newcomer here
i would not presume to tell these men
a newcomer with a fresh perspective
share your thoughts with the king your future father in law
the ministers are puzzled by amouns persistence
perseus uncertainly i know that i am young and have not seen much of the world but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible
the ministers react to the young mans arrogance
i am far from young and have seen much of the world
and i agree with my son
everyone turns to the new arrival perseus adoptive father spyros
perseus goes to embrace him
father how did you find me
i thought this boys father was a god
how does a stranger walk unmolested into the throne room of the king
i sent for him lord
this good man raised perseus from infancy
he will help him now
help him with what
with whatever is needed
perseus approaches the king
surprising himself he will help me destroy leviathan
spyros does a double take then swallows yeah okay sure
andromeda reacts falling in love with perseus
perseus has no idea
majesty we can seek the counsel of the norn sisters of skolothia
they know the hidden ways of the gods
if leviathan can be slain theyll know how to do it
we have thirty days to find its weakness
flashes him a look well leave tonight
with what army
i dare not weaken our forces when the city is about to be besieged
uncertain glances well go alone
give us a map
when some of the others join in the king gives them a look that stops them dead
my king with your permission
the king assents seemingly lost
amoun speaks to perseus
ill give you a map and much more
ill go with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission
we can leave at first light
to his aide diokles the map
the men move to the work area where the aide selects a map from dozens
something catches perseus eye
andromeda up in the balcony has made herself visible only to him
she silently mouths these words thank
which has been hung for all to see amoun uses a pointer
we head north on the via dahlia
if we can make it to the disputed territories
move in on the tip of amouns pointer on the well join the cleon desert legion the most formidable unit in all the army
with their escort we can safely reach our destination in skolothia which lies to the east
we dissolve through the map and pointer which remain lightly superimposed over the following music swells as we see the full expedition on horseback on the main road north
as they come over a rise amoun first two fearsome mongols mongke and tamburlane
our guides will be mongke and tamburlane father and son monster hunters from the kingdom of the iron horde
next the praetorian guard commanded by a square jawed old soldier draco
his men in heavy armor kosmo dracos lieutenant and the soldiers abas icos thad boreas krikor and polluc
our escort will be a detachment of the praetorian guard led by commander draco the staunchest security force in joppa
next on a stunning pale horse a pale rider the wilting girl
why do we bring the earth goddess into this danger
i thank the stars we have her
besides she takes her orders from an authority much greater than i
next spyros horseback riding is not one of his many skills
behind him perseus and amoun ride talking amoun it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor so long ago and now once again you instruct me
no matter what you believe porpoise some things are fated
ive been looking forward to this journey for a long long time
he spurs his horse riding ahead
spyros drops back beside perseus
who would have thought wed be on a journey like this
two simple fishermen
im afraid ive dragged you into real danger father when i have little idea of what im doing
living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable
its all in your attitude
whats our attitude about destroying leviathan
the kraken is just another big fish
perseus smiles but is not as sanguine
tiamats palace galleon is bigger than anything man can construct
tiamat is at the prow of the vessel using all her godly power to stir the elements
with great effort she sends a hurricane down on joppa
set the void approaches the prow
the demigod and his retinue are joined
they march for the counsel of the norn sisters to seek the frailty of my leviathan
i beseech you track the expedition
to plainly thwart them would betray our intentions and draw the wrath of zeus and the others
that we cannot have
i merely suggest that the road to skolothia is hazardous
i take your meaning
and your loyal brute he is fixed upon the hunt
fear not he is about and he will do his share of damage
tiamat resumes stirring the storm clouds
tiamats storm is pounding joppa
lightning stabs through the dark clouds
rain pounds the tiles outside andromedas lavish bedroom
peshet glides to andromeda whos wide awake red eyed distressed
you must sleep
off no reaction princessat you must take care of yourself
a crack of thunder
andromeda looks over at her thinking
my father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster
im sure that is not so
i saw it
i heard the words
my loving father his beloved child
only perseus stayed his decision
and do you know the worst part peshet
he was right
peshets feline eyes widen
the city is besieged the people suffer
because of me because he did not offer me up
is that right
go to sleep my lady
wiping her eyes sleep
sleep will come soon enough for me faithful one
in one month
at the latest
the palace shakes with the rolling thunder
the sound of that same distant thunder as the expedition follows the road
to the south behind them lightning flashes over faraway joppa
perseus and the wilting girl ride side by side
perseus looks back at the distant storm
joppa is pummelled by the dark goddess
it will not stop
tiamat knows no mercy
the moonlight illuminates a crumbling limestone arch on which time worn letters read via dahlia
by what name may mortals call you
i have no name
who do your worshippers pray to
i cant remember
perhaps that is why they are falling in number
the wilting girl flinches and perseus feels guilty about his jest
i have to call you something
since were naming you on this road what about via dahlia
she gives him a sharp look
is he mocking her
thats a pretty name
wait better yet vidalia
thats more than pretty beautiful really just as you are
she is pleased self conscious concentrating on the road ahead
you dont like it
as she murmurs whats that
i missed it just loud enough to i do not object
she picks up the pace moving her horse a little ahead
theyve camped for the night in a clearing
a fire burns food cooks
mongke and tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls of timber and kindling
draco glances up from striking his flintstone
the mongols stare either not comprehending or ready to fight
it must last all night
get some more
ill find some more
commander ill get some too
perseus and abas head off into the woods in different directions
perseus hacks branches and picks up deadwood
he slashes at a tree ting
under the vines is a stone column
he climbs mossy steps
the ruins of a public bath its marble pool fed by a stream
perseus sees vidalia on the far side her back turned
perseus freezes as she drops her garment
he peers through the vines
the leaves offer tantalizing cover to her naked body
she dives in with a quiet splash
now is when an honorable man would turn around and walk away
but they say i am not really a man
vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back looking sadly into the sky
perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes
his expression changes and the tenor of this stolen vigil is altered
raindrops fall as the sky opens and a cloudburst pelts the pool
vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and smiles
perseus heart pounds in his ears as he watches
the rolling thunder hits exactly on his heartbeat boom boom boom
vidalia instantly knows he is nearby
she looks around quickly and huddles in the water
after a few yards he stops face flushed with the awareness of a whole new dilemma
abas uses his sword to hack at dried wood
he bends to pick up a branch when he hears the crack of wood
he whirls sword at ready
but there is nothing there
embarrassed he picks up the firewood
now he hears something unidentifiable is that breathing
spooked he turns to head back to camp a dark figure is standing behind him larger than a man grotesquely misshapen
abas raises his sword but a twisted paw swats it away with a roar
abas tries to raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone
he looks up in horror as the creature envelops him only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of tall cedars
here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human features and a leathery scaled hide humbaba
suddenly set the void appears
the evil god strokes the sleeping monsters head then reaches inside humbabas skull
the animal goes stiff its leg twitches
hear me my pet
let my instructions be seared to your primal mind as natural law
the monsters eyes shoot open its pupils shrink to pinpoints
you are starving
your gut says youll soon perish
no earthly meat will still that hunger
what you need what you ache for is the flesh of
nearby the expedition minus abas rests
not here perseus draco icos and boreas
a herd of winged horses pegassi graze
draco boreas icos and perseus thrilled hide in a thicket
pegassi stallions of the gods
how long do you think you could stay on one of those
icos and boreas exchange a sly look
dont goad the boy icos
no man can ride a pegasus
did not bellerophon tame the great white pegasus
but he was a demigod
then this will be a good way to find out just what i am
stop it rogues
one of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief
what if perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up
dont worry commander the boy wont even get on its back
with a watch this grin perseus rises
draco pulls him back down
dont do this
if we go back to camp right now we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight
a true leader will not be distracted
im not the leader draco amoun is
im too young to start avoiding trouble
perseus jumps up and approaches a roan pegasus speaking soothingly
it whinnies and threshes its wings buffeting perseus with gusts
the pegasus rears up and leaps over perseus head
it lands behind him bucks its hind legs and kicks perseus face first into the dirt
icos and boreas are laughing but when draco gives them a dark look boreas jumps up sobered and heads into the clearing
ill collect him right now commander
suddenly humbaba erupts from the thicket with a howl
the pegassi take flight but the humbaba grabs one and swallows it whole
humbaba turns and sniffs the air homing in on perseus
perseus get out of there
icos fetch the others
draco and boreas leap into the clearing with swords drawn to draw the monsters attention
perseus does the same
i told you to run boy
youll make things worse
hearing the roars the expedition is already up
mongke and tamburlane fly into the woods the others follow
the reinforcements arrive to see humbaba pin boreas with its talons
draco hacks at the monsters leg to no avail
it rips off boreas head and swallows his body
perseus cries out and leaps at the creature sword swinging
vidalia spins her shepherds sling to pitch lead sling bullets
spyros leaps between perseus and the monster and thrusts his weapon a vicious looking harpoon boat tamburlane hoists an ancient bazooka
mongke lights the fuse and backs away
the weapon belches fire and metal
the humbaba staggers from the shot but lunges and swallows mongke whole
spyros sinks his harpoon in one leg but has it ripped from his hands
a delusion is planted in its mind
it thinks its starving and it wants to feed on
the humbabas eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces its nose
from inside mongke pries open the beasts mouth with his saber
i cant reverse the powerful curse
but if the monsters hungry i can feed it
vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes
a cyclone of cawing ravens descends from the sky and dives straight into the monsters mouth
as the humbaba tries to shake them away mongke is thrown clear
slash the belly
draco moves to do that when perseus leaps forward lunges and sweeps his blade up humbabas belly at the same moment draco sweeps down
the two blades barely miss each other opening a huge x in the belly
the others are shocked and impressed by perseus
steaming purple entrails spill over perseus and draco
humbaba crashes the flock of ravens liberated from humbabas gut shake the viscera from their feathers and take flight
perseus somber washes the creatures guts from his arms and legs
he turns to find vidalia standing above him furious
i should cast a spell upon you and leave you forever a stone upon this stream
i didnt beckon the humbaba
you did with your childish recklessness and boreas has paid the price
perseus already rife with guilt is stung by the truth
your safety is entrusted to me by the mightiest power on olympos
but without a thought you risk life and limb your own and your fellows
the monster killed my friend
i could not contain my rage
but you goddess are aloof from the emotions of men
vidalias eyes narrow enraged
yes a tyrannical goddess who dares question your mad rush to annihilation
the hopes of multitudes reside with you
youre late in learning you cannot act upon every impulse
she whirls and walks away
perseus is left with the weight of his culpability
and the beginning of knowledge
a cadre of revolutionaries led by fantasos is gathered
agenor the handsome scullion who made love to andromeda leads peshet in from the rain
she is frightened agenor has misled her
where have you brought me
peshet tries to leave but agenor stops her
just listen to this good man
he needs your help
fantasos comes forward
he fixes her with a hypnotic gaze
do you know who i am child
you are the priest of the streets
you know that the good common people of joppa trust that i will look after their welfare
do you love the people of joppa peshet
as she nods do you want them to be destroyed by this awful curse
as she shakes her no of course not
you want whats best for the people
i have always served the royal family
yes you have good peshet
and now you may be in a better position than anyone to help the princessa save the city
amoun smokes his pipe by the dying campfire
you knew about me didnt you
when you came to our village
your birth was written in the stars
i sought you out and took it as my cause to teach you
you chose a poor student
i have learned little and my mistakes cost dearly
understanding that is the first step toward knowledge
it wont do boreas any good
you can honor boreas by the way you act from this moment forward
im no demigod tutor
im not even much of a human
it is not your choice
you are what you are
amor fati perseus
love thy fate
i do not believe my fate is to be half a god
no demigod could feel as confused as i do tonight
concentrate on the task before you
all answers will come with that
tell me of the cleon desert legion
a fierce group
trained to fight
amouns description continues as we the desert camp of the legion is lit by torches
the legion soldiers are handsome powerful career warriors going about their evening business eating cleaning weapons washing
behind enemy lines
a lookout peers into the dark desert listening
now he hears something turns and shouts to another sentry
the night patrol returns on the gorge road
that message is shouted along from sentries to guards in the camp
out in the darkness on the dusty gorge road a dozen soldiers gallop in ground shaking formation toward the firelit encampment
theyve been chasing djinn raiders in the mountains for years
yes godly zealots supposedly insane
they fight like hades himself is keeping score
from the dark surrounding desert we see the night patrol ride into camp and dismount
thats how the desert legion came to be called god slayers
im not ashamed to say ill be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way
amouns voice fades
tilt down to the barren desert flats
suddenly a miracle transforms the moonlit strange beautiful magenta flowers sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti
the lotus blossoms surround the camp
the cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the mountain
startlingly a huge deformed paw claw hoof scrapes onto a boulder
pulling himself into view in repulsive closeup kalibos
there within his frightening visage is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of acrisius in his human form
when his twisted body has gained purchase he looks up the mountain
an eerie light illuminates his awestruck countenance
tiamat ensconced in a natural throne of rock
turning a lotus blossom in her hand she smiles on kalibos like a benevolent mother
my loyal friend
it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one
events demand more decisive action
kalibos speech is as tortured and deformed as his body grorashnrd
i to be
yes kalibos the time is nigh when i restore you to your rightful form proud acrisius
with me your protector on the throne of olympos
the violator zeus deposed
kalibos reacts with what must be satisfaction
go down into this valley
see what i am building for you an army dangerous and fearless as you their leader
several soldiers have been drawn from camp by the irresistible fragrance of the lotus flowers
they pluck petals and chew them
the rest of the legion filters out between the tents to take their fill of the drug
kalibos watches the handsome powerful warriors from across the field of lotus blossoms
peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on andromedas bed
on instinct she hurries to the bed and throws off the covers a pile of cushions no andromeda
peshet races out
peshet sprints through the rain dodging the refugees and citizens like a cat peering under each hood searching for her mistress
on the plaza a rabid throng of refugees
fantasos the revolutionary leader exhorts the mob surrounded by bodyguards including agenor
as before fantasos seems to have actual hypnotic powers
how much are we meant to suffer
where is your mighty king
safely cloistered above the flood
on the high ground with the high born the privileged gentry
the angry crowd responds fists shaking
peshet moves through the throng desperately looking for andromeda
she passes close to the rostrum and fantasos registers her presence
does kepheus worry about you
only the princessa
and still the kraken comes
does the king build his defenses at the waters edge
cries the crowd
peshet is shocked to find herself replying with them no fantasos motions for agenor to continue the harangue while fantasos hurries off the stage
he makes his stand at his daughters chamber door
we will show kepheus were not sacrificial fodder
we will tremble the walls of his basilica
rabid support from the mob
peshet stops suddenly peering ahead
at the fringe of the crowd andromeda herself watches from the anonymity of a hooded cloak terrified
andromeda is the one tiamat wants
we die so she may live
as the crowd explodes andromeda hurries away in tears
peshet fights through the crush to follow her
peshet rounds a corner frustrated
andromeda is gone
a hand grabs peshets shoulder startling her
it is fantasos
peshet youve come at the right time
fantasos engages her with hypnotic power
peshet nods trance like
one night soon a gong will sound three times
when you hear it unlock the back gate of the basilica
then go to andromedas chambers
hands her a dagger and bring the princess out
my men will take her to leviathan
peshet just stares at the dagger hands trembling
do you understand me
harshly off her non peshet do you understand how important your part is
she nods horrified by her predicament
the expedition moves through a mountain pass
perseus eyes a cliff
amoun and draco stop
glimpses of cloaked figures in the boulders
you wanted to know about djinn raiders
here they are
to the others look sharp
watch your surround
vidalia warily eyes the carpet of magenta flowers
the alkali lotus
she stops spotting something in the distance
kosmo pulls up
what is that
shimmering through the desert heat tents and flags
an army bivouac
flying the flag of joppa
its the cleon legion
the expedition enters the abandoned camp
they look around in dismay
where is everyone
spyros hears something and follows the sound to a tent weapon ready
spyros looks inside
a cauldron bubbles over a fresh fire
alkali lotus blossoms bob on the boiling broth
spyros uneasy backs out
cleon legion bivouac day r spyros comes out
draco tell me what this everyone is standing perfectly still
dark figures surround them
the transformed cleon legion lurches into view
the only resemblance to the soldiers they were is their armor
now theyre monstrous creatures lotophagi
as it plants in the dust
the companion foot lands beside it completely different
tilt up to kalibos
perseus stands by vidalia watching the monsters
kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod
he sniffs the air around perseus
we should leave
i wont do anything rash
ive learned my lesson
this time you must do something rash
we all must
kalibos leans close to perseus
perseus whips out his sword
the whole expedition comes to life as the lotophagi attack swift and brutal
long arms thrash and rip at the praetorians
mongke and tamburlane blast the swarm with handgonnes
spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon
amoun opens a leather sack of sand
muster to me
thad krikor and perseus are the first there
amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all
the ring of sand transforms into a dense swirling swarm of insects
amoun shouts to the others still fighting
you can pass through
draco bolts for the barrier
a lotophagi spears kosmo killing him
draco slides inside the swarm
he looks back at kosmo in horror
polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm
hes almost there when one of the lotophagi lands on him sinking fangs into his skull
polluc sticks his sword into the creature they both fall over dead
icos and spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside
mongke and tamburlane kill a lotus eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle
the tide of howling and shrieking lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail
only humans can penetrate the shield
perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm thinking
he looks over the lotophagi and sees vidalia out there alone flinging sling bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier
drop the barrier
its too late for her
drop it amoun
at that moment kalibos grabs vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop
at the top he turns looks directly at perseus and howls his message clear if you want to save her come and get her
he hungrily rips her leather bandeau
perseus turns to amoun
take the barrier down or ill go through it
have you learned nothing
if you break out now were all at risk
on the boulder kalibos grabs vidalias white flesh
perseus is anguished he knows hes in love
ive learned one thing for certain
perseus shouts at thad the massive praetorian
perseus backs away three steps
to the others get ready to defend yourselves
perseus runs plants a foot on thads back and leaps out through the swarm which immediately dissipates around the humans
they have only a moment to react as the stunned lotophagi come to their senses
lets kill these freks
perseus runs over the backs of the lotophagi
hurtling off them he scrambles up and knocks kalibos off vidalia
ralibos rolls flips onto his feet and gives perseus a look youre the one that i want
they face off looking for an opening
perseus lunges thrusting his sword
kalibos dodges springing up the rocks and then down toward perseus acrobatic as an ape
perseus rolls out of the way
perseus sweeps his sword at kalibos head
the monster catches the blade in his jaws and snaps it in two
bloody spittle flies from his tongue
kalibos pounces pins perseus
he opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into perseus shoulder
vidalia cracks a rock into kalibos head
the creature whirls on vidalia and careens toward her head bloody
perseus leaps in the air and catches kalibos in the back with both feet knocking him over the edge
kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets off pinwheeling through the air
the grotesque figure hits the lower rocks head first and his neck crunches
he slams into the dust dead
perseus lands on his back weak from the bite
when he tries to rise his legs are rubbery
vidalia catches him as he falls forward and lowers him gently looking at the bloody puncture wounds
ive got you
a thunderous sound surges in the distance
vidalia scans the horizon
draco spyros amoun and the others hack away fending off the lotophagi
outnumbered they wont last long
the earth vibrates
the lotophagi are distracted looking around nervously
over a rise stampede scorpiochs rhino sized scorpions
riding them djinn raiders flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes
they lay into the lotophagi
the scorpiochs skewer the beasts with huge pincers
the djinn use flashing scimitars to cut them down
in vidalias arms the fading perseus watches as the djinn turn and surround the expedition members closing in
we need to help them
he blacks out
vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where kalibos fell
she is mystified by what the deformed monster kalibos is gone
in his place neck broken lies a handsome aging noble finally at peace king acrisius
a string of lights each a lantern hanging from a scorpiochs tail
the expedition members ride on the scorpioch with the djinn
some of the huge scorpions carry small box rooms palanquins on their backs
perseus lies sprawled on cushions unconscious
vidalia replaces the dressing on his bite wound
knowing he cannot hear her to save me you risked everything your mission your friends
the fate of multitudes
men need better judgment in the one who is meant to lead them
no longer able to lecture she regards him with love
you shouldnt have risked your life for me
it is a waste to save me when ill be gone so soon
she strokes his hair and kisses his forehead
thank you for your reckless disregard
thank you perseus
vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a quick incantation
a small shoot appears and sprouts fat pods
vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers perseus wound
the wound bulges then squirms deeper into perseus
perseus shoots up clutching his chest
vidalia gently lays him down
a viper wriggles from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its stomach
the poison is gone now
where are we
in the djinn caravan
theyre escorting us to the skolothian border
but i thought the djinn
we all did
but their leader shaikh suleiman has some special interest in you
off his confusion just sleep
she waves her palm over his face and he does sleep
surviving lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen
one reaches hungrily for an alkali lotus in the sand but suddenly the petals blacken and curl
the creature spooked sniffs the air
all at once the lotophagi age years in seconds and keel over dead
the cause set the void glides over surveying the battlefield
the expedition rides through a war ravaged village of stucco and thatch
doors and shutters creak shut as they pass unseen inhabitants skitter about
the skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war
the legions of the gods have battered them
its no wonder they shy away from all strangers
perseus looks ahead where the expedition is parting company with the djinn raiders
only one of the djinn is staying shaikh suleiman a veiled priest
why does this djinn priest stay with us
because of you
youre the reason they saved us
i dont understand
why dont you ask him
i thought they didnt speak
they have no mouths
that doesnt mean they do not speak
the expedition climbs through rugged country
at a turn amoun looks up
dead ahead wreathed in fog sheer granite pinnacles one towering above the others
the pillar of moirai
lair of the norn sisters
tell me of them
theyre witches in the form of strix
not a pleasant sight a strix
they have powerful magic and dreadful habits
baby eaters among other things
off perseus shock but they owe me a favor
when the war broke out they lent their power to men against the gods in exchange for infant sacrifice
tiamat struck them blind for their treachery
when they came for help i fashioned them an artificial eye for their second sight
you made only one eye
pleased with his yes
they have to take turns
if they all could see at once they would be invincible which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque
the expedition sleeps in a drizzle
shaikh suleiman moves toward perseus
the whispering comes from behind his veil
he pulls a gleaming bronze sickle from his cloak
the priest blade poised stands over the sleeping perseus
out of the darkness runs spyros his harpoon raised for a strike
stay away from my boy
without touching him the shaikh throws the fisherman over his head where he lands hard with an umph
perseus jolts awake
he reaches for his sword but has none
spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge
suleiman raises his hand and freezes spyros in his position
the shaikhs veil has fallen revealing his frightening countenance scaled skin of charred wood eyes like slots in a furnace
perseus listens to the spyros he means me no harm
the shaikh lowers his hand spyros falls into the dirt
the shaikh pulls his veil over his face
he kneels before perseus head bowed
i hear you and i understand you
but i dont know how
moi ne epos aeprositi mene daeva
you are praying to me
there must be a mistake
the shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig zag lightning bolt pattern engraved on the blade honoring zeus
i thank you and take it humbly as agift from a friend not an offering
he takes the weapon and bows his head surprising the shaikh
tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr
you honor my father
you honor spyros
ho zeus patir
perseus reacts taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger
the expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain slick stairs and groaning rope bridges
in a morning fog the expedition enters a circle of free standing monoliths white with bird crap
all around regurgitated food shredded garments and tiny human baby bones
a flap of wings and suddenly perched atop the stones are the norn sisters urd verdandi and skuld human sized owls with the gray faces of old crones strix
each has one central eye socket they share one artificial orb
the strix toss the eye between them and pop it in to study the arrivals
low hoot owl amoun
so sorry to see you again
i seek your counsel
you want us to tell you about leviathan
you know already
we know this the kraken cannot be defeated
youve wasted a journey
i trust it was not a taxing one
the sisters cackle horribly
skuld swooshes down
icos and krikor terrified hit the deck
skuld tosses the eye back to urd
perseus watches with growing irritation
surely the beast from the sea has some weakness
you owe me this answer at least
the sisters owe nothing to you or any man
she tosses the eye to verdandi who focuses her attention on perseus
theres something wrong with that one
i dont like having him here
let me take a look
verdandi tosses the eye to skuld
perseus leaps and snags the eye out of mid air
the strix screech
perseus goes to the precipice
tell us what we want to know or your eye has seen its last
the norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers
youve brought a thief into our nest
no good sisters
the son of zeus
the strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith
since you cannot see let me tell you whats about to happen
im about to throw this evil eye to the rocks far below
i fear its journey will be a taxing one
the members of the expedition are impressed vidalia too the young demigod shows growing leadership
the strix are panicked we cant tell you
we dont dare betray tiamat again
she sees all
her touch is felt in every evil thing
a second offense and she will you dont have to tell us the secret
but you will have to live as blind as she made you
give us the eye and well tell
tell me first
if i like the answer you get your eye
we need the eye to see the answer
you know the answer sure as you already knew the question
the norn sisters confer enclosed in a curtain of wings
leviathan can be destroyed
the beast has one weakness
tell us now
the strix are torn frightened
finally the stare of medusa
no creature can look directly in her eyes and still survive
the answer hangs in the silence of the stunned expedition
theyre lying perseus
perseus studies the sisters weighing his response
i believe them
tosses the eye high heres your second sight
verdandi launches and catches it in her beak pops it in her socket
to the norns and medusa
where does she abide
in tartaros beyond the frozen tethys sea
only charons ferry dare challenge the ice
how can she be slain
with extraordinary cunning and unimaginable luck
skuld flaps to the pitch black portal to an underground and the proper tools
explore our cache of spoils
you may find such a tool
perseus stares into the black entrance
dont go in there perseus
its a trap
we have guaranteed the rage of tiamat with this revelation
we ask only that the young god mention our aid
to his father
if ever i should meet him
turns toward the i need a light
the shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until the end bursts into flame and hands it to perseus who disappears into the blackness
perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots
the torch reveals piles of armor bones and broken weapons
a round edge catches his eye
he pulls it free a shield tarnished and dented
unsure why it attracted him he shoulders it and leaves
the storm rages around a fleet of ships manned by armored crewmen that rises and falls on hundred foot mountains of water
the first mate shouts to the stalwart captain
captain the storm is too great
joppa is under siege
king kepheus needs these supplies
something huge breaches the surface
the captain squints through the rain
and sees the gigantic scuted tail of leviathan
it goes right past them miraculously leaving the fleet untouched
but then they hear a sound bigger than the typhoon
the dark sky gets darker as an enormous black shape appears behind the fleet bearing down on them at impossible speed tiamats palace galleon so dwarfs the fleet that it
plows through the other ships without noticing obliterating them in seconds sending all hands to the depths
lit by flashes of lightning
the goddess smiles in satisfaction at the devastation
a bleak shore
a boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter sea and fades into the fog
chunks of ice bob on the lapping waves
the expedition miserably wet waits for passage around a campfire on the frigid beach
perseus polishing the shield he got from the norns looks to amoun who sits smoking
tell of the gorgoneion
the rape of medusa
everyone falls silent
the soldiers shift suddenly nervous
with respect magi do not recite that black tale
youll bring the sky down upon us
does a fairy tale frighten you soldier
thad looks at him sharply
tell the story sir
my men fear only one thing to let fear in their hearts
mongke says something that means go ahead already
medusa was a tender young woman once a mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the gods
one night on the road home she caught the eye of the god of deserts and entropy set the void
a stunning beauty young medusa carries a water pitcher
suddenly frightened she turns sees something drops the pitcher and runs
she hastened to hallowed ground thinking the goddess tiamat would protect her in her temple
but the god set followed
a shadow passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher in pursuit
in the center of the dark hall set overtakes medusa l
forcing her down
his cloak ripples as shapes push through the spectral folds the girls reaching fingers her screaming face
he ravished her on the cold floor
she felt the heartless passion of a god
alone medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the altar
despoiled and broken in the shadow of tiamats altar she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage
but the goddess of the deep regarded medusa with disdain
the prayers of such a frail and filthy mortal angered tiamat
a bust of tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her blazing eyes throwing a long shadow of medusa onto the wall
the goddess twisted young medusa into a loathsome new thing
the contorting shadow shows the transformation
legs twist and snap and become a slithering tail
snake heads wriggle from her skull
the expedition all hang on amouns every word
and cursed her with a hateful stare that petrifies to stone all that look upon her
draco realizes hes burned his dinner on the fire
spyros shakes his head
perseus just stares a believer
noises come from the fog splintering ice sloshing oars
a shape emerges an ice cutting three tiered galley oars moving with precision
the prow of the galley cuts through ice
rows of oars slice the frigid water pulling the boat through at a steady clip
dark hot and loud pipes steam gears and pistons
charon a grizzled old sea captain shovels coal and slams the furnace closed
he walks past his crew mechanical oarsmen of tarnished brass rowing tirelessly
charon dons furs then climbs up to an icy slick deck snow
the expedition huddle around stoves miserable
we hear the oars beat the hull groan the ice cracking
charon chortles his voice deeper than the sea better stoke those fires boys its going to get cold soon
in a small space among the stores vidalia circles perseus whose eyes are shut
suddenly she sweeps his legs out
he lands hard
shes got a tail and shell use it just like that
perseus opens his eyes
keep your eyes shut
open them with medusa and it will be your last look
youre enjoying this too much
he cant see her smile
or that she regards him with something hotter than amusement
she tries to punch him but he blocks it
pleased he doesnt sense her right cross which knocks him down
do you think the gorgon will hit once and then surrender her head
he gets up eyes closed and resumes the defensive position turning as she moves around him
you will hear her muscles coil
feel her hunger in your gut
ask how will she feed it
i wish it but i cant perceive the world that way
youre the son of a god
nothing i have done has convinced me of that
you do not see yourself clearly yet
in time your actions in crisis will sharpen your view
her faith touches him deeply
she resumes the lesson you can do those things perseus and much more
he shadows her movements more closely back and forth
we think a room is silent until someone points out the wind
then the wind is all we hear
he dodges and locks her neck
pleased she flips him
surprisingly he lands on his feet and immediately sweeps her legs
she starts to fall backwards but slow motion as perseus dives forward and cradles her gently as they both fall to the floor
a move beyond human
she looks up at his closed eyes worried
their lips are inches apart
regular speed im beginning to hear the wind
senses something vidalia
why are you afraid
she kisses him deeply
he returns it
suddenly she rolls free and stands up turning away from him
she is already climbing the ladder
she stops for only a youve learned enough for now
spyros is at the rail looking over the ocean of ice
perseus troubled arrives
spyros looks at him closely
what do you see
a look i know well
spyros smiles puts his huge calloused hand on perseus shoulder
in my own mirror son
when does it go away
if were lucky
a landscape of volcanic rock
lava pouring into the sea raises veils of steam through which the expedition disembarks from the galley
the expedition crosses the black terrain lava vents here or there
in the distance dark ruins an ominous tilted facade half sunk in the dried lava flow
jaggous temploi tartaros de gorgoneion maitress
the temple of tartaros
mongke and tamburlane exchange words and point
they all two stone statues flank the entrance a pair of enormous centaurs nessus and ixion their eyelids sewn shut
icos and krikor exchange distressed looks
medusa must have turned them to stone
perseus swings his sickle measuring its balance and adjusts his shield
he checks a canvas sack on his belt
im going into the temple
i am with you
i go with my boy
perseus spyros and draco split off toward the temple
suddenly the two statues nessus and ixion shake off their dusty skins and come to life
they gallop down the ridge hooves shaking the ground
they raise fearsome spiky maces of jagged iron
vidalia readies her sling
the shaikh draws his scimitar
mongke and tamburlane load their handgonnes the others draw swords
the temple group arrives at the steps
draco speaks to are you afraid
stay close and ill steer us through
they tie on blindfolds and feel their way into the temple
nessus and ixion arrive
ixions mace catches krikor flinging him to his death in an open lava vent
icos cries out for his friend and charges in
ixion smashes him to oblivion
thad enraged races at nessus but the centaur dodges the massive praetorian and kicks him in the chest killing him
nessus charges amoun
amoun throws a handful of sand which becomes a hail of steel barbed darts in midair c which lash the centaurs flesh
tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon
nessus hurls the monster hunter against a boulder and goes for him when shaikh suleiman jumps between them
his scimitar slashes but is ripped from his hands
the shaikh bows nessus mace shatters shaikh suleimans head of charred wood
blue fire shoots out his neck enveloping the centaur
the burning centaur crumples dead
ixion slams his mace down just missing amoun
suddenly vidalias sling bullets slice his flesh
ixion turns and leaps at vidalia
in the subterranean temple we hear ixion landing above dust rains into the cavern
sunlight angles through holes in the roof
draco spyros and perseus move blindly through the debris
corpses everywhere faces frozen in stone screams
the men cant see it but one wall suddenly frames a silhouette of medusa hair of hissing snakes atop a womans torso the body of a mammoth reptile
we see only glimpses of medusa as she slides through the shadows
her forked tongue tastes the air
cutting between spyros perseus and draco moving silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary
our view of draco is suddenly blocked by medusa she coils around draco without touching him
he hears the rasp of scales on stone
i hear her perseus
her torso behind him she rattles her tail in front
draco spins and slices the air
the rattle stops
draco waits confused
from across the draco be wary
medusa gingerly tugs dracos blindfold free
draco sees the tail before him
unthinking he instinctively spins and looks
medusas face is inches from dracos
his muscles lock and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone emanating smoky gas
medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically
at that moment a hole blasts through the roof of the cavern as ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt dead a gaping wound in his head
medusa regards her fallen minion in horror loosing a spyros hears her and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the sound
with the harpoon as its sails cleanly through slanted pillars and debris whoosh whoosh until it comes through a tiny opening and thuds into medusas body
the monster screams whipping about
she tries to pull the harpoon out but cant
perseus i think shes hit
near to the left
medusas enraged attention shifts back and forth between the voices of the two men deciding which to attack
perseus tries to control his shakes jumping at every sound head swiveling blindly
from a distance perseus
i dont hear her near me
perseus steps back and bumps into a column
medusa is coiled around the column harpoon stuck in her bloody side
she crawls down toward perseus
perseus against the column
from the top of frame medusas fingers reach for his blindfold
she pulls the knot and the blindfold falls
eyes closed perseus slashes the air sweeping the sickle about until it smashes into the column brinnngi the sound echoes then fades
perseus waits and listens
one drop of medusas blood lands on his shield
perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield
in the reflection on the bronze he sees movement
eyes shut he windmills his weapon above him
medusas talons deflect the blade and the sickle flies from his grip
perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees
behind him medusa slithers down the column and heads for perseus
perseus reaches the sickle
he lifts his shield up in front of him and sees medusas reflection growing closer behind him
he shuts his eyes and wheels around blade sweeping
a soft f thmmp as the blade slices through something
perseus turns away and opens his eyes looking into the shield
still medusa looms behind him
but suddenly medusas head thuds and rolls on the ground
the headless reflection topples over dead
r the aftermath the survivors vidalia amoun mongke and tamburlane take mournful stock of their losses
mongke sees something smiles and swears in his language
they all turn to see perseus and spyros spent and saddened stand at the top of the temple steps
perseus grasps the canvas sack
now it holds medusas head which bloodies the whole bag and sends a crimson drip to the stones
there is still movement in there squirming serpents
rain and waves pound the lower wharf the water choked with debris and rotting corpses
kepheus stands in the rain with his minister of defense and generals at his side
a massive tent town has been pitched in the piazza
voices frequent and angry shout curses at the basilica
the relief fleet is lost
monsters gather outside our walls
soon i wont be able to keep my own people at bay
and still no word from the expedition
kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the city walls
on the plain outside the city
bonfires rage monster regiments assemble
siege towers roll toward the city
tiamat commands a massive horde
how many days remain
kepheus lowers the glass looking grim
our forces prepare
we have cards yet to play
well buy the time we need until
until the expedition perhaps returns
until were saved by the fishermans son
my king remember and take hope
he is not truly the son of a fisherman
from your lips i pray to his true fathers ear
andromeda has appeared
all are shocked to see her
she addresses the others with an authority weve never seen
i would speak with the king in private
princess let us find a protected we can speak here in the elements our subjects endure
the kings men exchange looks then bow discreetly away leaving father and daughter alone
andromeda looks down at the tent city
they take refuge from the lower wharf
a sight i wish youd never seen
youve sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world
i would have it no other way
and i thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth
but now with mother so
turns to him its time i shared this burden youve carried so long
filled with emotion he puts an arm around her
you make me proud but you are only a child
my little one
no no longer
your protection of me has brought hardship to our people
and to me perhaps new understanding
i must ask you something father
she turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city
if you could end this siege with just one unselfish act would you do it
to save my people yes of course
such an act is within my power
he studies her a moment then becomes alarmed
stop itl i forbid you to entertain such thoughts
perseus and the others were willing to give everything
turns her to him listen to me
by the time this is over your mother and i may well be gone
but i guarantee the day is coming when joppa will know glory under queen andromeda
she embraces him head upon his shoulder where he cant see her resolve
be at peace father i will not cause you any more sadness than i already have
an ancient walled road curves over the pastoral orchard hills
the exhausted expedition is now six perseus vidalia amoun spyros mongke and tamburlane
theyve stopped at a well beside a milestone
spyros studies the ancient words carved into the milestone polis of jove pater xi stadia s
eleven stadia to the south
what is polis of jove pater
im ignorant of this
jove the father is another name by which zeus was known
this milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities
perseus filling his canteen peers at the marker as amoun uses one hand to cover the letters ve and the other the letters ter
the polis of jove pater is the ancient name of joppa
once the most sacred site in the worship of jove
dawning on him tiamat chooses the city of zeus to take hostage
as amoun confirms she compels the people to make human sacrifice of the princess andromeda
and transforms joppa into the new church of tiamat
the ancient abode of zeus
becomes the new home of tiamat granting her sway to supplant him as the god of gods
urgently to perseus you cant allow tiamat to rule olympos
perseus holds her look
no he wont let that happen
but in his eyes are fear and doubt
the expedition passes through deep woods
spyros and perseus ride side by side
father weve seen much on this journey we cannot hold in our hands
yet these things are real enough
at each turn we find monsters and gods
yes the evidence is everywhere once we leave our island
thats why i so rarely leave
these gods what do you make of them
as you always said theyre petty vengeful
yes as bad as men
as perseus smiles and would you have that sort guide your life
men must be accountable to themselves
otherwise we serve poor masters
thats my boy
amoun rides up
we should stop for the night
we must keep moving
time is running out
if we dont rest the horses they wont make it to joppa
we all need rest
if you dont save yourself youll have nothing left when you face the kraken
riding behind them vidalia paler and more ephemeral than ever is suddenly alert
she peers into the woods agitated
then she exclaims softly dismounts and runs into the woods
perseus slides from his horse and follows her
mongke says something to tamburlane they laugh
amoun to why dont we stop here tonight
spyros smiles looking off after perseus
vidalia darts through the trees
she stops closes her eyes moves off again
through a stand of trees vidalia appears again and stops searching her senses
perseus arrives and watches her
i know this place
suddenly she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree
she probes the foliage steps forward
and descends into the ground out of sight
following perseus pulls away greenery revealing an opening in the trees massive roots
perseus drops into a dim earthen den
vidalia stands motionless before a bare altar
this is my church
where i was born to the world
where my people prayed to me
who were they
i know they were humans
they seemed so fragile
i sheltered them because i thought the harsh world would break them
now i know i underestimated them
her eyes pierce perseus
when i saw you come out with medusas head i saw that a man had done an impossible thing
beautiful yes but not fragile
i was mad with fear
i was no hero
i just didnt want to die
perseus turns toward the altar
what is this
a marble tablet sits on the altar its surface defaced
vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring
when the war began men ranged through the hills stamping out any trace of god worship they found
touching the tablet my true name was carved here
when it was obliterated my worshippers lost faith and my last season began
how long do you have
what will happen
i will vanish quick as dew evaporating at dawn
no one will notice the moment because all thought of me will be gone
what about me
nothing can save me
he takes her in his arms
vidalia is riven by anguish and desire
i dont believe that
will love not buy another day vidalia
i was cut free of earthly longing
why did you have to give me a name
the light is almost gone now
the wilted blossoms in her crown slowly open with color
they begin to make love
perseus and vidalia lie together listening to the sounds of nightingale cricket and owl
when you vanish ill find you
close your eyes
id rather look at you
do what i tell you
as he does im going to give you a spell
dont give away your secrets
you still have need of them
let me give you this sliver of magic
ill write it on your instinct
when the time comes youll know how to use it
she takes his head in her hands pressing her forehead to his
gently her fingers slip into his mind
a tear runs down her cheek
in quick flashes a white lid opens to a black eye
reflected in the eye clouds roll over a stormy sky
feathered white wings beat the air
then racing over the surface of a blue sea and then down down to smash through the surface into the depths
tiamat and set the void stand over the corpse of medusa
baby snakes and beetles spill out of her neatly sliced neck
tiamat is furious
how did he do this
they were not even to reach medusa
fate has begun to shift
the future ripples with uncertainty
spare me your pitiful maundering
there is no fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will
i meant only that the demigod bends the path without knowing it
he is ignorant of the rules or unconcerned with them
she turns on him with such a violent look he flinches
then there shall be no rules
prove to me you have not lost that which makes you most valuable
set absorbs her tirade stung
i am your ally
that is all you need to know
bloody your hands and rid me of this pestilence
you have liberated me my queen
watch as your desires are quickly satisfied
perseus jolts awake
he reaches for vidalia but she is gone
amoun stands over him his manner severe
where is she
this is my fault
ive permitted this infatuation to progress too far
it is not yours to permit master
vidalia comes down into the shrine her apron full of berries
look what ive found for us she startles when she sees amoun dropping the berries
have you forgotten perseus is engaged to the princessa
i wont marry andromeda
both amoun and vidalia are surprised
if by some miracle you survive this encounter with leviathan the hand of the princessa is your reward
i want no reward
are you so selfish
would you risk everything for the foolish love of a blast of hot desert wind blows into the shrine
the berries turn brown and shrivel
amoun grabs his chest
perseus and vidalia crumple in agony
set the void comes into the shrine
amoun tries to invoke a spell but set touches his chest and amoun splits open
set points at vidalia slamming her into the earthen wall
the god is there in an instant strangling her
perseus staggers up and swings his sickle but set points ripping the weapon from perseus hand
it flies across the shrine and sinks with a clang into the tablet that once held vidalias true name
still choking vidalia set grabs perseus arm
perseus doubles over paralyzed by the gods touch
suffocating vidalia fades more
immobilized perseus watches her struggle and searches low rasping i am half god
and now is the time
he cocks his arm and clobbers set with an ear splitting crack of thunder and a sparking burst of white energy
set drops vidalia and lurches back aghast
black blood shoots from his mouth
perseus his face contorted in rage chokes set
the gods body spasms and deforms in death throes
perseus slams the god down in a ghastly heap which liquefies into thick black blood
it seeps into the sandy floor leaving an ugly stain
perseus rushes to embrace vidalia who is more evanescent than ever
they look with pain at the remains of amoun
im so sorry perseus
a look of brutal determined resolve grows in perseus face
you faced a god in lethal combat
and vanquished him
never have i heard of such a thing
he looks at her mind racing then lifts her as he stands
we must go quickly now
he pulls the sickle from the marble with a brinng
the light flashes off zeus lightning bolt pattern on the blade
the combat has just begun
fantasos and the leaders of the revolution are gathered around a sacrificial fire
they fill the room with their we invoke thee queen of the deep
we attend thee only to listen and obey
fantasos moves through smoke to an altar on which is a fearsome idol of tiamat unlike any representation weve seen
we serve your will so that we may be absorbed into your perfection
holy of holies
the sanctuary is suddenly filled with the voice of loyal servants
it may be an illusion but the idol seems to have taken on the most subtle of life
it does not move but it breathes
you have sown the seeds of revolt
now comes the harvest
my legions stand ready at the gates
only one rite of consecration remains before the ascension
fantasos closest to the idol flinches buffeted by an unseen draft
the hour of sacrifice is upon us
offer up the princess andromeda to leviathan
a gong sounds once in the night
repheus sleeps fitfully on a divan by the bed of the desiccated cassiopeia
the gong sounds again
close on andromedas tortured face staring down at the city too close to see exactly where she is
the gong sounds a third time
peshet opens a lock and sets the heavy gate ajar
she looks at the dagger in her palm and hurries inside
after a moment four cloaked rebels slip through the open gate
peshet enters dagger held at her back
no sign of andromeda
she goes deeper into the rooms then gasps looking off andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony preparing to jump to her death
she turns at the sound teetering
peshet rushes to her but stops when andromeda raises a knife of her own
peshet is shocked not afraid
i know what i am meant to do
my lady please i was afraid peshet
afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me
princessa give me your hand
looks at the drop im not afraid anymore
i will do what i must
i will die so that they may live
she turns but peshet leaps and grabs her pulling her to safety
they fall to the floor both daggers clattering on the marble
i wont allow it my lady
today you are only a princess
one day your people may need a queen ready to die for them
peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it
come we have to hide you
she stops picks up andromedas knife and hands it to s her
andromeda accepts it with resolve
peshet leads andromeda out
we must get to my mother and father
a voice from the darkness your father is dead and your mother has been relieved of her suffering
the four cloaked rebels step into the light
agenor wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance
the princessa is coming with us
she has a rendezvous to keep
peshet whips her dagger through the air it thuds into the neck of the first rebel killing him on his feet
before he can fall peshet leaps to him and pulls out her knife
she plants herself in front of andromeda
come and get her
agenor and the other two circle peshet
she moves with feline agility but is separated from the princess
to the second rebel take the princess alive
the second rebel circles around peshet toward andromeda
peshet leaps on the third rebel
andromeda runs away from the second rebel who easily closes the gap
youre not going anywhere your highness
he grabs her in a bear hug from behind
she spins tiny within his massive arms and is suddenly facing him
he jolts in surprise andromedas knife in his belly
he falls on her dead
peshet wins her struggle with the third rebel sinking her dagger in him
agenor has thrust his blade into her ribs
she totters and coughs deep and bloody
peshet falls against the wall
andromeda wails at the sight
she is pinned beneath the dead weight of the second rebel unable to move
agenor finishes off peshet and turns to the princess
the survivors perseus vidalia spyros mongke and tamburlane crest a hill in the rainy dawn light
vidalia is almost transparent
the expedition reacts in shock to what they see
theyre on a shelf above the wide flat basin that lies outside joppa
a limitless inhuman army centaurs minotaurs monsters of every stripe fills the plain right up to the city walls
among the regiments of joppans waiting nervously for the battle are ranks of fifteen foot automata clockwork soldiers
operators feverishly work the mechanisms of the steel soldiers which flex their artificial limbs and weigh their massive weapons
mongke and tamburlane exchange words
for the first time they look impressed but also delighted
this is what they live for
spyros looks over at his adopted son
if it should come to pass tell your mother and sister i loved them much
perseus reaches out and touches his foster father warmly
youll have to tell them yourself
vidalias voice has become weaker
the people are frightened
but they can triumph
they need only one thing
perseus turns to her a question on his face tell me
theyre waiting for you perseus
perseus looks back toward the city
at last there is no uncertainty in perseus i will not fail them
he turns toward the goddess but vidalia is gone
its too late
hundreds of onlookers have gathered
an iron winch sits on a granite platform on the cliffs edge
fantasos and his cohorts wait beside a huge bronze agenor brings andromeda barefoot through the mud
the onlookers jostle for a better view some spiteful some sad all curious
agenor removes andromedas cloak revealing her tattered nightgown
fantasos inspects the mysterious symbols inked on her naked back streaked by rain
agenors thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice hundreds of feet above the raging sea
as the winch is cranked the chain lifts andromeda upside down from the ground
agenor pulls andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin
she spits in his eye
he wipes his eyes and lets go of the chain
as she rises the cliff drops straight down the jagged wall to the churning waves
o leviathan firstborn of the deep accept this offering of mortal flesh
for the exaltation of your cosmic mother
off the coast of joppa a dark shape emerges from the squall tiamats enormous palace galleon
the goddess is at the prow looking toward the cliffs of joppa expectantly
as the huge gong is struck then
fantasos continuing his incantations then
andromedas face her frightened eyes searching the ocean
everyone looks out to sea waiting
perseus spyros mongke and tamburlane hear the far off gong gong gong
the mongols speak to perseus in their language worried
the sacrifice has begun
i must get to the cliffs
they all look at what separates them from the city the monster army of tiamat surges forward with savage the gates of the city swing open
out march the giant mechanical automata followed by streaming legions of joppan infantry
the two armies slam together the battle is joined
the wind rocks andromeda on her creaking chain
a mile offshore a bulge of water swells and plows toward the coast
the onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races closer
leviathan explodes from the surface too huge to be seen whole
it shoots straight up up up the three hundred foot cliffs
the krakens jaws hurtle up at andromeda
fantasos stumbles in panicked retreat
the creatures bellow is deafening
at the apex of its surge it snaps its jaws shut with a booming thundercrack
just millimeters from andromedas dangling head and falls back
churning surf surrounds its endless slide back down
the kraken slips underwater and its vast shadow immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt
spyros mongke and tamburlane mount their nervous horses
push in on perseus who does not mount up
from his saddle he takes the bloody canvas bag with medusas head inside and slaps his horse away
be murmurs the incantation vidalia planted in his mind
a white lid opens to a black eye
feathered wings beat the air
the rippled flanks of a white creature
perseus hears the beating of the wings and looks toward the forest
pegasus whooshes over the treetops banks and lands in front of perseus
it bows inviting perseus aboard
perseus climbs on and rides up to the others who are flabbergasted
may we all have a good ride today
he spurs pegasus
it beats its wings launching from the ridge with astounding power
qi chin yang hung xian
they raise their weapons and spur their horses down the slope to war
click clack click clack
the chain lowers andromeda toward the sea
andromeda manages to get herself swinging back and forth until she builds enough momentum to reach up and grasp the links above her
with effort she climbs the very chain she dangles from leaving a slack loop beneath
leviathans eyes break the surface below watching andromeda
with a howl leviathan hurtles upwards jaws wide
leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her
up up up
the jaws snap closed
just below her climbing feet
so close it bites on the drooping slack of chain
the monster slides back down clutching the chain in its jaws
the princessa plummets with it
the chain unreels wildly pulls tight
and rips the platform from its anchors
it careens over the edge taking fantasos agenor and their thugs to their screaming death
a shadow glides over the shocked onlookers
one by one they tear their gaze from the sea and look up gasping perseus and pegasus descending
perseus sees andromeda splash down and get pulled under
the winch platform slams into the cliff face pulled by leviathan
exactly the image he saw when vidalia first planted the spell in his mind down down toward the dark sea
perseus and pegasus arrive a moment before the crashing winch
perseus dives off with the bloody medusa bag in hand
with his free hand he catches the chain just ahead of the winch and goes under
leviathan hurtles downward
andromeda flails bound to the chain
perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand
leviathan spirals on but the winch catches on a reef and the chain snaps
andromeda suddenly separated from the monster sinks weighted by her shackles
perseus swimming with the raw power of a porpoise dives after her but loses his grip on the bag
desperate he looks back and forth andromeda the sack both sinking
perseus goes after the sack
leviathan realizes it has lost the princess
huge eyes darting it spots andromeda and surges down after her
andromeda drowning passes out
tiny bubbles leak from her nose
leviathan swims down to her eye as big as her entire body
the wreck of a sunken whaler rests on the ocean floor
the medusa sack falls into view and catches on a harpoon wedged in the deck
perseus appears snags the sack and is about to kick upward
on impulse he grabs the harpoon
leviathan opens its huge jaws
andromeda is sucked toward the maw
perseus swims upward toward leviathans tail
perseus concentrates a sparking burst of white energy shoots through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip
lightning crackles and boils the water
he plunges the harpoon in the krakens tail at the same moment leviathan inhales the unconscious andromeda
contact an electric flash point flares and a charge races up leviathans spine
jolted the monster spits andromeda out
the kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on perseus
perseus shuts his eyes and yanks medusas head from the sack
medusas hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling energy into leviathans enormous eyeballs hardening them to boiled eggs then rocky spheres
the monster thrashes tries to turn but unbending stone races its length freezing the gargantuan curves the scuted tail locks mid flail into a final permanent hook
dead in the water the grotesque mass sinks like a mountain range picking up speed as it plunges into the perseus must swim like a god to snatch andromeda from
the downward tug
the stone kraken barely misses them as it and crashes in a cloud of silt shaking the ocean floor like an earthquake
a crack opens in the seabed and sucks back the silt
the trench deepens and streaks away across the seabed swallowing all the water above it creating a giant opening to the sky
tiamats face contorts sensing her beloved leviathan is dead
she turns at the sound of ghastly creaking the immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the ocean
as the towering masts drop below wave level tiamat raises her arms to the sky i damn you zeus
you will hear my curses forever in the crash of walls of water collapse burying the goddess her ship and her malediction deep in her realm
we hear a world rocking roar which booms off toward tiamats monster army is deafened by the boom losing all spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their goddess is gone
the tide turns in the battle as the joppans and their steel allies the automata wade into the ranks of creatures
mongke and tamburlane in the center of the battle find the opposition turning tail
they roar and lift their weapons high surviving yet another fight
spyros bloodied but unbowed smiles wide and sits down in the mud exhausted
the water stills
the sea calms
no sign of perseus or andromeda
wind and quiet
perseus surfaces with andromeda in his arms the onlookers rejoice
back with perseus and andromeda
he looks at her lifeless countenance in agony has he failed again as he did with anteros the fisherman
distraught his muscles go taut around andromeda and a short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his arms into her still body she jolts to life
color returns to her face
perseus too breathes again relieved
for the first time since the start of the adventure they find themselves alone holding each other
as she smiles are you all right
she takes a moment doing an inventory
finally she nods
i think i am
shell never know how close they came to oblivion
are you ready to become a king
his expression is kind but unmistakable
she accepts that rueful
are you ready to become a queen
she thinks about it her face beginning to light with confidence
yes i am
then youre ready to go home
perseus raises one arm
the air reverberates to a loud beating of wings
andromeda looks up in wonder
pegasus appears out of the suns glare gracefully alighting on the water
perseus helps andromeda up and then climbs on behind her
pegasus takes off
tilt up with them until they are lost from sight
black smoke rises to dirty the perfect sky
tilt down the sacred ground of joppa in the verdant hills above the sea is so beautiful it might be mistaken for olympos
two funeral pyres burn
the citizens of joppa by the thousands commend king kepheus and queen cassiopeia to the afterlife
moving over the crowd we push through the flame to find the new ruler of joppa
mournful but cloaked in regal dignity and strength queen andromeda
the ceremony and the heavenly setting
perseus views the scene from a nearby hill
behind him pegasus waits patiently grazing the grass
the equine suddenly whinnies and rears up
just as quickly pegasus goes silent and bows down
perseus looks in that direction to find zeus the prime god of gods an eagle perched on his arm
he couldnt look more imposing
am i to understand you do not intend to make this union with the queen andromeda
despite my will and intention that you do so
would you choose to condemn men your own people to suffer more of this devastating war
i have no people
you have stranded me between realms neither man nor god
do you reproach zeus
i thank you
zeus mighty god reacts to the word
his expression softens and he looks on perseus with growing pride
you have freed me
i will not be a pawn for men or gods
does that absolve you suddenly of your responsibilities
youve made me understand that my responsibility is to myself
so it is with us all
youve put me to a great test
in the midst of it i found the courage in my heart to defy gods
i do not know how much of that comes from you father
and how much from my mother who i never knew
zeus starts subtly at the mention of queen danae
it matters not
whatever the source i are only grateful
he looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human throng
this war will end the moment you choose for it to end
and men agree
i think perhaps that is the free will that all realms share
zeus looks at him proud yet wistful what an offspring what a creation
what will you do man of free will
perseus motions pegasus forward and swings up onto his back
im going to find vidalia
my son you will be a pawn for love
yes father gladly
perseus spurs pegasus and launches into the sky
and soars away
